        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Violent protests erupted in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, for a second night after two teenage boys appeared in court regarding an alleged sexual assault case, leading to multiple arrests and injuries to police officers. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon, with cars set ablaze and houses damaged. PSNI Chief Constable Jon Boutcher condemned the violence, describing it as "racist thuggery" and said the PSNI was critically underfunded. Assembly members expressed fears of fatalities and condemned the violence, with authorities urging reflection and promising to pursue those responsible, as residents displayed signs indicating their nationalities to protect their homes. The area has calmed but police cars were seen patrolling Ballymena on Wednesday morning, while fire fighters extinguished a small fire behind a wall near Clonavon Road, while a clean-up operation has begun. The score is reflective of the panic and violence.</p>

Orcel mentioned that while UniCredit is happy with the gains on its stake, a merger bid at a premium would not be valuable for investors. He also noted opposition from the German government and believes the share price has exceeded fundamentals. Commerzbank's shares have surged due to broader market factors and Berlin's relaxed fiscal rules. Orcel stressed the bank would seek a "constructive solution" to the opposition from the German government. (not investment advice)</p>

The conflict stemmed from Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which Musk claimed undermined the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk also deleted posts referencing Trump's alleged connection to Jeffrey Epstein and supporting Trump's impeachment, while Trump suggested terminating government contracts with Musk's companies.

The Series A financing round was co-led by Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital, marking the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date. Advocates say nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, can play a pivotal role in the energy transition by providing virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy. While some remain skeptical about the technology's readiness for commercial use, Proxima Fusion aims to bring the first European fusion power plant online within the next decade.

          <p>The Trump administration's ongoing assault on Harvard and other universities is part of a decades-long effort to undermine these institutions for political reasons. The Republican ambition to subjugate Harvard and Columbia traces back to the 1970s, when it became apparent that college-educated voters favored the Democratic party. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 text outlines a plan to prioritize trade schools over universities and eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Trump's actions, such as redirecting grants to vocational education and demanding academic receivership for area studies programs, align with this strategy.

          <p>India is "hopeful" of reaching a trade agreement with the US before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends on 9 July, according to India's foreign minister. Trade negotiations had already begun before Trump unveiled his 'Liberation day' tariffs on global partners, including up to 27% on India. A US delegation held closed-door meetings with Indian trade ministry officials in Delhi, and an Indian official told Reuters that the recent talks had been productive. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double bilateral trade to $500bn, though Delhi is unlikely to offer concessions in politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture.
