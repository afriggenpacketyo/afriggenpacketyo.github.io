          <p>A significant fire in Manchester city center caused part of a building to collapse. The blaze occurred at the old Hotspur Press printing works on Cambridge Street, near Manchester Oxford Road railway station, prompting the evacuation of neighboring apartment buildings. Firefighters from across Greater Manchester responded to the scene, using aerial units to prevent the fire from spreading. The incident led to the closure of railway lines and caused delays and cancellations for train services, with replacement buses being arranged for affected customers. The building, also known as Medlock Mill, had been slated for redevelopment into a student tower. The intensity of the fire led to a partial collapse of the structure, and authorities urged the public to avoid the area due to ongoing safety concerns. The incident caused significant disruption to transportation and local residents, underscoring the potential dangers of urban fires. </p>

The foreign secretary urged Iran to engage in negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the UK's readiness to defend its personnel and allies.

          <p>President Trump reported that Iran launched a missile attack on the United Statesâ€™ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, but stated that no Americans were hurt and there was minimal damage. According to Trump, Iran fired 14 missiles, 13 of which were intercepted by the U.S. and Qatar, with the remaining missile deemed non-threatening. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the attack, which allowed for the prevention of casualties. He expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region and encouraged Israel to pursue the same. This incident followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and marked a retaliatory response from Iran, prompting international concern and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. </p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their origin without offering them a chance to demonstrate potential harm. This decision lifts a judicial order that mandated the government to provide migrants with a "meaningful opportunity" to express fears of torture in the third country. The court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision. The case emerged after the Department of Homeland Security moved to expedite deportations to third countries, prompting immigrant rights groups to file a lawsuit on behalf of migrants seeking to prevent removals without notice. The legal battle reflects ongoing tensions over immigration policy and due process rights. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without first giving them the chance to raise fears of torture, persecution, or death. This decision is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced setbacks in its efforts to swiftly deport migrants. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented from the court's decision. The legal fight centered on the administration's efforts to deport migrants to countries other than their places of origin, such as Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda. The administration has already made arrangements with El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants it claims are gang members. </p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland, a supporter of President Trump, has criticized the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Strickland questioned how military action in Iran benefits the average American, citing concerns about the cost of living, wages, and inflation. He stated that he did not vote for his tax dollars to defend Israel but to help Americans. This criticism comes after the U.S. military struck three key nuclear sites in Iran, which Trump hailed as a success in hampering Iran's nuclear weapon development. Strickland's comments reflect a broader debate about U.S. foreign policy and its impact on domestic priorities. </p>

          <p>Oil prices fell sharply following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties. U.S. crude oil decreased by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent fell by 7.18% to $71.48. The price drop indicates investors' belief that the conflict may de-escalate after President Trump's actions against Iran. Some analysts suggest that Trump's strategy is to escalate in order to de-escalate, with the hope that Iran will not take further action. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, which helped prevent casualties. </p>

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. These MPs have signed an amendment to reject the welfare reform bill, which includes proposals to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact of these changes, including the number of people expected to be pushed into relative poverty. The amendment highlights the need for social security reform but objects to the bill due to a lack of consultation and an inadequate impact assessment on the job market and people's health.

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can deport criminal aliens to South Sudan or Libya, even if those countries are considered dangerous for visitors. The decision, made by a 6-3 vote, sets aside rulings from a Boston-based judge who argued the detained men deserved a chance to object to being sent to countries where they may face torture or abuse. Justice Sotomayor dissented, stating that the government had taken the opposite approach to caution. The government argued that the aliens had committed heinous crimes and had a final order of removal, but their native countries were unwilling to take them back. The case raises questions about due process and the protection against torture. </p>

          <p>President Trump has framed his strikes on Iran as a costless triumph, but potential economic consequences for Americans could be significant. Oil prices have already climbed, and an escalating conflict could further increase energy costs. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport, could be disrupted, potentially causing oil prices to surge. Additionally, Iran could disrupt global commerce through its allies or by striking oil and gas infrastructure in Middle Eastern countries. These disruptions could lead to higher inflation and increased costs for American consumers. </p>

          <p>Miley Cyrus shared how Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy helped her overcome stage fright. EMDR is a mental health therapy method used to treat conditions resulting from past traumas, particularly PTSD. During treatment, patients move their eyes in a specific way while recalling traumatic memories, creating new healing pathways. The method relies on the Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) model, which describes how the brain stores memories. Cyrus described her experience as watching a movie of her life while on a train, which allowed her to process and release anxiety associated with performing. </p>

          <p>The UK government plans to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror law, effectively branding the group a terrorist organization. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that Palestine Action has a "long history" of criminal damage, which has increased in frequency and severity since 2024. The group targets financial firms, charities, universities, and government buildings, and its activities meet the threshold set out in the Terrorism Act 2000. This decision comes after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and spray-painted military planes red. If the ban is passed in Parliament, membership of and support for the group will become illegal. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, officials and experts have given conflicting statements regarding the extent of the damage. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Iran's nuclear program had been "obliterated," while President Trump echoed this sentiment, stating that "monumental damage" had been done. However, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said it will "take some time" to assess the damage. Some experts expressed skepticism, noting that the underground structure of the Fordo enrichment site may have been too deep for the bombs to cause significant damage. The true extent of the damage cannot be ascertained until inspectors are allowed to access the sites. </p>

He also urged the Department of Energy to increase drilling. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields stated that producers must keep oil prices down or risk aiding the enemy.
