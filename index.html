        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump reiterated his commitment to expanding deportation efforts, focusing on sanctuary cities predominantly run by Democrats, during a meeting at the G7 summit. He directed ICE to prioritize cities like New York and Chicago, alleging that Democrats leverage illegal immigration for political gain, a claim unsupported by evidence as noncitizens cannot vote in federal or state elections. This announcement follows nationwide protests against the administration's immigration crackdown, though Trump has recently softened his stance on undocumented workers in farming and hospitality due to labor shortages. The president's stance has been met with pushback and accusations of targeting political opponents, raising concerns about the scope and justification of the deportation program.</p>

          <p>A juror in the Sean "Diddy" Combs sex trafficking and racketeering trial was dismissed after inconsistencies arose regarding his residency claims, specifically concerning whether he resided in the Bronx or New Jersey. The judge cited concerns about the juror's candor and potential bias in seeking to remain on the jury, leading to his replacement with an alternate juror from Westchester. The trial resumed with testimony from a paralegal detailing messages from Combs' assistant about setting up a "hotel night," while summary witnesses presented data records related to credit card statements and phone calls. The prosecution anticipates concluding its case soon, as Combs maintains his innocence amidst the charges.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally following President Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement. The agreement includes a 'golden share' for the U.S. government, granting the president significant control over key decisions, such as relocating headquarters or transferring production overseas. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the golden share provides veto power over actions like renaming U.S. Steel or idling plants prematurely. While Trump describes the transaction as a 'partnership,' U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an interview with ABC News, addressed the possibility of targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, arguing it could end the conflict rather than escalate it. He accused Iran of decades of regional destabilization and nuclear ambitions, asserting that Israel's actions are preventing a wider war, while also stating that Israel was "doing what we need to do." Netanyahu dismissed reports of Iran seeking to de-escalate and resume nuclear negotiations, and he also sought to garner support from the United States by portraying Iran as a global threat. The interview followed heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, with both countries experiencing casualties and the U.S. State Department issuing a travel advisory for Israel.</p>

          <p>AMD's stock price rose significantly after Piper Sandler analysts increased their price target, expressing optimism about the company's upcoming GPU performance. The analysts anticipate a rebound in AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter, following the absorption of charges related to new U.S. export regulations concerning semiconductors to China. This optimism stems from AMD's recent unveiling of its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including the Helios full-server rack. The analysts believe the Helios rack is crucial for AMD Instinct's growth, as it allows thousands of chips to be connected, making it attractive to cloud companies and large language model developers.

          <p>At Home, a home decor and furniture retailer with over 200 locations, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as part of a restructuring agreement to eliminate $2 billion in debt. The company plans to close 26 stores across the U.S. and transition ownership to its lenders, who hold over 95% of the company's debt. CEO Brad Weston cited the 'increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving trade environment' and the impact of tariffs as contributing factors. In addition to debt, the company faces challenges due to a slowdown in consumer demand for home furnishings, influenced by low consumer confidence and a sluggish housing market.</p>

The bill, introduced by State Sens.

The proposal comes in response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles where federal officers covered their faces, raising concerns about impersonation and lack of accountability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary restraining order against President Trump's proclamation barring foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S., pending further consideration. Harvard's legal team argued that the proclamation violates the university's First Amendment rights and exceeds the executive branch's authority, claiming it is a retaliatory measure. The government countered that it does not 'trust' Harvard to monitor foreign students and raised concerns about the university's 'foreign entanglements' with the Chinese government.
