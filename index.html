          <p>The European Union has threatened to withdraw from trade negotiations with China if substantial progress is not achieved. Discussions revolve around EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports and Chinese investments in the EV supply chain. EU Ambassador Jorge Toledo expressed concern that technical negotiations in Brussels are not advancing sufficiently to warrant a high-level economic and trade dialogue, which is a preliminary event to the summit slated for July 24 in Beijing. The EU seeks concrete deliverables to justify holding the summit. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange, suggesting it could lead to something significant regarding diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. A Ukrainian official confirmed the exchange was ongoing but not yet complete. The exchange, agreed upon during recent peace talks in Turkey, involves approximately 1,000 prisoners from each side. Trump previously stated he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours and held a phone call with Putin, describing the tone as "excellent", and held a separate call with Zelenskyy. </p>

          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a rally after reports surfaced that President Trump plans to sign executive orders aimed at accelerating reactor construction and securing essential materials for the nuclear industry. Advanced reactor companies like Oklo and NuScale saw significant premarket gains, as did Constellation Energy, the largest nuclear operator in the U.S., and Cameco Corp., a major uranium miner. Trump is expected to invoke the Defense Production Act, declaring a national emergency due to U.S. dependence on Russia and China for enriched uranium and nuclear fuel processing. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased following President Trump's statements suggesting increased tariffs on the European Union and Apple products made outside the U.S. Trump's comments led to a flight to safety, with investors moving into bonds, causing yields to fall. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 4 basis points to 5.028%, while the 10-year Treasury shed 6 basis points to 4.491%. These moves followed a volatile week for bonds, initially driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill worsening the U.S. deficit. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal interests and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with young employees most likely to admit to this behavior. This shift reflects a rejection of the older generations' dedication to companies at the expense of personal lives, with young people now seeking more "me time" and valuing a balanced lifestyle. The trend may also improve well-being and reduce 'karoshi', or death by overwork. </p>

These commandos, known as the Triples, supported the SAS and SBS in Afghanistan and faced danger after the Taliban's resurgence in 2021. Concerns arose that the rejections were linked to an inquiry into alleged war crimes by British special forces in Afghanistan, as the Afghan commandos could be witnesses. Internal concerns were raised as early as October 2022, with officials suspecting an "automatic rejections" policy. </p>

          <p>Left-leaning advocacy groups are campaigning against Republican plans to cut billions from food and health benefits for the poor in order to fund Trump's legislative priorities. These cuts, included in the "One Big Beautiful Bill," would impact Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), affecting millions of low-income Americans. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill would cut $698 billion from Medicaid and $267 billion from food assistance while adding $3.8 trillion to the national debt. Critics argue these cuts will disproportionately harm the poorest Americans, leading to hunger, housing instability, and reduced access to healthcare. </p>

While never mainstream, the movement's ideas, as explored in Emily Callaci's book, challenge the devaluation of care work and propose a society where women have the economic means to pursue any life they choose, whether it involves motherhood or not. </p>

The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, shouted "Free, free Palestine" during his arrest, but his connections to the broader movement remain unclear. While many pro-Palestinian organizations condemned the killings, the incident risks painting all activists with the same brush and could lead to further repression of the movement.

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening to strike after receiving a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems insufficient to reverse historical pay freezes. Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) may dispute the government's partial funding of a 4% pay rise for teachers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the offers, stating they are above inflation, but BMA council chairman Prof Philip Banfield said doctors' pay remains significantly lower than 16 years ago. The BMA is scheduled to ballot resident doctors next week over possible strike action. </p>

Interactive maps provide regular updates on the fire perimeters. The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed over 150 structures, while the Munger Shaw Fire is nearly 100% contained. </p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett has reached a settlement in a lawsuit filed by the city of Chicago, agreeing to pay $50,000 to a local charity. The lawsuit stemmed from accusations that Smollett lied about being the victim of a hate crime in 2019.

          <p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told CNBC that meeting President Trump's demand for NATO members to spend 5% of their GDP on defense would be challenging. Mitsotakis suggested that 3.5% of GDP on hard defense spending is a more realistic ceiling. He indicated that the 5% target might be achievable in the long term if broader security-related expenses were included. NATO chief Mark Rutte has proposed that members increase defense spending to 3.5% of GDP and allocate an additional 1.5% to wider security matters. </p>
