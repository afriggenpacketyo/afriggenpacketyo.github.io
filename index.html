          <p>The House of Representatives has passed the 'Take It Down Act,' a bipartisan bill aimed at combating the proliferation of sexually explicit imagery online without consent. This legislation, supported by First Lady Melania Trump, mandates that social media companies remove real and AI-generated explicit content within 48 hours of a victim's request. The bill seeks to provide recourse for victims of revenge porn and deepfakes, with proponents emphasizing its potential to prevent cyber abuse and suicide. While digital rights groups have raised concerns about potential suppression of lawful speech, major tech companies like Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat have voiced their support for the measure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations of race-based discrimination in article selection. These investigations, initiated by the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services, stem from concerns that the Harvard Law Review may be prioritizing authors' race over merit. This action is part of an ongoing dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard, which includes a freeze on federal grants and demands for changes to the university's DEI programs. The investigations will assess whether Harvard's policies violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its efforts to enforce immigration laws by targeting sanctuary cities and states. President Trump plans to sign executive orders directing federal agencies to publish a list of jurisdictions that obstruct federal immigration enforcement. The administration aims to 'unleash America's law enforcement' and penalize cities that limit cooperation with immigration agents. This move has faced legal challenges, with a federal judge already barring the administration from withholding funds from sanctuary cities. Critics argue these actions are unconstitutional and intended to instill fear, while the administration asserts it is simply enforcing existing laws and prioritizing public safety.</p>

This innovative approach will provide scientists with more accurate data for climate change modeling and deforestation tracking. The satellite's large antenna will analyze slices through trees, similar to a CT scan, to determine the amount of woody material present, which serves as a proxy for stored carbon dioxide. The mission aims to create annual maps showing carbon storage and deforestation rates, improving our understanding of forests' role in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

The government argues that the health benefits of milk-based drinks do not justify the harms from excess sugar. The consultation will run until July 21, with the government estimating that most pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market would be affected unless their sugar content is reduced.</p>
