          <p>Japan is steadfast in its demand for the complete elimination of tariffs imposed by the U.S., specifically a 25% levy on cars and steel/aluminum, as a precondition for any trade agreement with Washington. The government dismisses cutting consumption tax to relieve inflation, citing it as a vital revenue source. Meanwhile, household spending in Japan has declined for the second consecutive year due to rising food prices, impacting private consumption, which constitutes over half of Japan's GDP. The government aims to hold a third round of talks in mid-May to discuss tariff removal with the United States.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke in 2013 leaving him with aphasia, has made a comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Travis collaborated with musician James Dupré and producer Kyle Lehning to create new music, including the single "Horses in Heaven." AI was used to model Travis's voice using raw vocals from his previous songs and Dupré's vocal line, with the final product being tweaked by Travis and Lehning in the studio. Travis has also been on his "More Life Tour" since last spring and recently extended dates through fall 2025. Travis's wife, Mary, emphasizes the creativity involved in the AI process and hopes it sets a precedent for its use in music.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 AI chip for the Chinese market in July, in an attempt to navigate U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip will feature reduced memory capacity, addressing concerns raised by U.S. officials regarding its export license. This move represents Nvidia's ongoing efforts to maintain its presence in the crucial Chinese market, as Washington increases restrictions on China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. The company declined to comment on the specifics of the modified chip's design.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% decline following a first-quarter earnings miss. While revenue increased by approximately 28% year-on-year to $2.24 billion, and profit attributable to shareholders surged by 162% to $188 million, these figures fell short of expectations due to production fluctuations affecting average selling prices. SMIC anticipates revenue to decline sequentially in the current quarter, with a reduced gross margin. However, the company's wafer shipments increased significantly, driven by geopolitical changes and government policies, with capacity utilization reaching 89.6%.</p>

          <p>Ultra-rich investors in Asia are reducing their exposure to U.S. assets due to President Trump's tariffs, which are perceived as making the U.S. economy less predictable. Some family offices are entirely exiting U.S. holdings, redirecting funds to Asia and Europe, while others are significantly reducing their U.S. asset portfolios. This shift marks a change from earlier optimism following Trump's election, with concerns now centered on policy shifts, uncertainty, and recession risks.

          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Imports, however, only slightly decreased by 0.2%. Exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, while imports dropped nearly 14%. The surge in overall exports may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts. China's exports to ASEAN countries saw a significant increase, particularly to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Meanwhile, exports to the EU rose while imports from the EU fell.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's tariffs on imported aluminum, the U.S. aluminum sector is not experiencing a revival due to high electricity costs. While tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, they have not stimulated domestic production. Rising electricity prices in the U.S., relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. Companies like Hydro are passing tariff costs onto consumers, and downstream users like Thule Group are raising prices. The lack of competitively priced, long-term power contracts remains a significant barrier for U.S. smelters.</p>

Trump noted that tariffs are currently at their peak of 145%, implying a decrease is anticipated. The meeting, scheduled to take place in Switzerland, signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the two economic powers. China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying expressed confidence in Beijing's ability to manage trade issues with the U.S. However, analysts caution that systemic frictions remain, and any tariff cuts are likely to be minor.</p>

          <p>President Putin will preside over a Victory Day parade in Moscow, celebrating the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany, with leaders from China, Brazil, and other countries in attendance. This year's parade, the largest since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, comes amidst faltering attempts to end the conflict. Ukraine has increased attacks on Moscow, raising security concerns. The parade symbolizes national pride for Russia, but the invasion of Ukraine has turned it into a point of division. The event will also showcase Russia's shift towards closer ties with China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's indefinite halt to construction on the Empire Wind project off Long Island, N.Y., has raised concerns about the future of the U.S. offshore wind industry. European wind companies, such as Welcon and Vestas, are reassessing their approach to renewable energy, with a greater focus on Europe. While Europe anticipates significant growth in offshore wind, the U.S. market faces uncertainty due to tariffs and policy changes. Vestas and Orsted reported positive financial results, but the share prices of both companies have declined. Orsted also announced it would not proceed with a large wind facility in Britain due to rising prices and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with Britain, aiming to lower the burden of his tariffs and potentially deliver a political win for Prime Minister Starmer. The deal, the first of Trump's second term, affirms reciprocity and fairness in international trade. While details are being finalized, it includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market for agricultural products. A 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. will be subject to that rate. Commerce Secretary Lutnick estimates the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S.</p>

The test involved the operation of a 600-millimeter multilayer rocket system and the Hwasongpho-11-Ka tactical ballistic missile. The launches were detected by South Korea and Japan. Kim emphasized the need to bolster the role of nuclear forces in deterring and fighting a war, accusing the U.S. and its allies of escalating tensions with nuclear operation drills.

          <p>China's exports defied President Trump's tariff increases by growing 8.1% year-on-year in April, potentially strengthening China's negotiating position in upcoming trade talks with the US. However, exports to the United States fell by 21%, the sharpest drop in 21 months. Analysts suggest that the full impact of US tariffs may not yet be visible, and exporters are finding ways around the tariffs. Upcoming US-China talks could lead to a partial rollback of US duties, but a full reversal is unlikely.</p>
