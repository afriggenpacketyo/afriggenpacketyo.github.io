          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, alleging the company is violating antitrust laws by manipulating its App Store rankings to favor OpenAI's ChatGPT. Musk's AI company, xAI, claims its Grok chatbot is being unfairly suppressed, preventing it from reaching the top position among all applications. This move escalates Musk's ongoing feud with both Apple and OpenAI, which he co-founded, and adds to Apple's existing legal challenges, including a major antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice. The dispute highlights the intense competition and high stakes in the rapidly growing AI market.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to extend their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing a significant tariff increase that was set to take effect. This extension will maintain the current 30% U.S. tariff on Chinese imports and the 10% Chinese tariff on American goods, providing more time for negotiations. The talks aim to address trade imbalances, market access for U.S. exporters, and national security concerns, including technology sales and the status of TikTok. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two nations have already seen a significant decline this year. (not investment advice)</p>

His departure comes as GitHub faces increasing competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools like Cursor and Replit, which are gaining popularity among developers. GitHub, now part of Microsoft's CoreAI division, has seen significant growth with its own AI tool, Copilot, but the market for AI-assisted software development is becoming increasingly crowded.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "Frankly," former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on her political career, admitting regrets over the handling of controversial transgender rights legislation. She discusses the intense public division, particularly the case of an individual convicted of two sexual assaults being sent to a female prison, which she says made her seem weak and evasive. The book also details her fractured relationship with her predecessor, Alex Salmond, her personal struggles with a miscarriage and menopause, and the emotional toll of leading during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sturgeon also addresses the ongoing police investigation into SNP finances.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The announcement follows the president's recent firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has questioned the accuracy of its data in the past. The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, is seen as part of an effort by the administration to install its own people in key economic roles to ensure data transparency and reliability.

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for the government to guide the rapidly growing "quick commerce" sector with balanced policies. As e-commerce giants compete fiercely in the instant retail market, which involves deliveries often within 30 minutes, Wang advises against stifling competition. Instead, he suggests that regulatory oversight should focus on curbing excessive cash burn and promoting high-quality development. He argues that this approach will foster innovation and create new consumption opportunities, which are crucial for China's long-term economic growth and a move away from a zero-sum competitive mindset.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Defends Trump's Deal with Nvidia and AMD as a Form of Tariff</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented on the Trump administration's deal requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the government 15% of their revenue from sales to China, framing the move as a novel form of tariff. In exchange, the semiconductor giants will receive licenses to sell certain chips in the country, a reversal of previous restrictions. Cramer argued that while the 'pay-to-play' element is debatable, the arrangement is a relatively benign form of government intervention compared to past bailouts. He concluded that if the chipmakers are not complaining, the deal is ultimately beneficial for them and for U.S. taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado is battling two large wildfires, with more than 1,000 firefighters deployed to contain the blazes amid challenging weather conditions. The Lee fire has grown to become the fifth largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment due to gusty winds and extremely dry conditions. Another blaze, the Elk fire, has burned over 14,000 acres but is partially contained. The fires have prompted evacuations in several counties and led to air quality warnings. This explosive fire season reflects a broader trend across North America, intensified by climate change.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Trump's Claims of Rampant D.C. Crime are Based on Misleading Data</h2>

          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize the D.C. police is based on a portrayal of the city as lawless, a narrative rooted in false and misleading claims about crime. While the president cited 2023 homicide data, recent statistics show a dramatic reversal, with violent crime in D.C. at a 30-year low in 2024 and continuing to decline this year. Experts note that this tactic mirrors his previous claims about Los Angeles, where he also deployed the National Guard based on exaggerated descriptions of chaos. Critics argue the move ignores current positive trends and is a political maneuver rather than a data-driven response.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse following a threat from the government to withdraw its funding. In a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission, employees raised alarms about a 'toxic internal culture,' misuse of public funds, and a failure to deliver on its mission. The crisis was triggered after Technology Secretary Peter Kyle demanded the institute pivot to defense research and overhaul its leadership. This turmoil threatens the future of the prominent, publicly-funded research organization.</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter revealed she feared teammate Lauren James would face 'astronomical' racist abuse if she had been the only player to miss a penalty in the Euro 2025 quarter-final shootout.

She spoke about the devastating personal impact of the abuse, which made her feel small and scared to play. The Football Association has referred the abuse to the police for investigation.</p>

          <p>A dropped Red Bull can was the crucial clue that helped police solve the three-year-old disappearance of cyclist Tony Parsons in Scotland. The case broke when Caroline Muirhead, the new girlfriend of Alexander McKellar, was told by McKellar that he had killed a man in a hit-and-run. After he showed her the remote shallow grave, she secretly dropped the can as a marker and later alerted police. McKellar and his twin brother were subsequently charged. Parsons' family expressed immense gratitude for Muirhead's quick thinking, which they believe was essential to finding his body.</p>

          <p>During a press conference, President Trump mistakenly said he was 'going to Russia on Friday' when he meant Alaska, a slip that revealed the centrality of Vladimir Putin to his narrative on the Ukraine war. Trump confirmed he will hold a bilateral meeting with the Russian president to 'feel out' a potential peace deal, explicitly excluding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the talks. The president framed the summit as a pragmatic effort to mediate a deal involving 'land swapping,' positioning himself as a bold dealmaker. The move to federalize D.C. police is seen by some as a show of strength ahead of the high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a 'success' after meeting with him, just days after demanding his immediate resignation. The president's initial call for Tan's removal followed a senator's questions about the CEO's ties to China. However, after a 'candid and constructive discussion,' Trump announced that Tan and his cabinet would collaborate on future suggestions. This flip-flop occurs as the administration takes an aggressive role in the semiconductor industry, recently striking a deal with Nvidia and AMD regarding their sales to China.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has escalated the national redistricting battle, warning that Texas could eliminate as many as ten Democratic congressional districts if California proceeds with its own retaliatory map-drawing. Abbott's comments are a direct response to California Governor Gavin Newsom's plan to neutralize expected Republican gains from a new Texas map. The Texas GOP's efforts are currently stalled as state Democrats have fled to deny a legislative quorum. This heated exchange underscores an aggressive, state-by-state partisan conflict over shaping the U.S. House map ahead of the next elections.</p>
