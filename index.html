          <p>The L.A. Dodgers visited the White House to celebrate their World Series championship, a decision that sparked controversy among fans due to the current political climate. Shortstop Mookie Betts, who previously boycotted a White House visit during President Trump's first term, decided to attend this time, emphasizing his loyalty to his teammates.
