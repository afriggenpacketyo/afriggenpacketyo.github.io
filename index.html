          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to release orders from its final "cleanup conference" before its summer recess, with potential rulings on several significant matters. Among the outstanding issues are five emergency petitions involving former President Donald Trump, including cases related to federal workforce reductions, a Florida immigration law, and the deportation of an individual to Ecuador. Court observers anticipate detailed writings from the justices, such as dissents or concurrences, on these cases which were handled without oral arguments. The release follows recent rulings on birthright citizenship and transgender healthcare, with further implications expected from this final session.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis challenges key claims made by the White House regarding President Trump's major legislative bill. Contrary to assertions that the bill reduces the deficit, independent studies from the Congressional Budget Office and other experts indicate it would add over $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The article also fact-checks claims about Medicaid, finding that the bill would result in significant spending cuts and could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance. The report scrutinizes the bill's overall economic impact, tax implications, and effects on social welfare programs. (not investment advice)</p>

As the nation's second carrier, following the retrofitted Liaoning, the Shandong represents a significant step in China's military modernization and its goal of developing a blue-water navy.

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska is backing President Trump's sweeping spending bill, despite acknowledging concerns about its changes to Medicaid. Bacon argued that voting against the legislation would effectively mean a significant tax increase for his middle-class constituents, framing his support as a necessary, pragmatic choice. The bill, which narrowly passed the Senate, faces opposition within the House GOP from both moderates and fiscal conservatives. Bacon defended the Medicaid changes as focusing on work requirements, while critics worry about millions losing insurance and a substantial increase in the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

One woman required resuscitation after she stopped breathing and spent days in intensive care.

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell has been controversially called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia as an injury replacement. The decision, made by his father and team coach Andy Farrell, marks a surprising return to Test rugby for the 33-year-old, who has not played internationally in nearly two years. Farrell's selection has drawn criticism as he has been inactive for nine weeks due to a concussion and was chosen over other match-fit contenders. Despite the controversy, his experience as a three-time Lions tourist is expected to add leadership to the squad.</p>

The most prominent veto was for a bill sought by Duke Energy that would have eliminated a 2030 carbon emissions reduction goal and allowed rate hikes, which Stein argued would increase costs for families. He also rejected a bill expanding the State Auditor's investigative powers over private entities receiving state funds, citing risks to business recruitment. A third veto struck down a charter school bill that Stein claimed unconstitutionally infringed on the State Board of Education's authority. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill represents a major shift in federal policy, reallocating funds from social safety nets and clean energy to finance extensive tax cuts, enhanced border security, and increased defense spending.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer later sought to calm markets by stating he and the chancellor were "in lockstep," which helped stabilize the currency.

Dobrindt stated that relying on third-party mediators for such negotiations is not a sustainable long-term solution.

The record label, Universal Music Group, has reportedly offered returns to affected customers, but fans are hoping for a new pressing on a standard, functional CD.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Hugh Hewitt argues that House Freedom Caucus members who oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" are risking a catastrophic economic outcome. He contends that blocking the bill would lead to the largest tax hike in history when current cuts expire, damage military readiness, and derail the GOP's agenda. Hewitt dismisses the idea of achieving a better bill later as unrealistic given the narrow political margins. He proposes that holdouts should be offered control of a second, more difficult reconciliation bill focused on entitlement reform, challenging them to produce substantive cuts rather than just performative opposition.

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport, which suffered from extensive flight delays and cancellations earlier this year, is showing significant signs of improvement. In June, Newark reportedly became the most reliable airport in the New York City area, a notable turnaround attributed to the completion of runway construction and better-functioning air traffic control systems. Despite the recent positive trend, many frequent travelers remain wary due to past experiences of severe disruptions that caused some to cancel trips or use other airports. The upcoming July Fourth holiday travel rush will be a major test for the airport's fragile recovery and the nation's air travel system.</p>

The trial, which followed numerous civil lawsuits and the leak of a video showing him assaulting his former girlfriend, has already caused significant damage to his business empire and personal brand. The prosecution's case hinged on the testimony of two ex-girlfriends, which the defense portrayed as consensual, if toxic, relationships, ultimately failing to prove a broader criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>For individuals without diabetes, experiencing sharp dips in blood sugar after meals can lead to fatigue, mood changes, and increased hunger, potentially hindering weight loss. Scientists identify these individuals as "dippers," whose blood sugar crashes below baseline levels a few hours after eating carbohydrates. To prevent these fluctuations, nutritionists recommend several strategies, including never eating carbohydrates alone and instead pairing them with protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Additionally, they suggest eating protein and fiber first during a meal, spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day, and paying attention to how you feel two hours after eating to identify problematic patterns.</p>

          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon that intensifies heatwaves for city dwellers. This effect is caused by dark surfaces like asphalt and concrete absorbing heat, tall buildings trapping warm air, and a lack of cooling vegetation. The temperature difference can be as much as 15 degrees Celsius, posing health risks. Solutions to mitigate this effect include greening cities with more trees and parks, installing "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight, and using permeable pavements that enhance water evaporation.

          <h2>Chinese Brokerages Predict Stagnant Stock Market for Second Half of Year</h2>

          <p>Top-ranked Chinese brokerages are forecasting that the nation's stock market will likely remain stagnant in the second half of the year due to a lack of fresh catalysts. Analysts from firms like GF Securities suggest that while state intervention and a weak economic recovery may provide a floor for the market, sluggish earnings growth and deflationary pressures will continue to weigh on stock performance. The cautious domestic outlook contrasts with more upbeat views from global banks on Hong Kong stocks. The benchmark CSI 300 Index saw minimal change in the first half of the year as investors awaited stronger policy signals from Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BRICS bloc, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has expanded to include ten nations and now represents a significant non-Western geopolitical and economic force. The group accounts for over 40% of the world's population and more than a third of global GDP, challenging the dominance of Western-led institutions like the World Bank and IMF. BRICS has established its own development bank and is exploring ways to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar through trade in local currencies. While internal divisions and competing national interests pose challenges, the bloc continues to attract interest from dozens of other nations seeking membership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old pilot for a Chinese airline died by suicide after stabbing two of his colleagues during a dispute over a failed flight qualification appraisal. The pilot, identified by the surname Li, attacked a flight department manager and a party secretary before jumping from a 15th-floor window at the company's office in Changchun. The colleagues were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. An internal report indicated that Li had failed an evaluation due to a "lack of understanding of rules and procedures" and was recommended for comprehensive retraining before his flight qualifications could be restored.</p>
