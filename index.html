          <p>Sony Group Corp. shares experienced a rise amidst choppy trading after the company announced a share buyback program worth up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last quarter beat analyst estimates, though it was down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends.

          <p>A federal judge in Pennsylvania has approved the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan citizens identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, marking a first instance of judicial approval for President Trump's proclamation. This ruling contrasts with decisions from other federal judges who have temporarily blocked the administration from using the Act for similar deportations. The judge ordered that individuals facing removal under the AEA must receive at least 21 days' notice in English and Spanish. This ruling addresses a case involving a Venezuelan national seeking asylum who denies gang membership.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's administration has taken actions that could negatively impact the renewable energy sector, including halting permits for wind energy projects and proposing tariffs on imports from Southeast Asia. These tariffs could significantly affect the solar industry, as they target components critical to solar module manufacturing. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration's policies are injecting uncertainty into the future of clean technology in the United States. Six clean energy projects, representing $6.9 billion of investment, were cancelled in the first quarter of the year.</p>

          <p>President Zelenskyy has challenged Putin to meet him in Istanbul for peace talks, following Putin's demand for negotiations. This move comes amid increasing pressure to end the war in Ukraine. While Putin has yet to respond, both Ukraine and Russia are seeking to involve Donald Trump in the negotiations. Analysts suggest that Putin is unlikely to attend, and the talks may serve primarily to highlight Ukraine's willingness to negotiate. The article suggests that this could potentially be a high-stakes move, because if Putin does show up then Ukraine could face pressure to show they are willing to concede to some of Russia’s demands.</p>

The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from representatives from participating countries. The US has denied this proposal was discussed. The plan aims to be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>As President Trump cuts billions from science institutes, rival nations are seizing the chance to reverse the flow of talent. Other nations are making efforts to attract American researchers, scientists and academics. The European Union pledged to spend an additional $556 million to “make Europe a magnet for researchers.” Academic institutions are putting up their own money, and academic freedom is touted as a selling point. Offers are being made by France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Britain, Canada, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Ireland, Belgium, South Korea, and China.</p>
