          <p>OpenAI has launched GPT-5, its latest and most powerful AI model, making it available to all users, including those on the free tier. The company touts the new model as being significantly smarter and faster, with a lower rate of fabricating answers and improved safety features. Demonstrations showcased its ability to generate complex web applications from simple text prompts, a capability OpenAI calls "vibe coding." This release marks a major step in making advanced reasoning models widely accessible and is being integrated into Microsoft products and partner platforms like Box.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to increase the presence of federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C., following an alleged assault on a former official and a threat from the president to federalize the city. The deployment will involve personnel from agencies including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and ICE, with the D.C. mayor's office reportedly approving the request. This move comes amid political tension and despite D.C. police data showing a year-to-date decrease in violent crime, though several high-profile incidents have recently occurred.</p>

          <p>Haiti has inaugurated businessman Laurent Saint-Cyr as the head of its transitional presidential council, a body tasked with restoring order in a nation plagued by gang violence. The appointment marks a significant moment as both the head of the council and the prime minister now come from the private sector. However, the new leadership faces an immediate and severe challenge, as a powerful gang leader has vowed to overthrow the government, and gunfire continues to erupt in the capital, where gangs control most of the territory.</p>

          <p>British holidaymakers are increasingly booking shorter vacations closer to home and at the last minute, according to major travel firms. Companies like Booking.com and Airbnb report a significant rise in searches for spontaneous domestic getaways, a trend attributed to both cost-of-living pressures and the desire to capitalize on favorable weather. This shift indicates that travelers are adapting their plans to be more budget-conscious and flexible, leading to a surge in late bookings for UK destinations like Butlin's.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed plans to build what will be the largest-ever U.S. migrant detention facility, located on the Fort Bliss military base in Texas. The center, named Camp East Montana, will initially house 1,000 migrants in tent-like structures and is slated to expand to a capacity of 5,000. This development is a key component of the Trump administration's intensified crackdown on undocumented immigration, a policy that has already driven the number of detained migrants to record levels nationwide.</p>
