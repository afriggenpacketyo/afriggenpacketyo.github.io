          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, rapidly intensified into a powerful Category 5 storm before weakening slightly to a Category 4. The storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can cause temporary fluctuations in intensity but may result in it emerging even stronger. While its path is forecast to keep it away from the U.S. mainland, it is expected to bring heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions to the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, a local figure known for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of two women in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The cold case was solved after more than two decades when investigators used genetic genealogy to match DNA from the crime scenes to Miller. His defense argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity due to severe childhood abuse, but prosecutors highlighted his history of violence and meticulous planning in the killings.</p>

          <p>United Kingdom Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, asserting that its activities go beyond legitimate protest. She cited instances of property damage and other actions for which the group claimed responsibility, leading to charges with a "terrorism connection." The defense comes as police prepare to prosecute 60 more individuals for supporting the group, which is currently challenging the ban in the High Court.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota mechanic discovered a wallet that had been lost by a Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan eleven years prior. The wallet, belonging to Richard Guilford, had apparently slipped from his pocket into the airbox of a 2015 Ford Edge he was working on in 2014. The mechanic successfully located Guilford through Facebook and returned the wallet, which still contained cash and unexpired gift cards after traveling over 150,000 miles inside the vehicle.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are exploring a design for a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a unique rotating "scissor wing," a concept previously studied by NASA. This innovative design features a single wing that pivots as the aircraft's speed increases, providing high lift at low speeds and minimizing drag at hypersonic velocities up to Mach 5. The technology aims to overcome the significant aerodynamic challenges associated with transitioning between subsonic and hypersonic flight, creating a more versatile and efficient aircraft.</p>

These triggers include a lifetime of suppressing one's own needs to be perceived as "good," the self-sabotaging nature of perfectionism, and poor personal boundaries often stemming from childhood. Other powerful catalysts can be a subconscious retaliation against an abusive marriage or a profound re-evaluation of life following a major loss.</p>

          <p>Students about to receive their GCSE results have opened time-capsule letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, when they were 11-year-old pupils just starting secondary school amid a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters captured their unique perspectives, containing fears about the pandemic, hopes for their academic future, and personal questions about growing up. The activity served as a poignant reflection on their journey through the unprecedented disruptions of the pandemic as they reached a key milestone.</p>

          <p>During his recent summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump concerning the children impacted by the war in Ukraine. The letter's text, now public, speaks in general terms about childhood innocence and calls on Putin to "restore their melodic laughter." It does not, however, explicitly mention the abduction and forcible transfer of thousands of Ukrainian children, a war crime for which Putin faces an indictment from the International Criminal Court.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a German-style village in Chile with a dark history as the abusive sect Colonia Dignidad, now operates as a tourist destination with a hotel and restaurant. The site was also used as a torture center for political prisoners under the Pinochet dictatorship. The Chilean government is now planning to expropriate part of the property to establish a memorial, a decision that has divided the community's remaining residents, many of whom were also victims of the colony's brutal regime.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, introducing global diners to a wide variety of authentic regional cuisines far beyond common Westernized fare. Driven by fierce competition in their home market, brands specializing in dishes from regions like Hunan and Zhejiang are using Singapore as a test kitchen before expanding further. This culinary movement is challenging outdated stereotypes and is seen by some observers as a successful form of cultural diplomacy for China.</p>

          <p>A new music collection, "Sunset Boulevard," focuses on Elvis Presley's recordings in Los Angeles from 1972 to 1975, a period that included his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love." This era also saw Presley grapple with personal turmoil and professional disappointment, notably his failed bid to star alongside Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born." A longtime friend of Presley's suggests that losing this role was a significant blow that contributed to the singer's artistic and personal decline before his death in 1977.</p>
