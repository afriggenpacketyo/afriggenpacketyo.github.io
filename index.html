          <p>A global movement to protect children online, highlighted by the U.K.'s Online Safety Act, is spurring the growth of AI-powered safety technologies. Companies like Yoti are using AI for facial age estimation to restrict access to adult content on platforms such as Pornhub and X, while others like HMD Global are developing child-safe smartphones. This regulatory push has created a new market for digital safety solutions, though it also raises significant privacy concerns regarding data collection and potential breaches. The trend reflects a broader demand for tech companies to take greater responsibility for preventing online harm to minors.</p>

          <p>The United States has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and approximately 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York. The U.S. State Department cited actions that undermine peace efforts and the pursuit of unilateral statehood recognition as the reason for the ban. This decision, which Israel welcomed, raises questions about its compliance with the UN Headquarters Agreement obligating the U.S. to facilitate travel for officials on UN business. The Palestinian Authority has condemned the move as a violation of international law.</p>

          <p>Violent protests erupted in Makassar, Indonesia, following the death of a motorcycle taxi driver who was run over by a police vehicle. Demonstrators set a local council building on fire, resulting in the deaths of three people trapped inside and injuring at least four others. The unrest stems from public anger over the death and broader dissatisfaction with the police, particularly the notorious Brimob unit implicated in the incident. President Prabowo Subianto has promised a thorough investigation and urged calm, facing his first major crisis since taking office.</p>

According to reports, Baxter bragged about the incident to a security guard and was later seen on security footage repeating the gesture. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the termination, stating that disrespect for law enforcement would not be tolerated within the department. This incident follows the recent firing of another DOJ paralegal for allegedly throwing a sandwich at a federal officer.</p>

          <p>The UK prison service is reportedly in shock following the murder of former officer Lenny Scott, who was shot and killed by a drug dealer four years after exposing the inmate's affair with another officer. The killer, Elias Morgan, had previously threatened Scott after the officer confiscated a phone containing evidence of the affair. This premeditated revenge killing has highlighted the significant risks that prison staff face both inside and outside the workplace, damaging morale and prompting calls for better protection protocols. The Prison Officer's Association described the event as unprecedented and horrifying for the profession.</p>

          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has joined the Green Bay Packers after a contentious contract stalemate with the Dallas Cowboys, which he described as the "hardest four months of my life." The Packers acquired Parsons in a trade that sent two first-round picks and Kenny Clark to Dallas, subsequently signing him to a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Upon arriving in Green Bay, Parsons expressed his ambition to create a legacy alongside franchise legends like Reggie White. The move provides the Packers with a much-needed elite pass rusher.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's recent struggles, including a loss to Grimsby Town, are being attributed to the tactical rigidity of manager Rúben Amorim's 5-2-3 positional system. This article analyzes how his gameplan, which relies on creating numerical overloads and specific "up-back-through" passing routines, is frequently nullified by opponents using man-to-man marking and a back-five defense. The system's lack of encouragement for individual dribbling and roaming makes it predictable and vulnerable, particularly in midfield where United's two central players are often outnumbered. Amorim's methods, successful at Sporting, may require adaptation for the higher standard of the Premier League.</p>

          <p>North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, with volumes more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. This surge has made North Korea the second-largest market by volume for Chinese bottled wine, trailing only Hong Kong. Despite international sanctions on luxury goods, alcohol is not on the UN's restricted list, allowing China to continue its trade relationship with its isolated neighbor. The data indicates that with few alternative sources, North Korea relies heavily on China for its alcoholic beverage supply.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men under the age of 22 to leave the country, amending a wartime rule that previously barred men aged 18-60 from departing. The government stated the goal is to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for education and employment abroad, with the hope they will return with valuable experience to aid national development. While officials believe this will prevent losing a generation of young men who feared being unable to leave if they returned, some demographers worry it will exacerbate brain drain.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration's policy of expanding "expedited removal" to deport undocumented migrants detained in the interior of the U.S. without a court hearing. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that applying the statute to individuals who have been living in the country, away from the border, requires affording them due process rights. The administration had broadened the policy to apply to migrants who have been in the country for less than two years, a significant change from its previous use near the border.

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record for the fastest non-stop and unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, completing the 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia in just under 140 days. The trio overcame severe challenges, including violent tropical storms that forced detours and even swept one brother overboard before he was safely recovered. Their journey, which beat the previous record by over 20 days, has so far raised more than £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>
