          <p>A deadly explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulted in one fatality and multiple injuries, prompting investigations by the FBI and ATF. The explosion, described as an intentional act of violence, caused damage extending several blocks and impacting nearby buildings. While the victim's identity remains unknown, the clinic confirmed no employees were harmed and reproductive materials remained secure, expecting normal operations to resume soon. Authorities are working to determine the cause and potential motives behind the incident, which has drawn national attention. Palm Springs is known for its stunning mid-century modern architecture, arid desert landscapes and thriving L.G.B.T.Q. community.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings.

Chicago experienced significant visibility reduction, with the event being the first dust storm warning for the city since the Dust Bowl era. Dry soil conditions in the region contributed to the severity of the storm, which is unusual for the area, but more common in the desert Southwest and southern Great Plains.</p>

          <p>Federal courts have consistently pushed back against the Trump administration's efforts to expedite deportations, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court has chastised the administration for providing inadequate notice to immigrants facing deportation, while other courts have insisted on fair warning periods and the right to challenge removal orders. These rulings underscore the constitutional principle that all individuals, regardless of citizenship status, are entitled to due process before being deprived of life, liberty, or property. The cases highlight concerns over the administration's manipulation of processes to avoid judicial review and the potential for indefinite detention or persecution in countries to which immigrants are deported.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. While Starmer insists the scheme would be reciprocal and not a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized it as "free movement through the back door." An agreement is expected at Monday's summit, though it will likely be an agreement in principle, not the final deal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Walmart for warning that tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers, urging the retailer to "eat the tariffs" instead. Walmart CFO John David Rainey cited the speed and magnitude of price increases due to tariffs as a challenge. The retailer wants to keep its prices lower than competitors, especially at a time when shoppers are seeking discounts. The tariff impact is also an obvious concern for the Home Depot, though those headwinds could be slowly fading amid de-escalation between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator, Mosura fentoni, in the Canadian Rockies. The creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," possessed a pencil sharpener-like mouth and claws extending from its head. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period and reveals the complexity of early life forms. The sea moth is believed to have used its body flaps to swim similarly to modern stingrays, sharing the waters with fellow radiodont and early apex predator, the iconic Anomalocaris canadensis.</p>

The release puts Democrats in an uncomfortable position, forcing them to reconcile the recording with their previous claims about Biden's fitness for office.</p>
