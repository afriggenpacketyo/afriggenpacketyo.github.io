        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson revealed he used the potent painkiller fentanyl multiple times during the late 1990s to manage a toe injury. He described the drug's effects as similar to heroin, noting the severe withdrawal symptoms he experienced after it wore off. Tyson, who had to stop due to the substance being banned in boxing, is now a vocal advocate for cannabis legalization for athletes, which he refers to as medicine. He has been actively lobbying the White House for federal cannabis reform, linking his potential return to the ring to changes in its legal status.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned Israel's recent strikes in Doha, Qatar, which targeted Hamas leadership, calling them a violation of sovereignty that risks regional escalation. The condemnation came just before his scheduled meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Downing Street, where Starmer is expected to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The visit has drawn criticism from some UK politicians who are calling for Herzog to be denied entry over allegations of war crimes. Downing Street has affirmed that Starmer will press Herzog on the need for a ceasefire and increased aid to Gaza.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon commented that the U.S. economy is showing clear signs of weakening, a view reinforced by a recent Labor Department report that significantly revised job growth figures downward. While acknowledging that consumers are still employed and spending, Dimon noted that confidence may be faltering, and it remains uncertain whether the slowdown will lead to a recession. He suggested that while the Federal Reserve will likely reduce its benchmark interest rate soon, such a move might not have a substantial impact on the overall economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel has conducted and taken full responsibility for an airstrike in Doha, Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leadership, whom it holds responsible for the October 7th attacks. The Israeli Defense Forces stated the operation was a "surgical precision strike" and that measures were taken to mitigate civilian harm. Qatar strongly condemned the attack as a "cowardly" act and a flagrant violation of its sovereignty, launching an investigation. The strike has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from the UN and several Middle Eastern nations, who warn it undermines ceasefire efforts and threatens regional stability.</p>

          <p>A woman has died after an overloaded migrant boat experienced a "catastrophic deflation" approximately 10 miles off the coast of Dover while attempting to cross the English Channel. A major rescue operation involving the UK Coastguard, Border Force, and lifeboats was launched, but the woman was pronounced dead after being airlifted to shore. The incident highlights the ongoing dangers of small boat crossings, with UK officials expressing shock and sadness over the tragedy. This event occurred as figures show over 30,000 people have arrived in the UK via small boats in 2025.</p>

          <p>Four years after the tragic collapse of the Champlain Towers South building that killed 98 people, federal investigators have announced their preliminary findings. Researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology believe the collapse likely initiated in the pool deck area more than seven minutes before the main tower fell. The investigation suggests that the pool deck's connections had critically low safety margins from the time of construction due to design understrength and misplaced reinforcement. The final report on the cause of the disaster has been delayed and is now expected in 2026.</p>

          <p>Bulgaria's defense industry, specializing in Soviet-era ammunition, has become a crucial supplier for Ukraine's military efforts since the full-scale Russian invasion. Initially, these arms deliveries were kept secret to avoid Russian sabotage, with supplies often routed through Poland. However, Bulgaria is now openly slated to produce a significant portion of the artillery shells promised to Ukraine by the EU. This shift is highlighted by a new €1 billion joint venture between German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall and a Bulgarian state-owned company to produce NATO-standard artillery shells.</p>

          <p>Stage 16 of the Vuelta a Espana was won by Colombian cyclist Egan Bernal after race directors shortened the route by eight kilometers due to pro-Palestinian protests near the finish line. This marks another disruption in this year's race by activists targeting the Israel-Premier Tech team, including a previous stage that was shortened without a winner. Race officials decided to declare a winner and take official times before the protest location to ensure the stage could be completed. The protests have caused several incidents, including a minor crash in a previous stage involving another rider.</p>

          <p>On his CNBC show, Jim Cramer identified Home Depot as the stock in his portfolio with the "most upside," citing optimism surrounding expected Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. He argued that recent data showing a significant downward revision in job creation strengthens the case for multiple rate cuts this year, which would benefit the home improvement retailer. Cramer advised investors to view the current weakness in lumber prices as a buying opportunity for Home Depot stock. He expressed confidence that both short-term and long-term rates will fall significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly criticized the previous administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) following a report that revised U.S. job creation downward by 911,000. A spokesperson stated the revision proves that "President Trump was right: Biden's economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken." The statement called for new leadership at the agency to restore trust in its data. The White House also renewed its attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating he has "run out of excuses" and must cut interest rates immediately.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a week of engagements with charities he supports, arriving on the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death. His visit has fueled speculation about whether he will meet with his father, King Charles III, or his estranged brother, Prince William. Harry and his father have not seen each other in 19 months, and relations with William are reportedly non-existent. Royal experts suggest that a failure to meet with the King this week would signal a deepening of the family rift.</p>

          <p>The European Union is coordinating with the United States on a forthcoming 19th package of sanctions against Russia, as Moscow has recently escalated its military offensive in Ukraine. According to EU officials, the new measures will likely target Russia's energy sector more aggressively, with discussions focusing on the Druzhba pipeline that supplies oil to Hungary and Slovakia. A key point of discussion is the potential for secondary sanctions against countries, such as China, that continue to purchase Russian energy. The new package is expected to be presented within the next week.</p>

          <p>Preliminary data from the U.S. Labor Department revealed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs in the year through March than previously reported, signaling slower growth than was understood. This significant downward revision adds to recent signs of a cooling labor market and reinforces expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates. The data comes at a politically sensitive time, with the White House using the figures to criticize the previous administration's economic record. Analysts suggest the weakening job market could dampen the recent stock market rally. (not investment advice)</p>
