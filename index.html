            <p>In the deportation case against Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil, the federal government filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, arguing that Khalil's protests conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio asserts Khalil's presence undermines U.S. efforts to combat anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students, citing a statute allowing deportation of noncitizens whose presence damages national foreign policy interests. Khalil's attorneys argue the government lacks evidence and is infringing on his First Amendment rights, claiming he is being persecuted for his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

            <p>European Union leaders are planning to travel to Beijing in late July for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The plan suggests a second successive EU-China summit would be held in the Chinese capital, despite the fact that the location is supposed to rotate. EU leaders’ willingness to make the trip indicates a serious effort to re-engage with Beijing at a time when the bloc’s relationship with the United States has effectively collapsed.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles judge ruled in favor of Sony Pictures Television, granting them the right to take over distribution of "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune" from CBS. Sony had filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit, alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals for the shows and underpaid commissions. CBS plans to appeal the ruling, arguing that the contract with Sony is not yet dead and that they will prevail once all evidence is heard.</p>

            <p>India's diplomatic gamble with the US has failed to yield the desired results, as President Trump announced a 26% reciprocal tariff on India despite Prime Minister Modi being considered a friend. The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry expressed disappointment, while opposition leader Rahul Gandhi warned that the tariffs would devastate India's economy. Despite Modi's visit to Washington in February, the US-India relationship has not improved significantly, with the momentum established under the Biden administration diminishing.</p>

            <p>President Trump acknowledged "transition problems" and "difficulty" as US markets fell again amid uncertainty over his global tariff war. Trump paused his threat to impose tariffs on "worst offender" countries but pressed on with his trade war with China. Beijing has shown no sign of backing down, increasing its retaliatory tariffs to 84% on American products. Trump said investors were happy with how the US was running and that they were "trying to get the world to treat us fairly."</p>

China announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%.

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering placing Columbia University under a consent decree, a binding agreement approved by a federal judge, due to allegations of antisemitism on campus. The university has already accepted a series of changes demanded by the administration as a precondition for restoring federal grants and contracts. The proposal comes from the administration’s antisemitism taskforce, who have expressed skepticism that Columbia was acting in “good faith”. The move represents an escalation in the federal government's crackdown on the Ivy League institution.</p>

            <p>The United States is retreating from hard power, surrendering soft power, and yielding economic power, raising questions about the country's future global influence. President Trump’s economic policies, particularly his erratic approach to trade, have created uncertainty and eroded trust in the American financial system. The U.S. is also giving up soft power through cuts to USAID and other initiatives, and is yielding hard power through pullbacks in Europe and a questioning of support for Ukraine. These moves seem at odds with the goal of confronting China, as they undermine the alliances and moral standing needed to do so effectively.</p>
