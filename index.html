The proceedings are being closely watched by public health officials, as the panel's decisions influence official guidance for both children and adults across the nation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States is actively trying to regain control of the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan, which was abandoned during the 2021 withdrawal. He cited the base's strategic importance, particularly its proximity to China's nuclear weapons development sites, as a primary reason for the effort. Trump suggested that negotiations with the Taliban are underway, leveraging their need for U.S. assistance to secure the return of the former key military asset. The Taliban has previously denied claims that China occupies the base.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has set a date of November 5 to hear oral arguments concerning the legality of President Donald Trump's extensive global tariffs. This follows a lower court ruling that determined the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the duties. The case represents a significant test of presidential executive power and could have major economic consequences, potentially forcing the U.S. to repay billions collected from the tariffs if the court rules against the administration.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut is expected to have a mixed impact on American consumers' finances. Borrowers with variable-rate products like home equity lines of credit will likely see immediate relief, and mortgage rates have already declined in anticipation of the move. However, the reduction may not significantly affect high credit card APRs, and it could lead to lower returns for savers with high-yield savings accounts. This is the first of several cuts anticipated by the Fed through 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers calculated that modern chickens bred for rapid growth endure approximately 700 hours of pain in their 45-day lifespan. By switching to slower-growing breeds, producers could eliminate at least 15 to 100 hours of the most disabling and excruciating pain at a cost of just half a cent to three cents per hour of pain averted. This approach presents a quantifiable way to improve animal welfare.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of property tax data highlights the wide variation in what homeowners pay across the United States, with annual median bills ranging from over $9,100 in New Jersey to under $800 in Alabama. The report notes that property taxes have become a growing financial strain, increasing over 27% since 2019 and often exceeding homeowners' budgets. Factors influencing the tax burden include local home values, state funding structures, and the presence or absence of a state income tax, which can force higher reliance on property taxes.

          <p>President Donald Trump declared on social media that he will seek to designate antifa, a decentralized collection of far-left militant groups, as a "major terrorist organization." The president also recommended a thorough investigation into the funding sources for antifa-related activities. This move follows the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with the administration suggesting the suspect was radicalized by left-wing ideology online. It is unclear how such a designation would be applied to a domestic group without a centralized structure.</p>

          <p>Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS), the student wing of Bangladesh's largest Islamist party, has won decisive victories in student council elections at two of the nation's major universities. This success comes after the interim government lifted a ban on the party, which had been outlawed by the previous administration. These elections are seen as a significant political barometer ahead of national polls scheduled for 2026, suggesting a resurgence of support for Islamist parties, particularly among the youth, in the country's shifting political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers may face higher prices on Halloween products this year, including costumes, decorations, and candy, due to the impact of import tariffs. Despite the potential for increased costs, the National Retail Federation projects that consumer spending for the holiday will reach a record $13.1 billion. A costume shop owner noted that tariffs have added 5% to 19% to his wholesale costs, forcing him to absorb some of the increase. Shoppers are expected to be savvy, with many likely turning to discount stores to manage their holiday budgets.</p>
