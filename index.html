The judge ruled that overturning the jury's conviction would be contrary to the public interest, ordering the deputy to begin his four-month prison sentence. This decision concludes a controversial case where the new U.S. Attorney's post-conviction leniency had previously prompted resignations from several federal prosecutors.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue their relationship with Netflix, having signed a new multi-year, first-look deal for their Archewell Productions company. This new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their previous overall deal from 2020, giving Netflix first right of refusal on projects rather than exclusive development rights. The partnership has so far produced several successful documentary series and will expand to include projects related to Meghan's lifestyle brand.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the planned meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, European Union foreign ministers have convened to emphasize their unified stance on the war in Ukraine. The ministers insist that any potential peace agreement must directly involve Ukraine and respect its sovereignty. This position underscores European concerns that a bilateral deal brokered between the U.S. and Russia could potentially sideline Ukrainian interests and lead to an unjust resolution of the conflict.</p>

While some activists and officials denounce the move as an authoritarian power grab, some residents in higher-crime neighborhoods express hope that it could make their streets safer. Others remain cynical, viewing the action as political theater that will have little real impact on public safety while undermining local autonomy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that gold will not face tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to certain gold bars from Switzerland. The initial ruling caused concern in the precious metals market, with the Swiss Precious Metals Association warning it could disrupt the international flow of physical gold. Following Trump's clarification, gold futures experienced a notable drop in price, settling lower after reaching a record high. (not investment advice)</p>
