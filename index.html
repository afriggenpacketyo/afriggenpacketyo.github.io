        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an IAEA report indicating Iran's increasing stockpile of near weapons-grade enriched uranium, the White House has urged Iran to accept its proposal for a nuclear deal. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump is firm on preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, emphasizing that Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has presented a detailed and acceptable proposal. The IAEA's report highlights Iran's substantial increase in uranium enrichment, raising concerns about the country's nuclear ambitions. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, though U.S. intelligence agencies suggest otherwise; Israel has issued a grave warning regarding Iran's nuclear program, urging the international community to take action, and the White House urging Iran to accept the nuclear deal. Optimism about the stability of the situation is somewhat tempered by the report's findings.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned that China poses an "imminent" threat to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the U.S. to deter war. Hegseth characterized China as seeking to become a "hegemonic power" in Asia, citing a potential 2027 deadline for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. In response, the Chinese embassy in Singapore accused the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, while Hegseth emphasized that the U.S. does not seek conflict but aims to ensure China cannot dominate its allies. The US wants allies to forge a strong shield of deterrence to prevent war.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its ability to deter adversaries. This investment, part of the government's strategic defence review, aims to support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized that the war in Ukraine has exposed deficiencies in the West's weapons production capabilities, and the new factories will ensure an "always on" munitions production capacity. The announcement follows concerns from senior military officers about the UK's depleted stockpiles and the need to boost weapons production.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that "unavoidable" tough choices are looming as the UK government finalizes its spending plans across various sectors. The level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other "unprotected" areas such as transport, net zero initiatives, schools, and the criminal justice system. With Chancellor Rachel Reeves ruling out additional borrowing and tax increases, spending cuts are anticipated, raising concerns about the government's ability to meet its commitments, including increasing police numbers and capping bus fares. The government's spending review on June 11 will scrutinize every single pound the government spends.</p>

          <p>The US has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal following a UN report highlighting Iran's increased production of enriched uranium. The proposal, sent by US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, aims to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged receiving the proposal and stated that it would be appropriately responded to. The IAEA report indicated that Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, nearing weapons-grade levels, though Iran insists its program is peaceful.</p>
