          <p>A wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed over 13,250 acres and is approximately 50% contained. The Jones Road Wildfire led to the evacuation of around 5,000 residents, although evacuations have since been lifted. While one business was destroyed, no injuries or loss of life have been reported, thanks to the efforts of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. The fire, which officials expect to be the largest in the state in 20 years, started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area due to dry conditions and high winds, and smoke from the fire is impacting air quality as far as New York City.</p>

          <p>South Korea's GDP experienced a 0.1% year-on-year contraction in the first quarter, marking the first economic decline since late 2020, primarily due to a sharp fall in construction activity. The contraction occurred amidst political instability, including impeachment trials, and ongoing trade war tensions, particularly tariffs imposed by the U.S. The Bank of Korea had already warned of slower growth for 2025, and analysts predict potential rate cuts in response to the economic downturn. A South Korean team is engaging in trade talks with the U.S. to seek mutually beneficial outcomes amidst these challenges.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg stated that China has stopped taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to the ongoing trade war and high tariffs imposed by the U.S. This has led Boeing to redirect some 737 Max planes, originally destined for Chinese airlines, back to the U.S. and seek alternative customers for its aircraft. Despite the setback, Ortberg emphasized that Boeing will not allow this to derail the company's recovery and aims to continue delivering aircraft to other customers, as the demand for the Max aircraft remains strong.</p>

          <p>South Korea's former president, Moon Jae-in, has been indicted on bribery charges related to the employment of his ex-son-in-law at a Thai budget airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon received 217 million won in connection with facilitating the employment, with suspicions that the son-in-law's salary was a bribe. This development comes amidst political divisions in South Korea, just weeks before a general election brought forward due to the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol.</p>

          <p>A bill in California to sharply reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels is generating intense opposition from solar owners and environmental groups. Assembly Bill 942, proposed by a former Edison executive, would limit the credits to 10 years and end them upon the sale of the house, impacting those who installed systems before April 2023. Supporters, including union electrical workers and the state's big utilities, argue the bill addresses inequities in electric bills, while opponents contend it undermines long-term contracts and jeopardizes the state's clean energy goals.</p>
