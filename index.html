          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla 33% responsible for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, resulting in one death and serious injuries. The automaker was ordered to pay a portion of $329 million in damages, which includes both compensatory and punitive amounts, though the final payout is expected to be around $242.5 million. The case centered on a driver who, believing Autopilot would brake for obstacles, crashed while retrieving a dropped phone. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, arguing the driver was solely at fault for overriding the system.</p>

          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the family of the late Virginia Giuffre have strongly condemned the Trump administration for transferring Ghislaine Maxwell to a less restrictive, minimum-security prison in Texas. They argue the move, which occurred without their notification, suggests a cover-up and preferential treatment for the convicted sex trafficker. The transfer followed meetings between Maxwell and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a former Trump lawyer. A senior administration official called the assertion of preferential treatment "absurd," citing potential safety concerns as a reason for such moves.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, accusing the official of manipulating jobs data. The move came hours after the BLS reported a surprisingly low 73,000 new jobs in July and a significant downward revision of 258,000 jobs for the prior two months. In a social media post, Trump called for more accurate numbers and also renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The termination of the head of a non-partisan statistical agency has raised concerns about the politicization of economic data.</p>

          <p>After a significant 40% price increase over the past year, gold prices may stabilize around $3,300 per ounce in August. Key factors contributing to this potential stagnation include the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady, which removes a major catalyst for price shifts. Uncertainty around upcoming inflation data and evolving demand for portfolio diversification also suggest a period of muted activity. The article advises investors to consider gold's long-term role rather than focusing on short-term fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Danville, Virginia man has been charged with attempted first-degree murder after allegedly setting city councilman Lee Vogler on fire.

According to charging documents, Hayes later admitted to police that he intended to kill Vogler. Officials state the attack stemmed from a personal matter and was not related to Vogler's political position, while the councilman is currently recovering from his injuries.</p>

Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, had accused Trump of playing an "ultimatum game" that was a step towards war.

Countries like Mexico received a temporary reprieve, while Canada faced an increase to 35%. European nations negotiated a 15% rate, but some Italian business leaders called it a "surrender." Brazil was hit with a steep 50% tariff on many goods, and Switzerland faces a 39% levy.

This decision requires Italy to revise its procedures and could halt the Albania project, which is being closely watched by other European governments.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized set of exercises for schoolchildren that was phased out in 2013. The test, which includes exercises like the one-mile run and push-ups, was a staple in American physical education for over 50 years. The administration argues its return is necessary to combat declining physical fitness and rising obesity rates among youth. While some educators welcome the focus on physical activity, others express concern about the test's potential negative impact on students' mental health.</p>

The proposal documents repeatedly reference the repeal of California's waivers, which are foundational to the state's plan to ban new gas-powered cars by 2035. The EPA's own analysis suggests that without California's rules and federal tax credits, national EV adoption will decline and gas prices will rise, yet the agency claims its plan will save Americans money.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent tariff actions appear to follow a more coherent, if aggressive, negotiating strategy, using the threat of steep duties to extract concessions and bilateral trade deals from other countries. This approach has seen some success in forcing partners to agree to terms, but it is fraught with legal and economic uncertainty. The tariffs face a significant challenge in appellate court, and a weak jobs report has heightened concerns that the policy is contributing to an economic slowdown, posing a risk of a potential recession.
