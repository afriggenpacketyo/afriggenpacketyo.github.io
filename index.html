          <h2>Bridgend Council Faces Criticism Over Sex Education Presentation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 01:11:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bridgend council in Wales has been criticized for a draft PowerPoint presentation intended for schools that included a slide about strangulation during sex. The slide stated, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first," raising concerns among experts and politicians about the appropriateness of including an illegal act in educational material. The council claims the slide was part of a draft version and was removed following feedback, but questions remain about why such content was considered in the first place. Experts worry about the vulnerability of schools expected to cover sex education topics without adequate training, leading to calls for greater government oversight of sex education material.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the ongoing protests in Serbia against the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, highlighting the solidarity and determination of the student-led movement. Triggered by a train station collapse that killed 16 people, the protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in Serbia in recent years. The government's attempts to quell the unrest through resignations and financial incentives have failed, as evidenced by a massive demonstration in Belgrade. The article emphasizes the protesters' commitment to horizontal decision-making and their efforts to raise international awareness of their struggle.</p>

          <p>Oren and Tal Alexander, along with their brother Alon, face new federal charges, including additional counts of alleged sex trafficking, one involving a minor. The charges are part of a superseding indictment that includes more alleged victims, bringing the total to six. The Alexander brothers have been accused of luring women to nightclubs and parties, then drugging and sexually assaulting them. The attorneys for the Alexander brothers maintain their clients' innocence and state that the new charges are misguided and lack merit.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled legislation that would significantly cut Medicaid spending through new restrictions on beneficiaries, such as work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks. The bill aims to find $880 billion in savings as part of a larger effort to pay for Trump's domestic priorities. Millions of people would lose health insurance under the plan, and it would prohibit Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care for minors and for community health providers like Planned Parenthood that provide family planning and abortion services. Democrats have criticized the bill, stating it would increase the number of uninsured Americans.</p>
