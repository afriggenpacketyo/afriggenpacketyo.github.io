            <p>Macau experienced a surge in tourism and spending during the ITTF Men’s and Women’s World Cup, driven by enthusiastic Chinese table tennis fans, particularly young women. These fans spent significant amounts on tickets, travel, souvenirs, and food to support their favorite players like Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha. This trend aligns with the Chinese government's efforts to capitalize on the growing public enthusiasm for sports to stimulate consumer spending. Beijing has recently introduced supportive measures for the sports industry amidst this increasing public interest. Optimism score: 75</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating the 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Russian troops had violated the ceasefire "more than 2,000 times" since the start of Sunday. Russia's defence ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. Despite the accusations, US President Donald Trump expressed hope that Russia and Ukraine would reach a deal this week. Optimism score: 20</p>

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar called for the US Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for ignoring a court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García from El Salvador. She suggested appointing a special prosecutor to charge officials responsible for Ábrego García’s deportation or refusal to facilitate his return. Klobuchar warned that the US is nearing a constitutional crisis, but believes the courts, Republican dissent, and public protest are holding it off. The comments follow Justice Alito's dissenting opinion on blocking deportations of Venezuelans from Texas. Optimism score: 40</p>
