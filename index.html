        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. This system would aim to protect the entire United States from missile attacks. However, experts note that building such a system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex than Israel's Iron Dome due to the country's larger size and the different types of missiles that could be used against it. Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, compares the difference to building a kayak versus a battleship, highlighting the scale of the challenge. The article also mentions that questions about nuclear science can be emailed to shortwave@npr.org. </p>

          <p>Russian strikes on Kyiv have resulted in at least 14 deaths and dozens of injuries, marking one of the largest bombardments of the capital since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched a total of 440 drones and 32 missiles at the country, while Russia claimed to have intercepted 147 Ukrainian drones overnight. The strikes lasted more than nine hours, forcing residents to seek shelter in underground locations.

The J-35A is the land-based variant of China's latest fifth-generation fighter jet, developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC). While the J-20 is prohibited from overseas export, it was also on display at CATIC’s booth. China has been seeking to boost export sales of its fighter aircraft, particularly in developing countries in the Middle East and South Asia, despite facing challenges in the European market due to political and military relations with the US.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, ranging from supporting Israeli strikes to distancing himself from them. This ambiguity, along with his early departure from the G7 summit, has created uncertainty. The article outlines three potential paths for Trump: escalating the conflict in response to pressure from Netanyahu, maintaining the current course of limited involvement, or pulling back and prioritizing domestic concerns. The article notes that Trump's unpredictability could be a strategic tactic to coerce adversaries or allies. </p>

          <p>G7 leaders have urged a "de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza," but did not call for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran during their summit in Canada. The joint statement was signed by President Trump, who left the meeting early citing events in the Middle East. The statement reiterated support for Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Iran as a source of terror that should not have a nuclear weapon. Trump also criticized French President Macron for suggesting he was working on a ceasefire. </p>

The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen ($1.4 billion) per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen.

The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the removal of charges on steel imports. The order allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year. The order also agreed to remove tariffs on certain kinds of aerospace products. </p>
