          <p>A widespread heatwave is affecting the entire UK, with temperatures peaking at 33C in some areas, marking the third major heat event of the year. The conditions have prompted amber heat health alerts, hosepipe bans for millions of residents, and disruptions to travel and major sporting events like Wimbledon. Authorities have also issued wildfire warnings in Scotland and are cautioning the public about the increased risk of drowning as people try to stay cool. This article presents the recurring heatwaves within the context of a pattern potentially influenced by climate change.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic humorously portrays former commentator Dan Bongino as the "Deputy Director of the FBI" who dramatically resigns his post. The piece imagines him believing he can better solve the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy from outside the agency, lampooning the culture of conspiracy theories. The fictional Bongino character claims that being close to classified files is a distraction and that true, effective investigation happens in a basement with a red-thread bulletin board, far from any official government role.</p>

          <p>The third Test match at Lord's between England and India is finely poised, with the scores level on first innings after three days of intense play. England's bowlers managed to take India's last four wickets for just 11 runs, dismissing the tourists for 387, thanks to key performances from Chris Woakes and captain Ben Stokes. The match, played in sweltering heat, has been a grueling battle of attrition, setting up a decisive final two days to determine the winner of the closely fought contest.</p>

          <p>During a post-fight press conference for the historic all-female Taylor-Serrano 3 boxing card, promoter Jake Paul had a sharp response for a reporter. The journalist questioned the presence of ring girls and the "sexualization of women" at the event. Paul dismissed the question abruptly, telling the reporter to stop talking and making a sardonic reference to Vice President Kamala Harris. The tense exchange occurred following Amanda Serrano's loss to Katie Taylor in the main event at Madison Square Garden.</p>

          <p>An alleged leader of Italy's powerful 'ndrangheta mafia, Giuseppe Palermo, has been arrested in Bogota, Colombia. Palermo, also known as "Peppe," was wanted under an Interpol red notice and is accused of managing vast cocaine trafficking operations from Latin America to Europe. His capture was the result of a coordinated effort between Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. The arrest highlights the global reach of the 'ndrangheta and represents a significant blow to its international drug trade operations.</p>

The government's proscription followed an incident where activists painted aircraft at an RAF base.

          <p>U.S. companies are increasingly using federally sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce the financial impact of tariffs amid ongoing trade disputes. These zones allow businesses to import components and assemble products without immediately paying duties, which are only collected when the final goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow, though a recent executive order by President Trump has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product, creating new challenges for manufacturers.

          <p>An investigation found that FEMA repeatedly approved requests from Camp Mystic to remove dozens of its buildings from a 100-year flood map in the years before a catastrophic flood killed 27 campers and counselors. These exemptions from the "Special Flood Hazard Area" designation loosened regulatory oversight and insurance requirements for the Texas summer camp, which was expanding in a known flood plain. Experts question why a camp responsible for children would seek such exemptions in a high-risk area, highlighting potential flaws in FEMA's map amendment process.</p>

          <p>Chris Kirby, founder of Ithaca Hummus, has grown his business from a small farmers market operation into a brand expecting $50 million in revenue this year. Starting with just a $450 blender while studying at Cornell University, Kirby identified a "culinary gap" for fresh, high-quality hummus. The company's success is attributed to a slow-and-steady growth strategy, focusing on deep penetration in existing markets rather than rapid, wide expansion. Kirby has maintained control by avoiding outside investors, allowing the company to remain profitable and focused on its long-term vision.</p>

          <p>Military experts suggest Russia's intensified missile and drone attacks on Ukraine serve dual strategic purposes: destroying Ukraine's military-industrial capacity and demoralizing the civilian population. Thanks to expanded domestic drone production and supplies from allies like China and North Korea, Russia can now sustain a high tempo of assaults. Analysts believe these attacks are precursors to a potential new summer offensive, aimed at crippling Ukrainian air defenses and pressuring the government. The article concludes that more decisive Western military aid is seen as crucial for Ukraine to counter this strategy.</p>

          <p>In a new book and docuseries, author James Patterson explores the mindset of Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The analysis suggests Kohberger, described as an arrogant and socially awkward introvert, may have believed he could commit "the perfect murders" but made a critical error. Patterson posits that Kohberger experienced "tunnel vision" during the crime, causing him to leave behind a knife sheath containing his DNA, which ultimately led to his arrest. The article also explores his potential motives and unsettling behavior prior to the killings.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," with the goal of providing an alternative to the Republican and Democratic parties. However, political science experts are skeptical of its potential for success, citing the immense structural and financial advantages of the two major parties. Historically, third parties in the U.S. have succeeded by influencing the platforms of major parties rather than winning seats. Critics also point to Musk's own high public unfavorability rating as a significant hurdle for his political venture.</p>

While NASA's Artemis program officially has an earlier timeline for a crewed lunar landing, it faces significant technical hurdles.

          <p>This personal essay by a transgender woman reflects on the current political and social climate for trans people in the U.S., a decade after the supposed "transgender tipping point." The author contrasts growing public visibility, especially among youth, with a wave of restrictive legislation and debates over gender-affirming care. Using the concept of survivorship bias, she argues that her own success after transitioning later in life does not negate the benefits of early affirmation for today's youth. The piece frames the debate as one of acceptance and understanding versus doubt and fear.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague. This is the first recorded death from the rare bacterial infection in the state since 2007. While plague is known for its historical devastation as the "Black Death," it is now rare in humans and treatable with modern antibiotics. The bacteria is naturally present in rodent populations in the western U.S. and can be transmitted to humans through infected flea bites or contact with sick animals.</p>
