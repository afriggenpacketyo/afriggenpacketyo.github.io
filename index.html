          <p>The Senate is considering a bill that would eliminate taxes on tip income, a proposal championed by both Trump and Harris during the 2024 campaign. If enacted, workers could deduct all qualified tips from 2025 through 2028, provided they are reported. While this could provide relief to moderate and middle-income tipped workers, analysts point out potential issues such as income misclassification and shifts in compensation structures. The article notes that the impact may be limited as many low-income tipped workers already fall below the federal income tax threshold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing for a House vote on a comprehensive domestic policy bill that includes roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts, primarily benefiting the wealthy, alongside increased spending on defense and immigration enforcement. To offset these costs, the legislation proposes significant cuts to health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Key sticking points include disagreements over the state and local tax deduction cap and Medicaid work requirements. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill could leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured while reducing federal health care spending by over $700 billion.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Republican reconciliation bill, noting its alignment with long-standing party priorities of tax cuts for the wealthy, reduced spending on social programs, and increased defense spending. Despite some figures suggesting a shift, the bill's composition indicates a continuity of traditional Republican economic policies. The author argues that Congressional Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, are focused on redistributing income upward, a pattern consistent with Republican politics since the Reagan era.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced a reversal of cuts to winter fuel payments following political pressure.

The move comes after criticism that the policy contributed to Labour's losses in recent local elections, and details are expected to be clarified at the autumn Budget. The original cuts were implemented to save an estimated £1.4 billion by restricting eligibility to those receiving pension credit and other income-related benefits.</p>

          <p>The United States has accepted a 747 jetliner as a gift from the government of Qatar, with the Air Force tasked with upgrading it for use as the new Air Force One for President Trump. This plan has raised concerns among members of Congress about rushed security measures and potential undue influence from Qatar. The gift has also drawn scrutiny over whether the plane might contain listening devices or other security risks, and the overall ethics of accepting such a substantial gift from a foreign government.</p>
