          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that while Americans overwhelmingly find political violence unacceptable, a majority also believe it is likely to increase in the coming years. This concern is shared across party lines, though older Americans express the strongest condemnation of such acts. The findings also highlight a growing pessimism about the ability of people with different political views to unite, with fewer than half of respondents feeling comfortable expressing their political opinions publicly.</p>

          <p>A new seven-figure ad campaign in the Virginia governor's race is drawing criticism for its focus on transgender policies, with comparisons being made to the infamous 1988 'Willie Horton' ad. Produced by the American Principles Project, the ad attacks Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger by linking her policy positions to a specific sex offender case involving a transgender individual. The spot accuses Spanberger of prioritizing radical ideology over the safety of young girls, intensifying the cultural debate in a highly competitive race.</p>

          <p>California officials and labor leaders are calling for an audit and a State Bar investigation following a report that some plaintiffs in Los Angeles County's historic $4 billion sex abuse settlement were allegedly paid to file claims. A Los Angeles Times investigation found individuals who said they were recruited and paid by vendors to sue the county, with some instructed to fabricate their stories. The allegations have sparked outrage and cast doubt on the validity of thousands of claims within the largest settlement of its kind in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. intelligence sources, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly authorized military drone operations that targeted two humanitarian aid vessels off the coast of Tunisia. The boats, part of a flotilla aiming to break the naval blockade of Gaza, were reportedly struck with incendiary devices, causing fires but no injuries. The incident, which involved a vessel that had recently hosted international figures like Greta Thunberg, has been condemned by the activist group as a reckless endangerment of civilians.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key components of a Gaza peace plan outlined by President Trump, including the release of all hostages and handing over Gaza's administration to an independent Palestinian body. However, the group's statement suggests that other parts of the 20-point proposal are subject to further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. In response, President Trump called for Israel to immediately cease its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, viewing the development as a positive step.</p>

          <p>For the second consecutive day, Munich Airport was forced to suspend flight operations after more unconfirmed drone sightings were reported in the area. The closure of both runways led to the cancellation and diversion of numerous flights, affecting thousands of travelers. The repeated disruptions have heightened security concerns, particularly after a drone was also spotted over a nearby German military facility, prompting a large-scale investigation by authorities to identify the source of the drones.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is reportedly considering a design for a $1 commemorative coin that would feature President Donald Trump's likeness to mark the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft of the coin depicts Trump's profile on one side and a pose he struck after a 2024 assassination attempt on the other. This proposal is controversial as it appears to conflict with a long-standing federal law that prohibits the use of a living person's portrait on U.S. currency.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice under President Trump is facing alarm from within its ranks after dismissing several of the nation's most experienced counterterrorism prosecutors, reportedly for political reasons. The ousters include Michael Ben’Ary and the sidelining of George Toscas, both veterans with deep expertise in complex national security cases. Critics argue that these personnel changes weaken the department's capabilities, jeopardize ongoing cases, and undermine the principle of a justice system free from political interference.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought has emerged as the key figure enforcing deep cuts across federal agencies. President Trump has publicly praised Vought, linking his actions to "Project 2025," a conservative policy blueprint for aggressively reshaping the federal government. Vought is now wielding the shutdown as an opportunity to implement this agenda, targeting what the administration calls "Democrat agencies" for significant and potentially permanent reductions.</p>

          <p>The stock prices for Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis saw a notable increase following reports that the Trump administration is considering tariff relief for vehicles manufactured in the United States. This potential policy change could significantly reduce the financial burden of the 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts, which has cost the industry billions. The move would reward automakers with substantial domestic production, potentially offsetting a major operational expense and boosting their financial outlook. (not investment advice)</p>
