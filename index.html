          <p>Thousands of demonstrators have gathered for 'No Kings' protests across the United States, beginning in New York City, to challenge what organizers call the authoritarianism of the Trump administration. The coalition of left-leaning groups, which drew millions in June, has prompted Republican governors in several states to place the National Guard on standby. The protests aim to contest the president's perceived view of absolute rule, with allies of the president condemning the events as "hate America" rallies. International solidarity protests have also taken place in European cities like Berlin and Rome.</p>

          <h2>German Media Overrepresents Foreigners in Crime Reporting, New Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Hamburg's Macromedia University reveals a significant bias in German media, where foreign crime suspects are mentioned about three times more often than their actual share in police statistics. This distortion, which has intensified since 2015, influences public perception and aligns with a right-wing populist agenda, according to journalism professor Thomas Hestermann. Criminologists argue that crime is linked to socioeconomic factors like poverty and lack of prospects, not nationality. The study suggests that increasing diversity within editorial teams could help correct this discriminatory reporting pattern.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old document marking Margaret Thatcher's official consent to run for the Conservative Party leadership has been discovered in a cardboard box in a Somerset garage. The nomination paper, signed by Thatcher on January 27, 1975, was a pivotal first step in her ascent to becoming party leader and later Prime Minister. The letter was part of a collection belonging to former Conservative MP Sir Edward du Cann and is now set to be auctioned, where it is expected to fetch up to £100,000. Experts have described the find as a sensational and historically important discovery.</p>

          <p>As Halloween costume prices rise 11% from last year, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes from thrifted materials. For nine years, he has been collecting, washing, and redesigning second-hand garments to ensure all children can experience the joy of Halloween regardless of their financial situation. Waggoner spends over $5,000 annually on his project, hosting free giveaway events that have been busier than ever this fall. He believes his effort inspires a cycle of giving, as many families return to donate costumes for others.</p>

          <p>Following Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his Duke of York title and other honors, the brother of the late Virginia Giuffre has publicly called for King Charles to also remove his title of 'prince'. Sky Roberts stated his sister, who accused the prince of sexual abuse as part of the Jeffrey Epstein trafficking ring, would be proud of the recent developments. Andrew settled a civil case with Giuffre in 2022 but has consistently denied the allegations. The pressure on the prince intensified ahead of the release of Giuffre's posthumous memoir, which details her alleged experiences.</p>

          <p>An apartment balcony collapse in Cincinnati's Corryville neighborhood has left at least ten people injured, with one individual in critical condition. The incident occurred Friday evening at a complex near the University of Cincinnati, and some of the injured were students reportedly celebrating after an exam. The third-floor wooden balcony gave way, though the exact number of people on it at the time remains unclear. The university is offering support, including housing and grief counseling, to affected students as an investigation into the cause of the collapse gets underway.</p>

Trump acknowledged Santos was a "rogue" but stated the sentence was excessive.

          <p>Contrary to long-held stereotypes, a new study from the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more inclined than women to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial savings was a key motivating factor for men. Experts suggest that beyond economics, men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when single. This trend is also observed by relationship coaches, who report men are more likely to seek their services.</p>

          <p>Amid significant market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager suggests that income funds utilizing options-based strategies can offer a sound approach for risk-averse investors. These exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide structural downside protection and can generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is increasingly important as the Fed considers rate cuts. The strategy's appeal lies in its ability to offer reliable defense against equity drawdowns and a diversifying source of income.

          <p>To address the Fermi Paradox—the mystery of why we haven't found evidence of alien life—a NASA astrophysicist has proposed a theory of "radical mundanity." The hypothesis suggests that while other intelligent civilizations may exist in the Milky Way, they are likely only slightly more technologically advanced than humans. This means they would face similar immense challenges with interstellar travel and communication, lacking capabilities like faster-than-light travel or Dyson swarms. Consequently, they would remain undetectable and eventually abandon cosmic exploration, explaining the apparent silence in the universe.</p>

          <p>U.S. prosecutors have charged Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a 33-year-old Louisiana resident, with participating in the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. According to unsealed court documents, he allegedly armed himself and joined the National Resistance Brigades, a paramilitary group that fought alongside Hamas during the attack. He is accused of coordinating fighters and is charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Prosecutors state he later traveled to the U.S. on a fraudulent visa, where he worked in a restaurant before his arrest.</p>

          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that it has been held outside of Japan. The event required significant logistical planning to maintain cultural and religious authenticity, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. More than 40 professional wrestlers are competing over five days, bringing the highly ritualized Japanese national sport to a Western audience, complete with English commentary to explain its complex rules and traditions.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles-based group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth is providing a crucial safe space for Black men to discuss their mental health and be vulnerable. Founded by Desmond Carter, the bi-monthly meetings address the unique pressures Black men face, which contribute to a suicide rate that has risen over 25% in recent years for this demographic. The group serves as a gateway to therapy for many who are less likely to seek professional help due to societal stigma and systemic healthcare disparities. It fosters a supportive community where men can share struggles and celebrate successes without judgment.</p>

          <p>A University of North Texas graduate student's planned trip to China for an educational exchange has been complicated by state-level politics amid high U.S.-China tensions. A Texas state order discourages personal travel to China by state employees and has led to the cancellation of university-sponsored programs, forcing student Krislyn Massey to organize her trip through an independent non-profit. The situation illustrates how geopolitical friction is impacting routine academic and cultural exchanges, turning what was once a common part of international studies into a politically sensitive act that requires careful navigation.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge recommends that parents delay giving children smartphones until they can drive and restrict social media access until age 16 to promote better mental health. To successfully implement this delay, she advises parents to begin teaching responsible technology use at least six years in advance, ideally in late elementary school. Key lessons include understanding online privacy, not sharing personal information, and recognizing time as a precious resource. Twenge also stresses the importance of setting firm rules and using parental controls once devices are introduced to ensure moderation.</p>

According to Buffett, buying gold is merely a bet that someone else will be more fearful of currency in the future and pay a higher price for it. He contrasts this with his preferred investments in productive assets, like farms and businesses, which are valued based on what they can deliver over time.</p>
