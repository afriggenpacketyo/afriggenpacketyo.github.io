          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is expected to re-intensify after completing a natural structural cycle. While its direct path is forecast to steer between Bermuda and the U.S. mainland, its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and flood warnings to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The storm's growing size is also projected to generate dangerous surf, high waves, and significant beach erosion along the U.S. East Coast from Florida to New England later in the week.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan framed the recent presidential summit with Vladimir Putin as a preliminary step toward a ceasefire in Ukraine, driven by the pressure of U.S. sanctions. He emphasized Alaska's strategic military and energy importance, suggesting the state's strength serves as a message to Russia and highlighting its potential to supply natural gas to Asian allies. Sullivan also defended the reversal of previous environmental protections, arguing that resource development is vital for the state's economy, national security, and the well-being of its Indigenous populations.

          <p>West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. at the request of the federal government. This action is part of the Trump administration's initiative to address crime and homelessness in the nation's capital, which involved federalizing the local police force. The deployment has drawn mixed reactions, with some Republican governors expressing support while others, like Vermont's, have declined, viewing the enforcement of domestic law as an improper use of the Guard.</p>

          <p>For over 40 years, glaciologist Mauri Pelto has been measuring the significant decline of glaciers in Washington's North Cascade Mountains, a direct consequence of climate change. He is joined by his daughter, Jill Pelto, an artist who translates the scientific data they collect into compelling watercolor paintings that visually represent environmental shifts like temperature rise and ice loss. Their unique collaboration aims to make the stark reality of climate change more accessible and emotionally resonant, telling the story of a changing planet through both rigorous measurement and evocative art.</p>

Leaders from cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore are highlighting significant, data-supported declines in violent crime and homicides following pandemic-era peaks. They attribute this success to community-based strategies and public health approaches to violence prevention, arguing that the federal focus on militarized policing is a politically motivated misrepresentation of their achievements.</p>

          <h2>D.C. Police Union Alleged Crime Statistics Were Manipulated Weeks Before Federal Takeover</h2>

          <p>The D.C. Police Union accused the Metropolitan Police Department of altering crime statistics just weeks prior to the federal government assuming control of the force. The union chairman claimed that superior officers would direct members on scene to report serious felonies, such as carjackings or shootings, as lesser offenses to create a more favorable impression of crime trends. These allegations, which involve an ongoing investigation into a police commander, have fueled the administration's justification for the federal intervention and its assertion that official city data is unreliable.</p>

          <p>The federalization of police in Washington D.C. has prompted mayors of other Democratic-run cities to prepare for the possibility of similar actions against them. City leaders from Seattle, Minneapolis, and elsewhere are coordinating with police chiefs and governors and developing legal strategies to counter what they see as a potential illegal usurpation of local authority. While not opposed to federal partnerships on crime, they view the administration's recent moves as politically motivated chaos-creation rather than a genuine effort to improve public safety, especially as many cities report declining crime rates.</p>

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa program, leaving approximately 300 Russian and Belarusian dissidents, including critics of the war in Ukraine, in limbo. Many of these individuals had already received preliminary approval from the German Foreign Office, but the Interior Ministry has halted the final issuance of visas, citing a policy shift in the new government's coalition agreement. This decision leaves activists and journalists who have fled persecution at risk in former Soviet countries, where they face the threat of abduction or extradition back to Russia.</p>

          <h2>German Government Divided on Reinstating Compulsory Military Service</h2>

          <p>Germany's coalition government is split over how to increase the size of its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO targets. The center-left SPD, led by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, has proposed a bill to make voluntary service more attractive. However, partners in the center-right CDU/CSU alliance are critical, arguing that relying on volunteers is insufficient given the current security situation and are pushing for a faster return to some form of compulsory service. The debate highlights a significant disagreement on national security policy within the ruling coalition.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave-like space behind a powerful waterfall in California's Kern River area. The man, an experienced rappeller, was pushed off his lines by the extreme water hydraulics at the Seven Teacups waterfalls and became stranded. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him behind the cascade of water. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew then performed a difficult hoist to lift him to safety, concluding what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's decision to end race-based affirmative action, the Trump administration is now scrutinizing university admissions data for "racial proxies." Richard Kahlenberg, an expert who testified against race-based preferences, advocates for a class-based affirmative action system instead, arguing it would create both racial and economic diversity. He expresses concern that the administration may oppose any policy that results in racial diversity, even if achieved through legal, economic-based means, which he believes would be a political mistake and inconsistent with the court's ruling.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster has implemented a series of emotional team meetings during training camp to help bond a roster with many new players and coaches. In these "brotherhood meetings," coaches and players shared personal stories and vulnerabilities, a process that reportedly brought many to tears. The goal of the exercise was to build trust and connection within the team by encouraging players to let their guards down. The initiative is part of the new coach's effort to forge a strong collective mindset for the upcoming season, centered on the motto "We over me."</p>

          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats in the eleven days since the UK and France implemented a new "one in, one out" agreement. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one person with a strong asylum case. However, with removals to France not yet underway, the crossings have continued, bringing the total for the year to around 28,000. The government maintains its plan will break the business model of smuggling gangs, while critics question the deal's deterrent effect.</p>
