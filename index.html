            <p>Devastating attacks on camps near El-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region, housing hundreds of thousands displaced by civil war, have resulted in over 100 civilian deaths, including children and aid workers, with the UN and US condemning the violence attributed to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Residents describe dire conditions and blocked escape routes, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis as the war between the RSF and the army enters its second year. The attacks, which included arson, have destroyed structures and health infrastructure within the camps, hindering access to critical medical services for displaced people. The situation is described as catastrophic with death being everywhere.</p>

            <p>The U.S. State Department is reviewing inquiries from South African Afrikaners interested in refugee resettlement in the United States, following President Trump's concerns about their treatment. The Afrikaner Orania Movement seeks U.S. support for autonomy within South Africa, not refugee status, aiming to protect Afrikaner culture and safety. Trump's administration has taken steps to hold the South African government accountable for Afrikaner rights violations and prioritize humanitarian relief for victims of racial discrimination. This has sparked debate, with the South African government criticizing groups appealing to Washington.</p>

            <p>Chinese authorities are urging increased financial support for the sports industry, encouraging investment in facilities for athletes and spectators to boost the economy. New guidelines from the central bank and other regulatory bodies call for lenders and local governments to invest in sports-related infrastructure and support business models integrating sports with culture, tourism, and healthcare. The initiative aims to support sports event organizers, particularly for international events, through loans, insurance, and currency exchange services. Support will also be given for corporate bonds and stock market listings for sports industry firms.</p>

            <p>Following the government's takeover of the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds declined to confirm whether the blast furnaces can continue running due to raw material supply concerns. Emergency legislation was enacted to prevent the plant's owners from shutting down the furnaces, but Reynolds would not comment on the commercial aspects of supply, emphasizing that the takeover provides an opportunity to secure needed coal. The government intervened after the company rejected a support offer and is now seeking a buyer for British Steel, with Reynolds stating he would not sell to another Chinese company due to sector sensitivities.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the rise of "end times fascism," characterized by a belief in impending societal collapse and the need for fortressed escape pods for the elite, aligning with both corporate city-state visions and mass-market bunker nations. This ideology, embraced by figures like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, combines with Christian fundamentalist interpretations of the Rapture, creating a dangerous mix of supremacy, survivalism, and a lack of vision for a hopeful future. The author argues that this trend is genocidal at its core and treasonous to the wonder and beauty of the world, calling for a movement rooted in commitment to one another and the planet to combat these forces.</p>

            <p>Michigan autoworkers and small business owners are expressing mixed reactions to President Trump's tariffs, with some fearing that the measures could lead to higher prices and economic hardship for middle-income families. While some supporters believe tariffs could help revive American industry, others worry about the potential for job losses and increased costs for everyday goods. Democrats in Michigan are calibrating their messaging, with some supporting tariffs as a tool to level the playing field with countries like China, but emphasizing the need for a well-planned approach to avoid economic disruption. The situation is causing uncertainty among businesses and workers in the region.</p>

            <p>The outgoing top vaccine official at the FDA, Dr. Peter Marks, criticized U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for offering "false hope" to families by claiming to have found the cause of autism by September, emphasizing the complexity of autism research. Marks, who resigned over Kennedy's anti-vaccination misinformation, refuted claims linking vaccines to autism, citing extensive studies. This follows a measles outbreak and deaths in a community skeptical of vaccines, which Marks blames on Kennedy's rhetoric.

            <p>The Trump administration is considering pathways to deport American citizens, raising serious concerns about due process and the rule of law. This follows a pattern of the administration largely dispensing with due process rights in deporting immigrants, who are now being targeted for their protected speech. The administration has already deported hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to a mega-prison in El Salvador, defying judges’ orders, and has targeted immigrants for opposing Israel's actions in Gaza.

This decision avoids a potential price surge for iPhones in American Apple stores, which could have reached nearly $2,000. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, may play a key role in brokering peace in the US-China trade war due to his deep connection between the two economies.

            <p>Los Angeles, a city forged by global commerce, is facing uncertainty as President Trump's trade policies threaten to disrupt its economy and culture. The region, with a large foreign-born population and the busiest port complex in the Western Hemisphere, relies heavily on international trade. Businesses, from restaurants to retailers, are concerned about the potential impact of tariffs on their profit margins and supply chains. The city's reliance on imports and its interconnectedness with communities across the globe make it particularly vulnerable to the effects of a trade war.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, which benefited from the initial US-China trade war, now faces uncertainty due to Trump's new tariff policies, including a 46% tax on imports from the country. While a temporary stay on the duties has been announced, the potential impact on Vietnam's manufacturing sector and foreign investment remains a concern. The Vietnamese government is exploring measures to mitigate the effects, such as cutting tariffs on American imports and offering incentives for local factories. The situation highlights the vulnerability of Vietnam's export-driven economy to shifts in global trade policy.</p>

            <p>Cheap clothes from China are nearly certain to face a steep price hike soon – prompting concern among fast fashion retailers and potentially pushing consumers to look for other alternatives. As part of a package of global tariff policies announced on “liberation day” last week, Donald Trump signed an executive order that ended a duty-free exemption for low-priced goods to enter the US from China and Hong Kong. The de-minimis rule, packages under $800 do not qualify for any taxes or tariffs on the goods and are inspected minimally at the border. Some companies have already begun diversifying their production outside of China. Others have evolved their business model to begin stocking more inventory in the US as well as moving some production here and then fulfilling orders domestically.</p>

            <p>California farmers are bracing for economic consequences as President Trump's tariffs disrupt international trade, with retaliatory tariffs from China and Canada threatening key export markets. Growers of almonds, pistachios, and other crops are concerned about potential losses and increased costs for imported farm equipment. While the White House is considering a relief plan, farmers are hoping for a quick resolution to the trade conflict. The uncertainty is adding to existing challenges such as labor shortages and climate change, pushing some farmers to the brink.</p>

            <p>General Motors is halting production of BrightDrop electric delivery vans at its CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario, leading to temporary layoffs starting April 14. Production will be stalled for three weeks, followed by a limited two-week run in May, and then a 20-week closure for retooling. The plant will operate on a single shift when production resumes in October, impacting 450 workers. This adjustment is related to responding to market demand and rebalancing inventory. GM remains committed to the future of BrightDrop and the CAMI plant and will support employees through the transition.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin will have a retrial of her defamation case against *The New York Times* that will begin Monday. Palin has the rare opportunity to retry her defamation case against the Times even though she lost it twice in a 24-hour period in early 2022. Jury selection is slated to begin Monday in federal court in Manhattan, after a judge's misstep in the initial suit opened the door to a retrial. The case was sparked by a 2017 Times editorial that, Palin's attorneys argued, had accused her of inciting murder six years earlier in the shooting in Tucson, Ariz. that killed six people and gravely wounded then-Rep. Gabby Giffords.</p>

            <p>Stewart Lee draws parallels between Trump's policies and the themes in Sam Peckinpah's film *Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid*, suggesting that Trump's administration is working for modern-day cattle barons who prioritize profit over people. He argues that everything is nakedly transactional, where once geopolitical powerplays were disguised as altruism. The author reflects on how world events have caught up with and overtaken his stand-up show, which now seems prescient rather than pessimistic. The author suggests we are doomed and feels like he's knocking on heaven's door.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Legal experts are debating whether the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act could disproportionately affect married women's voting rights, particularly those who have changed their last names. The bill's requirement to prove U.S. citizenship with documents like birth certificates, which may not match current names, could create hurdles for millions of women. While states can accept secondary documents like marriage certificates, obtaining these may pose challenges for some. Experts also worry that the bill's ambiguity could lead to uneven enforcement across states, potentially disenfranchising voters.</p>
