          <p>New Jersey Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver has been indicted on three federal charges of assaulting law enforcement officers during a clash outside a Newark ICE detention center. The charges stem from an incident in May when McIver and other members of Congress attempted to oversee the detention center, leading to a confrontation between protesters and law enforcement. McIver denies the charges, claiming they are a politically motivated attempt to intimidate her, and plans to plead not guilty. U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a close ally of Trump, is prosecuting the case, adding a layer of political tension to the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., argues his case is a critical test of due process rights. Abrego Garcia faces human smuggling charges, which his lawyer claims are politically motivated by the Trump administration. The lawyer emphasizes that the case is not just about immigration but about upholding constitutional protections for everyone. Democratic lawmakers who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador warned of the erosion of democratic institutions, drawing parallels to the Salvadoran government.</p>

          <p>A new law in Georgia, the Survivor Justice Act, may allow domestic violence survivors to seek reduced sentences if they can prove abuse led them to commit crimes. Latoya Dickens, convicted of felony murder after a fight with her abusive husband, could potentially have her sentence reduced under this law. The law aims to consider the full context of abuse that may have influenced a defendant's actions. The legislation is not a 'get out of jail free card,' but it provides an opportunity for a fair review of cases where abuse played a significant role.</p>

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection for playtime in schools to combat the decline in outdoor play among children. The Raising the Nation Play Commission warns that children are increasingly confined indoors with digital devices due to traffic, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, including updated planning policies and government guidance to protect playtime in schools. Some councils have begun removing these signs to encourage children to exercise more and engage in outdoor activities.</p>
