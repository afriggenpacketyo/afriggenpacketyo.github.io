          <p>The Minnesota Twins have fired manager Rocco Baldelli after seven seasons, despite his three American League Central titles and a 2023 postseason win that broke the team's long playoff losing streak. The Twins' president, Derek Falvey, praised Baldelli's integrity and commitment, but the team's disappointing 70-92 finish and significant player trades led to the decision. Attendance also declined, and the team faced ownership challenges, including a reversed course on a potential sale, which contributed to the change in leadership. Baldelli concluded his tenure with a 527-505 record, marking the end of an era for the Twins. </p>

          <p>President Trump, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, unveiled a 20-point peace plan for Gaza, optimistically calling it a step towards “eternal peace” in the Middle East. The plan includes Hamas releasing hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a staged Israeli withdrawal, and a reformed Palestinian Authority governing Gaza. A temporary government of qualified Palestinians and international experts would be overseen by a “Board of Peace” chaired by Trump and including Tony Blair. However, fundamental disagreements remain, and the plan's success hinges on the willingness of both Hamas and Israel to compromise. </p>

          <p>YouTube will pay $24.5 million to President Trump to settle a 2021 lawsuit alleging censorship following the suspension of his account after the January 6th Capitol attack. Google, YouTube's parent company, will dedicate $22 million of the settlement towards the construction of a $200 million Mar-a-Lago-style ballroom in the White House, with the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall financing the renovations. The settlement follows similar payouts from Meta and X, formerly Twitter, despite free speech experts questioning the legal basis of the suits. The payout comes after YouTube reinstated accounts banned for spreading COVID-19 and election misinformation. </p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that the current AI boom differs significantly from the dotcom bubble of 2000, citing the financial strength and diverse reputations of today's tech giants. He highlights that companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are capable of absorbing bad investments, unlike the debt-ridden dotcom companies of the past. Cramer acknowledges concerns about Oracle's data center plans, but remains optimistic about the overall success of tech megacaps in the AI space. Despite his confidence, he advises investors to remain skeptical and scrutinize stock moves in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has introduced new parental controls for ChatGPT to help protect young users, giving parents the ability to link their accounts to their teenagers' accounts. These controls allow parents to customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience, restricting certain types of content, including graphic content and violent role-play. Parents can also opt to receive notifications if their child exhibits potential signs of self-harm while using ChatGPT. The company has also introduced measures to ensure that chatbot users identified as being under 18 are automatically directed to a version that is governed by age-appropriate content rules. </p>

          <p>J.K. Rowling has publicly criticized Emma Watson for her support of transgender rights, asserting that Watson's views are naive due to her privileged background.

          <p>Charlie Javice, founder of the startup Frank, was sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase by inflating the number of customers her company had. Javice was found guilty on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy after JPMorgan acquired Frank for $175 million in 2021. The bank later discovered that Frank had significantly fewer real customers than Javice had claimed, prompting her arrest in 2023. In addition to her prison sentence, Javice was ordered to pay $22.36 million in forfeiture and $287 million in restitution to JPMorgan. </p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has signed a decree granting him additional security powers in case of a military incursion into the country. The decree would allow Maduro to mobilize armed forces throughout the country and give the military authority over public services and the oil industry. The measure comes as the U.S. has deployed a fleet of warships in the Caribbean, which Washington says is to combat drug trafficking through the region. Maduro's government alleges that the U.S. is plotting to remove him from power. </p>
