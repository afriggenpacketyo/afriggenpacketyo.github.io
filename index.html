          <p>A 66-year-old woman has been charged with the murder of Jennifer Abbott, also known as Sarah Steinberg, who was found fatally stabbed in her Camden home. Abbott was discovered by her niece and neighbors with tape across her mouth. Detectives believe the murder may be linked to a missing diamond-encrusted Rolex watch from the victim's residence. Nancy Pexton of Westminster is scheduled to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court, according to the Metropolitan Police.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed two military planes with red paint, according to footage posted online by Palestine Action. The activists claimed they were able to "evade security" and put the supply planes "out of service," using repurposed fire extinguishers and crowbars to cause damage. The Ministry of Defence strongly condemned the "vandalism of Royal Air Force assets" and is working with the police on the investigation.

          <p>US singer Chris Brown has pleaded not guilty to a charge stemming from an alleged bottle attack at a London nightclub two years ago. The 36-year-old is accused of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to music producer Abraham Diaw during an incident that prosecutors have described as "unprovoked". Brown also faces charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and having an offensive weapon. The judge adjourned arraignment on those two counts, meaning Brown did not enter a plea. He was arrested in Salford last month and later released after paying a Â£5m security fee.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, a window for diplomacy has emerged, with European diplomats scheduled to meet with Iranâ€™s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva. While there are no concrete signs that the Iranian regime is any more likely to cut a deal now than they were at the beginning of the week, administration officials are pitching the presidentâ€™s two-week timeline as a chance to let diplomacy play out. Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Iranâ€™s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi have been in communication during recent days, but as of now, there are no plans for the two to meet, another official said. European diplomats hope to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict, which has involved Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites and retaliatory actions from Tehran.</p>

          <p>A recent United Nations report indicates that approximately 123 million people worldwide have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to conflict, persecution, or other significant threats. The report tracks refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons, revealing that the number of displaced individuals has risen significantly since 2015. Most displaced people are internally displaced, with Africa and the Middle East hosting the largest numbers. The report also highlights the increasing gap between asylum requests and decisions, as well as the concerning trend of displaced people returning to unsafe countries.</p>

          <p>The sale of the Los Angeles Lakers for a record $10 billion signifies that sports teams have become too valuable for individual billionaires to control. The shift in majority ownership from the Buss family to an investment group led by Mark Walter highlights the trend of teams being owned by consortiums of deep-pocketed investors and institutions. While the decline of cable poses a threat, the Lakers' strong connection to Los Angeles ensures continued growth. The new ownership is expected to benefit the team by attracting more stars, though the shift raises questions about accountability for teams without the Lakers' advantages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology challenges the long-held theory that birds sing at dawn because sound travels farther and more clearly at that time. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little evidence to support the "acoustic transmission hypothesis." The study suggests that early morning vocal activity is more related to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about food sources. While the study doesn't definitively identify one reason for the dawn chorus, it provides valuable insights into the complex factors influencing bird behavior.</p>

          <p>MPs are set to decide on the future of a bill that could legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, with a final stage vote scheduled in the House of Commons. In Scotland, a separate assisted dying bill has received initial backing and is under further consideration. The proposed law in England and Wales, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults to end their lives under specific conditions, including mental capacity and a six-month life expectancy. The Isle of Man passed its Assisted Dying Bill in March 2025, and Jersey is also considering similar legislation.</p>
