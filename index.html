          <p>United Airlines experienced a nationwide ground stop for its mainline flights due to a failure in its weight and balance computer system. The airline confirmed the issue was not a cyberattack and that flights already airborne would continue to their destinations. The halt, which did not affect United Express flights, was requested at major hubs like Newark, Chicago, and San Francisco, leading to expected widespread delays as the company worked to resolve the technology problem.</p>

Kennedy stated that HHS determined the technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a claim heavily criticized by numerous infectious disease experts and the former surgeon general. Critics argue the decision undermines a life-saving technology with broad applications for diseases like cancer and flu, potentially ceding technological advantages to other nations.</p>

In his first press conference, Son candidly admitted that LAFC was not his initial choice, but a conversation with the club's general manager, John Thorrington, changed his mind and heart. His arrival is seen as a significant cultural moment for Los Angeles, which has a large Korean-American population, and is expected to provide a major boost to the team both on the field and in its community engagement.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the charity Rethink Mental Illness reveals a stark disparity in England's healthcare system, with patients waiting for mental health treatment facing significantly longer delays than those needing physical care. The article highlights the story of a young woman with complex PTSD who has only seen a psychiatrist once in ten years despite multiple crises. Experts warn that these long waits worsen patient outcomes and increase long-term costs, while a new community-based mental health hub in East London is presented as a potential model for more effective, accessible care.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a plan to implement a 100% tariff on all imported computer chips and semiconductors, a move likely to increase costs for a wide range of consumer electronics and goods. The tariff would not apply to companies that manufacture their chips within the United States, an approach designed to incentivize domestic production. This policy represents a significant shift from previous strategies, such as the CHIPS Act, by using punitive measures rather than financial subsidies to bolster the American semiconductor industry.

          <p>The New Zealand air force successfully completed a challenging medical evacuation of three American staff members from McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The nearly 20-hour mission was conducted in extreme cold and total darkness, conditions that make mid-winter flights to the continent exceptionally hazardous. One individual required urgent care, while the other two were transported as a precaution, with a medical team providing in-flight support during the journey back to Christchurch. U.S. officials praised the "flawless" operation and the world-class skill of their New Zealand partners.</p>

This increased flexibility from universities is attributed to uncertainty around international student enrollment, making domestic undergraduates a more stable and financially reliable option for institutions.

          <p>The father of Lee Claydon, the 45-year-old man who died after falling from an upper tier at an Oasis concert at Wembley Stadium, has described his son as a hardworking family man. Clive Claydon said his son, a lifelong fan of the band, attended the show with his brother and was not a drug user, calling the incident a tragic accident. He also echoed concerns from other attendees about safety conditions at the venue, questioning the adequacy of the barriers and noting that slippery, beer-soaked floors may have been a factor in the fall.</p>

          <h2>New Archaeological Evidence Suggests Pompeii Was Re-inhabited After Vesuvius Eruption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 18:39:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that survivors of the Mount Vesuvius eruption in AD 79 returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. Researchers believe some residents who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, established a precarious settlement within the devastated city. This informal occupation, which may have lasted until the 5th century, saw people living in the upper floors of buried homes while using lower levels as cellars. The findings challenge the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating tech and trade tensions, China is utilizing its control over the global supply of rare earths as a strategic counter to U.S. policies like chip export bans. These critical minerals are essential for a vast range of technologies, from consumer electronics to advanced defense systems, and the U.S. is heavily reliant on China for its supply. By imposing export controls on certain rare earth elements, Beijing is employing a tactic similar to Washington's, aiming to leverage its unique position in the supply chain to regain ground in the ongoing geopolitical rivalry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers confirmed it altered the water outflow from a lake in Ohio to raise the level of a downstream river ahead of a boating trip for Vice President JD Vance and his family. The request was officially made by the Secret Service to "support safe navigation" for the security detail on the Little Miami River in early August. The action has drawn criticism regarding the use of public resources for a private recreational activity, with ethics experts calling it an apparent special treatment not available to the general public.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: President Trump Accuses Others of Rigging While Engaging in Such Practices Himself</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump consistently projects his own actions onto his political enemies, particularly regarding the concept of "rigging." The author contends that while Trump decries rigged elections, he is actively attempting to influence the 2026 midterms by pressuring states to re-gerrymander congressional districts. The piece further claims this pattern extends to governance, citing the firing of the BLS commissioner and attempts to impose tariffs as examples of rigging systems to his benefit. The author concludes that Trump's most significant rigging is his effort to reshape political maps.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol is scheduled to become the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball regular-season game during a weekend series between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves. Pawol, a former collegiate softball player, began umpiring in the minor leagues in 2016 after attending MLB's developmental umpire camps. Baseball Commissioner Robert D. Manfred, Jr. praised her historic accomplishment as a reflection of her hard work and dedication. The milestone marks the breaking of a significant gender barrier in one of America's major professional sports.</p>
