          <h2>Tesla's Stock Plummets Amid Musk's Feud with Trump and Company Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 11:00:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is facing significant challenges, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's public spat with President Trump over policy disagreements that escalated into a social media battle. This conflict led to a 14% drop in Tesla's shares, wiping out $152 billion in value and causing Musk's net worth to plunge by $34 billion. The fallout could severely impact Tesla's future regulations, investigations, and government support, particularly regarding tariff exemptions for Chinese-made equipment. Tesla was already underperforming due to increased competition from Chinese EV makers, consumer backlash to Musk's political activities, and quality issues with recalls, and now faces further uncertainty as the board is called to action amidst Musk's behavior. The stock's 4% rebound suggests some investors view this as a buying opportunity, while others remain skeptical about Tesla's fundamentals and future prospects. Optimism is tempered by the potential for continued brand damage. </p>

          <p>Following the removal of four hydroelectric dams, the Klamath River is experiencing a rebirth, offering new recreational opportunities and ecological restoration. The dam removal, a result of decades-long campaigns by Yurok, Karuk, and Klamath tribes, marks the end of a century of submersion and the beginning of a new chapter for the river. As the river finds its natural course, stakeholders are working to facilitate recreation while protecting ecologically and culturally sensitive areas. The Shasta Indian Nation, significantly impacted by the dam construction, will regain over 2,800 acres of ancestral lands, and the public now has access to new recreation sites, but challenges remain in infrastructure and balancing public use with tribal reconnection, ultimately contributing to a more hopeful outlook. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a House oversight DOGE subcommittee hearing, Democratic Representative Robert Garcia criticized Power the Future CEO Dan Turner for a past tweet calling Social Security a "government-sponsored Ponzi scheme." Turner defended his statement, arguing that Social Security's structure fits the Ponzi scheme definition, requiring new contributors to fund existing beneficiaries, a system he believes is unsustainable. Turner suggested Garcia's staff should focus on saving Social Security rather than scrutinizing his social media, highlighting his father's low returns from the program. James Agresti, president of Just Facts, supported Turner's view, explaining that Social Security operates by transferring current taxes to current beneficiaries rather than saving individual contributions, adding to the ongoing debate about the program's future and potential reforms. The disagreement underscores the differing viewpoints on Social Security's viability. </p>

          <p>Slate Auto, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is developing affordable, customizable EVs in a Detroit-area facility, with plans to begin deliveries by the end of next year. The company is producing two-seat, two-door electric pickup trucks that can be converted into SUVs with a focus on simplified manufacturing and lower costs. With over 100,000 reservations, Slate is conducting a Series C financing round after raising $700 million in earlier funding rounds. Slate aims to offer a vehicle with a starting price under $20,000, utilizing injected-molded composite exteriors and optional features for personalization, however the company faces challenges in scaling up production, managing customization complexity, and navigating regulatory uncertainties. Despite these hurdles, the company is striving to deliver an affordable EV option. </p>

The recovery operation took place in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, and the IDF stated the mission was launched after receiving information from a captured terrorist. Nattapong, a 35-year-old agricultural laborer, was kidnapped during the Hamas-led attack in October 2023 and was the father of a young son.

          <p>The NHS app in England will become the primary communication method for millions more patients, saving the health service Â£200 million over three years. The Â£50 million investment will allow for more test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders to be sent directly to smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. Patients without app access will receive text messages followed by letters, and the NHS app is projected to send 270 million messages this financial year. This move aims to provide patients with better access to manage their healthcare and reduce missed appointments, but will need to ensure that more vulnerable populations can still access these communications. </p>

          <p>The Russia-backed Wagner Group is departing Mali after more than three years fighting Islamic extremists, but Russia's mercenary presence will continue through the Africa Corps. The Africa Corps, under the Russian defense ministry's command, will remain in Mali, focusing on training and equipment provision rather than direct combat. This transition follows Wagner's struggle to curb violence and accusations of targeting civilians, with the UN urging investigations into alleged summary executions. The shift suggests a change in Russia's strategy in Mali, from direct fighting to a lighter footprint focused on training and support, but the impact on regional stability remains uncertain. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decade-long study interviewing parents of successful children reveals five key strategies: fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, cultivating a love for knowledge, and motivating with love rather than being a "coach." The study emphasizes the importance of a positive outlook, personalized encouragement based on a child's interests, and understanding that learning extends beyond formal education. It also highlights the value of curiosity and exploration, and the power of love and support over strict coaching. These insights provide a holistic approach to parenting. </p>
