          <p>China has achieved a significant naval aviation milestone with the successful catapult launch of its J-35 stealth fighter jet from the Fujian aircraft carrier. This event marks the J-35 as the world's second carrier-based stealth fighter, after the F-35 series, and demonstrates the Fujian's advanced electromagnetic catapult and recovery capabilities. The operation represents a substantial leap in the power and modernization of China's naval air wings. This development underscores China's growing military prowess and its commitment to expanding its carrier-based air power.</p>

          <p>Germany's pursuit of leadership in autonomous driving technology is encountering substantial challenges despite ongoing tests and authorized Level 4 autonomy. Projects, such as the NeMo Paderborn consortium's "swarm" of lightweight autonomous cabs, aim for energy-efficient urban and rural mobility solutions. However, high car ownership, strong taxi lobbies, and a well-developed public transit system in Germany limit market entry for new mobility solutions. Progress is slow due to manufacturers' caution regarding immature systems, and a lack of consistent government funding beyond pilot projects hinders a nationwide rollout.</p>

This decision follows the publication of an email from 2011 where she referred to convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The email, sent after she had publicly distanced herself from Epstein, appeared to apologize for her public rejection. A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was intended to counter Epstein's threat to sue her for defamation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2 billion privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves moving the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular use and expanding terminals, projected to increase annual flights significantly by the late 2030s. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves anticipates thousands of jobs and billions in investment, the plan faces strong opposition from environmental groups, who warn of increased air pollution, noise, and climate emissions. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate concerns.</p>

          <p>A recent call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, described as "pragmatic, positive, and constructive" by Chinese state media, indicates a potential shift in US-China relations. Despite ongoing tensions and economic pressures, both nations appear to be moving towards accommodation rather than escalation. This emerging reality reflects a pragmatic acceptance of mutual dependence, particularly in economically asymmetric sectors like hi-tech and supply chains. The development suggests a framework of cautious competition, crucial for global stability, acknowledging that all-out conflict would be mutually devastating.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has unveiled a policy to abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for migrants, replacing it with five-year visas requiring reapplication and stricter criteria, including higher salary thresholds and English proficiency. The party aims to address the "Boriswave" of 3.8 million migrants who entered the UK post-Brexit, arguing the UK should not be the "world's food bank." While EU nationals with settled status are exempt, Reform claims the changes would lead to hundreds of thousands losing status and voluntarily leaving, saving over £234 billion.

She argues that while self-help promises personal optimization, an excessive focus on individual betterment and productivity can lead to isolation. Lamb-Shapiro highlights a shift away from community engagement, suggesting that seeking help from others strengthens relationships and provides more holistic benefits than solely relying on self-improvement methods. Despite her initial skepticism, she acknowledges redeeming qualities in self-help but cautions against its potential to erode communal bonds.</p>

          <h2>Research Challenges Myth of Two-Parent Families as Solution to Black Racial Inequality</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the long-held belief that promoting two-parent families will resolve racial inequality for Black youth. Her research reveals that Black children in two-parent households still face significant disadvantages compared to their white counterparts, performing only as well as white children from single-parent families. Cross argues that the singular focus on family structure, often ignoring structural racism, diverts resources from more effective interventions like direct cash assistance or childcare subsidies. The article highlights the scarcity of research on two-parent Black families, despite their growing numbers.</p>

          <p>An inquest has revealed that former England rugby international Tom Voyce was nearly three times over the drink-drive limit when his vehicle was swept into a river during a storm. The 43-year-old was reported missing after a night out with a group following a shoot. While his blood alcohol levels were significantly high and would have impaired his judgment, the pathologist stated this was not a causal factor in his death. Voyce, who retired from rugby in 2013, had relocated to Northumberland and started his own business.</p>

Many continue to favor direct investments in private companies, but there's a notable retreat from early-stage startup and seed funding. Instead, they are increasingly selective, focusing on growth-stage investments and opportunistic plays in secondary sales as institutional investors exit. This shift reflects a bullish outlook on specific long-term themes like AI and infrastructure, rather than broad asset classes, allowing them to leverage reliable cash flow from operating businesses.

          <p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, while both managed baskets of assets, possess key differences crucial for investors. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, offering real-time pricing, whereas mutual fund transactions are priced at day's end. Critically, ETFs are generally more tax-efficient due to "in-kind" transactions that avoid capital gains distributions, a common issue for mutual funds in taxable accounts. ETFs also tend to have lower expense ratios. However, mutual funds offer a broader selection and are more commonly available in 401(k) plans, and some brokerages may not support automated ETF contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential Supreme Court ruling allowing President Trump to remove a Federal Reserve governor could grant him unprecedented power over the central bank. Beyond setting interest rates, the Fed controls money supply, access to the financial system, and can print and spend money without congressional approval during "unusual circumstances." Legal experts warn this could enable Trump to use the Fed's lending authority as a "bottomless slush fund" to reward allies or weaponize its regulatory power to "debank" perceived enemies. Such unchecked authority could profoundly impact the economy and civil liberties, with few legal or market checks. (not investment advice)</p>

Walnuts are highlighted for their rich content of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and potent antioxidants that combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. Furthermore, walnuts support heart health, which is closely linked to brain health, by improving lipid profiles. Alongside walnut consumption, experts advise following the MIND diet, staying physically active, ensuring quality sleep, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities to maintain cognitive health.</p>
