          <p>The granddaughter of a 79-year-old victim from the recent Air India crash in Ahmedabad has expressed that she cannot find peace until the root cause is identified and accountability is established. She described the preliminary report, which found that engine fuel was cut off post-takeoff, as "heartbreaking" and incomplete. Relatives of other victims, including 53 UK nationals, have echoed the call for more information, such as the release of cockpit audio recordings. The final investigation report is expected in about 12 months, as families grapple with their loss and frustration.</p>

          <p>Germany has progressed to the next round of Euro 2025, but its advancement was overshadowed by a significant defensive collapse in a 4-1 loss to Sweden. After an early lead, the German team exhibited panic and disorganization, leading to three Swedish goals in quick succession, including a penalty after a red card. The article highlights personnel issues, including inexperienced defenders and the absence of key players, as contributing to the team's vulnerability. Coach Christian Wück now faces major decisions to address these defensive frailties before the round of 16 match.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" provides a deeply sourced analysis of the election that returned Donald Trump to power. The authors argue that Trump's victory was not inevitable but resulted from a series of "what-ifs," including the Democrats' handling of Joe Biden's candidacy and the Republican failure to effectively challenge Trump. The book chronicles how Trump capitalized on public frustration with democratic institutions, turning his legal battles into a source of strength. It also details the internal divisions and miscalculations within the Democratic campaign.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to the United States, has indicated that the 10% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on most goods imported from the UK is likely "here to stay." While suggesting the universal tariff is unlikely to be removed, he noted there could be scope for negotiations in specific sectors. The statement comes amid ongoing confusion over separate tariffs on British steel. This development is part of a broader trade strategy from Washington, which recently announced a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his longtime rival, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. The statement, made on social media, comes amid an ongoing public feud and O'Donnell's vocal criticism of his administration. Legal experts have noted that the president has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling. This move represents the latest instance of the president threatening to use his power against political opponents.</p>

Analyst Marco Chan noted a prior service bulletin from the engine manufacturer about a flawed chip that could cause signal loss to the fuel system. This theory provides a potential explanation for how the switches, which are difficult to move accidentally, could have been activated during flight.</p>

          <p>A historic Avro Lancaster bomber, one of only two still airworthy in the world, sent an emergency alert after experiencing an engine problem during a families day event in Lincolnshire. The crew of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) aircraft diagnosed unusual engine behavior and safely returned to its base at RAF Coningsby as a precaution. Black smoke was seen coming from one of the plane's four engines, but no crew members were injured. An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the issue and its potential impact on future appearances.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to protect players from extreme heat. This decision follows concerns about player welfare raised during the recent Club World Cup in the US, where one player described the 35C conditions as "very dangerous." The tournament, co-hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico, has four indoor venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver. Infantino acknowledged heat is a significant issue and that utilizing these covered stadiums more frequently is a necessary measure.</p>

          <p>A rumored family vacation to Disneyland by Vice President JD Vance sparked a large protest outside the resort in Anaheim on Friday. The protest was fueled by opposition to the Trump administration's immigration policies, which have led to increased ICE raids in nearby communities. Local officials, including Orange County Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento, criticized the administration's policies while acknowledging the visit. While the VP's office did not confirm the trip's purpose, a motorcade was seen entering the park, and unconfirmed video later appeared to show Vance with his children inside Disneyland.</p>

          <p>The Beer Hunter Sports Bar & Grill in La Quinta, California, has had its liquor license revoked after an investigation found it served alcohol to two intoxicated minors. One of the minors was later involved in a car accident that resulted in "great bodily injury." The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control determined that bartenders served the minors without checking identification in January 2024. The popular sports bar, which had operated for three decades, abruptly shut down in September 2024, months after the incident that triggered the state's investigation into its practices.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's recent announcements of new tariffs on major trading partners like the EU, Mexico, and Canada, the U.S. stock market has remained near record highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating style and are not panicking as they did during previous trade disputes. The market's resilience is also attributed to other administration policies, such as deregulation and a hands-off approach to artificial intelligence development, which are seen as drivers of corporate earnings and economic growth, offsetting the concerns about trade friction.

          <p>The third Test between England and India at Lord's is hanging in the balance after a dramatic conclusion to the third day. England's bowlers took India's last four wickets for just 11 runs, dismissing the tourists for 387 and leveling the first-innings scores. In a tense final few minutes, England's openers navigated one over to close on 2-0, with tempers flaring between the sides over time-wasting tactics. The day was a grueling battle, highlighted by key performances from India's KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja, and a crucial run-out by England captain Ben Stokes.</p>

Palermo, who was wanted under an Interpol red notice, is accused of overseeing massive cocaine shipments from Latin America to Europe. The 'ndrangheta is one of Italy's most influential criminal organizations, and this arrest marks a significant blow to its international drug trafficking operations, which have expanded globally in recent years.</p>

          <p>The Wahlburgers restaurant chain has closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO, Randy Sharpe, has clarified the context behind the numbers. Many of the closures were small food court kiosks located within Hy-Vee grocery stores, following the end of a franchise agreement, and were not full-service restaurants. Sharpe stated that the move is part of a strategy to focus on "quality, not quantity" and ensure all locations represent the brand's standards. The chain is also moving forward with a menu update, introducing new limited-time items to drive customer interest.</p>

The reporter had asked what he would say to families who felt that earlier warnings could have saved lives. Trump dismissed the question, stating that everyone involved did an "incredible job" under the circumstances of a "one in a thousand years" event. He asserted that it was easy to criticize in hindsight and that the response had been heroic, a reaction that has since drawn significant criticism online.</p>

          <p>Two fathers are seeking a judicial review of UK government guidance on smartphones in schools, arguing for a complete ban to protect children. They have sent a legal letter to the Education Secretary, claiming the current policy, which lets headteachers decide, is unlawful and unsafe. The campaigners cite safeguarding incidents involving cyberbullying, the sharing of indecent images, and exposure to harmful content as reasons for their legal challenge. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>
