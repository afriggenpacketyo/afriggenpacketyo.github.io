          <p>Chef and television host Matt Tebbutt is set to replace Gregg Wallace as a judge on the upcoming series of 'MasterChef: The Professionals.' Tebbutt will join Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti on the popular BBC cooking competition. The change follows Wallace's dismissal after an inquiry upheld numerous allegations regarding his behavior on the program, including claims of inappropriate comments and unwelcome physical contact. The BBC has not yet announced replacements for the main 'MasterChef' series.</p>

          <p>A top researcher from China's lunar exploration program has announced that the country is planning a mission to test its planetary defense capabilities against asteroids. The mission aims to demonstrate a "kinetic impact" by sending an impactor spacecraft to strike a small asteroid tens of millions of kilometers away. The goal is to alter the asteroid's orbit by a few centimeters, testing the feasibility of such technology for defending Earth from potential future threats. An observer spacecraft will accompany the impactor to monitor the results.</p>

          <p>In a remote area of Sudan's Darfur region, villagers are digging by hand to recover victims of a catastrophic landslide caused by heavy rainfall. Aid groups describe scenes of immense devastation, with rescue efforts severely hampered by the lack of machinery and the difficult terrain. The death toll remains uncertain, with estimates ranging from a few hundred to over a thousand, including many children. The ongoing civil war in Sudan further complicates the delivery of humanitarian aid to the affected communities.</p>

          <p>Royal commentators are drawing parallels between Meghan Markle and the late Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, focusing on the intense media scrutiny both women faced after marrying into high-profile families. The article suggests that while Bessette-Kennedy largely withdrew from the press, maintaining her mystique, Markle's more public approach has yielded mixed results for her reputation. Several experts quoted in the article advise that a period of staying out of the spotlight could be beneficial for the Duchess of Sussex's public image.</p>

          <p>One year after American-Turkish activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi was killed by an Israeli sniper in the occupied West Bank, her family continues to demand an independent U.S. investigation. The 26-year-old was shot while attending a protest, and despite an Israeli military conclusion of an unintentional shooting, her family and a Turkish government probe assert she was deliberately targeted. The case highlights a recurring pattern where U.S. citizens are killed by Israeli forces with limited accountability or investigative action from Washington.</p>

          <p>A recent National Conservatism conference in Washington D.C. featured speakers from theocratic, ultranationalist, and other far-right movements alongside senior Republican and Trump administration officials. This event has raised questions about the shrinking distinction between the established Republican party and more extremist ideologies. Critics, such as the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, argue the speaker list demonstrates an increasing integration of the far-right into the mainstream conservative movement under the Trump administration.</p>

The article explores how the musical's themes of nation-building and political strife resonate differently today, shifting its perception from a celebration to more of a cautionary tale.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Activist Stages Remote Protest Against Xi Jinping's Government After Fleeing to the UK</h2>

          <p>A former factory worker from China, Qi Hong, orchestrated a daring protest by remotely projecting anti-government slogans onto a building in Chongqing after he and his family had already fled to the United Kingdom. The messages, which included "Down with red fascism" and "overthrow the tyranny of the Communist Party," were displayed on the eve of a major military parade. Mr. Qi's meticulously planned act of defiance highlights the extreme risks citizens face for expressing dissent in Xi Jinping's increasingly authoritarian China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken an approximately 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, making the U.S. government its largest single shareholder in a strategic move to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. This action, which converts grants from the CHIPS Act into equity, aims to enhance national security and competition with China in AI and technology. The goal is to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC, though the move also raises concerns about government influence in private enterprise.</p>

          <p>In traffic-congested Indian cities like Mumbai, drivers are increasingly replacing standard-issue vehicle horns with much louder, more powerful aftermarket versions to be heard above the constant din. This cultural phenomenon, driven by the belief that honking is essential for navigating chaotic roads, contributes to severe noise pollution that often exceeds recommended health limits. Despite laws against excessive honking, enforcement is low, and the demand for high-pressure "pom pom" style horns continues to grow.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to effectively challenge the Western-led world order, its political and strategic goals must be supported by a robust economic and monetary framework. The author draws a parallel to the Bretton Woods agreement, which established the post-WWII financial system, suggesting a similar institutional foundation is needed. With 27 members and partners, including China, Russia, and India, the SCO has significant political weight but lacks the complex economic structures for true global influence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research from Oxford Economics, China's recent government push against "involution"—defined as destructive, low-quality price competition—is unlikely to have the same economic impact as the major 2015 supply-side reforms. The analysis suggests that while President Xi Jinping has criticized the practice, the current economic environment makes it difficult to implement the necessary production capacity cuts or significant consumption stimulus. Therefore, expectations for a sweeping campaign to resolve China's supply-demand imbalances may be overly optimistic.</p>

The package is tied to achieving extremely aggressive growth targets, including increasing Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. This "super ambitious" incentive plan is seen by analysts as a strategic move to ensure Musk remains at the company to lead its expansion into AI and robotics, though it has raised questions about corporate governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social Security's 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is projected to be around 2.7%, partly due to the inflationary effects of President Trump's global tariff policies. This would mark the fifth consecutive year the COLA has surpassed 2.5%, a historic trend for the program. However, the increase may offer little relief to beneficiaries, as the purchasing power of Social Security has steadily declined, and a forecasted 11.5% rise in Medicare Part B premiums is expected to consume much of the additional income.
