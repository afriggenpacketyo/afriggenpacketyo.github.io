          <p>Copenhagen and Oslo's main airports faced temporary closures following multiple drone sightings, causing significant flight disruptions and diversions for several hours. Danish police reported an inability to confirm the drones' type or origin, initiating an investigation that includes cooperation with Norwegian authorities. While operations have resumed, the incidents prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reference potential Russian airspace violations. The lack of clarity surrounding these events highlights ongoing security concerns for critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle strengthened into a Category 4 storm, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Its center is expected to pass east of Bermuda, with no direct watches or warnings issued for the immediate area, though the Azores should monitor its progress. The National Hurricane Center forecasts life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada due to swells. This article highlights the continued activity in a season initially predicted to be busier than average.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stephen Miller's eulogy for Charlie Kirk is analyzed as a stark articulation of Trumpism's ideology, emphasizing an "us vs. them" narrative and the destruction of perceived foes. Miller's rhetoric, devoid of nuance, depicted opponents as inherently evil and incapable of creation, contrasting sharply with past calls for unity. The article highlights the perceived hypocrisy of holding enemies to standards the Trump camp disavows, using Kirk's death as a pretext to further political division rather than reconciliation. This piece frames the speech as a battle cry for state-sponsored political warfare.</p>

          <p>Longtime baseball broadcaster Ed Randall, a prostate cancer survivor, founded Fans For The Cure in 2003 to encourage men over 40 to get PSA blood tests. This initiative stems from his personal experience of being diagnosed at 47 during a routine physical. The article highlights that early detection of prostate cancer boasts a 99% cure rate, emphasizing the importance of regular screenings. Randall actively promotes the charity on his MLB Network Radio show, stressing its work in hosting awareness nights, free screenings, and support groups.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's rejection of Nvidia's stripped-down B40-series chips signifies a turning point in global technology politics. Despite the US aiming to maintain technological lead while allowing "safe" alternatives, Beijing views accepting these chips as acknowledging US-dictated inferiority. The decision, accompanied by antitrust investigations and security concerns, reflects China's intensified push for technological self-sufficiency. This shift suggests that US export restrictions have inadvertently strengthened China's resolve to achieve indigenous innovation, moving away from reliance on American suppliers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's assertion that Tylenol use during pregnancy raises autism risk is widely criticized by scientists for lacking scientific support. This article highlights that medical experts agree untreated fever and pain in pregnancy carry significant health risks for both mother and infant. The article frames this claim as part of a broader Trump administration campaign to valorize "natural" pregnancy, undermining proven medical interventions like Covid vaccines and antidepressants. This approach, rooted in an "appeal to nature" fallacy, is seen as corroding women's health and safety, potentially leading to more pain and fewer options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has accused FCC Chairman Brendan Carr of unlawfully intimidating broadcasters into aligning with President Trump, demanding an end to his "campaign of censorship." Bonta's letter specifically cited ABC's temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show following Carr's threats over Kimmel's comments. While Kimmel was reinstated, Bonta maintains concerns, arguing that governmental pressure on media violates First Amendment rights and creates a chilling effect on free speech. Constitutional scholars also emphasized the dangerous precedent set by these actions.</p>
