          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are at odds over the scale of protests in Los Angeles following immigration raids. Trump claims the city is under siege and requires the National Guard, while Newsom asserts local law enforcement can manage the situation. The protests erupted after ICE conducted raids in downtown Los Angeles, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement, with Newsom calling Trump's actions "purposely inflammatory." The President has bypassed Newsom and activated 2,100 California National Guard troops, including 1,700 on the ground in Los Angeles as of Monday night and the remainder on standby to be sent there, marking the first time a president has mobilized troops without a governor's consent since President Lyndon B. Johnson did so in 1965. Tensions remain high as the debate continues over the necessity and legality of federal intervention in the city's unrest. The article highlights the starkly different perspectives on the ground situation between the federal and state leadership.</p>

          <p>The United States government has announced sanctions against two sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the imprisoned leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, and is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to their arrest. The sanctions target Archivaldo Ivan Guzman Salazar and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar, who are believed to be in Mexico and are allegedly involved in fentanyl trafficking into the U.S. The Treasury Department is also targeting a Sinaloa cartel faction known as the "Chapitos," which is identified as a main exporter of fentanyl to the U.S. as well as a regional network of Chapitos associates and businesses based in Mazatlan, Mexico, that allegedly engage in drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering. The article underscores the ongoing efforts to disrupt the Sinaloa Cartel's operations and combat the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a key government panel advising the CDC on vaccines. Kennedy stated that this "clean sweep" is needed to restore public confidence in vaccine science, claiming the panel has been plagued by conflicts of interest and has become a rubber stamp for any vaccine. Health policy experts are concerned that this shake-up could lead to politicized recommendations that undermine vaccinations and create distrust in the CDC.

          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after suspending them in April due to a cyber attack. The retailer is initially offering fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with plans to expand to beauty, homeware, click and collect, and Northern Ireland services in the coming weeks. The cyber attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially disrupted click and collect and contactless payments, and is estimated to cost the company around £300 million in profits. Some personal customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen during the attack, though payment details and passwords were not compromised.
