        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear an expedited appeal concerning the legality of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The case consolidates challenges from small businesses and states arguing that the President overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for broad, indefinite tariffs. The administration sought the fast-tracked review, warning that a negative ruling could force the Treasury to refund up to $1 trillion in collected duties. The court's decision to hear arguments in November suggests a final ruling will come relatively quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British horse racing industry has staged a one-day strike, canceling all fixtures in protest of a potential government tax hike on betting. Industry leaders, including the British Horseracing Authority, argue that increasing the tax rate could cost the sport millions in revenue, lead to significant job losses, and make betting on racing less attractive. Jockeys, trainers, and owners are lobbying Members of Parliament, warning that the proposed changes threaten the financial viability of the UK's second-largest spectator sport.</p>

The race pits Democrat James Walkinshaw against Republican Stewart Whitson in a historically Democratic district where federal job cuts under the Trump administration have become a central issue. A Democratic victory would further narrow the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-213, adding pressure ahead of a looming government funding deadline at the end of the month.</p>

          <p>Former CDC Director Susan Monarez is scheduled for her first public appearance since her dismissal, testifying before a Senate committee next week. Monarez, who was ousted just four weeks into her role, claims she was fired by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for refusing to approve his vaccine policy agenda without scientific backing. The hearing, chaired by Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, aims to bring "radical transparency" to the recent controversial shakeups and policy changes at the CDC under the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>Apple Unveils iPhone 17 Lineup, Featuring Slimmer 'Air' Model and Higher Prices for Pro Versions</h2>

          <p>Apple has announced its new iPhone 17 lineup, highlighted by a new, thinner "iPhone Air" model and incremental updates to its base and Pro versions, such as better cameras and longer battery life. While the event did not feature major announcements on generative AI, the company implemented a pricing strategy that raises the entry-level cost for its Pro models, which should increase the average selling price. Analysts suggest the refreshed hardware lineup is strong enough to maintain consumer interest while Apple continues to develop its broader AI strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Girl Scouts of the USA have revealed a new cookie flavor, "Exploremores," set to debut in the 2026 season. The new offering is a sandwich cookie inspired by rocky road ice cream, featuring chocolate, marshmallow, and toasted almond-flavored crème. This announcement comes as the organization is retiring two other flavors, S'mores and Toast-Yay!, meaning the overall lineup will have fewer options than in the previous year. Cookie sales are a key program for the youth organization.</p>

          <p>According to a U.S. official, Israel informed the U.S. military of its plan to strike Hamas but did not specify the target's location in Qatar or provide other details before the attack. The notification was reportedly not sufficient to allow the U.S. to warn regional partners in time. This account adds context to the White House's statement that the attack was a "unilateral" Israeli operation, clarifying that while some communication occurred, the U.S. was not fully briefed on the specifics of the sensitive strike on an allied nation's soil.</p>

          <p>A 6-3 Supreme Court decision allowing U.S. Border Patrol agents to consider race and ethnicity as part of the "totality of the circumstances" for immigration stops has been met with sharp criticism. The ruling sets aside a lower court's order that had barred the practice, with critics arguing it effectively authorizes racial profiling and contradicts previous rulings against racial discrimination. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, warning that the decision subjects countless people in areas like Los Angeles to "indignities" based on their appearance.</p>

          <p>A Michigan judge has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans accused of acting as false electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The defendants faced forgery and conspiracy charges for signing a document claiming to be the state's "duly elected and qualified electors" despite Joe Biden's certified victory in Michigan. The dismissal is a significant setback for prosecutors in the state and complicates similar cases proceeding in four other states related to the fake electors scheme.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Key inflation reports due this week, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are anticipated to show that prices rose again in August. Economists predict the annual headline CPI rate will increase to 2.9%, driven largely by tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader services prices. Despite the expected uptick, analysts believe the Federal Reserve will likely still proceed with an interest rate cut at its next meeting, as policymakers are expected to view the tariff effects as temporary and focus more on a weakening labor market.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reportedly been in contact with William Parker, a scientist who theorizes that acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a primary cause of autism in children. Parker's work has been largely rejected by the mainstream scientific community, which has not found a causal link and attributes rising autism rates primarily to changes in diagnostic criteria. Kennedy's interest in this fringe theory aligns with his promise to identify and eliminate the causes of autism and his long-held skepticism of mainstream pharmaceutical products.</p>
