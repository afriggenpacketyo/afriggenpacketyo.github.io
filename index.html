          <p>Doug Lebda, the founder and CEO of the online loan marketplace LendingTree, has died in an all-terrain vehicle accident. The company confirmed his unexpected death and praised him as a visionary leader who transformed the financial services industry since founding the platform in 1996. In response to the tragedy, LendingTree's board has appointed Chief Operating Officer Scott Peyree as the new CEO and lead independent director Steve Ozonian as chairman. Lebda founded the company to simplify the loan shopping process after his own frustrating experience obtaining a mortgage, growing it into a major public corporation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and over 20 world leaders gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to sign the first phase of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. The summit included notable figures such as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and French President Emmanuel Macron, though representatives from Israel and Hamas were absent. Trump touted the agreement as a historic turning point for the Middle East, formally signing a document intended to establish new rules for the region. Despite the ceremony, many details about the subsequent phases of the peace plan and the rebuilding of Gaza remain unclear, with Trump suggesting reconstruction would be the easiest part.</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill has doubled down on her claim that her Republican opponent for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, was "complicit" in the state's opioid crisis. During a press conference, Sherrill alleged that Ciattarelli profited from his connections to pharmaceutical-backed programs that promoted opioid use, linking him to the deaths of thousands. Ciattarelli has vehemently denied the accusations, calling them defamatory and a desperate tactic, and has pledged to file a lawsuit against Sherrill. The heated exchange highlights the contentious nature of the gubernatorial race, which is being closely watched as a key political barometer ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The initial phase of the Gaza peace plan has advanced with Hamas releasing 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for Israel freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. This development, part of a U.S.-brokered deal, follows a ceasefire and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops, allowing more humanitarian aid into the territory after two years of war. However, significant challenges remain as negotiations move to more contentious issues, including the post-war governance of Gaza and Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm. The plan also proposes an Arab-led international security force, but a clear timeline for implementation and Palestinian statehood remains undefined.</p>

          <p>South Africa's cricket team achieved a dramatic three-wicket victory against Bangladesh in the Women's World Cup, recovering from a significant top-order collapse. Chasing a target of 233, the Proteas were struggling at 78-5 before half-centuries from Chloe Tryon and Marizanne Kapp revived their chances. Nadine de Klerk, who was dropped on a crucial catch in the penultimate over, ultimately sealed the win with a six, finishing unbeaten on 37. The victory marks South Africa's third consecutive win, showcasing their resilience, while Bangladesh was left to regret several critical dropped catches that cost them the match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law prohibiting the sale of new Glock handguns in California due to a design feature that allows them to be easily modified into fully automatic weapons with a "Glock Switch." The legislation, which does not ban the possession or resale of used Glocks, aims to compel the manufacturer to alter its design to prevent such modifications. Proponents, including victims' families, argue the law will save lives, while opponents claim it unfairly restricts access to a popular and reliable firearm for law-abiding citizens. The bill was passed on a party-line vote, with Republicans in opposition.</p>

          <p>Experts describe the U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan as deliberately vague, a necessary compromise to secure agreement from both Israel and Hamas but one that leaves critical issues unresolved. Key questions remain regarding the timeline for a full Israeli withdrawal, the composition and authority of a proposed international stabilization force, and the practical steps for the demilitarization of Hamas. Analysts warn that these undefined elements create significant hurdles for long-term peace and could lead to renewed conflict if not carefully negotiated. The success of the plan now hinges on sustained U.S. pressure and the ability to implement its ambiguous terms on the ground.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An editorial from The Guardian acknowledges the immense relief brought by the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release but expresses skepticism about President Trump's declaration of a "golden age." The article argues that while the U.S.-brokered deal is a positive step, it offers no clear timeline or mechanism for Palestinian statehood and risks freezing the conflict under the guise of peace. The plan's vague references to an international stabilization force and a transitional administration are criticized as insufficient for addressing the region's deep-seated issues. The piece concludes that without genuine Palestinian agency and a concrete political framework, the short-term reprieve is unlikely to evolve into a sustainable resolution.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old woman was killed in Brooklyn after being struck by a solar panel that was torn from a carport structure during a powerful nor'easter.

While the move was met with a sharp appreciation of the peso, it has also drawn criticism regarding the risks involved, given Argentina's history of defaults and the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.

          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash and remain in their home for as long as they meet specific obligations. There is no predetermined time limit, but the loan becomes due if the borrower moves out, sells the property, passes away, or fails to pay property taxes and homeowners insurance. For married couples, a surviving co-borrower can continue living in the home without the loan becoming due. Once a maturity event occurs, the borrower's heirs typically have six months, with possible extensions, to repay the loan, often by selling the property.</p>

          <p>Detroit Lions defensive back Brian Branch is facing a possible suspension after striking Kansas City Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster in the face immediately following their game. Branch stated he was retaliating for an illegal block in the back that went unpenalized by officials during the Lions' 30-17 loss. He later apologized for his actions, calling them "childish" but expressing frustration over what he perceived as bullying tactics. Lions coach Dan Campbell condemned the behavior as "inexcusable" and not representative of the team's values, while Smith-Schuster confirmed he received a bloody nose from the hit.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Vodafone customers across the United Kingdom experienced a significant service outage affecting broadband, 4G, and 5G networks. Downdetector, a web monitoring service, recorded over 130,000 reports of problems on Monday afternoon, with many users unable to access the internet or use mobile data. The outage also impacted customers of other providers that use Vodafone's network, such as Voxi and Lebara. In a statement, Vodafone apologized for the inconvenience and confirmed that its network was recovering, though the company has not yet disclosed the cause of the widespread disruption, which effectively took its services offline for a period.</p>

          <p>A small, single-engine plane crashed and caught fire on the median of Interstate 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, resulting in the deaths of two individuals on board. The incident, which occurred during a nor'easter, also injured one person on the ground and prompted the complete shutdown of the major highway. According to state police, the Socata TBM-700 aircraft had departed from the nearby New Bedford Regional Airport and may have been attempting to land there. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash, though weather has not yet been confirmed as a factor.</p>

          <h2>Senators Remain Deadlocked Over Government Shutdown and Healthcare Subsidies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown approaches its second week, Republican and Democratic senators appear entrenched in their positions. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham stated he would not vote to extend Obama-era healthcare subsidies, a key Democratic demand, even if it means prolonging the shutdown. In response, Democratic Senator Mark Kelly criticized Republicans for refusing to engage in genuine negotiations to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, Vice-President JD Vance warned that the longer the shutdown continues, the deeper the permanent cuts to the federal workforce will become, with over 4,000 workers already identified for termination.</p>
