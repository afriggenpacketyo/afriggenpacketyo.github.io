          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and a £2bn upgrade project. Initially drawn up in 1990 and begun in 2002, the 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges, and planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While some criticize the cost and delays, others believe the upgrade will generate jobs and better connect communities.</p>

While denying any presidential aspirations for 2028, they highlighted the need to focus on immediate challenges and deliver tangible alternatives to the opposition. Moore emphasized the importance of delivering an alternative to Trump now, while Walz encouraged Democrats to compete in every district and school board seat with determination.</p>

          <p>A sperm donor in Europe, used to conceive at least 67 pregnancies, was found to carry a rare cancer-causing mutation, TP53, which has been linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 children. The mutation causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, significantly increasing the risk of developing cancer at a young age. The European Sperm Bank stated that the mutation was undetectable through standard screening methods at the time of donation in 2008 and that donors undergo comprehensive health screenings. The bank supports an internationally binding family limit and has implemented its own limit of 75 families per donor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that the UN's global population estimates may be undercounting individuals in rural areas by over 50%, potentially increasing the total world population by hundreds of millions or even billions. This discrepancy arises from incomplete or unreliable census data outside major cities in the global south. While some express concerns about overpopulation and resource scarcity, the article argues that anxieties often reflect power struggles over whose lives matter. The author suggests that managing consumption responsibly and developing sustainable technologies are key to avoiding catastrophic outcomes, advocating for compromise and sharing resources.</p>

          <p>Meta plans to automate up to 90% of privacy and integrity risk assessments for new features on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, replacing human evaluators with AI-driven systems. This change is intended to expedite product development, but raises concerns about the potential for AI to overlook unforeseen repercussions and misuse of the platforms. Internal documents reveal that sensitive areas like AI safety, youth risk, and content integrity may be subject to automated reviews. Critics worry that engineers, who are incentivized to launch products quickly, may not prioritize privacy and safety concerns adequately.</p>

          <p>Veteran lawyers are raising concerns about the legality of President Trump's agreements with law firms, suggesting they may not be valid contracts due to coercion. The White House claims these firms agreed to provide pro bono services worth approximately $1 billion in exchange for curtailing investigations into their hiring practices and maintaining access to federal buildings. However, details of these agreements remain unclear, and legal experts argue that contracts made under duress are not enforceable. Some targeted law firms are successfully challenging Trump's actions in court, while others are criticized for prioritizing financial gain over ethical considerations.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence spending by 2034, with the upcoming strategic defence review based on this assumption. The review, expected to outline priorities for military and security spending, will address new threats like drones and artificial intelligence. The government's budget watchdog estimates meeting the 3% target would require an additional £17.3 billion in 2029-30. The defence ministry also announced over £1.5bn in additional funding to improve military housing, addressing urgent repairs and developing new accommodations.</p>

He noted that NATO members are pledging 5% of their GDP on defense and urged Asian allies to upgrade their defenses.

          <p>Satellite images reveal North Korea has deployed balloon-like objects alongside its damaged 5,000-ton warship, which has been partially submerged since a failed launch. Experts suggest the objects may be used to help right the ship or protect it from drone surveillance. The warship suffered damage during a launch malfunction on May 21, and leader Kim Jong Un has ordered swift repairs. Analysts speculate the balloons could prevent further flooding or reduce stress on the section of the ship still on the pier, while others warn that the lifting could cause further damage.</p>
