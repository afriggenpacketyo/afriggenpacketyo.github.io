        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oklahoma's new Superintendent, Lindel Fields, has officially rescinded a controversial mandate from his predecessor that required public schools to place Bibles in classrooms and incorporate them into curricula for grades 5-12. This reversal also includes plans to dismiss lawsuits filed against the previous administration over these religious directives. Fields stated that the decision on Bible incorporation should rest with individual districts and that funding Bibles is not the best use of taxpayer resources. This move marks a significant shift away from conservative efforts to integrate religion into public education, with the agency also reviewing other mandates from the former superintendent.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson is facing a significant legal claim in the UK from 3,000 individuals alleging its baby powder was contaminated with asbestos and caused cancers. The lawsuit claims J&J knew since the 1960s about fibrous talc, including asbestos minerals, in its products but concealed the risks, promoting the powder as pure and safe. J&J denies all allegations, asserting its baby powder was compliant, asbestos-free, and does not cause cancer. This UK action mirrors extensive litigation in the US, where claimants have been awarded billions, and could become the largest product liability case in British history.</p>

This center, led by a US three-star general, will coordinate security, aid, and rebuilding efforts in Gaza. Located outside an Israeli military base for international access, it is crucial for managing the complex logistics of post-war recovery. The initiative involves 200 US troops specializing in logistics, working alongside representatives from partner nations like Indonesia, Egypt, and Qatar, as discussions continue on establishing an international security force within the strip.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the visas of at least six foreign nationals for publicly celebrating the assassination of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk. The US Department of State stated it has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death upon Americans, sharing screenshots of social media posts as evidence. Kirk, a 31-year-old ally of President Trump and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot in September. This action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to target Kirk's critics and expand social media vetting for visa applicants, reflecting heightened political tensions following the incident.</p>

The article highlights that striking down Section 2 could allow states to disenfranchise minority voters with impunity, potentially shifting up to 19 House seats to Republicans and leading to "one-party rule."

          <p>Ashley Tellis, a prominent Indian-American academic and former US government adviser, has been arrested and charged with the unlawful detention of national security information. Thousands of pages of classified and top-secret documents, including details on US military aircraft, were found at his Virginia home. Tellis, who previously held top-secret clearance and served on the National Security Council, is also accused of meeting Chinese officials and providing them with documents, which he denies. This case has ignited a political storm in India, where Tellis is a well-known foreign policy commentator, and underscores the Trump administration's commitment to prosecuting mishandling of classified data.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to reallocate $1 billion in anti-terrorism prevention funds, shifting money from Democratic-led states to Republican-led ones. This overhaul of the post-9/11 Homeland Security Grants program has prompted a lawsuit from twelve Democratic states, who allege the move is politically motivated retaliation for non-cooperation on immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security claims the new allocation prioritizes threats from transnational organized crime and illegal border crossings. This action is part of a pattern where the Trump administration has adjusted federal funding to states that opposed him in the 2024 election, raising concerns about political weaponization of federal resources.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the US will not benefit from treating China as an enemy, especially concerning critical resources like rare earths. China has strategically developed its rare earth industry over decades, investing heavily in mining, refining, and a skilled workforce, giving it significant global dominance. The author highlights recent tensions where the US refused to sell advanced chips to China, leading to China imposing export controls on rare earth technologies. The article suggests China views its actions as self-protection, warning that continued US aggression, particularly over Taiwan, gives Beijing little incentive for cooperation, urging reflection from the West.</p>

          <p>This article argues that crime and the fear of crime are significant, underappreciated factors contributing to low mass transit ridership in the United States. While infrastructure and service quality are often cited, nearly 40% of Americans perceive public transit as unsafe, a fear supported by thousands of reported assaults annually in major cities. The piece explains how unchecked disorder and a lack of enforcement can create a "vicious cycle," driving away rule-following riders and making public spaces unusable. It emphasizes that improving public safety, including addressing petty disorder, is crucial for revitalizing mass transit and urban life.</p>

An Indian government spokesperson stated discussions are "ongoing" with the US, prioritizing Indian consumer interests in a volatile energy market.
