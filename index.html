        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop Mart, a leading toy company, has launched a new line of gold jewelry under its Popop brand, featuring Baby Molly designs, to capitalize on its growing popularity. The jewelry, including beads, pendants, bars, and ornaments, is priced between $137 and $56,800 and is available in Beijing and Shanghai stores. This move follows Pop Mart's January foray into jewelry with silver items and has boosted the company's stock, which had been declining since late August. The company's valuation remains significantly higher than its rivals in the toy industry. The stock ended the day with a gain of 1.2 per cent at HK$276.80, leaving it with a year-to-date gain of more than 200 per cent. Optimism is relatively high due to the potential for growth in a new market. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy showed zero growth in July, following a manufacturing output contraction, according to the Office for National Statistics. While this aligns with expectations, the ONS will focus on three-month growth, which showed a 0.2% expansion. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure to boost economic growth before the November budget, where tax increases may be necessary. Despite a service sector increase, manufacturing declined sharply, leading to overall economic slowdown, however, it is still on track to grow in the third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The death toll in Nepal's anti-corruption protests has risen to 51, including protestors, policemen, and prisoners, according to police reports. Thousands of prisoners escaped during the protests, with many still at large and attempting to cross into India. Former chief justice Sushila Karki is expected to be appointed as interim prime minister following the government's collapse. The public anger over corruption led to the ousting of the previous government, and now the country is trying to restore order. The country's future is uncertain as it tries to deal with the corruption which sparked the protests.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 05:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill indicates that insect populations are declining even in areas minimally affected by human activity, with climate change as a likely cause. The study, conducted over 15 summers in a remote Colorado meadow, revealed an average annual decline of 6.6% in flying insect density. This suggests that rising temperatures are significantly impacting insect numbers, even in pristine environments. Entomologists emphasize the critical role insects play in the global food chain and warn of potential ecological consequences. There is concern that the decline will affect many levels of biology. </p>

          <p>Under President Trump, the FDA is considering ending the practice of using external expert panels to review drug applications, a move criticized as reducing public scrutiny. George Tidmarsh, head of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, argues these meetings are redundant and costly. Former FDA officials and academics disagree, emphasizing the value of expert input and public transparency. The FDA has held fewer advisory committee meetings recently, and some worry about the agency consolidating power. There is concern over a lack of public input. </p>

          <p>Health care costs in the U.S. are rising, leading employers to increase health insurance deductions for employees, potentially by 6% to 7% next year.

The rising costs are driven by factors like expensive new treatments and reduced competition among healthcare providers. Employers are at the mercy of drug companies, pharmacy benefit managers, and hospitals, who have collectively driven up the costs of accessing medical care in the United States.
