He stated that Russia is significantly building up its forces, producing tanks and artillery, some of which could be used against NATO's Baltic state members. Gen Breuer emphasized the need for NATO members to prepare for a possible attack and strengthen their military capabilities. He singled out the Suwalki Gap as a particularly vulnerable area.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party is proposing that prison officers dealing with violent inmates should be armed with Taser stun guns and baton rounds. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick argues this would provide officers with greater confidence in handling threats.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) stated that some prison officers will trial Tasers this summer but opposes lethal weapons, arguing it would increase risk to prison officers.</p>
