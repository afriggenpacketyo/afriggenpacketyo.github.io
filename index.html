          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to shield the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" from the escalating conflict between President Trump and Elon Musk. Musk has denounced the bill, urging Congress to reject it, leading to a public dispute with Trump. Johnson, who once had a close relationship with Musk, is trying to keep the focus on the legislative agenda despite the online spat, with other House Republicans expressing concerns about Musk's influence on the bill's passage. Despite the clash, Johnson maintains that his priority is accomplishing the legislative agenda. Optimism surrounding the bill's future remains uncertain given the high-profile disagreement.</p>

          <p>This article provides a breakdown of estimated monthly annuity payouts based on different investment amounts and ages, offering insights for retirement planning. The payouts vary depending on factors such as the amount invested, the age when payments start, and life expectancy. The article highlights that annuities can provide predictable income during retirement, especially when other sources like Social Security and 401(k) plans may not fully cover expenses. It also notes that annuities are not suitable for everyone, as they involve locking up a lump sum of money, and advises shopping around for the best rates and features. (not investment advice)</p>

Bye secretly installed a camera in his office, and the police uncovered the scale of his offenses after reviewing hundreds of hours of footage.

          <p>Research from Northwestern University suggests that Duavee, a drug used to treat menopause symptoms, may also prevent breast cancer. The study found that the drug significantly reduced breast tissue cell growth, a key indicator of cancer progression, in post-menopausal women with stage 0 breast cancer. Patients taking the drug reported fewer hot flashes, and researchers are encouraged by the early results. However, more research is needed before the medication can be approved as a breast cancer prevention mechanism, as the study focused on reducing levels of one specific protein and did not directly show reduced recurrence of DCIS or development of invasive cancer.</p>

          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, a former Bargain Hunt art expert, has been sentenced to two years and six months in prison for failing to declare art sales to a suspected financier of Hezbollah. Ojiri admitted to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000 for not disclosing the transactions. The judge emphasized that Ojiri was aware that the art he sold was to Nazem Ahmad, who had been sanctioned by U.S. authorities. This prosecution is believed to be the first of its kind, highlighting the importance of reporting suspicious transactions in the art market.</p>

Researchers found that "mismatches" between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut environment could negatively impact immune and metabolic functions. The study, conducted on mice and human tissue samples, indicates that introduced microbes can "terraform" the intestinal tract, potentially causing modifications to immune and metabolic functions. Experts suggest that greater care should be given to designing fecal transplants with targeted microbes for specific intestinal regions.</p>
