          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has generated significant controversy with recent comments suggesting that Poland and Baltic states hindered a 2021 EU initiative for direct talks with Vladimir Putin. In an interview, she reflected on her final months in office, implying that this diplomatic failure may have preceded Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Her statements drew sharp criticism from Polish and Baltic officials, who called them outrageous and accused her of distorting history and failing to admit her own policy mistakes regarding Russia. Conversely, the Kremlin praised Merkel's remarks, stating they align with Russia's view that these nations have a "fanatical" anti-Russian policy.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Transport anticipates a record-breaking travel surge during the eight-day "Golden Week" holiday, with projections reaching over 2.4 billion total trips. This figure represents a 6.2% increase from the previous year, signaling a robust recovery in domestic tourism and transportation. To accommodate the massive demand, the national railway operator has added nearly 1,900 extra trains, with more available for popular routes like Shenzhen-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Beijing. The surge in rail and electric vehicle traffic underscores the scale of the national holiday migration.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, is set to announce a new economic "golden rule" aimed at enforcing fiscal responsibility. The proposed rule would mandate that half of all savings from a future Conservative government be allocated to reducing the national deficit. The remaining half would be used to fund economy-boosting policies, including tax cuts, as the party pledges to save £47 billion annually from various cuts. In her conference speech, Badenoch will position the Conservatives as the only party with a credible plan for economic recovery, contrasting her approach with the Labour government's alleged "borrowing and tax doom loop."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Australian cricket team is awaiting a final decision on captain Pat Cummins's participation in the upcoming Ashes series due to an ongoing back stress injury. Recent scans reportedly showed the injury has not fully healed, casting doubt on his availability for the first Test and potentially the entire series. While the team has not issued an official update, Cummins's absence would be a significant blow, likely leading to Steve Smith taking over captaincy and Scott Boland joining the pace attack. The situation adds to the pre-series tension, as England is also managing injury concerns for its own captain, Ben Stokes.</p>

The intense snowfall, which occurred during China's "Golden Week" holiday, rendered trails impassable and crushed tents, creating a perilous situation. While the Everest rescue was successful, authorities reported one fatality from hypothermia and altitude sickness in a neighboring province also affected by the weather.</p>

          <p>Spot gold prices have surpassed the historic $4,000 per ounce milestone for the first time, driven by strong safe-haven demand from investors. Analysts attribute the surge to mounting global uncertainty, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and the recent resignation of France's prime minister. This rally follows a summer of economic volatility spurred by U.S. tariff policies, further enhancing gold's appeal as a stable asset. While gold prices climbed, Asia-Pacific stock markets showed mixed results, and the U.S. dollar index also saw a slight increase. (not investment advice)</p>

The total compensation bill for lenders could reach £8.2 billion. The FCA's chief executive stated it is time for customers to receive fair compensation, though industry representatives have argued the regulator may be "overcompensating."</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is facing unprecedented challenges from a fragmented and polarized European Parliament, highlighted by two no-confidence votes in just three months. While she is expected to survive the votes, the push from both the far-right and radical left demonstrates the erosion of the traditional centrist coalition. Analysts point to her centralized leadership style and the rising influence of extremist parties as key factors fueling the discontent. This new political reality creates a difficult environment for passing legislation on critical issues like the budget, trade, and climate policy.</p>

          <p>A military attack in Myanmar's central Sagaing region has killed at least 24 people and wounded 47 after a motorized paraglider dropped bombs on a crowd protesting the military government. The incident occurred during a candlelight vigil organized for a national holiday, where attendees were calling for the release of political prisoners. The junta has increasingly used paramotors for airstrikes as it battles armed resistance groups that control large parts of the country. Amnesty International condemned the attack as part of a "disturbing trend" and called for urgent protection for civilians.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is exacerbating a critical shortage of air traffic controllers, leading to significant flight delays and cancellations nationwide as staff call in sick. With controllers deemed essential and forced to work without pay, facilities in Nashville, Dallas, and Chicago have experienced staffing issues, forcing the FAA to slow traffic to ensure safety. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association stated that while staffing has been a long-term problem, the shutdown is highlighting the fragility of the system. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed concern that controllers may be taking on second jobs to make ends meet.</p>

          <p>The government of Chad has ended its 15-year partnership with African Parks, a prominent conservation organization that counts the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, as a board member. The Chadian environment ministry accused the charity of failing to curb poaching, lacking investment, and displaying a "disrespectful attitude" towards national authorities. African Parks, which managed two major protected areas in the country, stated it is in talks with the ministry to understand the decision. The move is the latest controversy for the organization, which recently admitted to abuses by its employees in a park it manages in the Republic of Congo.</p>

          <p>A multi-story building undergoing renovation in Madrid, Spain, has partially collapsed, resulting in the deaths of four construction workers. Emergency services recovered the bodies of the victims, identified as workers from Mali, Guinea, and Ecuador, from the rubble. At least three other people were injured in the incident, which occurred when several ceiling structures gave way. Witnesses reported hearing a loud bang that sounded "like a bomb" and seeing a thick cloud of smoke. The building was being converted into a four-star hotel, and judicial police are now investigating the cause of the fatal workplace accident.</p>

          <p>Researchers have successfully demonstrated that donor kidneys can have their blood type converted, a breakthrough that could significantly expand the pool of available organs and reduce transplant waiting lists. In a recent study, a kidney was treated with enzymes to remove the blood group antigens that cause rejection, effectively making it a universal Type O. The converted kidney was then transplanted into a recipient and functioned for two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. This technique offers a promising solution to address organ shortages and improve the equality of organ allocation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has addressed the team's strategy for using rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who has become their most dominant relief option. Roberts explained that he is carefully managing Sasaki's workload, as the 23-year-old has never pitched in a relief role before and is recovering from a prior shoulder injury. This approach led to initially using another reliever in a key save situation in Game 2, a decision that nearly backfired before Sasaki was brought in to secure the final out. While Sasaki is now the primary option for future save situations, the team will continue to balance his usage to ensure his health.</p>

The situation has placed the city in a national spotlight, with President Trump threatening to deploy the National Guard, a move currently blocked by a federal judge.
