          <p>President Donald Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" for keeping interest rates high, but appeared to back away from the idea of firing him. Trump noted that Powell's term ends in May 2026, stating, "he's going to be out pretty soon anyway." The comments come amid ongoing speculation about Powell's job security and legal questions over the president's authority to remove the central bank leader. Trump has consistently accused Powell of being too slow to cut rates for political reasons. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates but revealed that auto tariffs had a $1.1 billion impact on its results. The company affirmed its full-year guidance, which includes a potential $4 billion to $5 billion total impact from the tariffs, stating it is working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives. Despite beating earnings expectations, GM's stock fell, and the automaker reported declines in year-over-year net income and revenue. The company also anticipates a short-term rush on electric vehicles before federal tax credits expire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A high-ranking Justice Department official, Todd Blanche, plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell in the coming days to discuss the Jeffrey Epstein case. This development comes as a House subcommittee moves to subpoena Maxwell for a deposition, indicating significant interest from both the executive and legislative branches in what she might reveal. The DOJ's outreach follows criticism of its recent memo which concluded there was no "client list" and that Epstein died by suicide. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed discussions are underway and stated she would testify truthfully.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a pilot program to increase the security allowance for members of the House in response to growing threats against lawmakers. The program will provide an additional $20,000 for residential security and raise the monitoring allotment to $5,000 through the end of the fiscal year. This decision follows the recent shooting death of a congressional intern and separate shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers. Johnson stated the program's effectiveness will be evaluated in September to determine future security measures for members of Congress.</p>

Before her surgery, she recorded hours of audio, including children's books and curse words, which an AI company later used to build a vocal clone. Sotinsky now uses a text-to-speech app to communicate, advocating for better insurance coverage for such technologies, which are often not deemed a "medical necessity."

          <p>This opinion article laments the announced cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," viewing it as a significant blow to political commentary on network television. The author suggests that while CBS frames the decision as purely financial, it may be a "convenient sacrifice" to appease the Trump administration ahead of a major corporate merger. The piece argues that Colbert's program served a vital function in the Trump era by providing a mainstream platform for moral outrage and calling out falsehoods, a role traditional news often struggles to fill. Its loss represents a weakening of institutional checks on political power.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that a growing number of retirees are heavily dependent on Social Security for their income, with two-thirds now saying they rely on it substantially, up from half in 2005. This increased reliance comes as confidence in the program's future wanes, with many Americans worried it will not provide enough to live on. The study highlights a paradox where the program's importance is increasing while its long-term financial stability is in question, facing a potential 20% benefit cut in 2034 if no action is taken.

Although the Labour government suspended some arms export licenses, parts for the F-35 were exempt, creating what experts call an "enormous loophole."

          <p>As employees return to the office, companies are increasingly using technology to understand and improve workspace utilization, with some turning to body heat sensors. Startups like Butlr offer systems that use thermal sensors and AI to anonymously track occupancy, foot traffic, and interaction patterns without using cameras, thus protecting privacy. The data helps companies make informed decisions on office layout, hybrid work schedules, energy efficiency, and even lease negotiations. This focus on data-driven optimization comes as the costs for upgrading and redesigning office spaces continue to rise.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Commentary: The State of Comedy in an Era of Politicized Humor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 12:26:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical opinion piece critiques the current state of comedy, arguing that under the Trump administration, what is considered "funny" has become dangerously politicized. The author sardonically posits that "comedy is legal again," but only if it aligns with the president's views and targets his opponents, while criticism of the powerful is censored or punished. The article uses the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show and the promotion of pro-Trump comedians as examples. It concludes that humor is being weaponized, where laughter is coerced and used to enforce a power dynamic rather than create genuine connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has voiced serious concern after the Ukrainian parliament voted to strip two key anti-corruption bodies of their independence. The legislation places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) under the direct supervision of the Prosecutor General. The EU's enlargement commissioner warned that dismantling these safeguards is a "serious step back" and emphasized that the independence of these agencies is essential for Ukraine's path to EU membership. The move has also triggered strong criticism from anti-corruption activists within Ukraine.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he will meet with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm, Sweden, next week for a third round of high-level trade negotiations. The talks aim to build on previous discussions and could lead to an extension of the current pause on high tariffs that the two economic powers have aimed at each other. Since a call between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping in June, trade relations have shown signs of thawing.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has dismissed a proposed class-action lawsuit brought by eight Malian citizens against Hershey, Nestle, and other major chocolate companies over the use of child labor. The plaintiffs, who alleged they were forced to work on Ivory Coast cocoa farms, sued under a federal anti-trafficking law. However, the court ruled that they failed to plausibly link their forced labor on specific farms to the defendant companies, which buy cocoa from the region. The plaintiffs' lawyer expressed disappointment, stating the ruling rewards companies for concealing their supply chains.</p>

          <p>An ER doctor argues that recent legislative cuts to Medicaid, estimated at $1 trillion over a decade, will create a disaster for the nation's emergency medical system. The article contends that as millions lose coverage, they will increasingly rely on emergency rooms for care, which hospitals are legally obligated to provide regardless of ability to pay. This will strain already underfunded ERs, particularly in rural areas, leading to more hospital closures and service reductions. The author fears these changes will worsen health outcomes and increase medical debt for all Americans, not just the uninsured.</p>

Lammy described Israel's rejection of the statement as "hugely disappointing" and said the UK would consider further actions if Israel does not change its conduct in the war.

          <p>This analysis examines how recent legislation signed by President Trump will significantly impact the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), potentially making millions of Americans hungrier. The bill cuts federal spending by $186 billion over ten years, shifting the program's costs to individual states and tightening eligibility requirements. With the federal government no longer covering the full cost of benefits, states will face difficult choices, likely leading to reduced benefits or dropping people from the program. Food banks are already warning they cannot meet the anticipated increase in demand.</p>
