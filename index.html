          <p>Serious disorder broke out in Ballymena for a second night, with petrol bombs, bricks, bottles, and fireworks thrown at police after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. The protest was organized after two teenage boys appeared in court accused of the sexual assault of a teenage girl. Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Paul Frew expressed concerns that someone could be killed and that the violence was overshadowing sympathies for victims of sexual assault. Police used baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse protesters, with tensions reportedly rising due to concerns about illegal immigration, with some residents displaying signs indicating nationalities of those inside their homes. The situation underscores the complex interplay of social tensions and justice concerns within the community, resulting in a score of 25.</p>

          <p>According to attorney David Seltzer, while Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend's testimony reveals him as a "sexual deviant," it does not necessarily strengthen the prosecution's case in his federal trial for sex crimes. Seltzer believes the testimony depicts Combs as morally reprehensible but does not prove the charges he is facing. Former federal prosecutor Neahma Rahmani notes that the case hinges on whether the actions were coercive or consensual. The conflicting perspectives highlight the complexities of the case and the challenges of proving the government's claims, which results in a score of 40.</p>
