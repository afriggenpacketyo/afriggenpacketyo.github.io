          <p>A 28-year-old spearfisherman in Florida experienced a bull shark attack just minutes after telling his visiting family not to worry about the marine predators. The shark bit his leg while attempting to steal a fish he had just speared at a depth of 65 feet. Fortunately, the shark's teeth missed major arteries and ligaments, allowing him to make a swift recovery after receiving numerous stitches. The man remains in good spirits and plans to return to diving, hoping the incident raises awareness about the abundance of sharks in Florida waters.</p>

          <p>Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group, has strongly refuted a lawsuit filed by the artist Drake, labeling it "groundless and indeed ridiculous." Drake alleges that UMG, the parent company for both his and Kendrick Lamar's labels, defamed him and intentionally promoted Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us" to damage his career. Grainge countered by highlighting UMG's significant financial investment in Drake over the years, including a reported $400 million deal. The UMG chief denies any personal involvement in the marketing of Lamar's track, calling the lawsuit an absurd attempt to reframe a lost rap battle as a corporate conspiracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The horror film "Weapons," from writer-director Zach Cregger, is being praised for its daring narrative that provides definitive answers to its central mystery about a group of children who mysteriously vanish. The article explores how the movie reveals a witch as the villain and delivers a satisfying, albeit brutal, comeuppance at the hands of her child victims. However, the review notes that this cathartic victory does not erase the underlying trauma and grief experienced by the community. This dual nature makes "Weapons" a uniquely compelling "feel-bad, feel-good" film that offers genre thrills while acknowledging that true resolution from tragedy is complex.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced an investigation into Meta following a report that the company's internal guidelines permitted AI chatbots to engage in "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with children. Citing a Reuters report on an internal document, Hawley is demanding that CEO Mark Zuckerberg preserve all relevant materials for the probe. The investigation aims to determine if Meta's AI products enable child exploitation and whether the company misled the public about its safety measures. In response, Meta stated that the examples in the document were erroneous, inconsistent with its policies, and have since been removed.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it could become a major hurricane early next week. As of Friday, Hurricane Erin was located east of the northern Leeward Islands with sustained winds of 75 mph, making it a Category 1 storm. While the hurricane is not currently projected to make landfall in the United States, officials are urging Caribbean islands to monitor its progress due to the potential for heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. The storm's development comes as the hurricane season approaches its typical peak period from mid-August to mid-October.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Tax Foundation indicates that the tax breaks from President Trump's recently enacted "big beautiful bill" will vary significantly by state, with some residents poised for larger savings. In 2026, the average individual taxpayer is projected to save $3,752, with the highest average cuts seen in states like Wyoming, Washington, and Massachusetts. The report also highlights that resort areas such as Teton County, Wyoming, could see disproportionately large average tax cuts, skewed by high-income earners. Conversely, a separate Congressional Budget Office report suggests the legislation could benefit top earners while reducing resources for lower-income Americans through cuts to social programs.

          <p>A divided federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with its plan to lay off approximately 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The 2-1 decision states that a lower court did not have the jurisdiction to block the mass firings, effectively vacating a previous injunction. This ruling is a significant development in the administration's effort to dramatically reduce the size and scope of the consumer watchdog agency, which was created after the 2008 financial crisis. The decision will not take immediate effect, allowing time for an appeal from lawyers representing the agency's workers.</p>

This inner circle, which includes Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, allows Trump to act on his instincts without contrary viewpoints, a departure from his first term. This article, using the upcoming Putin summit as an example, suggests the more personalized approach increases the risk of unintended consequences and policy whiplash by limiting expert input. The White House defends the change, claiming it makes the administration more nimble and effective in executing the president's agenda.</p>

          <p>Environmental organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is improperly rewriting climate science to support its policy goals. The suit targets a recent Department of Energy (DOE) report, which was allegedly produced in secret by five scientists known for their skeptical views on climate change. Critics claim the report is filled with inaccuracies and misrepresents peer-reviewed research to downplay the harms of greenhouse gas emissions. The lawsuit argues this report is being used to justify the EPA's move to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which allows for the regulation of carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI chatbots is exacerbating the long-standing issue of fake quotes online, with authors and public figures increasingly being credited with things they never said. This article details the experiences of science-fiction author John Scalzi and the article's own writer, who both discovered AI-generated, fabricated quotes attributed to them circulating online. This phenomenon misleads readers and can damage the reputations of those being misquoted, as the AI-generated content is often plausible but inaccurate. The widespread, uncritical use of these tools risks turning everyday users into vectors of misinformation, further degrading the quality and trustworthiness of online information.</p>

Eligible customers, whose personal information including Social Security numbers was exposed, can now file claims for up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses. The settlement stems from class-action lawsuits filed after the breaches, one of which involved data being found on the dark web and the other an unlawful download from a third-party cloud platform.

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against the federal government following President Trump's move to place the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control. The suit challenges the legality of the takeover and the appointment of the DEA Administrator as an "emergency police commissioner" with authority over the local police chief. D.C.'s attorney general argues the move is an abuse of power that will create chaos within the police command structure and endanger public safety. The Trump administration has justified the intervention by citing a need to crack down on crime, a claim disputed by city officials and recent crime statistics.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force, Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to end the takeover.

Home Rule Act to assume control of the local police. The lawmakers contend the president's action is an unlawful attack on D.C.'s autonomy, based on a misleading narrative about the city's crime rate.

          <p>The Salford Red Devils rugby club has cancelled its upcoming Super League game against Wakefield, citing "significant" welfare concerns for its players. The decision was made in consultation with the Rugby Football League after the financially troubled club suffered an 80-6 defeat in a recent match where five debutants played. With most senior professionals having left due to the club's financial issues, Salford's available 17-player squad for the cancelled match included only two with recent Super League experience. The RFL board will now determine the official outcome of the fixture, while discussions continue about the club's ability to complete its remaining games this season.</p>

          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California, concentrated in the Geysers geothermal steam field across Sonoma and Lake counties. The largest tremor in the swarm registered a magnitude of 4.0, though most were much smaller. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such minor seismic activity is common in this area, which is home to a major geothermal power facility. The earthquakes are believed to be induced by the power generation process, which involves withdrawing steam from the volcanic field and injecting cool water, causing the surrounding rock to contract and shift.</p>

The timing of the offensive is seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to create a favorable information backdrop for the negotiations, suggesting Russia has the upper hand on the battlefield.
