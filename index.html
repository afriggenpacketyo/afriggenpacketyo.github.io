        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. The contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with annualized GDP contracting by 0.7%. While domestic demand showed strength by growing 0.6%, exports were significantly impacted by uncertainties arising from U.S. trade policies, overshadowing the competitive advantage gained from a weak yen. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current rates, awaiting more certainty in the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

Conversely, liberals have filed cases against the Trump administration in larger venues, predominantly in the 9th Circuit and increasingly in Massachusetts.

          <p>An internal review indicates that FEMA is ill-prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, which begins on June 1, due to staffing limitations, hiring challenges, and a lack of coordination with states. Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson acknowledged the agency is not fully prepared but is working to finalize a plan, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding the American people and returning primacy to the states. The review highlights concerns about the agency's smaller footprint and the understanding of its role during hurricane season, while a DHS spokesperson claims the information is out of context.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing the world's fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections estimating up to 115 million cases by 2050. The number of dementia patients in China rose from approximately 4 million in 1990 to 17 million in 2021, and is expected to continue increasing due to its rapidly aging population. Researchers from Fudan University analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease database and found that dementia incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates have doubled globally, but tripled in China between 1990 and 2021.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the season to protect the whales, but some fishermen are using experimental pop-up gear to minimize rope usage. This technology, originally developed by the U.S. military, allows fishermen to retrieve crab cages without long lines of rope, reducing the risk of whale entanglements. However, the cost of the new technology presents a financial challenge for fishermen.</p>
