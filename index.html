            <h2>Coroner Advocates for Mandatory Eye Exams for Older Drivers Following Fatal Accidents</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 02:53:40 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A coroner in Lancashire is urging the Transport Secretary to implement mandatory eye tests for older drivers, citing the current self-reporting system as "ineffective and unsafe." This recommendation follows inquests into the deaths of four individuals killed by drivers with impaired vision who failed to declare their conditions to the DVLA. The coroner highlighted that the UK has the laxest licensing system in Europe, relying solely on self-reporting and lacking visual checks for drivers under 70. Families of the victims expressed their grief and frustration, emphasizing that the tragedies were avoidable and calling for stricter enforcement of visual standards for motorists.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Analysts suggest that the recent earthquake in Myanmar may have disrupted the production of rare earth minerals crucial for manufacturing various technologies. Myanmar is a significant supplier of these minerals to China, which dominates global processing capacity. The earthquake could have damaged mining equipment, compromised mine safety, and obstructed transport routes, leading to concerns about supply shortages and price volatility. This disruption may force China to diversify its sources for these critical minerals, particularly dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-temperature magnets.</p>

            <p>Director James Cameron, known for films like "The Terminator," has shifted his perspective on artificial intelligence, now advocating for its integration into visual effects workflows to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Cameron joined the board of Stability AI to understand the technology better and find ways to double the speed of VFX completion. He believes AI can alleviate tedious tasks like rotoscoping, allowing artists to focus on more creative aspects of filmmaking. While acknowledging concerns about copyright and training data, Cameron suggests focusing on the output and monetization of AI-generated content rather than restricting the input.</p>

The report highlights that China still relies on foreign parts for its C919 airplane and that industrial automation is primarily driven by foreign technology.

            <p>A federal judge has blocked Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive Social Security records, citing privacy concerns. Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander stated that granting DOGE unlimited access to personally identifiable information would betray the government's commitment to citizens. The order prohibits DOGE members from accessing records containing personal information and installing software on SSA computer systems.

            <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to impose port fees on Chinese ships, aiming to revive shipbuilding in the US and challenge China's dominance in the industry. The fees will be based on cargo weight, container count, or vehicle numbers. The measures are less severe than previously proposed, and exemptions are included for certain vessels. The move has raised concerns about further disruptions to global trade, with some cargoes being redirected to European ports. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China.</p>
