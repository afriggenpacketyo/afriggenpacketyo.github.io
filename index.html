The meeting was requested by several European nations following the Israeli Security Cabinet's approval of the military operation expansion. This development occurs alongside other regional news, including a German poll indicating majority support for recognizing a Palestinian state and criticism from soccer star Mohamed Salah towards UEFA for its tribute to a slain Palestinian footballer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing numerous asylum applications, some filed years ago, for individuals who did not undergo a mandatory "credible fear" interview upon entering the US. Immigration lawyers report that dozens of clients have received notices terminating their cases, effectively revoking their work permits and leaving them in legal limbo. This policy stems from a backlog where the U.S. lacked sufficient asylum officers for screenings, and now applicants are being told to report to ICE to restart the process, facing a higher risk of detention.</p>

This significant shift in weather follows Storm Floris and is caused by warm air moving north from the continent.

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands of visitors arriving via new and existing ferry routes. This influx is boosting the local economy, as Turkish tourists find the island's relaxed atmosphere and affordability appealing compared to domestic holiday spots. Despite ongoing political tensions between Greece and Turkey over maritime borders and other issues, this cross-cultural exchange is seen as a positive force, building personal connections and goodwill between the two peoples.</p>

          <p>A research team in China, led by scientist Gao Caixia, has developed a new set of genome editing technologies that can precisely manipulate large DNA fragments in higher organisms like plants. Published in the journal *Cell*, this breakthrough, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), is significantly more efficient and easier to use than previous methods. The technology holds the potential to accelerate crop improvement, advance treatments for genetic diseases, and contribute to the development of artificial chromosomes for synthetic biology applications.</p>

          <p>Key European allies, including the UK, France, and Germany, have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace talks between the US and Russia must involve Ukraine. The statement came ahead of a planned summit between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, where Trump has suggested he might negotiate territorial exchanges. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected any agreements made without Kyiv's participation, calling them "dead decisions" and reaffirming that Ukraine's borders are not to be changed by force.</p>

Initially, Matthew Ecker, who was with Pennig when she died, claimed she had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide. However, investigators found the metal lock component underneath Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forcibly broken open *before* she was shot and fell.

          <p>The man who killed a police officer during an attack on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta had reportedly told family and neighbors that the COVID-19 vaccine made him depressed and suicidal. The 30-year-old gunman was stopped from entering the CDC building before he opened fire, killing Officer David Rose who was responding to the incident. The attacker also died at the scene. The event has drawn renewed attention to the real-world consequences of anti-vaccine rhetoric and attacks on scientific institutions.</p>
