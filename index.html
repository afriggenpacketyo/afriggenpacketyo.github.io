          <p>Actress Emma Watson, known for her role in the "Harry Potter" series, recently shared her reasons for stepping back from acting, citing the promotional side of Hollywood as "soul-destroying." While expressing gratitude for her career, she explained that the constant "selling" of projects overshadowed the artistic parts of the job she genuinely enjoyed. Watson noted that this shift away from maintaining a demanding public persona has freed up significant energy, allowing her to be more present in her personal relationships and explore other creative and intellectual pursuits.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced that the FDA will advise physicians about a potential link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. This announcement was met with strong opposition from medical experts and Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, who cite comprehensive studies showing no causal link and emphasize that acetaminophen remains the safest pain reliever for pregnant women. The administration also announced the approval of leucovorin, a drug derived from folic acid, for treating some autism symptoms, though experts note it is not a universal remedy.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to negotiate a funding deal and avert a government shutdown. The meeting follows the failure of competing Republican and Democratic funding proposals in the Senate, with the September 30 deadline fast approaching. Democrats have insisted that any short-term funding bill must address their healthcare priorities, while Republicans argue their proposal is clean of controversial provisions. Both the House and Senate have left Washington, increasing pressure to reach an agreement to keep the government operational.</p>

          <p>Deion Sanders appeared to confirm that his son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, turned down interest from the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles during the 2025 NFL draft before being selected by the Cleveland Browns. Shedeur reportedly did not want to be a long-term backup to established star quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson or Jalen Hurts. Despite being considered a potential first-round pick, he fell to the fifth round. Deion Sanders defended his son's desire for a direct path to playing, stating that players don't develop by sitting on the bench in the NFL.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to ABC on Tuesday, nearly a week after the show was suspended indefinitely. The suspension followed comments the host made linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's MAGA movement, which prompted major affiliate station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to threaten preemption. Disney stated the decision to bring the show back was made after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel, who is expected to address the situation on his return. The incident sparked a national debate on free speech and political pressure on media networks.</p>

While sometimes helpful, these techniques can feel like a gimmick to boost engagement, which provides AI companies with valuable training data and fosters product loyalty. This evolution from "clickbait" to "chatbait" raises concerns about user manipulation and the potential for prolonged, sometimes unhealthy, interactions with AI systems.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a new $100,000 fee for initial H-1B visa applications, causing significant confusion among immigrant workers and their employers. The White House clarified that the fee is a one-time cost for new applicants and does not apply to current visa holders or renewals. However, immigration attorneys express concern over gray areas, such as whether current visa holders who travel abroad while an extension is pending could be affected. The policy is intended to encourage companies to hire American workers but is expected to have a chilling effect on the recruitment of skilled foreign labor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sense of unease is reportedly growing within the Justice Department as President Trump publicly directs the agency to investigate his political adversaries, such as former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. This follows the recent departure of a top federal prosecutor in Virginia who reportedly resisted pressure to pursue charges desired by the president. Former DOJ attorneys and legal experts express concern that these actions erode the rule of law and the department's traditional independence, creating fear among career employees and blurring the lines between legal and political motivations.</p>

The lawsuit also alleges that Amazon made the cancellation process for Prime intentionally complicated. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing, stating that it has always prioritized its customers, and a jury will decide the outcome of the case.</p>
