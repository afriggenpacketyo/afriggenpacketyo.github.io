          <p>Synopsys, a semiconductor design software firm, has retracted its full-year guidance following a notification from the U.S. Commerce Department regarding restrictions on product sales in China, causing a stock decline of approximately 3%. CEO Sassine Ghazi had previously refuted reports of White House directives to cease sales to Chinese clients. The company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the BIS letter on its business operations and financial health, acknowledging a slowdown in China during the fiscal second quarter. Synopsys had been communicating the cumulative impact of restrictions and the macro situation in China, which has intensified over the past year and a half, leading to the guidance suspension.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell met with President Trump at the White House to discuss economic growth, following Trump's repeated calls for lower interest rates. Powell emphasized that the Fed's decisions would be based on "careful, objective, and nonpolitical analysis" and would support maximum employment and stable prices, adhering to the Fed's dual mandate. He clarified that policy adjustments would depend on incoming economic data and its implications for the outlook. This meeting occurred amidst ongoing tariff uncertainties and a recent court ruling against Trump's broad-based tariffs, which are contributing to inflationary pressures as retailers raise consumer prices.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., sided with Learning Resources, Inc., a Chicago-area toy company, by blocking five executive orders signed by President Trump that imposed tariffs on Chinese imports. Judge Rudolph Contreras determined that the International Economic Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize Trump to impose these tariffs. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, which is stayed for 14 days pending a potential appeal by the administration. The ruling comes after the U.S. Court of International Trade also found the administration overstepped its authority over tariffs under IEEPA, asserting that Congress has the exclusive power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.</p>

Kenneth Genalo, who leads Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), will retire, and Robert Hammer, head of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), will be reassigned. The White House has been pressuring ICE to increase arrests of migrants living in the U.S. illegally, with Stephen Miller advocating for a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day.

Benioff defends his strategy, emphasizing the company's pivot to Agentforce, its AI agent solution, which now generates over $100 million in annual recurring revenue.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that significant glacier shrinkage is inevitable over the next few centuries, regardless of climate mitigation strategies. Even if global temperatures stabilize at current levels, glaciers outside of ice sheets are projected to lose approximately one-third of their mass. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels could preserve twice as much ice compared to a 2.7-degree Celsius warming scenario. The research emphasizes that every tenth of a degree reduction in warming will help preserve glacial ice, highlighting the importance of ambitious climate measures to minimize the most severe losses.</p>

          <p>Julius Jordan Priester, a 24-year-old man from Kansas, has been charged with interference with flight crew members and attendants after allegedly disrupting an American Airlines flight. Priester reportedly stood up, removed his shirt, and ran to the back of the plane yelling "Help me," before grabbing a flight attendant and attempting to drag the attendant up the aisle. Other passengers and staff intervened, and the flight was diverted back to Bradley International Airport, where Priester was removed by Connecticut State Police. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk reportedly tried to disrupt a major artificial intelligence infrastructure deal in the Middle East after learning that his startup, xAI, was excluded from the initiative.

Musk, a vocal critic of OpenAI and Sam Altman, argued that President Trump would not approve the deal without xAI's involvement, causing delays.
