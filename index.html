            <p>Airlines are increasingly relying on affluent leisure travelers to maintain revenue as economic clouds gather. Delta and Frontier have adjusted their 2025 outlooks due to a murky economic picture and weaker near-term demand, especially in domestic coach travel. To counter this, airlines are investing in premium seating options and expanding airport lounges, hoping wealthier customers will continue to spend on pricier travel experiences. While international routes and premium seats show resilience, problems are brewing in international travel as well, with Delta and United paring back some Canada-U.S. flights due to falling demand.</p>

Locals and environmental groups expressed outrage, highlighting the importance of protecting ancient trees and calling for stronger legal protections. Police have received a report of criminal damage, while the pub chain maintains it acted to protect employees and the public, using trusted professional contractors.</p>

            <p>Financial experts suggest keeping a small amount of cash at home for emergencies like power outages or natural disasters, but caution against hoarding large sums. Amounts between $300 to $1,000 are considered reasonable by planners like Matthew Saneholtz and Crystal McKeon. However, experts like Melissa Caro advise against over-reliance on physical cash due to lack of FDIC insurance and potential for loss or theft. Nicole Sullivan warns that having too much cash on hand can lead to impulse spending, and McKeon advises discretion when storing cash at home. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump suggested sending 'homegrown criminals' to El Salvador, which is already receiving US deportees and housing them in a mega-prison notorious for human rights abuses. Legal experts have widely condemned the idea as illegal and unconstitutional, citing the lack of any provision in US law allowing the deportation of citizens. The US currently pays El Salvador $6 million to house alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang.</p>

He had previously expressed concern over the White House's actions against universities, urging them to stand up against intimidation and defend academic freedom, even if it meant sacrificing financial resources.

The Trump administration claims he is a member of MS-13, but has provided little evidence, while paying El Salvador $6 million to house deported migrants. The Supreme Court has ruled that the administration must 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release, but the administration argues it lacks the authority to extract him from El Salvador.</p>

This assignment is considered dangerous, as Russia has used ex-convict forces for high-casualty missions. While some believe Putin may intervene, the assignment could be a propaganda move or a de facto death sentence for Popov, who commanded nearly 50,000 troops before his reassignment.</p>

            <p>Gayle King, co-host of 'CBS Mornings,' traveled to the edge of space with an all-women crew on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket, overcoming her admitted fear of flying. To prepare, King invited a meditation teacher to her home and attended astronaut training sessions at Blue Origin's facility in Texas. She also brought her grandson's favorite stuffed toy, Tamir, on the journey. King described the experience as 'peaceful' and 'oddly quiet' and expressed pride in conquering her fears, stating she now feels she can take on anything.</p>

            <p>A man shot and killed a grizzly bear in Montana after the animal charged at him at close range while he was shed hunting. The bear was an adult female with a yearling cub and no history of conflict, but charged as the man was leaving the area. The man was uninjured, and officials said no action will be taken regarding the cub. Grizzly bear populations are becoming more dense and widespread in the state, increasing the chances of human-grizzly interactions, so officials recommend taking precautions such as traveling in groups and carrying bear spray.</p>

            <p>Two Belgian teenagers and two others were charged in Kenya with wildlife piracy after being found with thousands of ants packed in test tubes, part of a trend in trafficking smaller species. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said the four were trafficking ants to markets in Europe and Asia, including messor cephalotes, a large harvester ant native to East Africa. KWS stated that the illegal export undermines Kenya's biodiversity and deprives local communities of economic benefits. Experts warn of the risk of trafficking species and exporting diseases to the agricultural industry of destination countries.</p>

            <p>Birmingham City Council states it is on track to clear a backlog of uncollected waste by the weekend, despite an ongoing strike with the Unite union, prioritizing collections in the poorest parts of the city. While normal household waste collections have resumed, garden waste and recycling collections remain suspended until the strike ends. The dispute centers around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles from some bin workers, with workers rejecting the latest offer and expressing concerns about potential pay cuts. Residents have expressed increasing frustration, while national government ministers have urged Unite to call off the strike.</p>

            <p>Arkansas has requested the U.S. Department of Agriculture to allow it to ban soda and candy from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), becoming the first state to do so.

            <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status after his administration froze over $2 billion in federal funds, demanding changes to hiring, admissions, and teaching practices to combat antisemitism. Harvard rejected the White House demands, accusing the administration of trying to 'control' its community. Trump accused Harvard of pushing political, ideological, and terrorist-inspired sickness and not acting in the public interest. Experts argue that the school can afford to resist, and that no price is too high to pay for freedom.</p>

            <p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's awkward photo op in the Oval Office, hiding behind binders during Trump's signing of executive orders, encapsulates Democratic dysfunction. While her visit was defensible, she is being criticized for enabling Trump, highlighting the party's disarray. Democrats are struggling due to the perception of being the party of urban elites, with voters distrustful of elite institutions. One suggestion is to 'play dead' and wait for Trump to self-immolate, although a long-term solution requires a party that builds a majority from the center-out.</p>

            <p>The Dodgers' celebration of Jackie Robinson Day feels insincere after their recent visit to President Trump, undermining their past actions against racial injustice. While the team protested racial injustice in 2020, they are now seen as prioritizing baseball over stimulating important conversations. Mookie Betts, the Dodgers' lone African American player, acknowledged the changed social climate, stating it's a 'tough spot to be in.' Critics argue that the Dodgers are missing an opportunity to regain their stature as agents of change, and are instead engaging in a cynical exercise in stealing the valor of a previous generation.</p>

            <p>States are increasingly pushing for Medicaid work requirements, but few programs exist to effectively help enrollees find jobs, raising concerns that the mandate would simply remove eligible people from Medicaid rather than improve their economic prospects. While some states are implementing incentives for job training, health plans may not have the incentive to help people find better-paying jobs, as that could mean losing customers. Some states require Medicaid insurance companies to help enrollees find work, but data tracking the effectiveness of these job programs is limited. Experts emphasize the need for a ladder, not a stick, to improve economic mobility.</p>

            <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) has cut its forecast for global oil demand growth by a third due to the 'substantial risks' posed by Donald Trump's trade tariffs. The agency warns of further downward revisions if a trade war develops, citing concerns that the tariffs could stoke inflation, slow economic growth, and intensify trade disputes. The falling oil market prices triggered by the tariffs could also upend Trump's promise to expand the US oil and gas industry, as US shale producers need higher prices to drill new wells. The IEA has revised down its forecasts for US oil production growth this year.</p>
