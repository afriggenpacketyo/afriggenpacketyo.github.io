          <p>Recent laws, including a significant tax and spending package, are enhancing Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts. These tax-advantaged savings plans allow people with disabilities to save money without losing eligibility for government benefits like Medicaid or Social Security. Starting in 2026, the ABLE Age Adjustment Act will raise the age of disability onset for eligibility from 26 to 46, expanding access to millions more Americans, including veterans. The changes also allow rollovers from 529 college savings plans and improve tax credits for low-income savers, providing greater financial security.</p>

The embryo was created via IVF in 1994 and donated by the original mother through a Christian embryo adoption agency. The new parents had struggled with infertility for seven years before choosing to adopt the embryo. This remarkable event surpasses the previous record set in 2022 and highlights significant advancements in reproductive technology.</p>

          <p>The funeral for Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent former Conservative cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, was held at the cathedral in Bury St Edmunds, where he lived. Lord Tebbit, who passed away at 94, was remembered for his political career and his devotion to his wife, Margaret, who was left permanently paralyzed after the 1984 IRA bombing in Brighton. Tributes from family and political figures like Sir Iain Duncan Smith highlighted his character, describing him as kind, passionate, and a great servant to his country. The service acknowledged the daily pain he endured from his own injuries sustained in the bombing.</p>

          <p>Gintautas Paluckas, the Prime Minister of Lithuania, has resigned from his position following public protests and political pressure over investigations into his past business dealings. The resignation came after the country's president gave him a two-week ultimatum and a smaller party in the ruling coalition threatened to leave. Anti-corruption agencies are probing several scandals, including a conviction from 2012 for which he allegedly failed to pay the full fine and a more recent issue involving a subsidized loan to a company he co-founded. Paluckas has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the accusations are a coordinated political attack.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County that destroyed thousands of buildings, survivors are increasingly using modular homes to rebuild their lives more quickly. The article highlights the story of one couple who lost their home in the Eaton Fire and chose a startup that builds accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in a factory. This approach offers a faster alternative to traditional construction, which can be mired in paperwork and delays. The use of prefabricated, modular housing represents an innovative solution to the urgent need for housing following natural disasters.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Economist characterizes Donald Trump's approach to redistricting as a profoundly cynical political maneuver. The article suggests that this strategy is part of a broader pattern of political hardball that has left the Democratic party struggling to find effective counter-measures. It portrays Democrats as trying to adopt a "fighter" persona to appeal to their base but often failing to secure meaningful victories against a unified Republican government. The piece frames the current political landscape as one where Democrats are outmaneuvered, holding an approval rating lower than Trump's himself.</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan are reportedly in discussions about potential scenarios involving the use of American nuclear weapons in an East Asian conflict, signaling a move to strengthen the US nuclear umbrella over Japan. This development comes amid heightened military activities from China, North Korea, and Russia. The talks build upon the "Guidelines for Extended Deterrence" adopted in December, which emphasize better communication regarding US nuclear capabilities. Analysts suggest that a stronger US commitment might ease Japan's concerns about defending Taiwan, though it is expected to provoke a negative reaction from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Figma, a collaborative design software company, has priced its initial public offering at $33 per share, exceeding its initial forecast of $30 to $32. The IPO raised $1.2 billion and values the San Francisco-based company at $19.3 billion. This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory opposition, which resulted in a $1 billion termination fee paid to Figma. The successful pricing indicates a gradually reopening market for tech IPOs, following other strong debuts earlier in the year.</p>

          <h2>Brief Radar Failure in UK Air Traffic Control System Causes Widespread Flight Disruptions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 20-minute radar problem at the UK's National Air Traffic Services (NATS) on Wednesday caused extensive flight cancellations and delays that have persisted into the following day. The brief outage forced NATS to reduce air traffic for safety, leading to chaos at airports across the country. Airlines like Ryanair and Easyjet have heavily criticized NATS, noting this is the second major system failure since 2023. Experts explain that even a short failure in a critical system like radar degrades the entire network's capacity, comparing the effect to a motorway suddenly shrinking to a country lane during peak traffic.</p>

          <p>A late-stage clinical trial by Eli Lilly showed its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, offers significant heart health benefits when compared directly to its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke by 8% in adults with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. While not statistically superior on this primary goal, Mounjaro also demonstrated a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and provided greater kidney protection. These results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for this high-risk patient population.</p>

          <p>Officials in Beijing have confirmed that the death toll from recent severe flooding has reached 44, with a tragic incident at a nursing home accounting for 31 of the fatalities. The nursing home, located in the mountainous Miyun district, was submerged by fast-moving floodwaters. According to a local official, the facility housed 77 people, including 55 who were incapacitated, and was not previously considered to be in a high-risk flood zone, so its residents were not included in evacuation plans. The rapid and powerful floodwaters made rescue efforts extremely difficult, leading to the high number of deaths.</p>

While he expressed confidence that an agreement would be finalized, he noted that some technical details still need to be resolved and that President Trump has not yet personally signed off on it. The statement comes as an August 12 deadline approaches to end a temporary truce in the ongoing tariff dispute between the two economic powers. The U.S. has been negotiating for a deal while also expressing concerns over China's trade practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it in May due to uncertainty over tariffs. The new outlook includes an estimated $2 billion net impact from these import duties, which is part of a total $3 billion hit partially offset by mitigation efforts. The company's updated guidance projects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion, which is lower than its pre-tariff forecast. Ford executives stated they are in near-daily communication with the Trump administration regarding the tariffs, particularly those on steel and aluminum. (not investment advice)</p>

The initiative, which began as a solo act of kindness, has grown into a warehouse operation, providing a small measure of comfort and connection for families who have suffered immense loss, including those whose children died at a nearby summer camp.</p>

          <p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has officially confirmed a new world record for the longest single lightning flash, which stretched an astonishing 515 miles across the U.S. Great Plains in October 2017. The massive bolt extended from east Texas to near Kansas City, Missouri. This record, along with another for the longest duration flash (17.1 seconds over South America), was identified using advanced space-based mapping technology from geostationary satellites. These findings underscore that lightning can travel extremely long distances from its parent thunderstorm, reinforcing safety advice to seek shelter immediately during lightning storms.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented recall vote in Taiwan targeting 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers has failed, with none of the legislators losing their seats. The campaign, led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), had framed the issue as a battle to "resist China, protect Taiwan," accusing the lawmakers of undermining national security. Analysts suggest that the failure of the recall has temporarily eased tensions with Beijing, as a successful recall could have been interpreted by mainland China as a sign of rising anti-China sentiment, potentially leading to a more confrontational stance. However, the outcome still leaves a new layer of political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has denied disaster assistance requests for three Kentucky counties that were hit by severe storms last spring, claiming the damage was not severe enough to warrant federal support. This decision is part of a broader pattern of denials from the agency, as the Trump administration aims to shift more of the financial burden of disaster recovery to the states. The move has drawn criticism from state officials, who plan to appeal the decision, and highlights growing concerns about the under-resourcing of FEMA amid escalating climate-related catastrophes.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved a White House request to rescind $7.9 billion in previously allocated foreign aid, but the specific impact of the cuts remains unclear, causing confusion among aid organizations. The rescission package targets broad categories like "global health" and "development assistance" without detailing which specific programs will be eliminated. The largest cuts are to long-term development and economic support funds, which experts say are crucial for building resilience and preventing future crises. The package also includes a significant cut to core funding for UNICEF, a move that surprised many in the aid community.</p>
