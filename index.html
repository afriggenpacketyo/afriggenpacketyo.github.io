          <p>A court has found Apple in contempt for willfully violating a 2021 injunction from the Epic Games case, with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers accusing Apple Vice President of Finance Alex Roman of lying under oath about the company's decision to levy a 27% fee on some purchases linked to its App Store. Rogers stated that Apple deliberately tried to violate her ruling by introducing new policies that collected commissions on off-app purchases, and accused Apple of withholding documents and abusing privilege to conceal its real decision-making process. The judge ordered Apple to immediately stop imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps and to pay Epic Games' attorney fees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, a sharp downturn from the previous quarter's 2.4% growth. This slowdown is attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of President Trump's tariff policies, which led to increased imports and decreased government spending due to cuts implemented by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. While economists caution that the figures may be skewed by the surge in imports, the data has heightened concerns about a potential recession, further compounded by weak ADP employment numbers. The Federal Reserve may delay rate cuts in response to the economic data, as analysts forecast a potential rebound in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced the creation of a reconstruction and investment fund, intended to give the U.S. access to proceeds from Ukraine’s reserves of minerals. The agreement concludes months of negotiations addressing President Trump’s concerns that the United States has provided Kyiv with a blank check to withstand to Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote that the two countries would have equal voting rights over the fund and that Ukraine would retain full control over its subsoil, infrastructure and natural resources. The deal had been delayed after an explosive meeting in the Oval Office in late February between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly contacted El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele regarding the detention of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was wrongly deported to a Salvadorian prison. The Supreme Court had ordered the administration to return Ábrego García to the US so that he would face immigration proceedings as he would have, had he not been sent to El Salvador. Bukele rejected the outreach, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the administration's foreign policy is the president's domain, not the courts'. Trump himself deflected responsibility, stating his lawyers advised against calling Bukele, raising questions about potential contempt of court.</p>

CEO Satya Nadella had previously announced plans for Microsoft to invest $80 billion in fiscal 2025 to construct data centers capable of handling artificial intelligence workloads. The Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, generated $26.75 billion in revenue, marking an increase of around 21%.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student with a green card, has been released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order in Vermont. Mahdawi was detained on April 16 during his U.S. citizenship interview, leading his attorneys to argue that the Trump administration was targeting him for his pro-Palestinian activism on campus, violating his First Amendment rights. Judge Geoffrey Crawford sided with Mahdawi, citing concerns about the government's chilling efforts to suppress debate, drawing parallels to McCarthyism. The Justice Department intends to appeal the court order, while the State Department has previously revoked visas of students involved in pro-Palestinian protests, alleging antisemitism.</p>

          <p>An effort in the Senate to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed, with Republicans largely opposing the measure. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, would have terminated the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. Despite the vote, anxieties remain high over the economic impact of the tariffs, with economic growth slowing in the first quarter of 2025. House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road, but ultimately believes the tariff policy will achieve the desired outcome.</p>

Despite promises to resolve conflicts, the war between Russia and Ukraine continues, and efforts to broker peace in other regions have sputtered.

Mexico is also accepting deportees from third-party countries, but the legal status and care for these migrants remain unclear. The Mexican government is reportedly preventing large numbers of migrants from being seen at the border to avoid reflecting poorly on the Trump administration.</p>

While Carney campaigned heavily on standing up to Trump, younger voters were more focused on economic issues, suggesting a divergence in priorities between generations. The Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats, but the Conservatives also made significant gains, preventing the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.</p>
