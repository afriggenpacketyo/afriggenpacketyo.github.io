          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, alleging antitrust violations regarding its App Store. He claims Apple is unfairly favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT, making it difficult for other AI companies like his own, xAI, to achieve top rankings for their products, such as the Grok chatbot. This legal threat adds to Apple's existing antitrust challenges, including a major lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem. Musk's action also continues his public feud with OpenAI, a company he co-founded.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa has affirmed the company's commitment to its S$6.8 billion expansion plan, despite receiving a shortened two-year casino license renewal from Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority. The regulator cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance, but the resort is moving forward with new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium. The CEO emphasized a strategic shift towards experiential offerings over traditional shopping to transform the resort into a premium lifestyle destination.

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along the coast of Western Australia have experienced their most severe bleaching event on record, following a prolonged and intense marine heatwave. The damage spans approximately 1,500 kilometers and affects areas previously considered resilient to climate change, such as the Ningaloo and Kimberley reefs. This local event is part of a global coral bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures. The Australian Institute of Marine Science has confirmed the unprecedented severity, highlighting the escalating impact of climate heating on vital marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to extend their trade truce for an additional 90 days, suspending the implementation of significantly higher tariffs that were set to take effect. This extension, confirmed by a US presidential executive order, keeps US tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on US goods at 10%. The move provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the US terms "unfair trade practices." Despite the truce, trade flows between the two economic giants have already seen a considerable decline this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists in Mexico City are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to search for the critically endangered axolotl in the canals of Xochimilco. With the salamander population having plummeted from thousands per square kilometer to just a few dozen, traditional net surveys often come up empty. By filtering water and searching for genetic particles shed by the creatures, researchers can detect their presence even when they are not physically seen. This technique offers a glimmer of hope, confirming the axolotl's survival in some protected refuge areas and guiding conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Nigerian military reports that it has killed more than 100 members of an armed gang in a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara. The operation was launched after intelligence indicated that over 400 gang members, locally referred to as "bandits," were preparing to attack a village. These armed groups have been terrorizing communities in the region, engaging in kidnapping for ransom and other violent crimes. Despite repeated military offensives, the violence has persisted, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis in the area.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump's federal takeover of the D.C. police and deployment of the National Guard represents a move towards authoritarianism, based on a false narrative of rampant crime. The author points out that violent crime in D.C. is actually down significantly, contrasting with the administration's outdated or misleading statistics. The piece criticizes the move as a political stunt that sets a dangerous precedent for using military force in American cities, drawing parallels to the illiberal actions of leaders like El Salvador's Nayib Bukele.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented on the Trump administration's deal requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Cramer argued the move is not novel, framing it as "just another form of tariff" where the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. While acknowledging a "debatable" pay-to-play element, he suggested the decision to allow the sales is more significant than the revenue cut. He concluded that the deal is beneficial for both the taxpayers and the chipmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 1,000 firefighters are battling major wildfires in Colorado, including the Lee fire, which has become the fifth-largest in the state's history. Burning through more than 130,000 acres, the Lee fire remains only 7% contained, with gusty winds and dry conditions expected to fuel its growth. Another significant blaze, the Elk fire, has scorched over 14,000 acres but is 30% contained. The fires have prompted evacuations and air quality warnings, contributing to an already explosive fire season across North America.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks President Trump's justification for the federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police, arguing it is based on false narratives about crime, similar to his previous actions in Los Angeles. The piece highlights that contrary to the president's claims, violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, with significant decreases in homicides and carjackings in 2024. Experts cited in the article note that community-led interventions have been more effective at reducing youth violence than punitive crackdowns, and that unhoused individuals are more often victims than perpetrators of crime.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned it is at risk of collapse in a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission. The complaint alleges misuse of public funds and a "toxic internal culture," and comes after the UK's Technology Secretary threatened to withdraw funding unless the institute pivots its focus to defense and national security research. This government pressure has reportedly triggered a "crisis in governance" at the institute, which was founded in 2015 to be a leading center for AI research.</p>

Carter, who was herself a target of online racism during the tournament, spoke about how the abuse made her feel "small" and "scared to play." The Football Association has referred the abuse to the police, and Carter highlighted the devastating psychological impact it has on players.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old missing person case was solved after the killer's new girlfriend used a Red Bull can to mark the location of the victim's shallow grave. Alexander McKellar confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had fatally struck cyclist Tony Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, she secretly dropped the can as a marker and later alerted the police. The victim's son praised Muirhead's "remarkable foresight," which was crucial in bringing his father's body home and securing justice.</p>
