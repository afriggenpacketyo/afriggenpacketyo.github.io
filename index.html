          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a temporary loss of radar and communications with aircraft, causing significant flight delays. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association attributed the incident to equipment failure and chronic understaffing at the facility. United Airlines announced it would cut 35 daily flights from Newark to alleviate disruptions. The FAA acknowledged the antiquated air traffic control system and is working to improve telecommunications equipment reliability in the New York area. The union refuted claims that controllers walked off the job, stating that workers took time off under the Federal Employees Compensation Act due to the traumatic nature of the event.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are pushing for stricter regulations on cryptocurrency legislation due to concerns about fraud, money laundering, and the Trump family's involvement in the crypto industry. This New York Times article highlights that Senator Chuck Schumer advised colleagues against supporting the GENIUS Act, citing potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's crypto business, World Liberty Financial. World Liberty Financial recently secured a $2 billion deposit deal from an Emirati venture fund, raising ethical questions. The proposed legislation aims to facilitate U.S. companies' involvement in stablecoins, but Democrats worry about insufficient safeguards against money laundering and the potential for the Trump family to profit from the industry.</p>

          <p>Indian textile producers are facing increased competition from cheaper Chinese viscose yarn imports, exacerbated by Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods entering the U.S. This has led to production slowdowns in India's textile hubs, causing concern among mill owners. While China's Ambassador to India has assured that his country will not engage in dumping, anxieties persist across various sectors in India. India's trade ministry has established a committee to monitor the influx of cheap Chinese goods and has imposed taxes on some steel imports. Despite efforts to boost local manufacturing, India remains heavily reliant on China for intermediate goods.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, outdated technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors.

United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily at Newark to mitigate the disruptions.

This action violated a 2014 plea agreement in which Credit Suisse admitted to helping U.S. taxpayers hide offshore accounts.

          <p>President Trump's recent remarks questioning the need to uphold the Constitution during deportation efforts have sparked controversy. This New York Times article details how Trump expressed uncertainty about due process rights for undocumented immigrants, indicating a belief that the legal system should not impede immediate deportations. Critics argue that this stance undermines constitutional principles and the independence of the judiciary. Trump's administration has faced legal setbacks in its deportation policies, including a federal judge barring the use of the Alien Enemies Act and a Supreme Court ruling that was ignored by the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order restricting federal funding for 'gain-of-function' research, which involves experimenting with pathogens to understand their potential to cause pandemics. The move comes amid ongoing debate about the origins of COVID-19 and the risks associated with such research. The order blocks U.S. funding for gain-of-function research in countries of concern, such as China and Iran, and empowers American research agencies to identify and end funding for biological research posing a threat to public health. Supporters argue the restriction is necessary to prevent future pandemics, while critics worry it could hinder crucial research needed to respond to emerging health threats.</p>

The administration argues that the program will save money by avoiding the costs of arrest, detention, and government-chartered flights. The money will be paid after migrants confirm their travel home through a government app. The administration has also engaged in policies to make life uncomfortable for those in the country without legal status, like cutting off certain migrants from access to financial services.</p>

          <p>OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan to address concerns about its mission and control. The company will remain under the control of its non-profit board but will become a public benefit corporation. This update comes after criticism from co-founder Elon Musk and others who argued that OpenAI's pursuit of growth was compromising its original mission of benefiting humanity. The non-profit will receive a significant stake in OpenAI's business arm, providing access to funds for its goals, while the new structure will allow the company to raise money more easily.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to 8 years. The study, which examined over 1 million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events in those who received the vaccine. The protective effect was more pronounced in men, younger individuals, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. Researchers suggest that preventing shingles may reduce blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation, thereby lowering the risk of heart disease.</p>
