          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential bomb within a matter of months. This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi noted caused severe but not total damage. His analysis contradicts claims that the program was completely destroyed, highlighting that Iran's industrial and technological capabilities remain intact, posing an ongoing challenge for international diplomacy and non-proliferation efforts.</p>

          <p>A week after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the extent of the damage. Initial claims of the sites being "obliterated" were later tempered and contrasted with preliminary intelligence reports suggesting the setback to Iran's program was only a matter of months. This shifting narrative, along with changing justifications for the mission, has sparked ongoing questions regarding the attack's true impact and strategic goals.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that California's public and cultural identity has been shaped by a narrative that erases the authentic and often brutal history of its Indigenous peoples. The author points to examples from visitor guides to restaurant menus in Berkeley that skip from a romanticized pre-colonial past to the arrival of Europeans, ignoring the genocide and resistance that occurred. The article criticizes institutions like UC Berkeley for perpetuating this historical amnesia and calls for a more accurate representation of the state's past.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites is analyzed as a reflection of President Trump's distinct military doctrine, which favors discrete, high-impact strikes over sustained campaigns. The article traces the evolution of his approach from his first term, noting his aversion to "endless wars" but willingness to authorize high-risk, one-off operations. This "One-and-Done" strategy, carried out by a more compliant team of advisers, is seen as a defining feature of his command, though its long-term effectiveness remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The surprisingly cautious reactions from China and Russia following the recent US and Israeli strikes on Iran reveal the practical limits of their anti-American alliance. Despite shared antagonism toward the West, both Beijing and Moscow prioritized their own economic and diplomatic interests over providing significant support to their partner. This suggests that when global stability is at risk, the bonds of this axis are weaker than often portrayed, and that China is unlikely to jeopardize its relationship with the West for its allies.</p>

The quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a problem that persisted for decades and still exists in some areas.

          <p>New tariffs on Chinese goods are creating significant disruption for the U.S. wedding dress industry, as approximately 90% of gowns are manufactured in China. Brides and boutique owners are now facing unexpected surcharges, price hikes, and budget uncertainty, turning the intimate process of choosing a dress into a discussion of global trade policy. The price instability is causing hesitation among buyers and forcing designers and retailers to pass on costs or absorb losses, threatening to shutter some businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markus SÃ¶der, the state premier of Bavaria, has called for Germany to establish a massive protective shield modeled on Israel's "Iron Dome," including 2,000 Patriot systems and a 100,000-strong drone army. This call for a significant military buildup, which also includes more tanks and cruise missiles, reflects a growing sense of threat in Germany. The proposal comes as another German official, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, expressed unqualified support for Israel's recent military strikes against Iran.</p>

          <p>Samuel Woodward, a former high school classmate of Blaze Bernstein, has been convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, a member of the violent neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, was motivated by hate when he stabbed the 19-year-old college student to death because Bernstein was gay and Jewish. The verdict concludes a six-year legal process, with Woodward now facing a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
