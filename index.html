          <p>China is adopting a new soft power strategy by sponsoring Kenyan social media influencers to visit and create content about the country. This digital-first approach targets Gen Z and Millennial audiences in Africa, aiming to reshape China's public image through cultural and tourism promotion.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's approach to Latin America is impulsive and lacks a clear strategic plan, characterized by bullying tactics and threats of military intervention. The author points to recent actions against Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico's drug cartels as examples of a regressive policy that revives an interventionist doctrine. This approach is seen as counterproductive, potentially strengthening authoritarian leaders, alienating regional allies, and ultimately benefiting strategic rivals like China.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors, including members of unions and immigrant rights groups, gathered on Los Angeles' 6th Street Bridge to rally against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Speakers and attendees called for an end to ICE raids, which they described as cruel tactics that have instilled fear in communities and harmed local businesses.

          <p>Before-and-after photographs from the Swiss Alps and satellite imagery starkly illustrate the rapid disappearance of glaciers due to climate change. Scientists report that glaciers worldwide are melting at an accelerated pace, with Switzerland's glaciers losing a quarter of their ice in the last decade alone. This retreat, which experts confirm is driven by human-caused global warming, threatens global sea levels and jeopardizes the freshwater supply for hundreds of millions of people in mountain regions.</p>

          <p>The article explores why waiting in long lines for store openings or product drops has become a popular activity, particularly among younger consumers. Psychologists explain that the anticipation of a reward, like an exclusive item or a free goodie bag, releases dopamine and creates a sense of excitement. For many, the queue itself is a social experience, offering a sense of camaraderie and community, which brands are leveraging through "experiential marketing" to create buzz and social media content.</p>
