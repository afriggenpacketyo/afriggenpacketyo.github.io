          <p>Emerging market stocks are gaining traction as the 'sell U.S.' narrative strengthens, fueled by factors such as a weaker U.S. dollar, a potential peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. Bank of America has identified emerging markets as the 'next bull market,' while JPMorgan has upgraded emerging market equities, citing attractive valuations and easing U.S.-China trade tensions. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has seen an 8.55% year-to-date increase, outperforming the S&P 500's 1% climb. Dented confidence in U.S. assets, marked by a selloff in U.S. Treasuries, equities, and the greenback, has further propelled the bullish outlook for emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are pressing the EU to act against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses these airlines of misleading passengers with additional charges for baggage that doesn't meet their guidelines, causing confusion and distress at check-ins. The consumer groups argue that such practices breach EU consumer law and are demanding an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, seeking sanctions for these 'illegal' practices. Ryanair and Norwegian have defended their policies, stating they comply with EU law, while other airlines argue that the action would decrease consumer choice.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate accurately reflects economic fundamentals, a statement made during bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgement implies that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade discussions, diverging from President Trump's view that it contributes to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Kato expressed concerns about the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, while both sides reaffirmed their commitment to market-determined exchange rates. Japan is considering a compromise on U.S. tariff rates to expedite a trade deal, but removing tariffs on cars and auto parts remains a priority.</p>

Officials and residents have expressed dismay, as the oversight aimed to end a pattern of violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices. Minneapolis officials oppose the withdrawal and state they will comply with the 169-page consent decree, while the police union welcomes the decision. The Justice Department claims such agreements are ineffectual, costly, and lengthy, but Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey insists on continuing with the outlined changes.</p>

          <p>A new 5,000-ton destroyer, critical to North Korea's naval advancement, was damaged during its launch ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un, according to state media. The ship slid off the ramp and became stuck after the flatcar failed to move alongside it, crushing parts of the ship's bottom. Kim Jong Un blamed military officials, scientists, and shipyard operators for the 'serious accident and criminal act' caused by carelessness, and has called for a Workersâ€™ Party meeting to address the errors. The damaged vessel is likely in the same class as the countryâ€™s first destroyer, unveiled on April 25.</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling 'the nuclear option.' These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn the waivers, but Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked in 50 years, and will sue the federal government if Congress revokes the waivers.</p>

          <p>Alejandro Oliveros Acosta, charged with animal cruelty in the killing and maiming of up to 20 cats in Santa Ana, failed to appear for his arraignment hearing, prompting authorities to issue an arrest warrant. Acosta faces felony counts of animal cruelty and grand theft of a companion animal, as well as a misdemeanor count of drug possession. The district attorneyâ€™s office sought to increase his bail to $100,000, describing Acosta as an 'immense danger,' with the investigation still active. Authorities believe Acosta was behind the deaths of several neighborhood cats, with reports of dead and injured animals filed with Santa Ana Animal Control.</p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have surged, with some areas 4Â°C warmer than normal, creating a marine heatwave with potential implications for marine life and swimmers. The heatwave is most intense off the west coast of Ireland and parts of Cornwall and Devon, with April and early May recording the highest sea temperatures in 45 years. Scientists attribute the surge to climate change and a warm spring with high temperatures and weak winds. While the impacts on marine life are still uncertain, there are concerns about disruptions to breeding patterns, influxes of jellyfish, and harmful algae blooms.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration welcomes Afrikaner asylum applicants claiming violence and discrimination, some Afrikaners say claims of a 'white genocide' in South Africa are untrue. Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp states that Whites are economically the strongest group, and Nick Serfontein, a cattle farmer, says he feels safe. The South African government's stance against Israel and relations with China could influence Trump's amnesty program for Afrikaners, but there hasn't been a single case of land expropriation without compensation documented since apartheid ended. Serfontein says the land must be shared by both Black and White.</p>

          <p>Food banks in Florida are experiencing reduced aid due to federal funding cuts, impacting their ability to provide meals to those in need. The White House's Department of Government Efficiency cut approximately $1 billion from U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, affecting the ability of schools and food banks to purchase food directly from local farmers. For Feeding South Florida, these cuts amount to 40% of its $37 million annual budget, leading to empty shelves and increased desperation among families who rely on the food bank. Farmers are also affected, as they lack the funds to process surplus produce destined for families in need.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has stated that the Trump administration 'unquestionably' violated a court order by deporting a group of migrants to a country not their own without sufficient notice. The administration said the eight migrants had serious criminal records and were being sent to South Sudan, but officials refused to confirm the flight's destination. Judge Murphy ordered the government to provide the men with access to a lawyer and interviews to determine if they feared being sent to a third country, potentially leading to criminal contempt penalties. Documents show the men were citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma, and Vietnam.</p>

Canada's potential participation comes amid ongoing trade and security negotiations between the two countries, with Canada open to completing the Golden Dome with investments and partnership.
