          <p>As tensions rise between India and Pakistan, Chinese defense stocks are experiencing a surge following reports that Pakistan used China-made weapons to down Indian jets. Pakistan's Foreign Minister claimed the deployment of Chinese J-10C fighter jets in a clash with India's air force. Several AVIC subsidiaries, including AVIC Chengdu Aircraft and AVIC Aerospace, saw their stocks rising significantly, with AVIC Chengdu Aircraft experiencing the most substantial gain since last October. China State Shipbuilding Corporation, which constructs military and civilian vessels, also saw a slight increase in its stock value, highlighting the economic impact of the geopolitical tensions on the Chinese defense industry.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk, considered a bellwether for global trade, announced a 70% increase in first-quarter operating profit, exceeding analyst expectations.

          <p>The European Commission's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by the end of 2027 is facing strong opposition from eastern European nations. Slovakia and Hungary, who maintain warm ties with Moscow, have criticized the plan as "economic suicide" that would harm the region's energy security and economy. These nations traditionally rely on cheaper energy supplies from Russia and warn of higher energy prices for consumers if such supplies are banned. The EU's proposal aims to ensure full energy independence from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Israeli embassy in London was the alleged target of a suspected terror plot, leading to the arrest of five Iranian men. The men were arrested on suspicion of preparing an act of terrorism, but police have not confirmed the embassy as the target, citing operational reasons. Iranian officials have denied any involvement and offered to assist with the investigation. The arrests were made under the Terrorism Act, and investigations are ongoing at multiple addresses across the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, marking his first such deal since imposing tariffs. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but discussions have involved lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, and reducing taxes on US technology companies. The announcement comes as senior British trade negotiators are in Washington seeking an agreement before a UK-EU summit. However, the president does not have unilateral authority to enter into trade agreements and needs to secure approval from Congress.</p>
