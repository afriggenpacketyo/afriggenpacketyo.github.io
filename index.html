          <p>Five Mexican nationals are facing charges of human smuggling following an incident where a boat capsized off the coast of San Diego, resulting in the deaths of three individuals, including a 14-year-old boy from India. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California reported that the boy's parents and two others were hospitalized, while nine additional migrants were initially missing, but eight were later located. The incident underscores the perilous nature of human trafficking and the disregard for human life exhibited by smugglers, as highlighted by U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon. </p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, at the White House, a stark contrast to his previous rhetoric about Canada. Trump expressed his affection for Canada, despite having recently suggested that he would like to absorb Canada into the U.S. as the 51st state. Carney firmly rejected the idea of Canada being for sale, emphasizing the importance of partnership between the two nations, while Trump addressed a range of topics, including the construction of Barack Obama’s presidential library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to tariffs, which have significantly increased the cost of importing bikes and bike parts. The company had been paying 25% tariffs since the first Trump administration, but recent tariffs have forced them to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties. This has led to the cancellation of new orders from China, and the company is struggling to find alternative foreign vendors, as fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially viable.</p>

          <p>China, a leading aluminium producer and consumer, may soon reduce its dependence on imported bauxite, the high-quality aluminium ore, thanks to French technology. A plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with IB2 technology to process China's low-grade, high-silica bauxite, previously unusable in the Bayer process. This innovation, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing the refining of low-grade bauxite into high-quality alumina, which aligns with Beijing's push for a greener aluminium industry.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. India stated the strikes were part of a "commitment" to hold those responsible for the April 22 attack "accountable". Pakistan, denying involvement in the attack, described the strikes as "unprovoked", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the "heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished". India has not named any group it suspects carried out the attack in Pahalgam and it remains unclear who did it.</p>

          <p>A small plane crashed into two homes in a Simi Valley neighborhood, killing the two people on board. The victims were identified as Paul Berkovitz, his 36-year-old son Matthew and Paul's dog named Brody. Residents were evacuated from both homes, but there were no reported injuries on the ground. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days, and will be investigating three factors in the crash — the pilot, the aircraft and the operating environment.</p>

          <p>India said it had carried out strikes on Pakistan, intensifying a conflict between two nuclear powers, after 26 people, most of them tourists, were killed on April 22 in a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan’s government said that the strikes “will not go unanswered.” and that it would respond at “a time and place of its own choosing.” The precise nature and location of the strikes is unclear, but Pakistan’s military said that Indian planes did not enter Pakistan’s airspace while conducting the attacks.</p>

          <p>India early on Wednesday said its armed forces had conducted strikes against Pakistan and what it calls Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting "terrorist infrastructure." Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given, according to AP. The operation, which targeted nine sites, follows a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed last month, the ministry said.</p>
