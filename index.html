        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent U.S. trade agreements under President Trump have consistently featured large orders for Boeing aircraft from partner nations like South Korea, Japan, and the UK. Experts suggest these high-value, high-profile deals serve both symbolic and pragmatic purposes, allowing countries to visibly reduce trade surpluses with the U.S. while fulfilling a genuine need for new planes in a growing international tourism market. Despite Boeing's recent safety scandals, its status as an iconic American company in a duopolistic market with Airbus makes it a strategic component of these international negotiations.</p>

          <p>Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams used his tradition of painting his fingernails to share a powerful message before the team's season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. His nails featured the suicide prevention logo and the "988" number for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, continuing a practice he's known for since his college days. Williams, who had paused the tradition during a difficult rookie season, explained his return to the practice as an unapologetic expression of his personality and confidence. The gesture highlights his use of a public platform to raise awareness for mental health issues.</p>

          <p>The killing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a Charlotte light rail train has ignited a debate over public safety and the criminal justice system's handling of repeat offenders. The suspect, who has a long criminal record and a history of mental illness, allegedly attacked Zarutska in what appears to be a random act of violence. The incident has drawn national attention, with President Trump and other officials criticizing local authorities for failing to prevent the tragedy. The case has become a focal point in discussions about crime, mental health treatment, and bail reform.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has released a "birthday book" compiled for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which includes a note allegedly written and signed by Donald Trump. The message, which the White House denies is authentic, is part of a larger trove of documents from Epstein's estate that were subpoenaed by lawmakers. The scrapbook, reportedly assembled by Ghislaine Maxwell, also contains submissions from other high-profile figures and provides further insight into Epstein's social network. The release has intensified calls for transparency regarding investigations into the late convicted sex offender's activities.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a former top official at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging she was removed from her position for opposing the Trump administration's agenda on vaccines. In an interview, she detailed internal clashes with officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., over efforts to cancel vaccine research and downplay their importance. Marrazzo claims she and her colleagues were silenced and became "inconvenient" for raising concerns about actions that posed a danger to public health. Her complaint alleges her subsequent reassignment was an act of illegal retaliation.</p>

          <p>According to CNN's chief data analyst Harry Enten, President Donald Trump's approval ratings are currently negative across several key issues, including those previously considered his strengths like crime and immigration. Aggregated polling data shows underwater net approval ratings on the economy, foreign policy, and trade, indicating a broad decline in public support. This negative trend has been consistent for 181 consecutive days, with significant drops in approval among younger voters (ages 18-29) and Hispanic demographics since February. The data suggests a challenging political landscape for the president in his second term.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision in Noem vs. Vasquez Perdomo is criticized for effectively sanctioning immigration raids that target individuals based on their appearance, language, and perceived low-wage employment. The ruling, issued without a full hearing via the court's emergency docket, allows federal agents to resume controversial raids in the Los Angeles area. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent warns that the decision undermines Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The author argues this sets a dangerous precedent, making constitutional rights conditional and threatening the principle of equal protection under the law for all residents.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the emotional impact of a film depicting the 1937 Nanking massacre, contrasting the profound domestic reaction with the often-politicized international interpretation of Chinese historical commemorations. The author describes the shared grief experienced by a Chinese audience watching a story about civilians risking their lives to smuggle out photographic evidence of Japanese atrocities. The article suggests that Western media often misses the deep-seated historical pain that informs modern Chinese national identity, instead focusing solely on geopolitical power displays. This narrative highlights a cultural disconnect in understanding historical suffering.</p>

          <p>The United States experienced the most significant drop in workforce participation among mothers with young children in over 40 years, with more than 400,000 women leaving their jobs in the first half of 2025. A University of Kansas analysis identifies the high cost and unavailability of childcare as the primary driver for this trend. Many mothers, like Mackenzie Bruegge from Iowa, found that their salaries were almost entirely consumed by daycare expenses, making it financially unfeasible to continue working. This exodus highlights a lack of supportive policies for caregivers and is causing a regression in women's labor force participation.</p>

The change follows the suicide of a head teacher, which a coroner linked to a negative inspection. The new system will use a five-point scale across multiple categories, but it has drawn strong criticism from a coalition of school leaders and campaigners, including the late teacher's sister. They argue the changes are merely cosmetic and continue to pose a risk to the mental well-being of educators, calling for a delay in its implementation.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the latest updated COVID-19 vaccines, but with narrower eligibility criteria than in previous rollouts. The new shots are specifically authorized for adults aged 65 and older and for younger individuals with certain medical conditions that place them at higher risk of severe illness. While officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the more limited formal approval may restrict access for some, particularly at pharmacies that must adhere to state regulations. Conditions that qualify for eligibility include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, and pregnancy, covering an estimated 100 to 200 million people in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Six current and former Meta employees have come forward as whistleblowers, alleging that the company deliberately concealed evidence of harm to children on its virtual reality products. They claim Meta managers instructed staff to delete or alter internal research showing children were exposed to sexual harassment, grooming, and violence in its VR environments. The whistleblowers have provided documents to Congress, and two are scheduled to testify before a Senate subcommittee. Meta has denied the allegations, stating the claims are part of a false narrative and that it has implemented safety features to protect young users.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest has sacked head coach Nuno Espirito Santo, citing a deteriorated relationship between him and owner Evangelos Marinakis. The dismissal comes despite a successful tenure in which Nuno saved the club from relegation and then guided them to their highest league finish in decades, securing a spot in European competition for the first time in 30 years. Tensions reportedly arose from disagreements over the club's transfer strategy. The club has announced that talks for a replacement are underway, with an appointment expected to be made imminently.</p>

The breach exposed the personal details of 40 million voters and went undetected for over a year due to significant security failures, for which the commission was publicly reprimanded. The watchdog's new chief executive, Vijay Rangarajan, admitted that huge mistakes were made and that the incident was an "enormous shock."

          <p>A leading UK waste management firm reports that the ban on disposable vapes has not reduced the number of devices being improperly discarded, which continue to cause fires in recycling facilities. Roger Wright of Biffa stated that his company is seeing more vapes in its system than ever before. He suggests that consumers are treating new, cheap reusable models as disposable items instead of refilling and recycling them properly. While the vape industry claims the ban has been successful and blames the black market, the waste industry continues to face significant costs and safety hazards from lithium batteries in discarded vapes.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic highlights President Trump's increasing use of violent and militaristic language during his second term, creating a notable shift in political discourse. Recent examples include a social media post threatening to make "war" on Chicago and a proposal to rebrand the Department of Defense as the "Department of War." This rhetoric is seen as a continuation of a pattern from his first campaign and presidency but has become more pronounced, influencing the administration's tone and actions. The article argues that this normalization of violent language, once directed externally, is now increasingly being turned toward domestic targets.</p>

McCullum clarified that his coaching philosophy is about creating an environment that allows players to perform without being restricted by pressure, rather than enforcing a rigid, high-risk playing style.

The election campaign focused on domestic issues like the cost of living and public services, as well as international instability.
