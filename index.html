          <p>President Donald Trump terminated Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden via email, a move condemned by top Democrats as an assault on American values. Hayden, who had served since 2016 and was the first woman in the role, was notified by the White House Office of Personnel Management that her position was terminated immediately. House Democrats, including Hakeem Jeffries, Joe Morelle, and Rosa DeLauro, criticized the decision as unjust and unprecedented, with Morelle planning to introduce legislation to ensure future Librarians of Congress are appointed by Congress. Trump is expected to announce Hayden's replacement soon.</p>

          <p>The Soviet-era Venera mission probe Cosmos 482, which failed to leave Earth's orbit in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Designed to withstand Venus's harsh atmospheric conditions, the lander may partially survive its re-entry, posing a potential threat if it lands on ground. While most space debris burns up, Cosmos 482 is relatively large, weighing 495 kilograms, and its descent is uncontrolled, but the risk of human injury is low. Russia plans to launch a new mission to Venus, Venera-D, in the early 2030s, signaling a renewed interest in exploring the planet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin, whose nomination was withdrawn due to criticism over his advocacy for Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants. Trump praised Pirro as highly qualified, while Fox News acknowledged her departure and wished her well in her new role. Pirro, a former district attorney for Westchester County, New York, is a staunch Trump supporter, and her appointment follows the announcement that Martin will serve in the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress and the White House are preparing a budget that includes tax cuts and increased spending on homeland security, while targeting smaller discretionary programs for cuts. The proposed budget aims to extend Trump's 2017 fiscal package and eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security payments, but faces criticism for potentially harming the poor and squeezing crucial long-term investments. Critics argue that the budget lacks a realistic plan to address the deficit and could lead to negative economic consequences.</p>

While the unconstitutionality of Trump's birthright citizenship order is clear, the Court's decision on nationwide injunctions could significantly impact the power of lower court judges and the implementation of policies.</p>

The court heard that Ojiri was aware of Ahmad's terrorism links and that the offenses took place before the UK government sanctioned Ahmad in 2023.</p>

          <p>Japan will continue to demand the full removal of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, the top government negotiator said Friday, after a U.S.-Britain trade agreement left some levies in place.

The government plans to hold a third round of talks in mid-May or later.</p>
