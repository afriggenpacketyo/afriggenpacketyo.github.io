          <p>Police in Texas identified an overseas man as the person who allegedly sent death threats to Houston Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. and his family after a poor start against the Cincinnati Reds. The man, who bet on the Astros, was reportedly "inebriated" and frustrated when he sent the threats on social media, later apologizing to the McCullers family. McCullers had to explain the situation to his young daughter, highlighting the impact on his family's safety and well-being, after which the Astros hired 24-hour security for the pitcher and his family. People should want the players to succeed, but it shouldn't come at the cost of the families' safety.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy grew less than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with a 1.3% year-on-year increase, unchanged from the previous quarter and below estimates. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the slow growth to reduced public spending, weak consumer demand, and declining exports. Extreme weather events also negatively impacted mining, tourism, and shipping industries, further hindering economic activity. The Reserve Bank of Australia previously cut rates to a two-year low in May and anticipates a gradual GDP growth recovery in 2025, driven by consumption and public demand, although global uncertainty tempers these expectations.

          <p>An opinion piece challenges the widely held belief that China's rise has negatively impacted the American job market, particularly in manufacturing. The article questions the "China shock" narrative, which claims that millions of American jobs were lost due to cheap Chinese goods. It references research by economists like David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson, whose work has been influential in shaping the debate around the impact of trade with China. The author suggests that the benefits of affordable goods may outweigh the alleged job losses.</p>

          <h2>Limits to Republican Lawmakers' Power in Texas</h2>

          <p>In Texas, Republican factions united to pass most, but not all, of their conservative priorities during this year's legislative session. This outcome illustrates the limitations of right-wing governance, even in a state known for its conservative leanings. The article suggests that despite a unified front on many issues, certain priorities faced resistance or failed to gain enough support for passage. This highlights the complexities and nuances within the Republican party itself.</p>

          <h2>Man Accused of Threatening Trump Was Framed, Officials Say</h2>

          <p>A man accused of writing letters threatening to assassinate President Trump was framed, according to investigators. Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant, was initially arrested after officials alleged he threatened to shoot Trump, but prosecutors now claim the letters were written by Demetric Deshawn Scott. Scott, who is set to face trial for allegedly assaulting and robbing Morales-Reyes, admitted to writing the letters to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying in the robbery case. Morales-Reyes, who doesn't speak fluent English, has handwriting that is "completely different" from the writing on the letters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to perform emergency abortions under a federal law ensuring stabilization of patients. The 2022 guidance, issued after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, stated that doctors must perform abortions in emergency departments, even in states where the procedure is illegal, if it serves as a "stabilizing medical treatment." HHS and CMS rescinded the guidance, saying it "does not reflect the policy of this Administration." Abortion rights groups have criticized the move, accusing Trump of backtracking on a campaign promise.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration eases EPA regulations, Houston could face increased pollution and health risks. The EPA has been slashing and reconsidering rules designed to combat pollution, and many EPA staffers who enforce these rules are being fired. A Houston neighborhood near an NRG Energy coal-fired power plant is particularly vulnerable, as emissions from oil refineries, chemical plants, and coal plants in the area can lead to lung disease, asthma, and heart attacks. A 2018 study found that pollution from the NRG plant contributes to 177 premature deaths per year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's domestic policy legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has cleared the House and moves to the Senate, potentially causing millions to lose Medicaid coverage and making it harder to sign up for health plans. Critics say the bill is essentially an Obamacare repeal lite, including substantial rollbacks of the Affordable Care Act. The bill aims to reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" in Medicaid and other government health programs. While Republicans deny it is a repeal of the ACA, Democrats argue it will destroy the health care system.</p>

          <p>A controversy has erupted in the mountaineering world after four British climbers summited Everest shortly after arriving in Nepal, using xenon gas to accelerate their acclimatization. This tech-focused approach, organized by guide Lukas Furtenbach, has sparked debate about whether it represents an unfair shortcut.

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Republicans in the Senate to unite behind a sprawling policy bill that carries his domestic agenda. However, the measure faces opposition from within the party, with Elon Musk emerging as a powerful new ally for those against the bill. This division highlights the challenges Trump faces in pushing his policies through Congress, even with a Republican majority. The outcome of this legislative battle will likely have significant implications for Trump's agenda and the direction of the Republican party.</p>

Influential MAGA voices, like Laura Loomer, have accused Trump of elevating Barrett as a "DEI Hire."
