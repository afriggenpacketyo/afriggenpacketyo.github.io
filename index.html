          <h2>CATL Claims New EV Battery Outpaces BYD with Ultra-Fast Charging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 01:38:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese battery manufacturer CATL has announced its second-generation Shenxing battery, claiming a new global record for superfast charging technology. According to CATL, the battery can add 520 km (323 miles) of driving range with just five minutes of charging, surpassing rival BYD's recent announcement. This development could address consumer concerns regarding EV range and convenience, potentially accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. CATL's claims, if validated on a larger scale, would position them ahead of Western competitors in charging speed, with Tesla and Mercedes-Benz also working to improve charging times.</p>

          <p>Walgreens has agreed to pay up to $350 million to settle accusations by the U.S. Department of Justice that it illegally filled millions of prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances over the past decade. The government alleged that Walgreens pharmacists knowingly filled invalid prescriptions, including those for excessive opioids, and that the company pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions quickly, ignoring red flags. Walgreens denies liability but says the settlement allows them to close opioid-related litigation and focus on their turnaround strategy. This settlement follows similar lawsuits against CVS and Rite Aid over the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly terminated their records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, claimed that ICE's actions were designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and deporting themselves. The judge granted a temporary restraining order, preventing the government from using the students' identities outside of the lawsuit and requiring notification upon compliance.</p>

          <p>This article discusses 'time blindness,' a common challenge for individuals with ADHD, which involves difficulty accurately perceiving and managing time. This can impact work, relationships, and more, causing issues with estimating how long tasks will take, sticking to schedules, and recognizing when to start activities. The underlying causes are linked to differences in brain structure and function, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. The article suggests strategies for managing time blindness, such as breaking tasks into smaller steps and using visual timers.</p>

While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness. Central banks are trying to avoid currency wars that could further destabilize the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>
