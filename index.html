          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty to federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment is linked to mortgage records she signed in 2020. James, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, has characterized the charges as politically motivated and a "desperate weaponization of our justice system." The case has drawn attention due to the unusual step of an interim U.S. Attorney personally presenting evidence to the grand jury.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has condemned recent U.S. military strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats, labeling them as illegal, ineffective, and a violation of international law. Petro argues that these attacks, which have killed dozens, target low-level workers instead of the powerful cartel leaders and sometimes result in the deaths of innocent civilians. He has called for a collaborative dialogue with the Trump administration to address drug trafficking, warning that unilateral military actions could escalate violence in the region. The U.S. maintains the strikes are a legitimate part of its anti-drug efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising U.S. credit card debt, many consumers wonder about the minimum amount a debt collector will sue for. While there is no fixed threshold, lawsuits often become a consideration for debts ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, depending on state laws and collection costs. The article advises that ignoring collection attempts increases the risk of legal action, even for smaller balances. It suggests proactive steps such as communicating with creditors, exploring debt management programs, or considering debt consolidation to resolve outstanding balances before they escalate to a court case.

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an advertisement run by the province of Ontario that featured former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. President Trump claimed the ad, which used a 1987 radio address, was fraudulent and misrepresented Reagan's stance on trade protections. Ontario Premier Doug Ford defended the ad, emphasizing the strong U.S.-Canada alliance and Reagan's historical opposition to trade barriers. This marks the second time the administration has halted trade talks with Canada, escalating economic tensions between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) indicates that mercenaries from the Wagner Group systematically used military equipment supplied to Mali's armed forces. The report, based on interviews and open-source intelligence, found evidence of mercenaries using Malian armored vehicles, machine guns, and drones, often without Malian soldiers present. This diversion of military hardware, sourced from countries like China and Turkey, potentially violates international arms trade agreements that require weapons to remain with their intended end-users.

          <p>Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei is facing a significant political test in the country's midterm elections amid a deepening currency crisis and public discontent over his severe austerity measures. Milei, whose party holds a small minority in Congress, needs a stronger legislative presence to pass his agenda, but his approval ratings have plummeted due to public sector job cuts and reduced subsidies. The U.S. has offered a $20 billion currency swap to stabilize the peso, an intervention that has drawn criticism. While Milei has managed to curb inflation, the social cost has been high, creating an uncertain outcome for the election.</p>

Researchers at the Pasteur Institute found genetic evidence of bacteria causing paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever, in addition to previously known afflictions like typhus and trench fever. This discovery, made from a mass grave in Vilnius, Lithuania, paints a clearer picture of the microbial assault the soldiers faced. The findings underscore that starvation and freezing temperatures were compounded by a host of infectious diseases, leading to the army's near-total annihilation.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown happens when Congress fails to pass funding legislation for federal agencies before the fiscal year begins on October 1.

Essential services, such as national security, law enforcement, and air traffic control, continue to operate, but employees in these roles work without immediate pay. Non-essential employees are furloughed, and while they are guaranteed back pay by law, the shutdown disrupts services and costs taxpayers billions.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment fell for the third straight month in October, reflecting growing concerns about the economy, a weakening labor market, and persistent inflation. The University of Michigan's sentiment index showed a 1.5% decrease, with lower- and middle-income households expressing particular anxiety over job and income prospects. Long-term inflation expectations also edged higher, indicating that the strain of high prices remains a primary concern for consumers. The report, one of the first major economic indicators released since the government shutdown began, suggests a dimming outlook on personal finances and business conditions.

The attack, which authorities believe was carried out by members of the cyber-criminal group Scattered Spider, caused three months of disruption to TfL services. This included affecting live Tube information, online journey histories, and payments on the Oyster app. The defendants have been charged with conspiring to commit unauthorized acts under the Computer Misuse Act, with a trial date set for June 2026.</p>

          <p>Stephan Smerk, a 52-year-old New York man with a clean record, has confessed to the 1994 murder of Robin Warr Lawrence in Virginia, a cold case that remained unsolved for three decades. Smerk turned himself in after detectives, using genetic genealogy, identified him as a potential suspect and collected his DNA. He told investigators he had an uncontrollable compulsion to kill someone that night and chose the victim's house at random. Smerk described himself as "a serial killer who's only killed once," and he has now been sentenced to 70 years in prison.</p>

Critics, including the family of one of Bulger's victims, argue the display glorifies violent criminals and is particularly offensive as the bar was once owned by a man Bulger murdered. The owners contend the photos are not an homage but an acknowledgment of the area's complex history, a theme chosen by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's restaurant makeover show.

The 2.8% figure is in line with recent averages but may not fully offset the rising costs faced by beneficiaries, especially as Medicare Part B premiums, often deducted from checks, are also projected to increase significantly.

According to the National People’s Congress, establishing this day is intended to reinforce the "indisputable historical fact that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China." The move is seen as a way to strengthen the international community's commitment to the one-China principle and underscore Beijing's sovereignty claims over the self-governing island.</p>

This trial is one of several recent cases where activists have successfully argued a "right to rescue," leading to acquittals.

This uptick, driven in part by a nearly 15% annual surge in beef prices, has occurred alongside a slowdown in hiring, creating challenging conditions for the Federal Reserve. The data, delayed by the government shutdown, adds pressure on policymakers as they weigh whether to cut interest rates to stimulate the labor market, a move that could risk fueling further inflation.

          <p>A new study from the Berlin Social Science Center suggests that mainstream political parties, both on the center-right and center-left, inadvertently bolster far-right movements when they adopt anti-immigration rhetoric. By mimicking the language of the far-right, centrist politicians legitimize these fringe ideas and increase the visibility of issues that far-right parties "own." This strategy, intended to win back voters, often backfires by bringing extremist positions into the mainstream debate. The research analyzed over two decades of German newspaper articles, concluding that this dynamic helps drag the entire political discourse further to the right.</p>
