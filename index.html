          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and experience as a former district attorney for Westchester County, New York, and her staunch support. A Fox News spokesperson acknowledged Pirro's contributions and wished her well in her new role. The appointment has raised concerns about potential political motivations, with D.C.'s shadow senator, Ankit Jain, expressing hope that Pirro will focus on fighting violent crime rather than pursuing political vendettas or whitewashing the events of January 6th.</p>

          <p>Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary commuter rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area, shut down all trains for several hours on Friday morning due to a computer networking problem, disrupting the commute for over 170,000 passengers.

This outage comes as BART struggles to regain ridership following the Covid-19 pandemic, with passenger traffic remaining significantly below pre-pandemic levels due to remote work trends.</p>

          <p>The Army will implement new fitness standards on June 1, featuring the same requirements for both men and women in combat roles. The updated test includes deadlifts, hand-release push-ups, planks, a two-mile run, and the sprint-drag-carry, designed to assess strength, speed, endurance, and core stability. Fitness experts recommend the test as a comprehensive gauge of overall fitness, balancing various physical capabilities. The minimum passing scores, such as deadlifting 150 pounds and holding a plank for 1 minute 20 seconds, provide good targets for anyone seeking to improve their physical condition.</p>

This incident follows a similar outage last week that caused delays and cancellations, leading several controllers to take medical leave due to the traumatic experience.

          <p>Despite widespread nostalgia for factory jobs, bringing them back to the U.S. is challenging due to automation and trade policies. While 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off with more manufacturing jobs, these positions now offer lower salaries compared to other sectors, and automation reduces the need for human labor. President Trump's proposed tariffs are unlikely to significantly increase manufacturing employment, and immigration policies could exacerbate labor shortages. The article suggests focusing on improving the quality of jobs in other sectors, such as Amazon warehouse work, to provide similar benefits and stability.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another brief air traffic control outage, compounding a week of problems for travelers. The latest radar outage, lasting approximately 90 seconds, occurred less than 24 hours after the Transportation Secretary announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system. United Airlines has been limiting flights to and from Newark, with the CEO stating that the airport cannot handle the scheduled number of planes due to FAA staffing issues.</p>

          <p>A 5-year-old grizzly bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058 and part of a famous grizzly family in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park, died after being struck by a vehicle, mirroring the fate of his mother, Grizzly No. 399, last year. Park rangers found the bear's body near Highway 26, and officials confirmed the relationship between the two bears using wildlife tags. The National Park Service reminded visitors that wildlife are often near roadways and difficult to see, urging drivers to reduce speed and avoid distractions. Authorities reported that 49 grizzly bears died from vehicle collisions between 2009 and 2023.</p>
