        <p>Senator Mark Kelly criticized President Trump for allegedly trying to undermine Ukraine's efforts and engaged in a Twitter exchange with Elon Musk, who called Kelly a 'traitor' for supporting Ukraine.  Kelly defended his stance, emphasizing the importance of supporting Ukraine's freedom and security.  The context includes a recent pause in US aid to Ukraine, which Trump and Secretary Rubio have said is intended to push for a resolution to the conflict.  Trump indicated the intelligence pause on Ukraine has been nearly lifted.</p>

        <h2>Dow Jones drops significantly amid escalating US-Canada trade war</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 12:19:45 EDT</div>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a substantial drop following President Trump's escalation of the trade war with Canada.  Trump increased tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, in response to Canada imposing surcharges on US electricity exports.  Further tariff increases are threatened unless Canada removes tariffs on US goods.  Market analysts attribute the decline to uncertainty surrounding trade policy and the broad application of tariffs.</p>
