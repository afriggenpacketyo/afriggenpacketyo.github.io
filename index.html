          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 flight, which famously turned a potential disaster into a "successful failure" after an oxygen tank explosion. He also flew on the Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, where he described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." Lovell's legacy as a courageous test pilot and astronaut, immortalized in the film "Apollo 13," is remembered for demonstrating remarkable grace under pressure.</p>

          <p>Immigration agents conducted two raids on day laborers outside a Van Nuys Home Depot, detaining at least ten people and prompting accusations of violating a court order. Critics and local officials, including LA's mayor, argue the operations may flout a temporary restraining order that prohibits targeting individuals based on race or location without reasonable suspicion. This follows other recent raids, including one dubbed "Operation Trojan Horse," which advocates claim are a clear defiance of the judicial ruling. Federal officials maintain their actions are legal, targeted operations based on prior intelligence.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was fatally shot following an incident where a suspect opened fire near the CDC headquarters and Emory University campus in Atlanta. The suspect was later found deceased from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The officer, who was pronounced dead at a local hospital, leaves behind a pregnant wife and two children. While no civilians were shot, the suspect fired multiple rounds at the CDC building, shattering windows while a daycare with 92 children was on campus, prompting a shelter-in-place order.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out in the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, a UNESCO World Heritage site in southern Spain, but was quickly extinguished by firefighters. The city's mayor praised the rapid response, stating it "averted a catastrophe" at the major tourist attraction. The blaze reportedly started around 9 p.m. local time in one of the chapels, with preliminary reports suggesting a short circuit in an electrical device as a possible cause. The monument, a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was later converted into a cathedral, was secured without major structural damage.</p>

The production, which coincides with the company's 10th anniversary, follows four artists in Los Angeles who use a new app that promises to help them succeed, only to find themselves controlled by it. Writer-director Jorge Durán was inspired by the rapid rise of tools like ChatGPT, exploring themes of control and the human element in art. The play aims to reflect the real-life struggles of artists in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Almond growers across Central California are grappling with a massive rat infestation affecting over 100,000 acres of orchards, causing significant economic damage. The rodents are damaging trees by burrowing in root zones, consuming nuts, and destroying irrigation equipment, with estimated losses ranging from $109 million to $311 million. California, which produces 80% of the world's almonds, is seeing farmers resort to expensive pest control methods. The Almond Board of California highlights the severe financial burden on growers facing substantial crop losses and infrastructure replacement costs. (not investment advice)</p>

While Carano's posts were provocative, the author suggests they stemmed more from ignorance than malice and did not warrant the loss of her livelihood.

In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders hosted the Texas Democrats, vowing to advance their own gerrymandered map to "nullify" any GOP gains in Texas.

While production moved from the UK to Turkey in 2013, Ford's UK facilities still handle engineering, design, and engine manufacturing. As the brand moves toward an electric future, it faces a more competitive market where the brand loyalty it once commanded is no longer guaranteed.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has seen a notable increase in complaints about models appearing "unhealthily thin" in fashion advertisements, sparking concerns of a return to the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s. High-street brands like Zara, Next, and M&S have recently had ads banned by the watchdog, which ruled that posing, styling, and lighting made the models appear unhealthily slender, even if they were not. Activists and industry experts worry this trend undermines the body positivity movement and could be harmful, though some connect it to the rise of weight-loss drugs rather than a direct fashion trend.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Debunks Claim of Trump's Plane Flying to Epstein's Island 37 Times</h2>

          <p>A viral claim made by a Facebook user posing as a retired pilot, alleging that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times, has been found to have no evidence. The investigation notes that Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making landings by a plane like Trump's impossible; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. The user who made the claim wore a pilot costume from Amazon in his profile picture and was an administrator for anti-Trump Facebook groups. Trump has publicly denied ever visiting the island, and no credible evidence has emerged to contradict his statement.</p>

His impressive round included seven birdies with only a single bogey on the 18th hole.

          <p>The city of Seoul has opened four "warm-hearted convenience stores" as part of an initiative to combat rising social isolation and loneliness among its residents. These centers, designed to feel like warm cafes, offer free ramen, massage chairs, and social activities to provide a welcoming space for people of all ages who feel isolated. The program was prompted by an increase in "lonely deaths" and a study showing nearly 40% of households in the capital are single-person. The initiative has been unexpectedly popular, attracting 20,000 visitors since March, far exceeding the initial projection of 5,000 for the entire year.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has stated that he currently cannot involve star striker Alexander Isak with the first-team group, signaling a deepening rift with the player. This comes after Newcastle rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool last week, with Isak reportedly wanting to explore other options. The 25-year-old has been instructed to train separately from his teammates, though Howe confirmed it is not a disciplinary action. With the Premier League season opener approaching, the situation leaves Newcastle in a difficult position, especially given their frustrating summer transfer window and lack of depth at the striker position.</p>

Wastewater surveillance shows that viral activity has reached a "moderate" level nationwide, with states like California, Alaska, and Nevada marked as "high." The CDC estimates that infections are growing in 45 states, up from 40 the previous week. This late-summer wave is driven in part by the new XFG variant, also known as "Stratus," which has become the third-most common strain in the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has started issuing licenses allowing Nvidia to export its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, according to a U.S. official. This move reverses a previous ban and removes a major obstacle for the chipmaker's access to the critical Chinese market, which it had warned would cost billions in sales. The H20 chip was specifically designed by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls aimed at slowing Beijing's AI and military development. It is unclear which Chinese companies will be permitted to receive the chips or the total value of the licensed shipments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to pave the way for alternative investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies, to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The move aims to democratize retirement savings but introduces higher-risk assets into traditionally conservative portfolios. While these investments offer the potential for higher returns, they also come with greater volatility, higher fees, and less transparency compared to stocks and bonds. Experts believe adoption by employers and workers may be slow due to the complexity and risks involved. (not investment advice)</p>

The film thoughtfully handles his death at 30, presenting it as a tragic accident rather than a suicide.

Another user, a musician, wrote a popular song about the emptiness he felt after a series of hook-ups, calling the app a place "where love comes to die."
