        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dispute has intensified between House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Thomas Massie regarding the public release of Department of Justice records related to Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson criticized Massie's legislative push as "meaningless," advocating instead for a House Oversight Committee inquiry to protect victims' privacy. Massie, who is using a discharge petition to force a vote, labeled Johnson's alternative a "placebo resolution" and suggested the Speaker is afraid of political repercussions. The conflict highlights growing divisions within the Republican party over how to handle transparency in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Google, allowing the company to retain ownership of its Chrome browser. However, the decision prohibits Google from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default choice on devices and browsers, a practice that has included multi-billion dollar payments to Apple. The ruling also mandates that Google share some of its search data with competitors, though it stops short of the full divestiture sought by the Department of Justice. Google has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin experienced a modest increase, reclaiming the $110,000 level, while the broader stock market faced a downturn and gold surged to a new record high above $3,500. The market divergence was influenced by concerns over President Trump's global tariffs and expectations of a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Analysts suggest that while both assets benefit from safe-haven demand, Bitcoin's performance has also been affected by a recent investor rotation into other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The differing movements highlight a market seeking both safety in traditional assets and yield in digital ones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new cryptocurrency, WLFI, launched by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, has added an estimated $5 billion to the family's on-paper wealth, despite the token's value dropping nearly 50% from its peak shortly after its debut. The family's significant holdings are currently locked and cannot be sold, according to the company. This venture aligns with President Trump's recent embrace of the crypto industry and has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, which the White House has dismissed. The token grants holders governance rights over the company's stablecoin, USD1. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department has authorized approximately 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges to address a significant backlog of cases and a recent decline in the number of judges. This move follows a change in qualification requirements, removing the need for prior immigration law experience for these temporary roles. The military lawyers will undergo about two weeks of training before hearing cases. The decision is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to expedite immigration proceedings and increase deportations, but it has raised concerns about the experience level of these new judges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Howard Webb, chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has publicly acknowledged that the decision to disallow a goal by Fulham's Josh King during their match against Chelsea was incorrect. The goal was overturned after a lengthy VAR review identified a minor foul in the build-up, a decision Fulham's manager called "unbelievable." Webb stated that such interventions should only occur for clear and obvious errors, and this incident did not meet that high threshold. The official who acted as the VAR for the match was subsequently stood down from his next appointment.</p>

          <p>For individuals facing significant credit card debt, such as a $20,000 balance, several strategic approaches can facilitate repayment. Options include working with a debt relief company for management or settlement programs, which can help negotiate lower interest rates. Another method is obtaining a debt consolidation loan to combine multiple balances into a single, often lower-interest payment. Additionally, disciplined payment strategies like the "debt avalanche" or "debt snowball" methods, alongside budget cuts and earning extra income through a side hustle, can accelerate the process of becoming debt-free.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using military personnel for domestic law enforcement activities in California, ruling that the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The law restricts the use of the military for civilian law enforcement. The case specifically concerned the deployment of National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles earlier in the year. The judge noted that President Trump's stated desire to send troops to other cities supported the need for the injunction, which currently applies only to California. The White House criticized the ruling and is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>A fact-check addresses several claims surrounding the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of attempting a coup d'état following his election loss. The analysis concludes it is misleading to claim the trial's purpose is to disqualify him from politics, as he is already barred from running in 2026 due to prior convictions. It also finds claims of judicial abuse by a Supreme Court justice to be misleading, noting that while some legal experts have raised procedural questions, the court has not been found to have exceeded its powers.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields saw a significant increase as the market reacted to a federal court ruling that invalidated most of the Trump administration's tariffs. Investors are concerned that if the ruling is upheld, the government may have to refund billions of dollars in collected duties, which would worsen the U.S. budget deficit and potentially require a surge in Treasury issuance. The 30-year Treasury yield surpassed 4.97%, its highest since late July, contributing to a significant drop in the stock market. The development adds another layer of fiscal uncertainty for bond investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion column argues that while Donald Trump's actions often appear autocratic, his main focus is on cultivating the image of a powerful, dictatorial leader rather than achieving lasting policy changes. The author points to executive orders, like a supposed ban on flag burning, that are largely symbolic and lack legal teeth but generate media attention for his perceived strength. This preference for appearance over substance is described as a political weakness, as his executive actions can be easily reversed, unlike legislation passed through Congress. The article concludes that Trump's unique trait is not the power grabs themselves, but his open boasting about them.</p>
