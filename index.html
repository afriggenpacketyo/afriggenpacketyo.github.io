          <p>Elon Musk announced that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft in response to President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies. This decision came amid escalating tensions between Musk and Trump over the Republican tax bill. Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX has been developing a replacement for Dragon, with plans to fly Dragon for six to eight more years, though the Starship rocket, which is intended to replace Dragon, has faced testing setbacks.</p>

Yusuf's departure highlights internal tensions within Reform UK regarding policy and professionalization, with some suggesting his modernization efforts faced resistance and prejudice. The resignation also led to the departure of Nathaniel Fried, who was leading the Doge teams initiative to cut wasteful spending in councils.</p>
