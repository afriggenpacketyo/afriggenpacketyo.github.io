        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon plans to invest approximately $4 billion by the end of 2026 to expand its delivery network in rural towns across the U.S., aiming to bring faster shipping times to more customers. This expansion will add over 200 delivery stations, tripling the size of Amazon's rural delivery network and creating about 170 jobs at each new site. The company intends to cut average delivery times in half by bringing products closer to customers, even as other logistics providers are backing away from rural service due to cost considerations. The move comes as Amazon prepares to report its first-quarter earnings.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student with a green card, was released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order in Vermont. Mahdawi was detained on April 16 during his U.S. citizenship interview. His attorneys argued that the Trump administration sought to deport him in retaliation for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, infringing on his First Amendment rights. Judge Geoffrey Crawford cited concerns about chilling efforts by the government to suppress debate, referencing historical parallels to the Red Scare. The government justified Mahdawi's detention under the Immigration and Nationality Act, alleging his presence would have adverse foreign policy consequences related to antisemitism.</p>

          <p>The American Parents Coalition (APC) has filed a brief supporting a lawsuit against a Florida middle school accused of socially transitioning a 13-year-old girl without parental consent. The APC argues that social transitioning constitutes medical treatment, and parents possess a substantive due process right to be informed about and refuse treatments administered to their minor child by the school. The lawsuit was filed by January and Jeffrey Littlejohn, who claim the school's actions created a divide between them and their daughter. The APC asserts that social transitioning is the initial step in treating gender dysphoria, necessitating parental involvement.</p>

          <p>A student allegedly discharged a possible firearm inside a classroom at Westside Global Awareness Magnet in Marina del Rey, prompting a brief lockdown. No injuries were reported, and the student reportedly fled the campus. Law enforcement sources indicate the student was a 13-year-old boy, and the gun may have discharged accidentally from inside a backpack. School district officials notified parents of the incident and confirmed that the campus was swept by law enforcement, and the lockdown was lifted. The school is providing on-campus support, extra patrols, and counseling services, and a parent meeting is scheduled to discuss the incident.</p>

          <p>The NFL has fined the Atlanta Falcons $250,000 and assistant coach Jeff Ulbrich $100,000 after Ulbrich's son admitted to making a prank call to prospective quarterback Shedeur Sanders during the NFL draft. Jax Ulbrich, 21, obtained Sanders' number from his father's iPad, which contained confidential team information. The call involved impersonating the New Orleans Saints' general manager and falsely claiming the team would draft Sanders, who was eventually selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round. The Falcons facilitated an apology from Jax Ulbrich to Sanders, and the team has accepted the NFL's disciplinary actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite campaign promises to cut spending, the Trump administration's federal government has spent over $200 billion more in the first 100 days compared to the same period last year. The increase is attributed to factors such as uncontrollable big-ticket expenditures, the fundamentals of the government's budget, and political considerations related to military and veterans' spending. Rising costs are particularly evident in direct payments to the military and seniors, as well as skyrocketing interest payments on the national debt. While the administration has attempted cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), these efforts have faced legal challenges and have had limited impact on the overall budget.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority appears inclined to permit the creation of the nation's first religious charter school funded directly by taxpayer dollars. The justices heard arguments in a case from Oklahoma, where the state Supreme Court blocked the Catholic Church from receiving a charter school contract due to constitutional bans on government-sponsored sectarian education. Supporters of the school argue that excluding it from charter school funding constitutes religious discrimination, while opponents maintain that charter schools are public institutions subject to separation of church and state principles. A ruling in favor of the school could have widespread implications for charter schools nationwide.</p>

          <p>A controversial agreement between the IRS and ICE allows immigration authorities to access tax data from up to five million people, many of whom are undocumented immigrants who have paid taxes using ITINs. This has led to fear and confusion among immigrants, some of whom are now hesitant to file taxes, despite having been told for decades that doing so is the right thing to do. Legal challenges have been filed to block the agreement, with concerns raised about violations of federal law and taxpayer privacy. The Trump administration has also implemented a policy requiring immigrants over 14 to register with USCIS, which critics compare to past repressive practices.</p>

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are influenced by several factors, including the federal funds rate, the prime rate, loan-to-value ratio, credit score, and miscellaneous economic data. The federal funds rate, controlled by the Federal Reserve, has a major impact on HELOC rates, as demonstrated by the recent decline in HELOC rates mirroring Fed rate cuts. The prime rate, which is the median rate that banks charge customers, also affects HELOC rates. Smaller loan amounts and higher credit scores typically result in lower rates for borrowers. It is important to shop around and secure rate offers from multiple lenders to determine the lowest rate.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney assumes the role of Canada's prime minister, navigating divisions within the country, including a generational divide. Younger voters, concerned about housing unaffordability, crime, and the cost of living, supported the Conservatives, reversing the trend from 2015 when youth voters helped elect Justin Trudeau. While the Liberals gained seats in a historic comeback, the Conservatives also made significant gains, preventing a decisive majority. The Liberals won 169 seats and 43% of the popular vote, while the Conservatives secured 144 seats and 41% of the vote.</p>
