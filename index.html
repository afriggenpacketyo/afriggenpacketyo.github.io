          <p>In the culminating bout of their epic trilogy, Ireland's Katie Taylor secured a majority decision victory over Amanda Serrano, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship. The fight, held at a sold-out Madison Square Garden, was a gripping, tactical affair that differed from their previous all-out brawls but remained intensely compelling. Two judges scored the contest 97-93 for Taylor, while one scored it a 95-95 draw. The event was particularly historic as it was the first all-female card hosted at the iconic venue, with Taylor acknowledging that she and Serrano are now "history makers forever" in the world of women's boxing.</p>

          <p>Negotiations in Qatar between Israel and Hamas for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal are reportedly on the brink of failure, according to Palestinian officials. The officials claim Israel's delegation lacked the authority to make decisions on key issues, such as the withdrawal of troops and the mechanisms for humanitarian aid distribution, effectively stalling the talks. A major point of contention is a map provided by Israel showing proposed buffer zones significantly deeper than previously discussed, which Hamas viewed as a bad-faith maneuver. This breakdown in trust has led negotiators to believe the talks were used to buy time during diplomatic visits.</p>

          <p>Jane Ragsdale, the owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls, was among the victims of the catastrophic July Fourth flooding in Kerrville, Texas. Ragsdale, who was in her late 60s, was a beloved and central figure in her community, known for her generosity, leadership, and dedication to the generations of girls who attended her camp. Unlike another nearby camp that suffered many casualties, Heart O' the Hills was between sessions, with Ragsdale being the only person killed there. Friends and community members remember her as a genuine and kind person who embodied the spirit of the region and would have been at the forefront of recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, survivors and family members of the deceased are sharing their stories of recovery and grappling with unanswered questions. The attack by gunman Thomas Crooks killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore and severely injured David Dutch and James Copenhaver. The survivors are still dealing with significant physical and psychological trauma but are focused on living life to the fullest for their families. An independent report on the incident cited major security failures, including insufficient personnel and poor communication, which allowed the shooter to position himself on a nearby roof undetected before opening fire.</p>

          <p>Chinese analysts are observing a growing, yet potentially unstable, alliance between US tech executives and the 'Make America Great Again' political movement, which could intensify the tech rivalry with China. This trend includes increased cooperation between Silicon Valley and the US defense industry, leading to concerns that tech leaders may adopt a more aggressive, interventionist foreign policy. While many of Trump's tech supporters advocate for continued pressure to contain China's technological development and further decoupling, analysts suggest that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the MAGA camp could ultimately undermine these efforts to reshape US politics and foreign policy toward China.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Arizona have forced the immediate evacuation of all residents from the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. One blaze, the Dragon Bravo Fire, was sparked by lightning on July 4 and has grown to 150 acres with zero containment. A larger fire, the White Sage Fire, is burning just north of the park and has consumed nearly 11,000 acres, also with no containment, prompting further evacuations and road closures. Firefighting efforts are being challenged by strong winds, low humidity, and critically dry conditions in the rugged terrain. Nearby in Colorado, similar lightning-sparked fires have also led to the complete evacuation of a national park.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration stops in seven Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling by Judge Maame E.

The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and enjoined agents from making stops based solely on factors like race, accent, or presence at day laborer sites. The order follows recent clashes between protesters and agents during raids.</p>

In response, Prada held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. This move is seen as a step toward respectful partnership between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities, prompting the Chamber to pursue a patent for the sandals.</p>

This expansion reflects a preference among Chinese businesses for legal support from their compatriots, whom they tend to trust more. However, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients, particularly amid rising geopolitical tensions.

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has revealed a baffling discovery: both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position just seconds after takeoff. This action starved the engines of fuel, causing a total loss of power. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he initiated the cut-off, to which the second pilot replied that he had not. Investigators are struggling to understand how this could have happened, as the switches have multiple safety features to prevent accidental activation, making an inadvertent deployment highly unlikely and deepening the mystery of the disaster.</p>

Pneumonic plague is the most deadly form and can spread between people.

          <p>Dozens of independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been abruptly cut off by the popular soft toy brand Jellycat, leaving owners feeling devastated and confused. The company sent emails informing about 100 stores that it would no longer supply them as part of a "brand elevation strategy," without providing specific reasons. This move comes after a year of explosive growth for Jellycat, fueled by social media trends on TikTok. Many small retailers, who have stocked the brand for decades and helped build its popularity, now feel they are being cast aside in favor of larger department stores, which receive priority for the in-demand stock.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, an undocumented immigrant and father of three U.S. Marines, is set to be released on bond after being held for 20 days in a federal facility. His arrest went viral after a video showed masked federal agents violently tackling and beating him outside a Santa Ana IHOP. An immigration judge ordered his release on a $3,000 bond, and his family plans to seek immediate medical care for injuries they believe he sustained during the arrest. Barranco, who has lived in the U.S. for decades and is married to a U.S. citizen, had applied for parole-in-place, a program for relatives of military members, before his highly publicized detention.</p>

The president reassured residents that the government would provide support for rebuilding efforts, stating he had "never seen anything like" the devastation. During a roundtable with local officials, Trump praised the heroism of first responders and volunteers who are searching for the 161 people still missing. He dismissed a question about the adequacy of early warnings as "evil," emphasizing the unprecedented nature of the disaster and the incredible spirit of the affected families.</p>

A mother, Iman al-Nouri, described the horrific aftermath, where she found her two young sons and teenage niece among the dead and another son critically wounded. The Israeli military stated it targeted a "Hamas terrorist" and that the incident was under review, while the aid group running the clinic condemned the strike as a violation of international law.

          <p>The mayor of Perris, California, has issued a public warning urging residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel due to ongoing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the region. In a video message, Mayor Michael Vargas advised residents to remain calm, not open their doors to strangers, and know their legal rights. This guidance comes as intensified federal immigration enforcement has created a climate of fear in immigrant communities across Southern California. The city of Perris, where nearly 80% of the population is Hispanic or Latino, stated its commitment to protecting residents' well-being but noted it lacks jurisdiction to interfere with federal agents.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle and replace the historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague has ignited a fierce debate between modernization and heritage preservation. The authority argues that the corroded bridge cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic and that a new, three-track bridge is necessary. However, a coalition of architects and experts, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, contends that the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. They propose building a second, slender bridge alongside the original to add capacity, preserving a crucial element of Prague's historic skyline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration aimed at reducing the federal workforce. The cuts have significantly impacted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee admissions, and foreign assistance, including the office that handles refugee resettlement and the entire global programs office of the population bureau. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the widespread layoffs will undermine U.S. diplomatic capabilities and national security.

The massive resort, hailed by Kim Jong Un as a world-class destination, was reportedly built using "shock brigades" of forced laborers who faced brutal conditions, long hours, and inadequate food, according to the UN and defectors. Satellite imagery shows rapid construction from 2018, followed by a pause until work resumed after a recent meeting between Kim and Vladimir Putin. While intended to attract foreign visitors, experts are skeptical it will become a popular destination for Russians due to superior and less restrictive alternatives.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is experiencing its most extreme marine heatwave ever recorded for this time of year, with sea surface temperatures regularly exceeding 30°C, more than six degrees above normal. Scientists express grave concern over the potentially devastating consequences for marine life, as many species struggle to cope with such prolonged and intense warmth. The heat can lead to mass mortality events for critical organisms like seagrasses, which act as vital habitats, and can also cause "sub-lethal effects" that prevent reproduction, threatening fish stocks. Experts warn the Med is a "climate change hotspot" and that this event is a stark indicator of future conditions.</p>

In a letter, OMB Chair Russell Vought criticized the project's alleged features like rooftop gardens and VIP dining rooms, which Powell has denied. This attack comes amid President Trump's persistent criticism of the Fed for not cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy. The letter suggests the Fed may have altered renovation plans without proper approval, a claim that adds a new dimension to the political pressure on the independent institution.

This fiscal pressure, combined with global uncertainty from U.S. tariffs, suggests that Chancellor Rachel Reeves may be forced to implement significant tax rises of £10bn to £20bn to stabilize public finances and meet self-imposed borrowing limits.
