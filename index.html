          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests, following clashes between demonstrators and federal agents. White House officials cite attacks on ICE officers as justification for the move, while California Governor Newsom has criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary. Defense Secretary Hegseth has threatened to mobilize U.S. Marines if violence escalates further, reflecting the administration's hardline stance. Trump praised the National Guard's efforts on social media before their official arrival, signaling continued federal intervention in the situation. Optimism is low as tensions remain high between state and federal authorities regarding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion piece criticizes CNN's broadcast of Broadwayâ€™s "Good Night and Good Luck," arguing it shamelessly equates CNN with heroic journalists like Edward R. Murrow and President Trump with Joseph McCarthy. The author contends that CNN and the liberal media have a history of dishonesty, citing the Russia collusion story and the editing of a Kamala Harris interview on "60 Minutes." The piece accuses CNN and figures like George Clooney of prioritizing attacks on Trump over journalistic integrity. The author concludes that CNN has not learned from its past lies and remains an unreliable news source, suggesting a lack of contrition within the network.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that the Trump administration's deportation program has net positive approval, particularly among Republicans, but is heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support hinges on the belief that dangerous criminals are prioritized, with approval dropping significantly if this isn't the perceived focus. The poll also indicates concerns over the program's scope, with half of Americans disapproving if they believe Trump is deporting more people than expected. While more Americans believe the program enhances safety, concerns persist about potential economic weakening and mistaken deportations of legal residents, highlighting a gap between the program's goals and its approach.</p>

          <p>This article critiques America's infatuation with narratives of 'boy geniuses' and 'Great Men,' arguing it perpetuates harmful myths and reinforces societal inequalities. It uses examples like WeWork's Adam Neumann, Fyre Festival's Billy McFarland, and portrayals of Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs in film to illustrate how these narratives often excuse unethical behavior and prioritize brute power. The author contends that this obsession distracts from systemic issues and hinders true progress, pointing to the concentration of wealth and the rise of authoritarian figures. The piece concludes that society must stop blindly celebrating people for 'changing the world' and instead focus on moral goodness and equitable distribution of power.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles as a constructive framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving positive outcomes through cooperation, and opposing external interference. China asserts its commitment to managing tensions and differences, while the report blames regional tensions on external actors fueling rival claimants. The proposal comes amid increasing face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed waters, particularly near Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal.</p>

          <p>The UK Science and Technology Secretary has urged the police to "do their bit" and "embrace change" as the Home Office and Treasury negotiate the upcoming Spending Review. While acknowledging pressure from various sectors for increased funding, the minister declined to rule out a squeeze on policing, despite concerns from the shadow home secretary about potential cuts to police numbers. This comes after police chiefs warned that years of cuts have left forces with outdated technology and further cuts would exacerbate inefficiencies. The Chancellor is set to announce departmental spending allocations for the next three to four years, indicating some departments will not receive their desired funding levels.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how the threat of "peaceful evolution" â€“ a strategy to subvert the Communist Party through Western values â€“ has receded in China due to Trump's policies. The author, born in China in the 1960s, recalls being taught to be vigilant against American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party. However, the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing others on governance, while China has emerged as a major economic and global power. This shift has diminished the perceived threat of American subversion, according to the article.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to revive manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers to build and maintain airplanes. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, and the industry faces a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are working to attract younger people, but the pandemic-induced layoffs exacerbated the existing retirement wave. High-value sectors like aviation tend to pay well and remain in the US, but hiring remains difficult, compounded by a shortage of air traffic controllers. The Trump administration aims to increase wages and hiring to address these shortfalls.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the evolution of US-China relations through the lens of a sports movie about an American football team in Chongqing. Initially, the story was seen as a tale of cross-cultural teamwork with Hollywood potential, but it was later adapted by a Chinese studio, reflecting a shift in power dynamics. The Chinese version centers on local characters and perspectives, highlighting the differences in cultural understanding and priorities. The author reflects on how both the American and Chinese versions of the story were shaped by their respective audiences and political contexts.</p>

          <p>This article questions Barack Obama's limited engagement in the political arena amidst Trump's actions, contrasting his low profile with the desperation of his admirers. While acknowledging Obama's achievements and right to enjoy his post-presidency, the author argues that his detachment is incongruous with the current political climate. Obama's advisors defend his judicious approach, emphasizing the need to preserve his voice and avoid overshadowing new Democratic leaders. The author suggests that Obama could play a more vocal role in challenging Trump's policies, particularly given his continued popularity and communication skills.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk over Trump's spending bill, arguing that the public is the most likely loser. While both criticize the bill, neither opposes its core flaw: redistributing wealth to the richest by cutting benefits for the middle class and poor. The author contends that the ability of wealthy individuals to manipulate the system for their benefit reveals a deep problem in American democracy. The article also critiques the Republican Party's hypocrisy on fiscal discipline and other values, arguing that slashing public services for tax cuts remains their most consistent principle.</p>

The center-left Democratic Party supports the referendum, advocating for changes that would help second-generation Italians integrate and align Italy with other European countries.

          <p>India is rapidly becoming a dominant force in the chess world, boasting numerous grandmasters and the youngest-ever world champion, Gukesh Dommaraju. This surge is attributed to a pandemic-induced chess resurgence, strong grassroots support in Tamil Nadu, and parents who encourage chess as an academic pursuit. Chennai, in particular, has become a hub for chess training, with schools granting holidays for practice and local businesses sponsoring players. While English language proficiency remains a challenge, initiatives like YouTube channels teaching chess in Tamil are expanding access to the game.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Pell Grants in Trump's spending plan could significantly reduce college access for low-income students. The cuts would lower the maximum Pell Grant for the 2026-2027 academic year to its lowest level in over a decade, potentially increasing student debt and forcing some to drop out. Experts warn that the cuts would disproportionately affect the lowest-income families, as Pell Grants are often the foundation of financial aid for these students. While the Pell program has faced deficits in the past, slashing the award amount is considered an extreme measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that anti-Jewish attacks inadvertently strengthen the case for Zionism, the movement to create a Jewish state. Recent attacks on Jews in America, framed by perpetrators as acts of anti-Zionism, have raised the costs of being Jewish and reinforce the need for a safe haven. The author contends that the history of anti-Semitism, including the Holocaust and persecution in Arab and Muslim countries, has consistently driven Jews towards Israel. The author suggests that a rational anti-Zionist movement would focus on making Jews feel welcome outside of Israel, but the current movement often fuels the very fears that led to Zionism in the first place.</p>

They also gathered data to prove its effectiveness and safety, and advocated for its legalization. Today, the Socorristas en Red, the biggest abortion accompaniment network in the world, continues to provide support to women, even in countries where abortion is legal.</p>
