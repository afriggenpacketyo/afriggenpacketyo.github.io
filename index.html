          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), originating from its US-East-1 region, caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites and applications worldwide. The issue was identified as a DNS problem with DynamoDB, a core database service, affecting over 70 of Amazon's own services and impacting companies like Disney+, Reddit, and United Airlines. The outage also paralyzed critical internal tools at Amazon, affecting warehouse operations and delivery drivers. While services were largely restored after several hours, the event highlights the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers for its infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Steel manufacturing company Cleveland-Cliffs is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. The announcement, made during its third-quarter earnings call, caused the company's shares to jump by approximately 17%. This move aligns with a broader U.S. strategy to establish domestic sources for critical minerals, reducing reliance on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain. The potential venture could position Cleveland-Cliffs as a key player in supplying materials for defense, electric vehicles, and technology. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are facing the challenge of making coverage decisions during an ongoing federal government shutdown. While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services states that critical enrollment activities will continue, experts suggest that accessing detailed information and assistance through official channels like the 1-800-Medicare hotline may be difficult due to staffing shortages. Financial author Philip Moeller advises people to wait until the government reopens before finalizing their 2026 plans to ensure they can make fully informed decisions. The enrollment period allows changes to Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Part D prescription plans.</p>

          <p>Instagram is rolling out new parental controls that automatically apply 'PG-13' style content filters for all users under the age of 18. This update will restrict teen accounts from viewing mature or risky content, including sexually suggestive material and topics like alcohol or tobacco, unless a parent approves a less restrictive setting. The changes were developed based on feedback from thousands of parents who rated sample posts for age appropriateness. For stricter control, a new 'Limited Content' setting will also be available, further filtering material and restricting interactions on the platform.</p>

          <p>Scottish Premiership club Rangers has appointed former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Rohl as its new head coach, ending a search that began after the dismissal of Russell Martin. The club had previously engaged in unsuccessful talks with former manager Steven Gerrard and ex-defender Kevin Muscat. Rohl, a 36-year-old German, has prior coaching experience with RB Leipzig, Southampton, and Bayern Munich. He takes over a team currently sitting sixth in the league and has emphasized that there is no time to waste in turning the season around and meeting fan expectations for immediate results.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated he would attend a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin if he were invited. The statement follows Trump's announcement of a future summit in Budapest to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy emphasized that any resolution concerning Ukraine requires Ukrainian participation, expressing a desire for a just and lasting peace. However, he voiced skepticism about the choice of Hungary as a venue, citing Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Russia-friendly stance and the history of the failed 1994 Budapest Memorandum.</p>

This event is noted as one of over 400 mass shootings in the U.S. this year, renewing calls for more substantial gun control legislation.

          <p>This article delves into the persistent issue of violent crime in Chicago, challenging political narratives that either oversimplify the problem or downplay its severity. It highlights the tragic murder of 24-year-old police officer Aréanah Preston as a symbol of the city's struggles, noting that despite a recent drop, Chicago's homicide rate remains significantly higher than that of New York or Los Angeles. The analysis attributes the problem to decades of disinvestment, residential segregation, and ineffective policing. The piece argues that true solutions require addressing the city's deep-seated social and economic issues rather than relying on political rhetoric or simplistic enforcement strategies.</p>

This marks the second time the UK restaurant business has faced administration in less than a year.

The shutdown persists due to a stalemate in the Senate, where Democrats are demanding that any funding bill include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.

Other techniques include anticipating criticism to manage feedback constructively and directly asking for positive reinforcement to balance the focus on adjustments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) generally lose their value more quickly than internal combustion engine cars, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include historically larger government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline for resale values. Additionally, the rapid advancement of EV technology, particularly in battery range, makes older models less desirable to value-oriented used car buyers. As the market matures and a wider variety of more affordable EV models become available, these depreciation dynamics could begin to change.</p>

          <p>This article explains the eligibility requirements for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a process that can wipe out most unsecured debts but is not available to everyone. The primary obstacle is the 'means test,' which compares a filer's household income to their state's median income. Those with income below the median generally qualify automatically, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. Other factors, such as recent bankruptcy filings and the completion of credit counseling, also affect eligibility.

Under his brief tenure, the team struggled, earning just six points in his last 18 league games combined with his previous club.

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, currently the acting NASA administrator, stated that Elon Musk's SpaceX is falling behind schedule on its contract for the Artemis moon mission. Duffy announced he will open the lunar landing system contract to other companies to ensure the U.S. wins the 'second space race' against China. NASA has already delayed the next Artemis missions, with the crewed lunar landing now scheduled for 2027. Duffy expressed a desire to land on the moon during the current president's term and identified Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin as a potential competitor for the contract.</p>

          <p>Following a tense White House meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump has publicly called for an immediate halt to the war in Ukraine, suggesting the current battle lines be frozen. This proposal would effectively leave Russia in control of the occupied Donbas region, a condition Ukraine has repeatedly rejected. The call came after Trump held separate discussions with both the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, and it signals a potential shift in U.S. policy toward a resolution that favors Russian territorial gains. The meeting was reportedly contentious, with Trump expressing frustration over the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The Economist has released its third annual 'Carrie Bradshaw Index,' which identifies the U.S. cities where an individual with a median salary can afford to live alone in a studio apartment. Wichita, Kansas, ranked as the most affordable city, where median wages are 75% higher than what is needed to rent a typical studio. The index, which uses the 30% rule for rent-to-income ratios, found that 41 of the analyzed cities were unaffordable, an increase from 38 last year. Several Texas cities, including Dallas and Austin, shifted from the affordable to the unaffordable category due to rising rents.</p>
