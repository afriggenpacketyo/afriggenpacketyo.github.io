          <h2>Movie Studio Stocks Decline Following Trump's Proposed Foreign Film Tariff</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 09:31:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery experienced a downturn after President Trump suggested imposing a 100% tariff on movies produced overseas, citing foreign tax incentives as a national security concern. The proposed tariff raises questions about its implementation, scope (whether it includes TV shows), and impact on already completed projects. Industry experts worry about potential retaliatory measures from other countries, given Hollywood's reliance on international box office sales, especially with China already limiting access to Hollywood films. The article highlights the uncertainty surrounding the tariff's effect on the production process and international relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army is sending an honour guard to participate in Victory Day parades in Minsk and Moscow, marking the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat. This marks the first time a Chinese honour guard has participated in Minsk's Victory Day event. Analysts suggest this gesture, along with recent defense diplomacy, signals China's support for the post-World War II international system, which Beijing believes is currently under threat. Videos circulating on Chinese social media show rehearsals of Chinese soldiers in both Minsk and Moscow, including practicing the patriotic song "Guerrillas' Song."</p>

Klingbeil, known for his calm demeanor, was instrumental in negotiating the coalition agreement after the SPD's poor performance in the recent election. His cabinet picks signal a fresh start, with several long-serving ministers being replaced.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is standing trial in New York City on charges including sexual assault, trafficking, and racketeering conspiracy, with jury selection beginning Monday and opening statements scheduled for May 12. Combs faces multiple charges related to running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004, allegedly engaging in sex trafficking, forced labor, and other offenses. The indictment details a pattern of abuse toward women, including forced participation in commercial sex acts, physical assaults, and manipulation through money, drugs, and threats. A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, in 2016 is expected to be a key piece of evidence.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are divided over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are vital for remote Alaskan communities like Noatak, where residents face exorbitant electricity costs due to reliance on flown-in diesel. The Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy tax credits have enabled the village to invest in solar power, but their future is now uncertain due to efforts by President Trump and hard-right Republicans to defund the law. Senator Lisa Murkowski is advocating for the tax credits, warning that their repeal would jeopardize long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector, as Alaskans prepare for looming natural gas supply shortfalls.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is restarting student loan collections for millions of borrowers in default, coinciding with significant changes and disruptions in the federal lending system. Borrowers previously enrolled in the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan face uncertainty due to GOP-led lawsuits and may need to switch to other plans with higher monthly payments. Staff reductions at the Education Department have led to long wait times for borrowers seeking assistance, and borrowers in default may experience significant credit score declines as collection activity increases. Experts express concern that restarting collections amid such uncertainty will exacerbate economic challenges for working families.</p>

The plan involves adding tens of thousands of soldiers, though it remains unclear how this will fundamentally alter the conflict dynamics. Critics, including former Israeli military intelligence chief Tamir Hayman, argue that attempts to pressure Hamas with overwhelming force have been exhausted.
