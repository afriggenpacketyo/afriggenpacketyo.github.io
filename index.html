          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, showed a slight increase in May. The annual inflation rate stood at 2.3%, but the core PCE rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to 2.7%, higher than economists' expectations. This development moves the key inflation reading further from the Federal Reserve's target, which could influence future monetary policy decisions. The Fed considers the core rate a more reliable indicator of long-term inflation trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have formalized a trade framework aimed at resolving key economic disputes. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, the agreement will facilitate Chinese exports of rare earth materials in exchange for the U.S. easing a range of technology-related restrictions. This framework builds upon earlier talks in London and Geneva, which sought to de-escalate a fraught trade relationship marked by tariffs and curbs on critical materials. While the development is seen as a positive step, analysts caution that details remain sparse and trade in strategic goods will likely continue to be a point of negotiation.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire with Israel, Iran's government has intensified its crackdown on internal dissent, executing several individuals and arresting hundreds on accusations of spying for Israel. Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi reported that a high-security prison ward was mysteriously emptied, raising fears that political prisoners may have been moved to secret locations for mistreatment or execution. Human rights organizations report a sharp increase in executions and arrests, which experts interpret as the regime attempting to consolidate power at home after being weakened abroad. This brutal suppression targets not only political activists but also ordinary citizens under broad pretexts.</p>

The court heard that Akter had been living in a women's refuge after her husband, Habibur Masum, had previously threatened her with a knife.

          <p>The U.S. plans to withdraw from Gavi, an international alliance that provides lifesaving vaccines to children worldwide, a decision spearheaded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This move, rooted in Kennedy's skepticism about vaccine safety, could jeopardize a pledged $2.53 billion contribution, which Gavi estimated would have saved approximately 1.2 million lives. Critics are condemning the decision as catastrophic and based on scientifically unfounded beliefs, arguing it will lead to preventable deaths from diseases like measles and tuberculosis.

          <p>A classified intelligence briefing on the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities has created a partisan divide among senators, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of obstructing congressional oversight. The situation was further inflamed when President Trump claimed on social media that Democrats had leaked a Pentagon assessment suggesting the strikes had limited success, a report he has publicly contradicted. This political turmoil unfolds as Trump also pressures Republicans to pass his major tax-and-spending bill and his controversial new vaccine panel voted against a preservative in flu shots. The briefing highlighted deep divisions over the effectiveness and legality of the military action.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has fired Omead Afshar, the company's vice president of manufacturing and operations, as the automaker contends with declining car sales in key markets. Afshar's termination follows a difficult year for Tesla, which has seen its stock price fall and sales in Europe drop for five consecutive months. The company has faced significant brand and reputational damage, partly attributed to Musk's polarizing political activities and incendiary rhetoric. This high-level departure adds to recent executive changes at the company, signaling ongoing turmoil amid competitive and market pressures.</p>

Klingbeil, a career politician from Lower Saxony, is now tasked with navigating his party's decline while holding two of the most powerful positions in the new government.

Verstappen is currently contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but break clauses in his contract could allow for an early exit. The speculation is fueled by Red Bull's recent loss of performance dominance and key personnel, as well as the belief that Mercedes may have an advantage with the new engine regulations coming in 2026. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations are influenced by the team's pursuit of the Dutch superstar.</p>

          <p>The article examines whether "self-deportation"â€”immigrants choosing to leave the U.S. due to a hostile political climateâ€”is a growing phenomenon or a narrative amplified by the Trump administration. It features stories of individuals and families who have left, citing fears over the administration's policies, but experts caution against viewing these anecdotal cases as a widespread trend. They argue that promoting the idea of self-deportation is a political strategy for an administration that cannot feasibly deport as many people as it has promised. The piece also explores the problematic history of the term and the practical and emotional difficulties faced by those who choose to leave.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Zohran Mamdani's apparent victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary represents a significant blow to the established, passive wing of the Democratic party. The author posits that Mamdani, a 33-year-old socialist, energized voters with a clear moral vision and grassroots organizing, proving that the party's left flank is an asset, not a liability. The piece contrasts the energy of progressive voters with the risk-averse nature of the party's national leadership. Mamdani's success is framed as a potential model for a renewed, more active Democratic party that is more in tune with its base.</p>

Introduced globally in the 1970s, minibars were a logistical and financial burden for hotels due to high operational costs, food spoilage, and theft, often costing more to run than they earned. By the early 2000s, major chains like Marriott began removing them. In their place, hotels have shifted to more modern and profitable alternatives, including contactless lobby marketplaces, enhanced hotel bars, and strategic partnerships with food delivery apps like DoorDash and Grubhub.</p>

          <p>Quantum computing is attracting billions in investment from tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, as well as governments, all racing to build a practical device. The technology promises to solve certain problems impossible for traditional computers, with major potential applications in materials science, drug discovery, and chemistry. However, its most understood immediate impact is on national security, as a functional quantum computer could break most current forms of encryption, prompting a race to develop "post-quantum" security methods. Despite recent breakthroughs in error correction and scaling, experts believe a truly useful quantum computer is still many years, or even decades, away.</p>

          <p>Tesla recently held a small-scale, supervised launch of its robotaxi service for select invitees in Austin, Texas, generating mixed results. While some participants praised the vehicles' smoothness and maneuverability, others documented issues like driving on the wrong side of the road and sudden stops in traffic. The article highlights Tesla's unique camera-only approach to self-driving, which contrasts with competitors like Waymo that use lidar and radar. This long-promised robotaxi service is a key part of CEO Elon Musk's vision, but the limited and controlled nature of the launch shows the company is still far from a general, worldwide deployment.</p>

The conflicting messages reveal potential divisions or a shifting narrative within the Iranian leadership regarding the impact of the attacks.

During the strike, multiple bunker-buster bombs were dropped directly into ventilation shafts to cause maximum internal damage.

Using multiple dating techniques, they estimated a section of the rock to be approximately 4.16 billion years old, potentially settling a long-standing scientific debate over the formation's true age. Since Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago, such ancient rocks are extremely rare due to the planet's tectonic recycling process.

For Universal Credit, the health-related top-up will be reduced for new claimants and eligibility will be restricted for those under 22.

The book uses this fantasy premise to explore the dangers of erasing painful personal and collective histories, particularly the founding shame of settlers stealing land from Native Americans. The narrative argues against the fantasy of getting rid of the past, suggesting that memories must be shared and circulated for a society to be healthy and just.

          <p>The successful recovery of the grizzly bear population in the Yellowstone region has sparked a contentious debate over whether to remove it from the Endangered Species Act (ESA). While the population has exceeded all biological recovery goals, leading to increased human-bear conflicts, some biologists and conservationists argue a delisting is premature due to political threats to their habitat and state management plans that include hunting. The article explores this paradox, where a species' success creates new challenges, and frames the debate as a referendum on the purpose of the ESA itself. The outcome could set a precedent for how recovered species are managed and whether the act can withstand political pressure.</p>

          <p>German federal prosecutors have charged a Syrian national with supporting a foreign terrorist organization in connection with a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Austria, last year. The suspect, identified as Mohammad A., is accused of assisting a man in Austria who planned the attack by translating bomb-making instructions from Arabic and connecting him with an Islamic State member. The plot was discovered in August 2024, leading to the cancellation of three concerts and the arrest of three individuals in Austria. The case will now proceed to a Berlin court.</p>

          <h2>Judge Denies Bryan Kohberger's Bid to Introduce 'Alternate Perpetrator' Theories in Idaho Murders Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 07:27:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The judge presiding over the Idaho quadruple murder case has rejected a request from defendant Bryan Kohberger's defense team to present evidence of four potential "alternate perpetrators" to the jury. The judge ruled that the evidence linking these other individuals to the crime was irrelevant and would amount to "rank speculation," as none of their DNA matched samples from the scene and there was no other competent evidence. The judge also denied a request to postpone the trial, confirming that jury selection will begin in August for the case, in which Kohberger is accused of the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students.</p>

          <h2>China's Faltering Domestic Economy a Key Focus at World Economic Forum in Tianjin</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 07:19:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite optimistic official growth figures presented by Premier Li Qiang at the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Tianjin, China's domestic economy is showing signs of weakness. The article describes nearly empty shopping malls and car showrooms, indicating that Chinese consumers are saving rather than spending amid economic uncertainty. The fierce price war in the domestic auto market is eroding profits, and experts believe the old export-led growth model is no longer viable. The country is struggling with over-investment and the need to stimulate domestic consumption to maintain its economic momentum. (not investment advice)</p>
