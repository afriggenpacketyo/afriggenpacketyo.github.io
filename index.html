          <p>The UK's official COVID-19 inquiry has begun its examination of the pandemic's effects on the social care sector, a phase long-awaited by bereaved families. The investigation will scrutinize key government decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes without testing, which is blamed for introducing the virus to vulnerable populations. It will also address issues like the use of "do not resuscitate" orders and restrictive visiting policies that left families separated. Testimonies from care home managers and families highlight feelings of abandonment and the immense pressure placed on a sector lacking adequate guidance and resources.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were killed in what authorities describe as a targeted ambush in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The first responders were shot at by one or more gunmen while attending to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain, leading to an active and dangerous situation. Law enforcement officials are investigating the possibility that the fire was deliberately set to lure emergency personnel into an attack. The ongoing incident has prompted a shelter-in-place order for the area, with the FBI assisting local authorities in the search for the suspect or suspects amid the mountainous terrain.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's manager, Pep Guardiola, has expressed significant concern that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could severely disrupt and potentially "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season. He noted the immense physical toll on players due to the packed schedule, which leaves little time for rest and recovery. While acknowledging the financial incentives and prestige of the tournament, Guardiola sided with other managers who have criticized the relentless calendar imposed by football's governing bodies. He stated his intention is to remain relaxed for now but admitted he might have a different, more negative view of the situation later in the season.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Istanbul, Turkey, detained over 50 people and used a heavy police presence to block a banned LGBTQ+ Pride parade. The city's governor had prohibited the event, citing threats to "social peace, family structure, and moral values," a stance consistent with the government's increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community. Despite homosexuality not being a crime in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's administration has intensified its crackdown, creating what human rights groups call a hostile environment. Activists and opposition politicians defied the ban, asserting their right to exist and protest against the government's discriminatory policies.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The threat followed Tillis's opposition to Trump's major tax and spending bill, which the senator argued contained devastating cuts to Medicaid for his state. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, noting that such qualities are often scorned by one's own party. His departure opens up a key Senate seat in a historically Republican state.</p>

The prosecutor, using the pseudonym Hikari, claims she was not only assaulted but was later subjected to a campaign to silence her and was slandered by a colleague. After initially admitting to the charge, the accused former chief prosecutor has since recanted and claimed the encounter was consensual. The case highlights the immense pressure and secondary victimization faced by survivors who speak out against powerful figures within established Japanese institutions, echoing other recent MeToo cases in the country.</p>

          <p>According to preliminary government data, Japan's industrial output experienced a modest rise of 0.5 percent in May compared to the previous month. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported that the seasonally adjusted index of production at factories and mines reached 101.8, using 2020 as a base of 100. This slight increase suggests a degree of stability in the country's industrial sector, though it also points to a slow pace of growth. The figures are closely watched as an indicator of the health of Japan's manufacturing-heavy economy amid global economic uncertainties.</p>

In an interview, Ishiba emphasized that securing a majority in the 248-member upper chamber is a crucial goal for his Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner. However, he acknowledged the difficulty of this task as his party faces growing challenges from conservative voters who are exploring alternative political options. The outcome of the election will be a significant test of his leadership and political strategy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is increasing its efforts to combat a significant rise in attacks against religious facilities, which have nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023 according to FBI data. An assistant Attorney General described the attacks as a form of terrorism meant to intimidate communities and deter them from worship. Recent cases include planned attacks on churches and synagogues, often driven by white nationalism or animus towards minority groups. The department is prioritizing these cases, securing lengthy prison sentences for perpetrators to send a clear message that houses of worship are not soft targets in the United States.</p>

Enthusiasts use trail cams and forensic techniques, driven by the conviction that the wolf-like marsupial still roams the Tasmanian bush. Meanwhile, a separate scientific endeavor, backed by $15 million in funding, is attempting to "de-extinct" the animal by editing the DNA of its closest living relative. This dual quest, fueled by hope and remorse over the species' extinction, highlights a unique intersection of folklore, citizen science, and cutting-edge genetic engineering.</p>

The photos, now the subject of a play titled "Here There Are Blueberries," depict officers and staff socializing, singing, and enjoying leisure time, all while the systematic murder of 1.1 million people occurred nearby. Historians at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, who analyzed the album, were struck by the mundane and carefree nature of the images, which stand in stark contrast to the horrific reality of the camp. The collection offers a terrifying look at the capacity for human beings to compartmentalize and participate in mass atrocities.</p>

          <p>Renowned German filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, continues to create distinctive films that explore the edges of human sanity and the indifference of nature. In a recent interview, he reflected on his six-decade career, from making the grueling 1972 film "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" to his more recent documentaries. Herzog is known for his extreme filmmaking methods, such as physically hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for "Fitzcarraldo," insisting that such authenticity is essential to his art. He maintains that a filmmaker must possess "good criminal energy" and a willingness to operate outside the norm to capture profound truths on screen.</p>

          <p>The United States faces significant challenges in countering the growing threat of drone swarms over sensitive sites, stemming from both technological and legal issues. Standard radar systems often fail to detect small, low-flying drones, and downing them over populated areas poses a safety risk from debris. Furthermore, jurisdictional confusion among agencies like the FAA, FBI, and Department of Defense complicates a coordinated response. Jamming drone frequencies is also problematic as it can interfere with civilian services like Wi-Fi and GPS, making it a difficult solution to implement without broader consequences for the public.</p>

Whistleblowers have previously raised serious concerns about manufacturing standards at Boeing's South Carolina plant, alleging that defective parts were used and safety procedures were ignored to avoid delays.

The writers published on a Taiwan-based platform called Haitang, a popular hub for the genre.

          <p>A week after the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's success and objectives. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested the setback to Iran's program was limited to months. As the week progressed, officials appeared to shift their focus, emphasizing that the strike successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than focusing solely on the physical destruction of the nuclear facilities. This evolving narrative has sparked ongoing questions about the actual extent of the damage inflicted.</p>

          <p>Iran's deputy foreign minister has stated that the United States must guarantee it will not launch further military attacks as a precondition for resuming diplomatic negotiations. Speaking to the BBC, he said that while the U.S. has signaled a desire to return to talks, its position on forgoing future strikes during dialogue remains unclear. The demand follows a recent U.S. bombing raid on three Iranian nuclear sites amid escalating hostilities with Israel. Iran also insists on its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, rejecting the notion of zero enrichment as a basis for any discussion.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023 after Japan began releasing treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Chinese customs authorities stated that long-term monitoring showed no abnormalities, leading to the decision to "conditionally resume" imports. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to improve diplomatic ties with Tokyo amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States. However, restrictions will remain on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, and resumed shipments will require registration and radiation checks.</p>

          <p>Japan's Fair Trade Commission is set to fine Harley-Davidson's Japanese unit approximately 200 million yen ($1.4 million) for violating antimonopoly laws. The company allegedly pressured its dealers by imposing excessive sales quotas, implying that their contracts might not be renewed if targets were not met. This pressure reportedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to fulfill the quotas. The antitrust watchdog will also issue a cease and desist order to prevent the practice from recurring, which follows a similar case involving BMW's Japan unit in 2019.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a U.S. expert on Chinese law at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that historical context provides reasons for optimism about the future of U.S.-China relations. Drawing parallels to the post-1989 period, he notes that just as American students are beginning to return to China after the pandemic, there was a similar pioneering spirit in the mid-1990s. He observed a warm and welcoming reception for his students in China, indicating a desire for engagement despite current geopolitical ruptures. This perspective suggests that educational and cultural exchanges can help bridge divides even during periods of significant diplomatic strain.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski delivered a standout performance in a 5-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals, continuing his impressive midseason resurgence. Pitching six scoreless innings in relief, Wrobleski allowed only three hits and one walk while striking out six, showcasing improved velocity and command. After a difficult start to the season, the 24-year-old left-hander has become a reliable depth option for the team, posting a 2.73 ERA in June. His recent success, fueled by mechanical adjustments and a more aggressive approach, is raising his stock within the organization's pitching hierarchy.</p>
