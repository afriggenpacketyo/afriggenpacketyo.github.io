          <p>A small plane crashed into a Simi Valley neighborhood, killing the pilot, his son, and their dog. The Vans RV-10 aircraft, en route to Camarillo Airport from Lancaster, crashed into two homes, causing structural damage and fire. Residents were evacuated without injury. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause, examining weather conditions, the pilot's experience, and potential aircraft failures. Neighbors reported the plane circling the area before the crash, suggesting a possible loss of control. The wreckage has been moved to a secure facility for further evaluation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will meet with Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to discuss trade matters, marking a potentially key moment after recent tariff escalations.

This meeting comes amid stock market turbulence and fears of slower economic growth and higher consumer prices resulting from the ongoing trade war.

          <p>President Trump stated that the number of hostages believed to be alive in Gaza has decreased to 21, with three confirmed dead. This announcement follows Israel's approval of plans to seize the Gaza Strip indefinitely, aiming to recover hostages and dismantle Hamas. The plan has faced international opposition. One American, Edan Alexander, is among those presumed alive, while the remains of other Americans are also believed to be held by Hamas following the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

          <p>India confirmed that its armed forces carried out strikes against Pakistan and what it refers to as Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting "terrorist infrastructure." The operation, named "Operation Sindoor," was a response to a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that resulted in 26 deaths last month. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes, asserting Pakistan's right to retaliate. Pakistani state media claimed that three Indian Air Force fighter jets were shot down. The Indian embassy in the U.S. stated that its actions were precise and targeted only known terror camps.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India conducted strikes on sites in Pakistan, escalating tensions between the two nuclear powers. India stated it targeted nine sites used by terrorists, while Pakistan reported that at least eight people were killed and 35 wounded in six locations. The strikes mark a significant escalation as they extended beyond Pakistan-administered Kashmir into Punjab Province. Pakistan has vowed to respond, raising concerns about potential further conflict and prompting international calls for de-escalation. The attacks follow a militant assault in Kashmir that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, on April 22.</p>

          <p>A Canadian retailer, Luke Therrien, is bypassing American middlemen and establishing direct relationships with Chinese suppliers due to trade tensions, stock shortages, and tariffs. This shift involves navigating logistical challenges but aims for a more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chain. Amid the trade war, tariffs are reshaping how goods are sourced and traded across borders. Therrien's company is adjusting its purchasing strategy to move more sourcing outside the U.S. to find direct players, highlighting the need for businesses to adapt to the changing global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed SB 700 into law, prohibiting local governments from adding fluoride to public water supplies, citing informed consent and medical freedom. The law, part of the Florida Farm Bill, allows private suppliers to still offer fluoridated water. Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson stated the law ensures Floridians are not medicated without their consent. This aligns with the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, emphasizing consumer choice and skepticism of centralized health mandates. DeSantis also addressed geoengineering, promising action against unilateral chemical applications. Critics argue fluoridation prevents tooth decay, but DeSantis cited concerns about fluoride's effects on pregnant women and children.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspapers are reporting on a new £5bn trade deal between India and the UK, with different perspectives on its implications. The Telegraph highlights concerns from Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, describing the agreement as a 'two-tier' tax deal exempting Indian migrants from National Insurance payments. The Times and Daily Mail also focus on Conservative and Reform criticism, alleging the deal will make it easier and cheaper to hire Indian workers. The i newspaper cites accusations of a "two-tier" tax system, while the government defends the deal as similar to agreements with the US and EU. The Daily Express leads with "Labour turmoil" over Keir Starmer's refusal to reverse cuts to winter fuel payments for OAPs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's claims of securing close to $9 trillion in new investments in the U.S. are not supported by evidence, according to CBS News Confirmed. While companies have announced significant investments since his inauguration, the White House has not provided data to justify the $9 trillion figure. A CBS News review found that some investments cited by the White House were announced before Trump took office. Additionally, the administration is comparing future investment pledges with a narrower list of completed projects under the previous administration. Experts caution that planned investment announcements do not guarantee actual action.</p>

          <p>The upcoming conclave to elect the next Pope is marked by divides within the Catholic Church regarding the legacy of Pope Francis. While many cardinals support building on his work, some critics remain unconvinced, potentially influencing the vote. Pope Francis's efforts to shift the Church's focus towards the marginalized and his attempts to reform the Vatican have sparked debate. The conclave is the most diverse in history, with representatives from countries like South Sudan and Papua New Guinea. The new Pope will need to balance spiritual leadership with the demands of global influence and address issues ranging from declining congregations in Europe to social issues in Africa and Asia.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala sparked controversy among South Asian fans after two first-time attendees, Shah Rukh Khan and Diljit Dosanjh, were perceived to be dismissed by Vogue livestream hosts.

This perceived lack of respect for the South Asian superstars, who have cultivated international followings, has led to disappointment and criticism online. A representative for Vogue said that the cutaway from Dosanjh was unintentional and that they were thrilled to include Khan's clip.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States and the Houthis in Yemen have reached an agreement to halt American airstrikes after the militants agreed to cease attacks on American vessels in the Red Sea. However, the Houthis stopped short of declaring a full cease-fire, stating they would continue to fight Israel. Experts are skeptical that the agreement will lead to a long-term cessation of attacks in the Red Sea, as the Houthis have only promised not to target American vessels. The situation is further complicated by Iran's involvement and the Houthis' stated intention to retaliate against Israel.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the Apple TV show “Your Friends & Neighbors,” which stars Jon Hamm and portrays the wealthy in a mostly miserable light. The article contrasts this portrayal with other media that either glamorize wealth or judge the rich. The author explores whether the show’s depiction of affluent unhappiness is accurate, suggesting that societal and aesthetic shifts have diminished the appeal of upper-class lifestyles. The author concludes that while the show offers a reassuring perspective for those with “meritocratic status anxiety”, it might be too bleak to be fully convincing.</p>
