          <p>President Trump is scheduled to host a private dinner at the White House for several prominent figures in the technology industry, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Sam Altman. The event aims to continue the administration's engagement with tech CEOs, many of whom have previously attended White House meetings and contributed to the president's inauguration fund. Notably, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was invited but will not be in attendance, sending a company representative instead, following a public disagreement with the administration earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a lethal strike on a boat in the Caribbean, alleging it was operated by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and was involved in drug trafficking. This action marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's strategy to combat the gang, which it has designated a foreign terrorist organization. While the administration asserts the strike was necessary to counter an imminent threat, details about the intelligence used to identify the individuals remain undisclosed, raising questions about the new combative approach to drug trafficking in the region.</p>

          <p>According to data from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, U.S. companies announced nearly 86,000 job cuts in August, a 39% increase from the previous month and the highest for August since 2020. The pharmaceutical and finance industries were the most affected, with employers citing economic and market factors as the primary drivers for the layoffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially abandoned a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from airline industry groups, who argued it would increase ticket prices and operational burdens. The decision to shelve the proposal aligns with the current administration's focus on deregulation, and the department is also reviewing other Biden-era airline regulations, including those on ancillary fee disclosures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell nearly 20% to their lowest point since its July IPO after releasing its first quarterly earnings report as a public company. While second-quarter revenue of $249.6 million slightly exceeded analyst expectations, investors reacted negatively, continuing a trend of high volatility for the stock. The company's forecast for third-quarter revenue, though showing continued growth, did not prevent the significant sell-off, which has erased more than half of the stock's value since its trading debut.

          <p>In his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the complex nature of pain and strategies for managing it beyond traditional medication. As a neurosurgeon, Gupta explains how the brain processes pain signals, sometimes making mistakes like in the case of phantom limb pain, and how mental techniques like meditation can be used to retrain the brain's response. The book also covers the body's natural opioid system, the role of inflammation in healing, and new non-opioid medications being developed to offer relief without the same risks.</p>

          <p>The District of Columbia has sued the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement in the city is unconstitutional and illegal. The lawsuit, filed by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, seeks a permanent injunction to halt the deployment, which was initiated as part of the president's nationwide crime crackdown. The administration maintains that the president is acting within his lawful authority under D.C.'s Home Rule Act to protect federal assets and assist local law enforcement during an emergency.</p>

          <h2>New Senate Bill Proposes Eliminating Federal Taxes on Social Security Benefits</h2>

          <p>A new bill introduced in the Senate, the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," aims to permanently eliminate all federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. To offset the revenue loss and bolster the program's finances, the legislation would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to all annual earnings above $250,000. Proponents argue this would provide financial relief to seniors and extend the solvency of the Social Security trust funds, contrasting with a recent temporary tax deduction for seniors that did not include a funding offset.</p>

Pulte has made multiple criminal referrals to the Department of Justice against Cook, who has denied the allegations and is suing to block her termination by President Trump.</p>
