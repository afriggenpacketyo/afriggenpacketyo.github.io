          <p>Senior Pentagon officials provided details about Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission to bomb Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. According to Gen. Dan Caine, the operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri, with additional B-2s acting as decoys. The mission included in-flight refuelings, fighter jet support, and the launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles from a U.S. submarine, with over 125 U.S. aircraft participating overall. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described the attack as an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it targeted the Iranian nuclear program without harming Iranian troops or civilians. The operation employed Massive Ordnance Penetrators to inflict severe damage to the targeted sites, with initial assessments confirming the destruction. </p>

          <p>Chinese companies, known for their risk tolerance in overseas markets, are increasingly facing escalating risks in conflict-ridden African nations. These risks include geopolitical instability, political unrest, policy changes, and security threats, impacting their investments in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Mali, and Sudan. Chinese firms have experienced attacks on mining sites, kidnappings of workers, and hijackings, leading to significant financial and human costs. President Xi Jinping has called for severe punishment for those responsible for attacks on Chinese nationals, highlighting the severity of the threats faced by these companies.</p>

          <p>Kyoto saw a record 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, totaling 56.06 million visitors overall, yet satisfaction levels remained high among both foreign and Japanese tourists. Temples, shrines, and historical sites like Kiyomizu temple and Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine were popular attractions, however Japanese visitors reported more dissatisfaction due to crowds and public transportation issues. To address overtourism, Kyoto is set to implement a lodging tax increase in 2026, with revenues allocated to strengthening measures against overtourism, as the city aims to balance tourism with resident quality of life. The survey, conducted over four periods in 2024, gathered responses from over 5,500 visitors to understand their experiences and satisfaction levels.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton suffered a lower right-leg injury during Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder and was unable to return to the game. Haliburton, who had been crucial to the Pacers' playoff success, appeared to reaggravate a previous calf injury, as his father indicated that the injury was to his Achilles. The injury occurred in the first quarter, causing Haliburton visible pain and forcing him to be helped off the court, as his absence significantly impacted the Pacers' chances of winning the championship. Haliburton had been a key player throughout the playoffs, making important shots and leading the team's offense.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, President Donald Trump addressed the possibility of regime change in Iran on his Truth Social platform. Referencing his "Make America Great Again" slogan, Trump questioned why a regime change wouldn't occur if the current Iranian regime couldn't achieve similar success. This statement comes after Trump authorized the bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, an operation he described as a "spectacular military success," and as a result, Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated."</p>

          <p>A shooting at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulted in one person injured and the death of the alleged gunman. The suspect, a 31-year-old man, arrived at the church armed with a long gun and handgun, firing at the building from the outside, and a security guard for the church was shot in the leg by the gunman. A parishioner struck the man with their vehicle, and at least two staff members returned fire, killing the attacker, as the FBI is assisting with the investigation to determine the motive behind the shooting. Despite the chaos, Pastor Bobby Kelly Jr. noted that the parishioners recognized the situation could have been far worse.</p>

          <p>China has criticized the United States and Israel, calling for de-escalation of the conflict with Iran and prioritizing civilian safety and adherence to international law. China's UN ambassador, Fu Cong, stated that the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear facilities violated Iranian sovereignty, exacerbated tensions, and undermined the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. While the UN Security Council emphasized ending the conflict, divisions emerged along geopolitical lines, with China and Russia defending Iran, and the U.S. and its allies defending Israel. China's criticism was largely diplomatic, while Moscow expressed stronger condemnation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that parents who avoid defiance do not use threats, bribes, or harsh consequences, but instead use language that encourages cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that respects a child's autonomy fosters natural cooperation. Examples include explaining decisions instead of saying "Because I said so," and framing requests positively rather than using threats, as these shifts create a safer emotional environment, and children thrive when they feel respected and involved.</p>

Constant online monitoring is becoming normalized, prompting calls for education on healthy digital relationships. Cyberstalking, defined as using digital tools to harass or spread false information, mirrors physical stalking, causing fear and distress. Experts believe the normalization of digital surveillance contributes to concerning behaviors, as sharing locations and constant messaging are often seen as signs of love and care, especially when parents are doing it for safety.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge ordered the release of Kilmar Ábrego García, whose mistaken deportation has become a focal point in immigration debates, while he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges. However, he is expected to remain in ICE custody, and potentially face deportation before his trial. Judge Barbara Holmes acknowledged that determining Ábrego García's release is largely academic given ICE's likely intervention, but emphasized his right to the presumption of innocence. Ábrego García has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which his attorneys claim are an attempt to justify the deportation error, as the U.S. government is now expected to try to deport him again.</p>

NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to reach those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources, and it is available for people with a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 if from a minority ethnic background) and four out of five specified conditions. Some GP practices are warning patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments, and pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand will outstrip supply, while the NHS plans to expand access to more people in the coming years.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the goal of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. Trump warned Iran against retaliating, stating that any retaliation would be met with far greater force, as Defense Department officials confirmed that B-2 Spirit bombers were used in the strikes. Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction, although Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial trade passage connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, is crucial for the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. Iran's control over the northern side of the strait makes it a vital oil "chokepoint," and disruptions could severely impact international energy markets, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that blocking the strait would be a "suicidal move" for Iran.</p>
