          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure plans to deploy 50,000 AMD Instinct MI450 AI chips starting in the second half of 2026, signaling a major challenge to Nvidia's dominance in the AI hardware market. This move follows OpenAI's significant deals with both AMD for processors and Oracle for cloud services, indicating a strategic shift towards diversifying AI computing suppliers. Oracle aims to provide a powerful alternative for developing and deploying advanced AI algorithms, especially in the inferencing space. This substantial investment underscores Oracle's ambition to meet escalating AI demand and strengthen its position against major cloud competitors like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.

          <p>German police have announced the discovery of a child's body in a forest, with a high probability it belongs to eight-year-old Fabian, who vanished from Güstrow last Friday. Authorities suspect a criminal offense, awaiting an autopsy for definitive identification and to determine the cause of death. This tragic development follows an extensive search involving hundreds of emergency personnel and volunteers across the region. The community in central Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania has been deeply shocked by the case, which investigators are now treating as a suspected crime, seeking further information on the circumstances surrounding the boy's death.</p>

          <p>The US government has revoked the visas of at least 50 Mexican politicians and government officials as part of the Trump administration's intensified crackdown on drug cartels and their suspected political allies. This unprecedented move has caused significant concern within Mexico's political elite and marks a broader application of US anti-narcotics powers. While the US State Department cited activities contrary to national interest, the widespread revocations, especially among the ruling Morena party, threaten to complicate US-Mexico relations amid ongoing trade and security talks. Critics suggest this aggressive use of diplomatic tools could backfire, straining crucial bilateral cooperation.</p>

          <p>The Conservative party is pressing the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) regarding the possibility of restarting prosecutions against two men acquitted of spying for China after charges were unexpectedly dropped. The case collapsed because evidence from the government, labeling China a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses, was not provided. However, legal experts highlight the extremely high bar for a second prosecution after acquittal, particularly under the Official Secrets Act, which prevents double jeopardy for these specific charges. The Conservatives are now questioning the role of the government's national security adviser in the trial's collapse.</p>

Mills, a popular two-term Democratic governor, is seen as a key recruit for national Democrats seeking to flip control of the Senate. However, she faces a potentially contentious primary against progressive challenger Graham Platner, backed by Senator Bernie Sanders. This high-stakes contest is expected to be one of the most closely watched races in the upcoming midterm elections, reflecting broader national tensions within the Democratic party regarding generational change and political strategy.</p>

          <p>Newly released records reveal that the Dallas ICE facility shooter, Joshua Jahn, believed he suffered from "radiation sickness" and was "allergic to plastic" before his deadly attack. His parents described him as a "loner" obsessed with AI, who had withdrawn into computer gaming after returning from Washington state. Jahn killed two detainees and wounded another before taking his own life in the September 24th shooting. While the records offer insights into his deteriorating mental state, they provide no clear motive for the "ANTI-ICE" attack, which federal authorities previously said was intended to terrorize agents.</p>

          <p>Disney is nearing the announcement of Bob Iger's successor, with internal candidates Dana Walden and Josh D'Amaro as frontrunners. The board is reportedly considering a co-CEO structure, inspired by Netflix's success. However, corporate governance experts and company insiders warn against this for Disney, citing its famously political corporate culture, Iger's history of extended leadership, and past power-sharing issues with Bob Chapek. The article suggests that while a dual leadership might retain top talent, Disney's unique history and complex structure make such an arrangement prone to instability and internal conflicts, potentially undermining effective leadership.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is revamping its Jeep Grand Wagoneer lineup for the 2026 model year as part of a broader turnaround strategy for the Jeep brand. The overhaul includes updated exterior styling, the introduction of a new extended-range plug-in hybrid (EREV) powertrain, and a simplified, less expensive model lineup under the single "Grand Wagoneer" name, discontinuing the standalone "Wagoneer" nameplate. This move addresses past issues with consumer confusion and high pricing, aiming to expand market share.

However, the IMF also forecasts the UK to have the highest inflation in the G7 for 2025 and 2026, primarily driven by energy costs.

          <p>Gen Z-led protests are sweeping across South and Southeast Asia, fueled by stagnant youth prospects, widening inequality, and conspicuous elite privilege flaunted on social media. The World Bank notes high youth unemployment and a shift to lower-paid service jobs, pushing many into poverty. These movements, from Nepal to Indonesia, have targeted government corruption and lavish perks for politicians, forcing some rare concessions. While youths provide catalytic energy and digital infrastructure, core issues of economic injustice resonate across generations. Experts anticipate more youth-led movements, emphasizing the need for systemic accountability and better governance.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal that the US government warned Dutch officials months ago that Nexperia's CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, had to be removed to prevent the chipmaker from facing fallout from the US entity list. The US indicated a forthcoming change to the blacklist would extend sanctions to subsidiaries where a listed entity holds over 50% ownership. Nexperia's parent company, Wingtech, was added to the entity list in December, having acquired Nexperia in 2018. This pressure resulted in the removal of CEO Zhang, sparking fury in Beijing and highlighting escalating US-China tech and trade tensions.</p>

Her friend reported hearing screams before the phone went dead. Majek denies murder, and the trial is expected to last three weeks, with forensic evidence linking him to the crime.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon, under the Trump administration, is reportedly retreating from its long-standing approach to climate change as a national security threat, despite extreme weather increasingly impacting US troops and military bases. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed global warming concerns, leading to cuts in climate research funding and the abandonment of adaptation plans. Critics warn this policy shift jeopardizes military readiness and strategic vulnerability, as climate change continues to cause heat-related illnesses among troops, flood bases, and fuel global instability. The article highlights concerns that the military is being forced to operate without crucial information.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's upcoming defense strategy report is expected to outline significant changes in the US approach to countering China's military and economic power. According to Chinese defense researchers, the report will prioritize homeland defense, including US skies and borders, while deterring China in the Indo-Pacific. Reports suggest a shift towards prioritizing homeland security over perceived threats from China and Russia. However, this does not necessarily mean reduced attention on the Indo-Pacific; instead, it might indicate a broader, indirect containment strategy through peripheral regions, rather than direct confrontation, according to one researcher.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined luxury brands Gucci, Chloe, and Loewe over €157 million for violating EU competition rules by engaging in price fixing. The brands allegedly restricted independent retailers from setting their own online and offline prices, dictating minimum sales prices, maximum discount rates, and specific sales periods. This anti-competitive behavior led to higher prices and reduced consumer choice. Gucci-owner Kering has acknowledged the probe and ledgered the penalty, while Richemont (Chloe's owner) and LVMH (Loewe's owner) have not yet commented.
