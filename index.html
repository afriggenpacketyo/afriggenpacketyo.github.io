          <p>A judge-led public inquiry has been announced in Parliament to investigate the Nottingham attacks, where three people were fatally stabbed. Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar, and Ian Coates were killed by Valdo Calocane in June 2023, prompting criticism from the victims' families regarding the authorities' handling of the case. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that the inquiry, chaired by Her Honour Deborah Taylor, will have the power to compel witnesses and conduct a thorough assessment of the facts. The inquiry aims to scrutinize various agencies involved in the case, following reviews including a mental health homicide review and an assessment of the Crown Prosecution Service's actions.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced a sweeping reorganization of the US State Department, aimed at reforming the agency amidst criticism from the Trump White House. The plan involves closing overseas missions, reducing staff, and minimizing offices focused on promoting liberal values. Rubio claims the reorganization will streamline operations, eliminate redundant offices, and align programs with America's core national interests. This move is part of a broader effort to reshape the State Department's approach to diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin has indicated a willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking the first such signal since the early stages of the war. Despite this, Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities continued, resulting in casualties and injuries. Putin's comments followed a proposal from Zelensky for a cessation of strikes on civilian infrastructure, suggesting a potential shift in Russia's stance. However, the ongoing attacks raise doubts about the sincerity of Putin's offer and the prospects for meaningful negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been ordered to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after a U.S. District Court in Georgia granted temporary restraining orders. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The lawsuit claims that ICE's actions were designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting, despite not violating their status. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday to further address the matter.</p>
