          <h2>CNBC Survey Predicts Fed Rate Cuts Amid Stagflationary Economic Outlook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 11:27:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC survey of fund managers, analysts, and economists indicates that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this year and in 2026 in response to a stagflationary economic forecast, which includes higher inflation and unemployment, along with increased recession odds. The survey respondents anticipate the fed funds rate declining to 3.71% by year-end and 3.36% by the end of 2026. Despite concerns about tariffs and their impact on prices, the majority believe the Fed will prioritize addressing economic weakness. However, some analysts suggest that these cuts could mean the Fed abandoning its 2% inflation target, while others remain optimistic about economic growth rebounding in 2026.

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have reached a trade agreement designed to facilitate exports between the two countries. The deal aims to lower tariffs on UK goods like whisky and cars entering India, while reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. The UK government anticipates the agreement will boost trade by an additional Â£25.5 billion annually by 2040. The agreement includes provisions for the services sector and procurement, enabling British firms to compete for more contracts, and will halve tariffs on gin and whisky to 75%, with further reductions planned over time.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, the conservative leader, has been elected as Germany's next chancellor after a second attempt in parliament.

The coalition with the Social Democrats was expected to provide a comfortable majority, but some members dissented in the first ballot. After the vote, Merz was sworn in as chancellor, and his cabinet was expected to take office shortly after, signaling a resolution to the political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has been elected as Germany's next chancellor after winning a second parliamentary vote, overcoming an initial defeat.

          <p>The Trump administration is offering a $1,000 incentive to migrants who "self-deport" using the CBP Home App, which was previously used for asylum requests. The Homeland Security Department promotes this as a more cost-effective and "dignified" way to leave the country, estimating that arresting, detaining, and removing someone without legal status costs around $17,121. While officials claim over 7,000 people have used the app for removals, immigrant advocates express skepticism, questioning whether migrants will receive the promised incentive or be able to apply for legal status in the future.</p>

These individuals feel they are fighting against the ever-growing misinformation about the war in Russian schools, with the Kremlin's efforts to indoctrinate children having taken root in most schools across Russia. The propaganda includes "Important Conversations," weekly lessons involving flag raising and discussions on family values and Russiaâ€™s military glory, though some schools quietly sabotage the lessons.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are scheduled to meet at the White House amidst escalating trade tensions between the two countries. The meeting comes as relations between Washington and Ottawa have reached their lowest point in decades, with Trump imposing steep tariffs on Canadian goods. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has described Canada as an economic leech on the United States, further highlighting the strained relationship. Canadian exports to the United States have recently declined, while exports to other countries have increased.</p>

          <p>Major delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport have been attributed to a combination of factors, including air traffic control staffing shortages and equipment malfunctions. System outages, such as controllers' screens going dark, have disrupted the ability to track aircraft. The FAA has cited staffing levels in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is based, as a contributing factor, as well as runway construction. The situation has led to calls for an investigation and a plan to revamp the aging air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's dismissal of authors behind the sixth National Climate Assessment (NCA6) has raised concerns about the future of climate research and its global impact. Experts are worried about the potential for "junk science" to be injected into the report and the impact on international collaborations. The decision has led to efforts to attract scientists to other countries, with some experts suggesting the "center of mass" of climate research will shift away from the US. The US government is also proposing significant cuts to the 2026 federal budgets for US scientific agencies and research.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit from three Republican-led states that aims to restrict access to the abortion medication mifepristone. Justice Department attorneys are arguing that the states lack the legal right to sue. The lawsuit challenges the FDA's approval and regulations surrounding mifepristone, seeking to prohibit telehealth prescriptions and require in-office visits. The administration is arguing that the states are challenging actions taken in 2016, exceeding the statute of limitations, and cannot use this venue to push an agenda.</p>

          <p>The Constitution mandates due process for all individuals on U.S. soil, including non-citizens, yet the extent of these protections in deportation cases is debated. Legal experts emphasize that while a full trial isn't guaranteed for every migrant, the government must ensure fairness and safety, particularly for asylum seekers and vulnerable individuals. The Supreme Court has affirmed the right to challenge detention, though the specifics of "notice" and "hearing" vary based on circumstance. The Trump administration's policies, including expedited removal and deportations to third countries, are raising concerns about the adequacy of due process protections.</p>
