          <p>A rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government regarding the country's stance on nuclear power. The dispute was highlighted when the Economy Minister, from the conservative CDU party, attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, despite Germany's official phase-out of nuclear energy. This move angered the Environment Minister from the center-left SPD, who insists the focus must remain on renewable energy. The disagreement reflects a broader European debate on how to achieve climate neutrality, with France championing nuclear power while Germany officially pursues a different path.

The new decentralized event involved players on-site in Los Angeles interacting with their new teams via video call, an experience that was often awkward.

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has conducted the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, avoiding open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique was used to help a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement, offering a potentially safer alternative to methods like Elon Musk's Neuralink. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a vein in the neck. The successful trial marks a significant advancement in neurotechnology with the potential to reduce surgical risks and recovery times.</p>

Key offensive moments, including a home run from Shohei Ohtani and a two-run homer by Max Muncy, were crucial for the win.

          <p>A recent 6-3 Supreme Court decision granting parents the right to opt their children out of lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs has brought nine specific LGBTQ+ children's books into the national spotlight. The case originated from a lawsuit by parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who objected to the inclusion of books like "Pride Puppy" and "Uncle Bobbyâ€™s Wedding" in the elementary school curriculum. The court's majority opinion argued these books promote messages contrary to some religious beliefs, while the dissent argued that removing them fails to acknowledge the existence of LGBTQ+ people in society.</p>

This notable absence is interpreted by experts as a reflection of shifting priorities and a growing concern within the Indo-Pacific region. These countries are reportedly worried that conflicts in the Middle East may be distracting the United States from its commitments to their region. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba canceled his trip at the last minute, reportedly due to the unlikelihood of a meeting with the US President.</p>
