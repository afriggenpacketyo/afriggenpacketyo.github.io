          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced its intention to divide into two distinct public companies by the following year. The media conglomerate made this announcement on Monday, though specific details regarding the reasons for the split or the structure of the new entities were not immediately available. This move signifies a significant restructuring for the company, which could have wide-ranging implications for its various media properties and strategic direction. The full scope and rationale behind the decision will likely be revealed in subsequent updates from the company's leadership, as the split is likely being undertaken to increase shareholder value and allow the two separate companies to focus on different aspects of the entertainment industry.</p>

The leaders of Japan and South Korea agreed to build stable ties, and four Japanese Self-Defense Force members were injured in an explosion near the U.S. Kadena Air Base. Japan's negotiator is planning a U.S. trip for tariff talks, and the country's January-March GDP was revised upward but still contracted.

          <p>Theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek explores the relationship between physics inside materials and fundamental physics in empty space, highlighting the fruitful implications of using similar ideas to describe both. This approach has enabled modern electronics and computer technology, and continues to inspire innovations in technology and discoveries in fundamental physics. Wilczek references historical perspectives, from Aristotle's concept of nature abhorring a vacuum to Descartes' theory of planets embedded in an ether, contrasting them with Newton's view of space as an immaterial void. The exploration delves into the notion of quasi-worlds and their potential connection to the universe, raising questions about the fundamental distinctions between them.</p>

          <p>An article examines the irony of Donald Trump's fondness for the musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's *Les Misérables*, a story about the struggles of the oppressed against a punitive regime. The author, having written a biography of Hugo, finds the mass-market musical a sanitized version of Hugo's complex underworld of moral and literal sewers. The article explores Hugo's history as an outcast and advocate for freedom and democracy, contrasting his values with Trump's administration. The author suggests that the MAGA movement's adoption of *Les Misérables* demonstrates the volatile nature of political buzzwords and the appropriation of artistic genres by various factions.</p>

          <p>Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are facing challenges under the second Trump administration, including potential cuts to federal funding and grants. Mark Brown, president of Tuskegee University, discusses how HBCUs can navigate the uncertainty, emphasizing that these institutions are merit-based schools open to all qualified applicants, not just diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He highlights the importance of HBCUs as economic engines and stresses the need for them to focus on capability, outcome, and performance, ensuring students gain internships, experience, and graduate. Brown also points out that proposed budget reductions in student loans and Pell Grants could significantly impact access to education for students at HBCUs, where most rely on federal aid.</p>

Defense Minister Israel Katz had vowed to prevent the ship from reaching Gaza, citing the need to maintain a naval blockade to prevent Hamas from importing arms. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the effort, claims the activists were "kidnapped by Israeli forces," while Israel's Foreign Ministry asserts that Thunberg is safe and in good spirits. The ministry stated that any aid on the ship would be sent to Gaza, however the coalition claims the cargo, including baby formula, food, and medical supplies, was confiscated.</p>

          <p>The UK government has proposed extending a ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging large nets along the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. This expansion would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas. The proposal is subject to a 12-week industry consultation and aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. The announcement coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France, where calls are being made for more countries to ratify a treaty to protect a third of international waters by 2030.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as a breach of state sovereignty, while Mayor Karen Bass blamed the administration for provoking chaos.

The incident occurred after security forces were attacked during a routine patrol in the municipality of Frontera Comalapa, leading to a confrontation where authorities repelled the fire and killed the suspects. Local media reported that the security forces may have inadvertently entered Guatemalan territory during the pursuit, though the Chiapas Security Secretariat insisted the operation took place within Mexico.

          <p>With the UK Spending Review approaching, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is the sole cabinet minister yet to finalize her department's budget through 2029. Despite an offer of above-inflation increases to police funding over the next three years, Cooper has not reached an agreement with the Treasury. The Home Office argues that police numbers must be maintained to fulfill policy commitments on neighborhood policing, which current spending proposals would undermine. Meanwhile, police chiefs have been publicly lobbying for more funding, and the heads of police organizations have warned that the service is "broken" due to budget cuts.</p>

          <p>China's rare earth exports experienced a significant drop in value last month, declining nearly half compared to the previous year, reflecting Beijing's capacity to leverage its dominance in the critical-mineral supply chain. According to the General Administration of Customs, the value of rare earth elements exported by China last month was US$18.7 million, a 48.3 per cent year-on-year decrease. This data comes as analysts suggest China's export controls on critical minerals could serve as a strategic advantage in trade negotiations with the United States. May's export value also represented a 13.7 per cent monthly decline from US$21.7 million in April.</p>

          <p>According to economists and labor experts, the U.S. job market is currently challenging for recent college graduates and other job seekers. Career coach Mandi Woodruff-Santos describes the job market as "kind of trash right now," citing difficulties for both experienced professionals and college students. CEO confidence has significantly declined, with concerns over geopolitical instability and trade policy impacting hiring decisions. Economist Cory Stahle warns that the steady erosion in the job market cannot continue indefinitely, as employers may eventually be forced to lay off existing employees, increasing unemployment.

          <p>Despite lurid details and allegations in Sean “Diddy” Combs’s trial on federal charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, the concept of “coercive control” has not been a major focus. Coercive control, a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse, is not widely recognized in US courts, though “coercion” as an individual act is. The judge has blocked the prosecution's expert from testifying specifically about coercive control, which could impact the jury's understanding of the long-term effects of abuse on survivors and their relationships with Combs. Understanding coercive control helps explain intimate partner violence beyond physical acts.</p>

          <p>Days of violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops by President Trump. The protests, largely limited to downtown LA, have been declared an "unlawful assembly" area by police, with reports of vehicles set alight and incendiary devices used against horse patrols. The unrest has temporarily halted traffic on the 101 freeway, and the downtown Federal Building has become a flashpoint after reports of ICE detainees being held there. The deployment of the National Guard has triggered a political row with state politicians, who believe local police can handle the situation.</p>

Speaking at London Tech Week, Huang explained that programming has historically been difficult and inaccessible, but now, with AI, the new programming language is "human." He highlighted that conversational AI models like ChatGPT allow users to simply ask the computer to perform tasks, such as writing a poem or generating images. This shift makes programming more accessible to a wider audience, as the way to program an AI is like the way you program a person.</p>

He jokingly attributes his fitness to "lots of women, drugs and wine," but in reality, he has a dedicated trainer and an indoor pool, gym, and golf course at his disposal. His underwater training involves diving to push a brick to the end of the pool, inspired by advice from Frank Sinatra about the importance of powerful lungs for singing. Stewart also does 100-meter sprints on his private track, aiming to break the world record for an 80-year-old.</p>
