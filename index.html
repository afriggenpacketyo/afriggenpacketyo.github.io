        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune disclosed his offer to Democrats for a vote on extending Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, a key demand to end the prolonged government shutdown. As the stalemate extends into its 16th day, Democrats are pushing for these health care fixes to prevent premium spikes affecting millions of low- and middle-income Americans. Thune emphasized that while he could guarantee a process and a vote on the matter, he could not promise a specific legislative outcome, highlighting the complexities of bipartisan negotiations. House Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated that no health care outcomes could be guaranteed, viewing the situation primarily as a funding dispute and suggesting that subsidy discussions should occur outside the immediate shutdown context. This article highlights the deep divisions in Congress over fiscal policy and health care.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers from the European Union and China engaged in contentious discussions regarding Russia and Taiwan during their first official talks in Brussels since 2018, following a recent normalization of ties. EU delegates reported that Chinese counterparts echoed Russian narratives concerning the Ukraine war's origins, with one EU lawmaker expressing shock at the alignment with Russian perspectives on NATO expansion. Engin Eroglu, chair of the parliament’s China delegation, noted the Chinese side questioned NATO's right to exist, finding this stance absurd in light of Russia's aggression. This article highlights significant geopolitical friction and ideological divides between the EU and China, particularly on sensitive international security issues, underscoring the challenges in their diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>A decision regarding China's application for a new mega-embassy in London has been delayed again, pushing the deadline to December 10, marking the second such postponement. The proposed 20,000-square-meter complex, near the Tower of London, has sparked significant security concerns due to its location near fiber optic cables crucial for the City of London's financial communications. Critics fear potential espionage risks, a sentiment amplified by the recent collapse of a high-profile UK spy case involving alleged Chinese agents. This article highlights the ongoing tension between economic engagement and national security in the UK's relationship with China, making the embassy approval a highly scrutinized matter.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 11:36:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic Senator Mark Kelly urged President Donald Trump to engage directly in negotiations to resolve the ongoing government shutdown, now in its third week. Kelly suggested that House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, both Republicans, would follow Trump's lead. The core dispute revolves around Democrats' insistence on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. Republicans, including Thune and Johnson, have indicated willingness to discuss ACA subsidies, but only after a short-term funding bill is approved, viewing it as a separate issue. This article underscores the political gridlock and the perceived need for presidential leadership to break the impasse.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national pursuing a doctorate at the University of Southern California (USC), Sizhe "Steven" Weng, has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting several women over a three-year period. Prosecutors allege Weng slipped incapacitating drugs into victims' food or drinks before the assaults between 2021 and 2024. Los Angeles police were tipped off by German authorities investigating similar incidents. Weng faces eight felony counts, including forcible sexual assault and sexual penetration by use of controlled substances, and is held without bail. Investigators believe there may be additional victims, and USC has barred Weng from campus, cooperating with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>As Congress debates Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance subsidies amid the government shutdown, financial advisors are examining how their potential expiration after 2025 could impact client tax planning, particularly Roth IRA conversions. Roth conversions, which shift pretax IRA funds to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, can increase income and affect eligibility for ACA premium subsidies. If subsidies expire, some investors might reduce conversions to avoid higher health insurance costs, while others above the income threshold might find conversions more appealing without subsidy loss. This article highlights the complex interplay between health policy, tax planning, and individual financial decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

Medigap also provides more predictable out-of-pocket costs and stable benefits year after year, appealing to those with chronic conditions or frequent medical needs.

          <p>An Alaska Airlines flight from Portland to Dallas was forced to divert to Boise, Idaho, after a 61-year-old passenger, Tracy Barkhimer, allegedly assaulted two flight attendants. Police reported that Barkhimer exhibited erratic behavior and struck crew members who were attempting to calm her down. She was restrained until the flight landed, then taken into custody and charged with two counts of misdemeanor battery. The flight crew was cleared by medics to continue, and the aircraft proceeded to its destination after a 90-minute delay.

          <p>Tobacco consumption in Southeast Asia has significantly decreased over the past two decades, with smoking prevalence falling from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, according to a WHO report.

However, despite per capita declines, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth. The region now faces the new challenge of rising e-cigarette use, with several countries banning vaping outright, while others like Malaysia struggle with political resistance to regulation, highlighting ongoing public health battles.</p>
