          <p>India announced early Wednesday that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan, targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The operation, prompted by a militant attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people last month, aimed at nine sites while avoiding Pakistani military facilities, according to India's Ministry of Defence. Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar called India's description of the strikes as restrained "absurd," accusing India of violating Pakistan's territorial sovereignty and attacking its civilian population. The U.S. and UAE have urged restraint, while airlines are diverting flights from Pakistani airspace amidst the escalating tensions. The strikes underscore the fragile relationship between the two nuclear powers.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators unveiled sweeping policy steps, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amid trade worries. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting approximately $138.6 billion into the market. These measures also include support for financing key sectors like technology and real estate, as well as a new relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While analysts suggest these measures indicate greater urgency to bolster the economy, they also note that domestic credit demand may not significantly increase without additional fiscal policy measures.

          <p>India launched missiles into Pakistani-administered territory, striking at least five locations and resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, according to Pakistani officials. India claimed the strikes targeted infrastructure used by militants, responding to a recent militant attack on tourists in Kashmir. Pakistan has condemned the attacks as an act of cowardice and asserted its right to respond, while India maintains its actions were focused and non-escalatory. The United States has acknowledged the reports and is monitoring the situation closely, urging both countries to avoid military confrontation.

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, prosecutors played voicemails allegedly left by Read for her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, on the night he died. The messages, filled with anger and accusations, suggest Read was unaware of O'Keefe's dire condition, according to defense attorneys. The defense argues the voicemails portray a frantic girlfriend, while the prosecution suggests they were a calculated attempt to cover her tracks. The trial also highlighted concerns about the handling of evidence at the scene, including the use of Solo cups and a leaf blower, raising questions about the integrity of the investigation.</p>

          <p>For the second time in just over a week, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea. The two pilots safely ejected and sustained minor injuries, according to a defense official. The incident occurred during a landing attempt on the flight deck of the Truman, when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to hold trade talks this weekend in Switzerland to de-escalate tensions, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This marks the first high-level in-person contact since President Trump imposed tariffs on imports. Bessent indicated the focus will be on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal, as well as agreeing with China on "what we're going to talk about" in the future. China's Commerce Ministry confirmed Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet with Bessent, signaling a willingness to engage with the U.S. amid ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>President Trump intends to announce next week that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or Gulf of Arabia. This move, which has been pushed by Arab nations, is likely to anger Iran, which maintains its historic ties to the name Persian Gulf. While the U.S. military already uses the term Arabian Gulf, this official change reflects Trump's closer ties to Gulf countries.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Miami Marlins in extra innings, with bullpen fatigue contributing to the defeat. Tony Gonsolin delivered a solid start, and Shohei Ohtani had another productive game, but the Dodgers' overworked bullpen faltered late. Minor league reliever JP Feyereisen gave up the walk-off single after the team was forced to use less-than-ideal pitching options due to workload concerns for their top relievers. The loss highlights the Dodgers' need to manage their bullpen effectively throughout the season.</p>
