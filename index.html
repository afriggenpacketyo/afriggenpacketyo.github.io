          <p>Citigroup has reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its markets and banking divisions. The bank posted earnings of $1.96 per share against an estimated $1.60, with revenue reaching $21.67 billion versus a $20.98 billion forecast. This performance comes amid a volatile market period and as CEO Jane Fraser continues her strategic turnaround plan, which includes pulling back from some international markets. The positive results follow a significant outperformance of the company's stock in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A grandfather and grandmother in Flintshire, UK, have been found guilty of murdering their two-year-old grandson, Ethan Ives-Griffiths. The toddler died in August 2021 from a catastrophic head injury, and the court heard he was also dangerously dehydrated, underweight, and had numerous bruises. The boy's mother was convicted of causing or allowing his death and child cruelty, with the court noting he was targeted for abuse. The grandparents face life imprisonment, while the mother is expected to receive a substantial prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The UK government has disclosed the existence of a secret resettlement program, the Afghan Response Route, which has relocated 4,500 Afghans to the UK. This initiative was established in response to a 2022 data breach by a defense official that leaked the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for assistance, putting them at risk from the Taliban. The scheme, which has cost £400 million to date, was kept confidential by a court injunction that has now been lifted. Defence Secretary John Healey apologized for the "serious departmental error."</p>

          <p>At a high-level meeting, China's leadership has declared a fundamental shift in its urban development model, moving away from large-scale expansion to focus on enhancing existing city resources. With 67% of its population now in urban areas, Beijing will prioritize human well-being, efficiency, and improved governance. The new framework for the property sector will concentrate on renovating urban villages and repairing dilapidated housing. This change reflects China's adaptation to a more stable phase of urbanization after decades of rapid growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have utilized publicly available NASA satellite data to identify promising locations for deep-sea mining in the Indian Ocean. After NASA's GRACE satellites detected gravity anomalies along the Ninety East Ridge, Chinese researchers investigated and confirmed the presence of a significantly thicker oceanic crust in the area. This thickened crust suggests the presence of valuable minerals like copper, cobalt, and rare earths pushed up by magma. The use of the free data has potentially saved the Chinese research team years of work and significant financial resources.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in England's East and West Midlands, adding to areas in the North West and Yorkshire already under the same status. The declarations follow one of the driest starts to a year since 1976, with exceptionally low reservoir levels and river flows across much of the country. This prolonged dry spell, which experts link to climate change, is straining water supplies, impacting agriculture, and harming wildlife. Hosepipe bans are already in effect for millions, with the potential for further restrictions if substantial rainfall does not occur soon.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Beijing by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that relations between the two nations have "turned around" after years of setbacks. Xi emphasized the importance of mutual respect, seeking common ground, and pursuing beneficial cooperation. Albanese echoed these sentiments, welcoming the opportunity to discuss Australia's interests directly with Chinese leadership. The visit signifies a significant thaw in diplomatic and economic ties, which had been frosty due to various political and trade disputes in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has imposed a 17% tariff on most tomatoes imported from Mexico, effective immediately. The Commerce Department enacted the duty after withdrawing from a 2019 agreement, arguing it failed to protect U.S. growers from Mexican producers selling tomatoes at unfairly low prices. Mexico has rejected the accusation, attributing the popularity of its tomatoes to their high quality. The measure is expected to raise prices for consumers on products like fresh tomatoes, salsas, and pizza sauces, as about 70% of tomatoes consumed in the U.S. are imported from Mexico.

This absence of clear rules comes as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear cases on transgender athlete participation.

The proposal primarily targets $8.3 billion from foreign aid programs and would also eliminate $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. While the House has approved the request, it faces resistance from some Senate Republicans concerned about cuts to global health programs like PEPFAR and the impact on rural public broadcasting.

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite a recent IRS rule change allowing political endorsements, churches should refrain from this practice to maintain their moral authority and unity. The author, a pastor, distinguishes between bearing witness against injustice, a vital role of the church, and endorsing specific candidates, which can be destructive. Endorsing candidates risks reducing faith to partisan politics, deepening societal divisions, and disrespecting the individual conscience of congregants. The piece concludes that the church best serves the state by reminding it of its limits, not by becoming a political tool.</p>

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the author's journey of leaving the conservative evangelical church to reconcile her sexuality with her Christian faith. Raised in the Southern Baptist tradition, she was taught that opposition to same-sex marriage was a moral duty and that her identity as a lesbian was a cross to bear through celibacy. After years of internal conflict, she chose to leave her church community, ultimately finding a more profound sense of faith and integrity in an affirming congregation. The author argues that for many queer Christians, affirmation is a sincere religious conviction, not a capitulation to secular culture.</p>
