          <p>The House Judiciary Committee has issued subpoenas to Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania, escalating its investigation into potential antitrust violations among Ivy League schools. The probe examines whether these universities colluded to fix tuition prices and used applicants' financial data to practice price discrimination in financial aid offers. Committee Chair Jim Jordan stated that the universities' initial responses to document requests were inadequate. The schools maintain they have been cooperating and now have until July 22 to comply with the new demands.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low of just over 6,000 in June. This continues a significant lull in illegal immigration that the Trump administration credits to its aggressive deportation policies and the halt of migrant releases. The figures represent a stark reversal from the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, with officials noting that daily crossings once surpassed this new monthly total. The administration's approach includes swift deportations, increased military presence, and large-scale interior arrests by ICE.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, is suing the Trump administration for sharing confidential Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that the transfer of sensitive health information to agencies involved in immigration enforcement is illegal and creates a climate of fear, potentially deterring people from seeking necessary medical care. Federal officials defend the action as a lawful effort to combat fraud and ensure federal funds are not used for non-citizens. The suit seeks to block further data sharing and its use in immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>France has enacted one of Europe's strictest anti-smoking laws, banning smoking in numerous public spaces including beaches, parks, and near schools to "denormalize" the habit. The government aims to combat the high rate of tobacco-related deaths, which claim 75,000 lives annually in the country. Violators of the new rules face fines up to 700 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public venues since 2008, this expansion targets outdoor areas, leaving cafÃ© terraces as one of the last public refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal.

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the bill while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to local water contamination from a 3M plant. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's powerful testimony before lawmakers was a key catalyst for the legislation, which passed shortly after her death at age 20.</p>

          <p>After a dominant series against the West Indies, England's women's cricket team is facing a difficult challenge, having lost the first two T20 matches against a strong Indian side. The defeats have highlighted familiar weaknesses, including batting collapses against spin and inconsistent bowling under pressure, raising questions for new coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt. With the T20 World Cup approaching, the team's performance in this series is seen as a crucial test. Pundits are now questioning the stability of the opening batting partnership and the team's ability to adapt its plans.</p>

Combs faces charges including sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution, which stem from accusations by former girlfriends and employees.

          <p>Drought has been officially declared in northwest England and Yorkshire, with other regions at risk if dry conditions persist, according to the Environment Agency. The UK experienced its sixth driest spring since 1836, leading to exceptionally low levels in rivers and reservoirs, which are critical for water supplies. Farmers are already feeling the impact, facing increased irrigation costs, while wildlife habitats are also under threat. While climate change is a factor, experts note that how water is managed and used will also determine the severity of future water shortages.</p>
