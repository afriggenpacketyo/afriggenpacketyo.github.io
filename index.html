            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the killing of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza to an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The investigation found that troops opened fire believing they faced a threat, exacerbated by poor night visibility, leading to the misidentification of ambulances. While the IDF claims some casualties were Hamas members, no concrete evidence was provided. The deputy commander involved has been dismissed, and the incident has prompted calls for an independent investigation, especially given conflicting accounts and the burial of bodies before proper recovery.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military investigation into the deaths of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza concluded there were "professional failures" leading to the incident, resulting in the dismissal of a deputy commander. The investigation determined that poor visibility contributed to the misidentification of ambulances as belonging to Hamas militants, contradicting initial claims that the vehicles lacked emergency signals. Video footage later revealed the ambulances had flashing lights and visible logos. The incident involved the bulldozing and burial of the bodies, prompting criticism and calls for further investigation, though the probe denied claims of executions.</p>

It suggests that while economists and media outlets often focus on metrics like consumer sentiment, unemployment, and GDP, these indicators can be contradictory and fail to capture underlying economic problems. Instead, the author advises focusing on actual data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies to gauge the health of the economy, as these sources provide direct insights into consumer spending, capital flow, and labor market conditions.

            <p>The construction industry, traditionally male-dominated, is exploring how technology and AI can attract more women. Companies are using tools like robotic dogs and digital apps to automate tasks and reduce the physical demands of the job. Digitization also allows for more flexible work arrangements, addressing concerns about work-life balance. Experts believe that AI can create new roles for women in construction, simplifying communication, reducing waste, and improving safety. These advancements aim to modernize the industry and make it more appealing to a diverse workforce.</p>

The Berlin Immigration Office has ordered the individuals to leave Germany by April 21, citing a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. Those served with deportation orders say they have no information about charges. The cases have drawn comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protesters in the U.S., raising concerns about restrictions on freedom of movement.</p>

            <p>The author recounts a humorous anecdote about telling a lie on a first date 30 years ago, claiming to drive a Land Rover despite knowing nothing about cars. The reflection leads to a broader discussion about dishonesty in dating, ranging from harmless "butler lies" to more egregious fabrications. The author questions whether all dating lies are inherently awful, suggesting that some may stem from insecurity or a desire to present a better version of oneself. The story concludes with the revelation that the date found out about the lie years later but it didn't end the relationship.</p>
