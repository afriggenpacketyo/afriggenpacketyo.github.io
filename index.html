          <p>Walt Disney is set to expand its global presence with the opening of its first theme park in the Middle East, located in Abu Dhabi on Yas Island. This venture is a collaboration between Walt Disney and Miral, a local leisure and entertainment company. Yas Island is already home to attractions like SeaWorld and Warner Bros World, with a Harry Potter-themed park also under development. The new Disney theme park in Abu Dhabi will be Disney's seventh resort, adding to its existing locations in North America, Europe, and Asia, with the most recent opening in Shanghai in 2016.</p>

          <p>Fresno, California, is among the American cities that are increasingly criminalizing homelessness, as evidenced by the recent arrest of Davina Valenzuela for camping in a public place. The 33-year-old, who has been homeless for over a year, had her belongings confiscated by sanitation workers before being arrested. This trend reflects a broader effort by cities to reduce homeless encampments through legal measures, raising questions about the effectiveness and ethical implications of such policies.</p>

          <p>Despite negative economic news, including a decline in first-quarter GDP, weekly mortgage demand has surged by 11% as mortgage interest rates slightly decreased for the second consecutive week. Applications for home purchases also rose 11% year-over-year, driven by demand for conventional loans, which is seen as a surprising move given the current economic climate. However, some potential buyers remain hesitant due to concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and stock market volatility. Applications to refinance a home loan also rose, particularly for Veterans Affairs (VA) loans.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in what it calls "Operation Sindoor." Pakistan has condemned the strikes as "unprovoked," stating that they targeted civilian areas, resulting in numerous casualties. India claims that the targeted sites were "terrorist infrastructure" used for planning attacks.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that credit card debt forgiveness can be a smart option for seniors with high medical expenses, low income, or no significant assets, but may not be suitable for everyone. While it can provide financial relief by settling balances for less than owed, it can also damage credit scores and trigger tax consequences. Seniors with assets or those planning to use credit in the future should exercise caution, and be wary of predatory actors in the debt relief industry. Alternative strategies for reducing credit card debt include stopping credit card use, contacting card issuers directly for lower interest rates, and choosing a debt repayment strategy like the snowball method.</p>

Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East, including an accidental shooting down of an F/A-18 and a collision with a merchant vessel.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation impacting the economy, saving money has become a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a solution with higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs allow savers to lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD, providing a safe investment with FDIC or NCUA insurance. Online banks often offer the most competitive rates, and short-term CDs can be a way to maximize returns. Strategies like CD laddering can help savers take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the prehistoric Chavín people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to reinforce social hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," at Chavín de Huántar containing traces of hallucinogenic substances like DMT and tobacco. These findings suggest that consuming psychoactive drugs was a tightly controlled practice, likely reserved for elite members of Chavín society. The ceremonies were integral to the creation of early class structures, providing an ideology that justified inequality in social orders.</p>
