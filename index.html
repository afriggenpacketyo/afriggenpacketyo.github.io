          <p>President Trump discussed the upcoming military parade, emphasizing the strength and greatness of the United States. He noted that other countries celebrate the end of the World Wars, unlike America. Trump also mentioned a conversation with Vladimir Putin about Russia's role in World War II, expressing Putin's confusion over the current perception of Russia compared to Germany and Japan, as Russia was once an ally of the U.S. The article highlights Trump's impromptu reflections on historical alliances and national perceptions on the global stage.

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years. This declaration follows Iran's "many failures" to provide the IAEA with full answers regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities. Iran has condemned the resolution as "political" and announced plans to establish a new uranium enrichment facility. The IAEA's report also criticized Iran's "general lack of co-operation" and highlighted its stockpile of enriched uranium, which could potentially be used to create nuclear weapons. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent LendingTree study analyzed tipping habits in the United States, revealing that New Hampshire residents tip the most, averaging 16.07% of their spending on food away from home. The study suggests that tipping rates correlate with how often people dine out in a given state, with East Coast states generally tipping more than those in the South and West. The data indicates that Americans spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars, and other eateries in 2023, representing a significant portion of their food budgets. The analysis also highlighted that spending on dining out has increased in recent years, comprising approximately 56% of Americans' food budgets in 2023. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly increased inflation, as indicated by recent benign consumer and producer price readings. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, a time lag for tariffs to impact the real economy, and limited pricing power due to consumer belt-tightening. Economists anticipate that the effects of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months. These factors have temporarily masked the inflationary pressures that were initially feared. </p>

          <p>This article discusses the pros and cons of debt settlement, advising consumers when it might be a beneficial option and when it should be avoided. Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, but it can negatively impact credit scores and trigger tax implications. It suggests considering debt settlement if you're significantly behind on payments, have a lump sum of cash available, or are contemplating bankruptcy. However, it cautions against accepting settlement offers if you can still manage payments, if the tax implications outweigh the savings, or before exploring alternative options like credit counseling or debt consolidation.

          <p>Brian Wilson, the creative force behind the Beach Boys, has died at the age of 82, leaving behind a legacy of innovative sound and emotional depth. Wilson's unique approach to music production, influenced by Phil Spector, involved meticulous sound design and a focus on collective feelings. His landmark album, Pet Sounds, is considered one of the greatest albums ever made, blending toy-box instrumentation with poignant lyrics exploring themes of love, loss, and alienation. Despite facing personal struggles with mental health, Wilson's influence on music continues to grow, inspiring musicians to explore new sonic territories and prioritize emotional resonance. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that families can sue the government for damages caused by wrong-house raids and other abuses by federal law enforcement, upholding an exception to legal immunity. The decision revives a lawsuit filed by a family whose home was mistakenly raided by the FBI, causing property damage and emotional distress to the occupants. Justice Neil Gorsuch confirmed that Congress has opened the door to potential liability when an officer commits an assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, or abuse of process. The case has been remanded to a lower court for further consideration. </p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reveals that the Republican's proposed tax and spending bill would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans while negatively impacting low-income families. The CBO's forecast indicates that the highest-paid workers would experience the most significant gains from the bill's tax cuts, while middle-income families would see smaller benefits. Families earning less than $55,000 per year would likely face a net loss due to cutbacks in government benefits outweighing any tax savings. The analysis highlights a potential transfer of wealth from working families to the ultra-rich under the proposed legislation. </p>
