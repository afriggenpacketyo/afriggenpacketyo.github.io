          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, escalating a trade conflict. In a letter, President Trump explicitly linked the tariff to Brazil's ongoing prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, which he termed a "Witch Hunt." Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated his country would respond with "reciprocity," citing a new law authorizing countermeasures. The article notes that despite Trump's claims of an unfair trade relationship, the U.S. actually maintains a trade surplus with Brazil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded its highest number of measles cases in 33 years, with over 1,288 infections confirmed so far in 2025. This surpasses the previous high set in 2019 and marks the worst year for the virus since it was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. Health officials attribute the resurgence to declining vaccination rates, with the largest outbreak centered in West Texas, resulting in two pediatric deaths. The CDC continues to recommend the MMR vaccine as the most effective protection against the highly contagious airborne virus.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs of federal workers. The plan, spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), had been halted by a federal judge who argued the president lacked the authority to reorganize government without congressional approval. The Supreme Court's majority stated the administration was likely to succeed on the merits of the case, though it expressed no view on the legality of specific agency plans. This decision allows the administration to resume its efforts to significantly reduce the size of the federal workforce.</p>

This article details the timeline of events and questions from a former county IT director who helped install the system.

The piece speculates whether the film's poor box office performance could be partially linked to a climate of fear preventing Latino families from going to public spaces like theaters. It concludes by hoping the film's message of a Latino hero redefining home reaches children affected by these policies.</p>

          <p>A judge in Utah has scheduled a September 5 execution date for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate diagnosed with dementia. Menzies, who was convicted of a 1986 murder, chose execution by firing squad decades ago when it was an option. His attorneys are appealing the decision, arguing that his cognitive decline is so severe he cannot rationally understand his punishment, a standard previously addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Despite the pending competency appeals and his deteriorating health, the judge signed the death warrant, though a hearing to re-evaluate his condition is scheduled for late July.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high on Wednesday, briefly trading above $112,000 before settling slightly lower. The surge in the flagship cryptocurrency coincided with a strong rally in the stock market, led by tech giant Nvidia, which momentarily touched a $4 trillion market capitalization. Although still considered a risk asset, Bitcoin often rallies alongside growth-oriented stocks during periods of positive investor sentiment. Analysts suggest that continued corporate buying and potential progress on U.S. crypto legislation could fuel further upward momentum for the digital currency this summer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former chairman of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced he is defecting to the rival Reform UK party. In a statement, Berry, who lost his parliamentary seat in 2024, said that "old Westminster politics has failed" and criticized both the Conservative and Labour parties. He is the fourth former Conservative MP to switch to Nigel Farage's party in the past two weeks, signaling growing political momentum for Reform UK. A Conservative spokesman responded by wishing Berry well in his "new high spend, high tax party," highlighting policy differences between the two right-leaning groups.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued sanctions against Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur responsible for investigating human rights in the Palestinian territories. This action is the latest in a U.S. campaign against critics of Israel's military operations in Gaza. The State Department accused Albanese of a pattern of antisemitism and anti-Israel bias, which she denies. Albanese has been an outspoken critic of the conflict, labeling it a "genocide," and has supported the International Criminal Court's indictment of Israeli officials.

          <p>This article analyzes the political difficulties the Trump administration is facing regarding conspiracy theories surrounding the late Jeffrey Epstein. Before taking power, some high-ranking officials in the administration had fueled right-wing speculation about a "deep state" cover-up of explosive information related to Epstein's activities. Now in government, the Department of Justice has stated there is no secret information to release, a declaration that only intensifies conspiratorial beliefs. This situation creates a credibility problem for the administration, as it is now in the position of denying the very theories some of its members previously promoted.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has issued over 20 subpoenas to medical clinics and individual doctors who provide gender-affirming care to minors. This move follows an April memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi directing federal prosecutors to investigate such care, framing it as potential "chemical and surgical mutilation of children." While no charges have been filed, legal experts suggest the investigation is intended to create a chilling effect, intimidating physicians from providing what major medical associations consider necessary, life-saving treatment. The DOJ is also investigating manufacturers of drugs used in these treatments for potential misbranding.</p>

          <p>China's portable power bank industry is facing a crisis of confidence after a series of high-profile incidents where devices caught fire, leading to an emergency ban on certain models by aviation regulators. The problem was traced to a supplier that illegally substituted cheaper, lower-quality materials to cut costs, a symptom of a hyper-competitive market with shrinking profit margins. With the average price of a power bank having halved in four years, many manufacturers have been forced to compromise on quality and safety. This has resulted in product recalls and growing consumer distrust in the once-booming industry.</p>

A recent decision to suspend, then abruptly resume, a key arms delivery has created significant uncertainty for Ukrainian military planners, who rely on a predictable flow of aid to design battlefield strategies. The vacillation hampers Ukraine's ability to defend against escalating Russian attacks and could be interpreted by Moscow as waning U.S. support. The unpredictable nature of the aid, which is core to President Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy, forces Ukraine to make difficult logistical and strategic adjustments on short notice.</p>

The author argues that both are eccentric billionaires using a new political vehicle to attack an incumbent president, with Musk's effort aimed at aggravating President Trump. While third parties rarely succeed in the U.S., the piece suggests Musk's party could harm Republicans more than Democrats by peeling off swing voters and the "crackpot vote" from the MAGA coalition. Ultimately, the author is skeptical of the project's success, viewing it as another billionaire's misguided attempt to disrupt a system they don't fully understand.</p>
