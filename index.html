          <h2>New Tax Bill Offers Temporary Deduction for Seniors, Does Not Eliminate Social Security Taxes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 16:32:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently passed tax and spending bill, described by the administration as a major tax break, does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security as some claims suggested. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older with incomes below specified thresholds. This deduction, which applies to all income and not just Social Security payments, is scheduled to expire at the end of 2028. Policy experts clarify that this measure primarily benefits higher-income seniors and could potentially add financial strain to the Social Security trust fund.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signaled that a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, pending a final decision. In response, Hamas communicated a "positive" stance to mediators, emphasizing its demand for a permanent end to the war and a partial Israeli military withdrawal. Despite these diplomatic overtures, Israeli military operations have escalated across Gaza, resulting in at least 138 Palestinian fatalities over two days, according to health officials there. The ongoing violence highlights the fragile nature of the negotiations as civilians continue to suffer from the intense conflict.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally delivered a "positive response" to the latest US-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release, signaling readiness to enter negotiations. The plan is believed to involve a 60-day pause in fighting, the release of some Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and increased aid to Gaza. While diplomatic efforts advance, Israeli military strikes continue across the Gaza Strip, with health officials reporting at least 138 Palestinian deaths in the preceding 24 hours. In Tel Aviv, families of the remaining hostages held rallies urging for a deal to secure their release.</p>

          <p>After a nearly three-year slump, the market for initial public offerings is showing signs of recovery, offering encouragement to venture capital firms awaiting returns. This revival is highlighted by the strong performance of cryptocurrency company Circle, whose market capitalization has surged to $42 billion since its debut. While the largest private tech companies remain on the sidelines, an increase in smaller IPOs and strong post-debut gains by firms like CoreWeave suggest the industry's "liquidity drought" may be easing. Investors are cautiously optimistic, hoping for continued economic stability to sustain the trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a joint finding by Dutch and German intelligence services, Russia has escalated its use of prohibited chemical weapons in Ukraine, making it a standard military tactic. The report states that Russian forces are deploying substances like chloropicrin, a poison gas from World War I, and riot control agents to force Ukrainian soldiers from their trenches before attacking them. This practice violates the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which Russia is a signatory. Dutch officials have called for increased sanctions against Moscow and continued support for Kyiv in response to these actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign a sweeping tax-and-spending package into law, marking a significant legislative victory for his administration. The bill, which passed Congress by a narrow margin, introduces substantial tax cuts that analyses show will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans. It also imposes new restrictions and work requirements on federal safety-net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which could lead to millions losing benefits. Additionally, the legislation allocates $170 million to enhance immigration enforcement, supporting the administration's goal of conducting mass deportations, while also ending green energy incentives from the previous administration.</p>

He emphasized that while the Declaration of Independence's promise of equality did not initially include women, people of color, or the poor, its inspirational words set in motion global movements for liberty.

          <p>Top European Union officials gathered in Chisinau for the first-ever EU-Moldova summit, sending a strong signal of support for the country's ambitions to join the bloc. Moldovan President Maia Sandu stated the summit shows that accession is "no longer a distant dream," and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised Moldova's progress. The EU is also expected to pledge support to help Moldova counter hybrid threats and disinformation from Russia. The summit occurs as Moldova and Ukraine, which both began formal accession talks last year, push to advance their membership negotiations.</p>

          <p>During trade negotiations in Washington, the Trump administration has threatened to impose 17% tariffs on all food and agricultural exports from the European Union. The proposed tariffs would impact a wide range of popular European products sold in the U.S., including Irish butter, Italian olive oil, and Belgian chocolate. The warning was delivered to the EU's trade commissioner this week as part of the administration's aggressive negotiating stance. While the EU remains hopeful for a negotiated solution, it has also prepared retaliatory tariffs on American goods should the U.S. proceed with the new duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The LGBTQ+ community in Turkey is confronting escalating repression from the government, which has intensified its hostile rhetoric and crackdowns on public events. During Istanbul Pride Week, police arrested over 50 demonstrators, including a well-known journalist, after the governor banned the events, claiming they undermine "family structure and moral values." Activist groups report a surge in hate campaigns, censorship of LGBTQ+ media, and demonization by politicians, who portray the community as a threat. This atmosphere of persecution has overshadowed critical issues like poverty, housing, and healthcare access for LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

          <p>The market share of Chinese-made cars in the United Kingdom has seen significant growth, with one in every ten new cars sold in June originating from China. This represents a substantial increase from 6% in the same month last year, driven by the rapid expansion of brands like BYD, MG, and Omoda. The surge comes at a time when other Western nations have imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports. The UK's lack of similar tariffs, combined with the popularity of electric vehicles, has created a major opportunity for Chinese manufacturers to expand their presence.</p>

          <p>Momentum is building around the potential launch of a new left-wing political party in the UK, potentially co-founded by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The move was highlighted when MP Zarah Sultana announced she was quitting the Labour Party to help build this new alternative. While Corbyn confirmed discussions are ongoing, he indicated that the party's foundations are still being formed. Polling suggests such a party could capture up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from younger voters and potentially impacting the electoral fortunes of both the Labour and Green parties.</p>
