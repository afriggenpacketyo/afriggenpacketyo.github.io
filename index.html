        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CoreWeave's shares experienced a 19% surge following the announcement of a $2 billion debt offering, which was upsized from an initial $1.5 billion due to high demand. The company, a renter of AI data centers powered by Nvidia chips, priced the notes at 9.25% with a maturity date in June 2030. CoreWeave intends to use the capital to pay off outstanding debt, with the debt offering reportedly being five times oversubscribed. This move comes after CoreWeave raised $17.2 billion in equity and debt to support its cloud computing strategy for AI, despite reporting a wider-than-expected net loss in its recent earnings report. </p>

          <p>The Health Secretary is considering restricting or banning the private prescription of cross-sex hormones to individuals under 18, following concerns raised by Keira Bell, who regrets taking such medication as a teenager. A judicial review application was rejected, with the court acknowledging the government's ongoing review of hormone use by young people wishing to change their gender. Government lawyers mentioned exploring "alternative legal mechanisms" to address private and overseas providers prescribing these drugs. The review was initiated after the NHS stopped prescribing puberty blockers to under-18s at gender identity clinics, with campaigners arguing that cross-sex hormones should also be addressed. </p>

          <p>President Trump's plan for a second-term tax cut, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," is facing challenges due to disagreements over the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to itemize state and local taxes, but Trump's 2017 tax law capped it at $10,000, leading to protests from states like New York and New Jersey. While Trump now pledges to end the cap, some House Republicans oppose raising it, creating infighting within the party as fiscal hardliners seek to reduce the debt. </p>

          <p>Canada Goose shares rose nearly 20% after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, although it withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty.

However, the company expressed confidence in its brand strength and ability to adapt to changing conditions.

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, easing U.S.-China trade tensions, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt.

Increased liquidity in the crypto market, as measured by Tether stablecoin holdings on exchanges, and growing corporate treasury investments in Bitcoin are also contributing to the price surge. The Senate's move to advance stablecoin legislation and positive sentiment surrounding Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 are adding to the positive outlook. </p>

The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death. While some Democrats call the bill a positive step, others criticize its limited impact and lack of exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies.
