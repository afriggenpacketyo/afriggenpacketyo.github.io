          <p>The United States and Iran have commenced in-depth negotiations in Oman concerning Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Discussions are expected to revolve around limiting Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. The talks are led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, with expert teams from both sides delving into the specifics of a potential agreement. While President Trump expressed hope for a new nuclear deal, he also maintained the possibility of military action if negotiations fail. Optimism score is set at 40.</p>

          <p>Analysts are questioning the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the Trump administration's proposed 'Golden Dome' missile defense shield, designed to counter China's expanding missile arsenal.
