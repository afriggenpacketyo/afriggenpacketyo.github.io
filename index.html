          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap performed a contentious set at the Glastonbury Festival, drawing a massive crowd. The performance included chants against UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had deemed their appearance inappropriate, and expressions of support for Palestine. The set occurred amid legal troubles for band member Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh, who faces a terrorism charge, which he denies, for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a previous show. The group thanked the festival organizers for not cancelling their performance despite political pressure.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on Evin Prison in Tehran on June 23 resulted in the deaths of 71 people, according to an Iranian judiciary spokesperson. The victims reportedly included administrative staff, prisoners, and their visiting families, prompting condemnation from human rights advocates and the UN, who stated the prison is not a military target. Israel claimed the strike was targeted to avoid harming uninvolved individuals, but reports from Iranian media describe civilian casualties. This attack was part of a broader wave of Israeli strikes on what it termed "regime targets" in Tehran.</p>

          <p>Ukraine lost an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, while repelling one of the largest Russian air attacks of the war. The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia launched over 500 drones and missiles overnight, with Ukrainian defenses, including F-16s, downing a majority of them. Lt. Col. Ustimenko reportedly shot down seven targets before his plane was damaged; he guided the aircraft away from a residential area and did not have time to eject.

          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll indicates that 50 percent of Japanese voters hope Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition will lose its majority in the upcoming House of Councillors election in July. In contrast, only 38.1 percent of respondents expressed a desire for the Liberal Democratic Party and its Komeito party partner to maintain their majority. This sentiment reflects growing public discontent and sets the stage for a critical election that could significantly impact Ishiba's administration and the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>A recent incident where a Delta passenger was asked to spit out a Zyn nicotine pouch has highlighted confusion over airline policies regarding smokeless tobacco products. While the TSA permits these pouches in both carry-on and checked bags, individual airlines set their own rules for in-flight use. Delta's policy explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches and gum, treating them similarly to smoking and vaping. However, policies for other major carriers like American and United are not clearly defined on their websites, leaving travelers uncertain about the rules.</p>

          <p>A series of recent summits has exposed Europe's perceived weakness and lack of independence on the global stage, particularly as it prepares for engagement with China. Since the return of US President Donald Trump, discussions about Europe becoming a more autonomous geopolitical player have been widespread. However, this article suggests the continent's ambitions are being undermined by internal divisions and external pressures. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's comments about Europe paying a price for not meeting NATO spending targets are cited as an example of the challenging dynamics at play.</p>

This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi described as causing severe but not total damage, contradicting claims by Donald Trump that the sites were obliterated. The statement highlights that Iran's industrial and technological capabilities remain, suggesting any long-term solution to the nuclear issue will need to be diplomatic.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf has amplified concerns over the safety of women with public online profiles in Pakistan. Many women who use social media for self-expression or professional reasons report facing a barrage of threats, privacy violations, and stalking that often escalates into real-world danger. Activists argue that deep-seated patriarchal norms contribute to this environment, where women's visibility is often perceived as a threat to cultural values, leading to harassment and violence. Despite these risks, many women continue to use digital platforms to advocate for issues like mental health and domestic violence awareness.</p>

The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an act of rage after an unwanted sexual advance, an assertion for which there is no evidence.

          <p>France is positioning satellite operator Eutelsat as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink, leading a â‚¬1.35 billion investment to become the company's largest shareholder. After merging with British venture OneWeb, Eutelsat is now the only European operator with a functional Low Earth Orbit (LEO) network, a key asset for technological sovereignty. However, experts express skepticism about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, citing a massive disparity in scale, as Eutelsat operates 650 LEO satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. Eutelsat is seen as better positioned for specialized government and enterprise contracts rather than the mass market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first half of the trading year was marked by significant volatility driven by political tensions, and this trend is expected to continue into the second half. Geoeconomics remains a dominant market force, with trade disputes and geopolitical events causing sharp swings in global equity markets. This week, attention will shift to central bankers gathering at the ECB Forum in Sintra, Portugal, where they will discuss monetary policy amid pressures from political leaders and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Analysts warn that elevated policy uncertainty is likely to sustain higher equity volatility in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a group of islands administered by Taipei but located less than 10km from mainland China, exemplifies the complex dynamics of the Taiwan Strait conflict. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its strategic location, on-the-ground interviews suggest that both Beijing and Taipei face clear limitations in their ability to influence the island's populace and affairs. The island serves as a unique case study in the ongoing geopolitical struggle, representing both a symbol of deterrence for Taipei and a target of influence for Beijing.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarus are withdrawing from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland plan to restart production and deployment of land mines to secure their eastern borders as a deterrent. The move is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end. This plan would create a new, explosive "Iron Curtain" along a 3,500-kilometer border, a strategy defended as necessary for national security against an existential threat.</p>

Violators of the ban could face fines up to â‚¬700, although there will be an initial grace period. The measure is part of a broader national strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032, addressing France's relatively high smoking rate.</p>

          <p>A man has detailed a devastating stalking and harassment campaign perpetrated by Venessa Pinto, a lay preacher for the Church of England's Leicester diocese. The campaign began after he, a gay and trans man, declined her romantic advances. The harassment included false public accusations, threats, and doxing, which he reported to both the police and the church with little initial success. The Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, initially disbelieved the victim and accused him of witchcraft. Pinto was eventually convicted of stalking and received a community order, while the police and diocese have since apologized for their handling of the case.</p>

          <p>Civil servants in China, particularly at local levels, are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent and ever-shifting austerity measures.

An official in Sichuan province reported that his department head banned eating out entirely, reflecting a climate of caution among government employees. This behavior highlights the pervasive impact of anti-corruption and austerity campaigns on the daily lives and social habits of public officials across the country.</p>
