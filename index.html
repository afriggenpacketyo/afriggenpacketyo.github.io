          <p>Two 16-year-old boys have been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa. The attack occurred on a bus in Woolwich, south-east London, where the assailants stabbed Bokassa with machetes in what the court heard was a pre-planned assault. CCTV footage was crucial evidence, leading to the defendants' guilty pleas. The judge mandated a minimum term of 15 years and 10 months, as the victim's family expressed their profound grief in court.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wharton associate professor Ethan Mollick suggests that while artificial intelligence is not yet capable of fully replacing human jobs, it poses a significant concern for the entry-level workforce. He argues that the immediate challenge isn't mass unemployment but rather developing expertise and judgment to oversee AI systems, as traditional apprenticeship models may become obsolete. Mollick advises that jobs with a variety of "bundled" tasks are more resilient to AI disruption than single-focus roles, and emphasizes that organizational leaders must articulate a clear vision for AI integration.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated that he has not thought about a potential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. While acknowledging he has the authority to do so, Trump deflected further questions and urged focus on other public figures associated with Epstein. The comments come as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is conducting interviews with Maxwell. Trump also dismissed a report about a "bawdy" letter he allegedly sent to Epstein.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel have withdrawn their negotiating teams from ceasefire talks in Qatar, with President Donald Trump stating that Hamas "didn't really want to make a deal." A US envoy cited Hamas's response as showing a "lack of desire" and mentioned that "alternative options" for hostage release are now being considered. Hamas expressed surprise at the negative characterization of its position, affirming its commitment to continue negotiations to end the conflict. The stalled talks exacerbate the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of mass starvation.</p>

          <p>The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a program to deliver essential supplies like food and medication to immigrant families who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration enforcement raids. Archbishop José H. Gómez stated the initiative aims to support community members experiencing significant fear and anxiety. The program, funded by donations, will utilize parish networks across three counties, reactivating delivery systems established during the COVID-19 pandemic. This response comes as ICE has arrested nearly 3,000 people in the Los Angeles area since June.</p>

          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window has seen massive spending, dominated by the league's top clubs. Liverpool leads the expenditure with £269 million, including a potential British record for Florian Wirtz, followed by Chelsea and Arsenal, who have also spent over £200 million. This spending spree contrasts with previous years and highlights a growing financial gap, with the top six clubs accounting for a significant majority of the total outlay. Football finance experts note that despite the large sums, Liverpool's spending remains within profit and sustainability rules, bolstered by increased revenue.</p>

Maxwell's attorney described the first day of talks as "very productive," while Trump has not ruled out clemency.

One method is to invest in an annuity to create a private income stream that can bridge the financial gap until age 70. Another option for homeowners is a reverse mortgage, which allows them to borrow against home equity to supplement income.

The junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, has overseen a crackdown on media and civil society, leading to job losses in the non-profit sector and worsening human rights abuses. Despite justifying the takeover by citing insecurity and economic hardship, little has improved, and the country has since withdrawn from the regional bloc ECOWAS.

          <p>At least seven children were killed and 20 others were injured after a portion of a school's roof collapsed in Rajasthan, India. The incident occurred Friday morning as students were gathering for their morning assembly, burying them under debris. Local residents and authorities rushed to the scene to conduct rescue operations. While officials noted the building was not previously flagged as unsafe, reports suggest it was in poor condition, and weeks of heavy monsoon rains may have been a contributing factor. An investigation has been launched to determine the cause.</p>

          <p>A provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student loan forgiveness tax-free at the federal level is set to expire at the end of 2025. Without new legislation, borrowers who receive debt cancellation through programs like Income-Driven Repayment plans will once again face a federal tax bill on the forgiven amount starting in 2026. Experts note this could create a significant financial burden, as the forgiven debt is treated as taxable income by the IRS. This policy change could saddle struggling borrowers with a large tax debt immediately after having their student loans cleared. (not investment advice)</p>

These revelations have intensified anger over the administration's failure to release the full Epstein investigation files. The ongoing drip of evidence, including photos and witness accounts, has repeatedly thwarted Trump's attempts to downplay his association with the convicted sex offender.</p>
