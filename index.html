          <p>US job openings decreased to approximately 7.18 million in July, reaching levels not frequently observed since late 2020, aside from a brief dip last year. This figure, which fell below economists' expectations, significantly bolsters concerns about a cooling labor market. Experts are characterizing this as a "turning point," indicating a potential freeze in hiring and increased difficulty for individuals seeking employment across the country. The report underscores a notable shift from the more robust post-pandemic employment conditions, with upcoming weekly jobless claims and the comprehensive jobs report expected to offer further critical insights into the labor market's overall health and trajectory.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact check rigorously investigated former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrat-governed cities inherently experience higher crime rates. Analyzing 2024 FBI data and a comprehensive three-decade study by Harvard, MIT, and Boston University, the investigation found no causal link between a mayor's party affiliation and crime statistics. While many large US cities are indeed Democrat-led and tend to report higher crime than rural areas, this correlation does not imply causation, as the FBI itself warns against simple city rankings. The research definitively concluded that mayoral political affiliation made little difference in crime or arrest rates, emphasizing that crime is influenced by complex socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors rather than political leadership.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that "narco-terrorists will face the same fate" after a US military strike destroyed a drug-carrying vessel off Venezuela. President Donald Trump confirmed the attack, which killed 11 individuals identified as members of the Tren de Aragua, a designated foreign terrorist organization. Hegseth stated the US will maintain assets in the Caribbean to target those involved in drug trafficking, signaling a more aggressive stance against illicit substances entering the country. This action is part of an ongoing anti-drug cartel mission, despite protests from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro regarding the increased US military presence, highlighting escalating tensions and a commitment to disrupting criminal networks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are increasingly considering HELOCs and home equity loans as affordable financing options, with current average rates just over 8%, significantly lower than credit cards or personal loans. HELOCs feature variable interest rates and a flexible draw period, making them potentially more appealing if the Federal Reserve implements anticipated rate cuts later this year. In contrast, home equity loans offer fixed rates and predictable payments, providing greater stability over the loan's life. The optimal choice hinges on a borrower's financial goals, risk tolerance, and repayment approach, as both options involve closing costs and use the home as collateral, necessitating careful financial planning to avoid potential foreclosure if payments are missed.

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that critical DNA evidence, obtained using novel whole genome sequencing technology, will be admissible in the Gilgo Beach serial killer case against Rex Heuermann. This decision is significant because it marks the first time this advanced DNA method, derived from accepted scientific techniques, will be used in a New York court. Prosecutors successfully argued for its reliability, linking Heuermann or individuals residing with him to hairs found at crime scenes and on six of the seven victims. This ruling is a crucial development in the high-profile investigation, potentially bolstering the prosecution's case and aiding the jury in its determination of guilt for the murders spanning from 1993 to 2011.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano experienced its 32nd eruption episode this week, shooting lava 500 feet into the air from its summit crater. The 13-hour event produced an estimated 337 million cubic feet of molten rock, covering a significant portion of the Halemaumau Crater floor within Hawaii Volcanoes National State Park. While the lava was contained to an uninhabited area and caused no injuries, the eruption released approximately 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, creating volcanic smog that poses respiratory and health risks downwind. Officials also warned of volcanic glass and fragments in areas up to 10 miles from the vent, emphasizing potential hazards despite the contained lava flow.</p>

          <p>A year-long investigation by the Fundraising Regulator found that Depher Community Plumbing and Heating CIC, founded by "Britain's kindest plumber" James Anderson, breached multiple fundraising rules.

Breaches included inadequate care for case studies, confusing appeal pages, and using funds for personal purchases like a house and car. The report highlights serious errors in Depher's fundraising activities, despite its initial charitable aims and rapid growth, leading to calls for further investigation from affected families and a rescinded award for Anderson.</p>

Israel's Foreign Ministry dismissed the allegations as "Hamas' campaign of lies," asserting that Israel itself is a victim of genocide.

          <p>Hurricane Lorena, currently at hurricane strength, is threatening Mexico's Baja California peninsula with heavy rain and potential "life-threatening flash floods and mudslides" later this week. Forecasters anticipate rapid strengthening tonight, followed by weakening to a tropical storm by Friday, as it moves northwest parallel to the coast. Mexico has issued tropical storm warnings and watches for parts of Baja California Sur, with up to 15 inches of rain possible in some areas. Meanwhile, Hurricane Kiko, a much stronger Category 2 storm, is also in the Pacific but poses no threat to land, highlighting the dual storm activity and the immediate danger Lorena presents to coastal communities.</p>

          <p>Cholera, an ancient and easily treatable disease, is experiencing a significant resurgence in Africa, with cases more than doubling over the past three years to over 230,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths this year across 23 countries. This alarming increase, driven by conflict and poverty, has prompted African leaders, the Africa CDC, and WHO to launch an emergency plan and presidential task force. The initiative aims to coordinate efforts, mobilize resources, and address underlying issues like access to clean water, with an estimated budget of $231 million. The long-term goal is to eliminate cholera as a major public health issue by 2030, a lofty aim for an infection whose spread is often exacerbated by humanitarian crises and climate change.</p>

          <p>Macy's shares surged 20% after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street's expectations and raised its full-year guidance. CEO Tony Spring attributed the positive performance to revamped stores and a resilient consumer spending on new items and fashion. Despite previous uncertainties due to President Donald Trump's tariffs, which led to price hikes, Macy's has incorporated these impacts into its outlook and remains cautiously optimistic. The company saw its best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, with Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury also performing well, indicating successful strategic shifts and a healthy inventory position going into the fall season.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief, Sir Mark Rowley, has called for a change in legislation after the arrest of comedian Graham Linehan, which sparked a backlash over free speech concerns. Linehan was arrested at Heathrow for posts on X, including one that suggested punching a trans-identified male in a female-only space, which Sir Mark said could be an offense under existing law. Sir Mark argued police are "between a rock and a hard place" when investigating online speech, calling for legal clarification "without delay" and announcing a more stringent triaging process for future cases. This incident has fueled a debate among public figures and politicians about the balance between free speech and preventing incitement to violence.</p>

This meeting, the first of its kind in decades, highlights the growing influence of an economic and security bloc determined to resist a US-led world order. Analysts suggest Kim is leveraging this alliance to diversify from China and secure benefits from Russia, which relies on North Korean support for the Ukraine war. While united in their opposition to the West, each leader seeks to exploit the three-way relationship for their own advantage, indicating a complex diplomatic dance and a potential shift in US trade policy towards China under President Trump.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With high mortgage rates and home prices, reverse mortgages are gaining traction for older homeowners to access equity, but experts caution about inherent risks in the current market. While no monthly payments are required, borrowers must maintain their home, insurance, and property taxes, all of which are rising significantly, potentially leading to foreclosure if not managed. Falling home prices in some areas can reduce available equity and qualification chances. Additionally, reverse mortgages deplete home equity, potentially leaving less for heirs, and high upfront costs may not be worthwhile for those planning short-term occupancy, making careful consideration of financial goals and alternatives crucial.

          <p>Following a devastating 6.0 magnitude earthquake in Afghanistan's eastern provinces, women are struggling to access critical help due to Taliban restrictions and cultural norms. Despite over 1,400 deaths and 5,400 destroyed homes, women are notably absent from aid efforts and hospitals, with male family members preventing them from being seen or helped by strangers. Volunteer female doctors were denied access by the Taliban and local men, exacerbating a severe shortage of female medical personnel in medical centers.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential successor to Jerome Powell as Fed chair, advocated for initiating interest rate cuts this month, citing concerns about a rapidly deteriorating labor market. Waller, who dissented from the July FOMC decision to hold rates steady, believes multiple cuts are needed over the next few months, as current rates are significantly above their "neutral" level. He acknowledged tariffs could slow growth but does not foresee a recession, with the next policy meeting scheduled for September 16-17. While declining to comment on the controversial firing of fellow Fed Governor Lisa Cook, Waller emphasized the critical importance of the Fed's independence, vowing it would be maintained under any leadership.
