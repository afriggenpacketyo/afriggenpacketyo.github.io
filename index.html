          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, decade-long compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, contingent on the company achieving exceptionally ambitious market capitalization and operational goals. The proposed package involves over 423 million additional shares and would significantly increase Musk's voting power, a condition he has publicly sought. This move comes after a Delaware court invalidated his previous 2018 pay plan, a decision currently under appeal by the company. Investors will also vote on a proposal for Tesla to invest in Musk's artificial intelligence venture, xAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A French couple who illegally kept a black panther named Louise in their apartment has been handed suspended jail sentences and fines. The case gained notoriety in 2019 when the young feline escaped onto the rooftops of their building in Armentieres, prompting a large-scale police and rescue operation. The owners claimed they viewed the animal as a "big, affectionate baby," having purchased her from a traveling community. Despite their affection, the court found them guilty of illegally keeping a wild animal, with the man also barred from owning animals for five years. The panther now resides safely in a big cat sanctuary.</p>

          <p>In a strategic political move, New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate, bypassing his direct opponent, Andrew Cuomo. The challenge came after Cuomo, running as an independent, called for a series of one-on-one debates with Mamdani and urged other candidates to drop out. Mamdani framed his counter-proposal as a way to "cut out the middle man," suggesting Cuomo is a puppet for the President. This development occurs amid reports that the White House is exploring ways to consolidate the opposition against Mamdani, who currently leads in the polls for the upcoming election.</p>

Families of those still held captive in Gaza are increasing pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, voicing opposition to the government's plan to reoccupy Gaza City. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 63,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and a severe humanitarian crisis.

          <p>A recent survey of Chinese citizens indicates a significant division in public opinion regarding their country's role in global affairs and its relationship with the United States. While a large majority do not view the U.S. as a friend and see economic competition as a major threat, most also favor a balanced approach of cooperation and containment toward Washington. The study, conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, found that Russia and North Korea are overwhelmingly seen as friendly nations. Chinese citizens are split on whether their country should seek a dominant or shared leadership role on the world stage.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that the U.S. Supreme Court's Republican-appointed majority has established a pattern of rulings that systematically benefit former President Donald Trump and allied conservative interests. The piece cites numerous examples, including the granting of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts and the frequent use of the 'shadow docket' to grant Trump's requests for emergency relief. It contrasts this with the treatment of the Biden administration, which faced newly created legal doctrines like the 'major questions doctrine.' The author concludes that these actions demonstrate the justices are acting as partisans rather than impartial arbiters of the law.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom experienced a 0.6% increase in July, surpassing analyst expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The boost in consumer spending was largely attributed to sunny weather and the excitement surrounding the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. Online retailers, along with clothing and footwear stores, reported particularly strong sales growth during the month. The release of this data was delayed due to concerns over statistical quality, for which the ONS issued an apology and has since revised its figures for the past year to correct for errors.</p>

They concur that the primary danger of AI is not from sentient machines but from malicious humans using the technology for purposes like political propaganda.

For living donations, psychological and practical barriers are significant; while many support the idea, few donate to strangers due to the abstract nature of the need and practical costs like lost wages.

          <p>An opinion column explores the recent wave of public speculation about President Trump's health following a six-day absence from major public events. The author notes that while Trump, at 79, is the oldest president and does not appear to be in peak physical condition, much of the intense rumor-mongering stems from his political opponents' wishful thinking. The piece argues that Democrats and other critics are engaging in a form of 'wishcasting,' hoping that mortality will solve their political problem. The columnist warns that relying on a potential health crisis to check Trump's power is a flawed strategy, as authoritarian figures often remain in power longer than expected.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced gains on Friday as investors awaited the release of the U.S. August jobs report, which is expected to heavily influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on interest rates. Current market sentiment, bolstered by recent U.S. payroll data, strongly indicates a rate cut in September, creating a positive outlook. In related corporate news, Danish renewables company Orsted saw its shares climb after shareholders approved a significant rights issue. Meanwhile, U.K. data revealed an unexpected increase in retail sales and a slight rise in house prices, suggesting some positive economic momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nga Wai hono i te po Paki, New Zealand's Maori queen, delivered her first public speech, officially ending a traditional year-long period of mourning for her late father, King Tuheitia. In an emotional address to thousands of attendees, the 28-year-old monarch paid tribute to her father and announced new initiatives aimed at achieving economic independence for the Indigenous Maori people. The Maori queen's role is largely ceremonial but holds significant cultural and symbolic importance. The Maori population constitutes 17% of New Zealand's population and faces higher rates of unemployment and poverty compared to other citizens.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has strongly rejected a Western proposal to deploy a "reassurance force" to Ukraine following a potential ceasefire, warning that any such troops would be considered "legitimate targets." The statement came after a Paris summit where 26 of Ukraine's allies, led by France, committed to providing security guarantees, including a possible troop deployment to prevent future aggression. Putin dismissed the initiative and stated there was little point in engaging with Ukrainian President Zelensky, claiming it is nearly impossible to reach an agreement on key issues, dimming hopes for a near-term peace deal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is set to release its August jobs report, the first since President Trump fired Commissioner Erika McEntarfer last month. McEntarfer's dismissal followed a weak July report that showed a sharp hiring slowdown, which Trump suggested without evidence was "manipulated." Economists anticipate the addition of 75,000 jobs in August, a figure that will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's decision on a widely expected interest rate cut later this month. Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a BLS critic from the Heritage Foundation, to lead the agency and ensure the numbers are "HONEST and ACCURATE." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed concern that Europe is not adequately asserting its influence on the global stage to protect its interests. Citing the war in Ukraine, Merz noted Europe's dependence on American assistance and its lack of leverage to pressure Russia, while other nations like China and India deepen their ties with Moscow. Despite these challenges, he welcomed signs of renewed European unity and emphasized Germany's responsibility to help drive that effort. His comments came as a teacher was injured in a knife attack at a school in Essen, and Germany's parliament finalized its 2025 budget.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent elimination of the 'de minimis' tariff exemption is causing significant chaos and disruption in global shipping and logistics networks. This policy previously allowed low-value shipments, typically under $800, to enter the U.S. without incurring duties or taxes, a rule that greatly benefited e-commerce platforms shipping directly from overseas. Its removal now subjects millions of small parcels to new customs processes and fees, creating backlogs and uncertainty for both consumers and businesses. The change is intended to level the playing field for domestic retailers but has introduced immediate and complex challenges for international supply chains.</p>

          <p>Thailand's parliament has elected tycoon-turned-politician Anutin Charnvirakul as the new prime minister, following the court-ordered removal of Paetongtarn Shinawatra last week. Anutin secured a comfortable majority with 311 votes in the lower house. His election was notably overshadowed by the abrupt departure of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarn's father, who left the country ahead of a court ruling that could potentially send him to prison. Anutin's premiership may be short-lived, as his election was secured with the support of the opposition on the condition that new elections are called within four months.</p>

He was detained under the catch-all offense of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble."

          <p>The world's largest iceberg, known as A23a, is rapidly disintegrating as it drifts into the warmer waters of the South Atlantic Ocean. Scientists report that the nearly 40-year-old iceberg, which originally broke off from Antarctica in 1986, is breaking into very large chunks and will soon be too small to track via satellite. After being grounded on the seafloor for decades, A23a began its final journey in late 2023. Its demise is considered part of a normal iceberg life cycle and not directly linked to climate change, providing scientists a valuable opportunity to study its environmental impact.</p>
