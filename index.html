          <p>The Department of Homeland Security indicated that arrests are possible for House Democrats from New Jersey after their visit to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility devolved into a confrontation. Reps. LaMonica McIver, Bonnie Watson Coleman, and Robert Menendez, along with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, allegedly stormed the Delaney Hall Detention Center, leading to Baraka's arrest for trespassing. DHS claims that body camera footage shows Congress members assaulting ICE officers, prompting an ongoing investigation into potential charges against those involved in the incident, which occurred amidst protests regarding the facility's detainees, who include individuals accused of serious crimes. The article states that DHS officials have not yet confirmed any pending charges against those accused of storming the facility.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested holding direct talks with Ukraine as early as May 15, aiming to address the root causes of the conflict and move toward a lasting peace. This proposal follows calls from European leaders, including the UK Prime Minister and the French President, for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. While the Kremlin initially stated they would consider the ceasefire proposal, they cautioned against applying pressure on Russia. The article emphasizes the ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict and initiate meaningful negotiations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Livestock farmer David Thornley is pursuing legal action against East Midlands Airport, alleging that a leaking pipe contaminated Diseworth Brook, leading to the loss of valuable pedigree lambs. Thornley claims that 25 of his ewes lost their lambs after drinking the polluted water in 2022, following an incident where the airport exceeded environmental permit limits by releasing water containing chemicals. While the airport acknowledges a small leak occurred, they deny any direct link between the discharge and bacterial pollution in the brook. The Environment Agency is also involved, having brought charges against the airport for discharging contaminated wastewater, with sentencing scheduled for July.</p>

          <p>Faced with the threat of new sanctions, President Vladimir V. Putin called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in the coming days. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, on their first joint visit to Ukraine, said on Saturday that Russia would face ‚Äúnew and massive‚Äù sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Vladimir V. Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. Hours later, Mr. Putin brushed that demand aside and called instead for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey.

          <p>Bangladesh's interim government has banned the Awami League, the political party of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, citing the Anti-Terrorism Act. The ban will remain in effect until a special tribunal concludes its trial of the party and its leaders for the deaths of hundreds of people during anti-government protests last year. This decision follows sit-in protests in Dhaka by thousands demanding the ban. The Awami League has rejected the ban, calling it "illegitimate." The UN's human rights office has reported that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the Hasina administration's response to anti-government protests.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. and China made "great progress" in trade talks held in Switzerland, suggesting a "total reset" was negotiated. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met for over 10 hours to discuss tariffs that have destabilized global markets. While initial discussions focused on de-escalation, not a comprehensive trade deal, Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China. The talks aim to scale back tariffs that have disrupted trade and increased the U.S. trade deficit with China, but analysts remain skeptical about the possibility of substantial results from the Geneva meeting.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China have begun negotiations in Geneva aimed at resolving the trade war that has disrupted the global economy. President Trump described the initial meeting as "very good" and "friendly," but expectations for a significant reduction in tariffs remain low. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, are the first since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent and China retaliated with levies of 125 percent on U.S. goods. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations, fearing that a prolonged trade war will lead to slower growth and higher prices worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Florida Legislature has passed a bill that would shield the addresses and phone numbers of elected officials from public disclosure, citing concerns about harassment and threats. Government watchdogs, however, worry that the bill will hinder accountability by preventing voters from verifying whether their lawmakers reside in their districts as required. While proponents argue the bill is necessary for the safety of public officials and their families, critics argue it limits government transparency and Floridians' First Amendment rights. The bill, if signed into law by Governor DeSantis, would apply to a wide range of public officials, including members of Congress, state legislators, and local commissioners.</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating trade tensions, China's export controls on rare earth elements, crucial for military technology, pose a threat to the U.S. defense industry. As retaliation for President Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese goods, China has imposed restrictions on seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths. This move has sparked concern in Washington, given China's dominance in the production and supply of these essential minerals used in jet engines, radar, avionics, and other electronic systems.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan agreed to halt the fighting after an alarming escalation, but reports of violence continued. India and Pakistan announced a cease-fire on Saturday, after days of the worst fighting in decades between the two nuclear-armed rivals. Hours later, there were reports of continued violence on both sides, as India and Pakistan accused each other of violating the truce. The cease-fire agreement, which came after four days of missile, drone and artillery strikes, was first announced by President Trump, who cited the role of the United States as a mediator.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations. This directive effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon," a metric used for two decades to weigh the costs and benefits of policies related to greenhouse gas emissions. The move is seen as a denial of the scientific consensus on climate change and a way to weaken environmental regulations. Scientists and economists have criticized the decision, arguing that it ignores the real and growing economic harms caused by global warming.</p>

The House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxes, released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill on Friday evening. However, the bill could change significantly before the final vote. The full committee will debate and advance this legislation on Tuesday. With control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, Republican lawmakers can pass Trump's package without Democratic support via a process known as "reconciliation," which bypasses the Senate filibuster with a simple majority vote.</p>

Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to worries that Trump's involvement with meme coins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA creates opportunities for influence peddling. Critics, including Senators Jeff Merkley and Richard Blumenthal, have raised ethical concerns about the president profiting from cryptocurrency while advocating for policies affecting the industry.

Trump has been pressuring the Fed to cut rates, but Powell has dismissed the idea of pre-emptive cuts, citing a "solid" economy.
