          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents.

Attorney Mark Geragos expressed hope for their release, while the prosecution maintains they should not be released.

          <p>The UK government plans to relocate thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. The initiative aims to reduce the number of roles in London by 12,000 and close 11 offices, saving £94 million annually by 2032. Two new government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, focusing on digital innovation/AI and energy, respectively, with other roles created in various regional cities. The government intends for 50% of senior civil servants to be based in regional offices by 2030, expecting to bring £729 million to the local economy.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adam Schiff is requesting a DOD Inspector General inquiry into the Trump administration's role in accepting a luxury jet donated by the Qatari government for use as Air Force One.

They suspect the administration used the DOD to facilitate the transfer, potentially burdening taxpayers with retrofit costs and enabling Trump's personal use of the jet.

          <p>GOP lawmakers, led by Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Mary Miller, are targeting online pornography with the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA). The bill aims to clarify the definition of obscenity and make it illegal to transmit obscene content across state lines, intending to protect children and families. The IODA seeks to replace subjective standards with practical ones for identifying obscene material, removing the reliance on public opinion. The bill defines obscenity as material appealing to prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, lacking serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, which provided deportation protections and work permits to over 8,000 individuals. The Department of Homeland Security will wind down the program on July 12, citing an improved security situation and stabilizing economy in Afghanistan. This decision reverses the Biden administration's extension of TPS due to the humanitarian crisis following the Taliban takeover in 2021. Advocates have criticized the move, with #AfghanEvac calling it "unconscionable."</p>

A survey of over 1,000 GPs revealed that about 500 were against legalizing assisted dying, while about 400 were in favor. Concerns included terminally ill patients feeling like a burden and potential coercion. Supporters emphasized patient choice and the desire for a dignified death. The Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concerns about unmet needs and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.</p>
