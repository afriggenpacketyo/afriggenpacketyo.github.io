          <p>Actor Christian Bale is spearheading a project called Together California, a new type of foster care village designed to prevent siblings from being separated within the system. The facility, located in Palmdale, California, aims to provide a stable and supportive environment for children at risk by housing brothers and sisters together in one community. In an interview, Bale discussed his personal inspiration for co-founding the organization, emphasizing the critical need to maintain family bonds for children navigating the foster care system. The project represents a significant effort to address a long-standing challenge in child welfare services.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a defiant speech, asserting that the nation will persist in its fight for freedom. His address coincided with a prisoner exchange where 146 soldiers from each side were returned, and it followed Ukrainian accusations of Russian disinformation regarding a fire at a nuclear plant in Kursk. The day was also marked by significant international support, with Canada, the UK, Norway, and Sweden announcing new military aid packages, joint defense production agreements, and extended training programs. Zelensky emphasized the need for a just peace determined by Ukraine itself.</p>

          <p>A German NGO has reported the deaths of three young Sudanese sisters, aged 9, 11, and 17, after their overcrowded rubber dinghy encountered severe weather while crossing the Mediterranean Sea. The vessel, which had departed from Libya with 65 refugees, was partially deflated and taking on water for hours in the dark. Rescuers from the organization RESQSHIP found the girls' bodies and rescued their mother and brother, who were among the survivors. The incident highlights the ongoing dangers faced by migrants attempting the perilous journey from North Africa to Europe.</p>

          <p>Retired General and former CIA Director David Petraeus stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin is the main impediment to ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking on ABC News, Petraeus expressed skepticism about a potential peace summit, arguing that Putin has shown no genuine intention of ending the conflict unless he is granted additional territory. He urged the United States to escalate its support for Ukraine by lifting weapon restrictions, seizing frozen Russian assets for Ukrainian aid, and imposing further sanctions. Petraeus contended that altering the battlefield dynamics through increased assistance is necessary to compel Putin toward a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>An Ohio-based tiny living enthusiast, Levi Kelly, successfully built a 19.4-by-4-foot livable home in his yard for approximately $5,000, utilizing an old utility trailer as its foundation. The construction, which took one month, resulted in a highly efficient, solar-powered space equipped with heating, air conditioning, a compact kitchen, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower. Despite its closet-sized dimensions, the home is designed for functionality and has proven durable, even weathering a snowstorm.

          <p>Following a deadly mass shooting in a New York City office building, law enforcement officials and psychotherapists are expressing growing concern over the rise of nihilistic violence. This form of violence is characterized by a lack of clear ideological motive, with perpetrators often driven by a sense of emptiness, alienation, and a desire for destruction for its own sake. According to a 2024 Global Terrorism Index report, a significant majority of terrorist attacks in Western countries were not associated with a specific belief system. This trend complicates counterterrorism efforts as it makes attackers unpredictable and harder to profile.</p>

          <p>Despite stringent U.S. sanctions, including the blacklisting of China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), China's nuclear industry has achieved advanced capabilities and a massive industrial scale. This progress contrasts sharply with the costly delays and weakened supply chains hampering nuclear expansion in the U.S. and Europe. The exclusion of China's efficient and sanctioned industry now poses a potential threat to the West's own atomic energy revival. Sama Bilbao y León, Director General of the World Nuclear Association, emphasized that the nuclear industry is global and called for international cooperation and sharing of best practices to accelerate development.</p>

          <p>Amid plummeting public trust and increasing political pressure from both the left and right, American universities are facing an existential crisis. This opinion article argues that to save their core mission, institutions must adopt a stance of institutional neutrality, as outlined in the University of Chicago's 1967 Kalven report. This principle requires the university as an entity to refrain from taking positions on social and political issues, thereby creating a protected space for faculty and students to freely test and contest ideas. By reaffirming their commitment to academic freedom over partisan stances, universities can restore their credibility as centers for open inquiry.</p>

While European nations may engage with Beijing on issues like trade and climate, their foundational security commitments to the U.S. remain an immovable priority.

          <p>Israel has escalated its bombardment of Gaza City with heavy air and tank fire, signaling preparations for a major ground offensive in the territory's most populous urban area. Residents reported continuous explosions as Israeli forces also returned to the northern Jabalia refugee camp to destroy buildings. The Hamas-run health ministry reported 64 fatalities in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to over 62,600 since the war began. With some 60,000 Israeli reservists being called up, the planned operation has intensified international concern over the humanitarian impact on the nearly one million Palestinians remaining in the area.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is currently moving northeast across the open ocean. As of Sunday morning, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and posed no immediate threat to land. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict that Fernand will strengthen over the weekend, potentially reaching hurricane status by Monday before weakening later in the week. The storm's track is expected to keep it well east of Bermuda, consistent with an active hurricane season forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia to head the newly established U.S. National Design Studio, an agency tasked with streamlining and improving federal government websites. The studio, set to operate for three years, will advise agencies on usability, aesthetics, and standardized design to enhance user experience and cut costs. Gebbia, who previously worked with Elon Musk on the Department of Government Efficiency, stated his goal is to make government digital services as simple and reliable as those on the Apple App Store. The appointment follows Gebbia's recent shift in political alignment from a major Democratic donor to a Trump supporter.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data suggests that the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) may not keep pace with the actual inflation experienced by retirees, continuing a trend of diminishing purchasing power. The Senior Citizens League has revised its initial COLA forecast from 2.1% up to 2.7% due to a recent rebound in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). A long-term study by the organization found that Social Security benefits have lost 20% of their purchasing power since 2010 because COLAs have frequently lagged behind the true cost increases for seniors.

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce the backlog and decrease reliance on housing migrants in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that a new body staffed by independent adjudicators will be established to handle appeals more swiftly than the current court system. The move comes as the government faces pressure over the 32,000 asylum seekers still accommodated in hotels, with an average appeal currently taking over a year to be heard. Critics, like the Refugee Council, argue that the most effective way to reduce appeals is to improve the quality of initial decisions.</p>

          <p>A review of internal Jesuit correspondence from the 1970s and 80s, stemming from a recent lawsuit, details how leaders within the order grappled with the case of Donald B. Dickerson. Despite multiple reports that he had molested children and strong internal recommendations against his advancement, Dickerson was ultimately ordained as a priest in 1980. The letters show a conflict between regional leaders, with some pushing for his ordination despite clear warnings. This case also involves Pedro Arrupe, the former Jesuit superior general whose cause for sainthood is active, who was aware of the concerns but ultimately did not prevent the ordination.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has shifted to a confrontational, no-holds-barred approach in his political battle with President Donald Trump. In a direct challenge, Newsom has initiated a special election to redraw the state's congressional maps, aiming to add up to five Democratic seats to counter a similar Republican effort in Texas. This move, along with a barrage of lawsuits and aggressive social media tactics mimicking Trump's style, marks a significant change in strategy for the governor. Newsom argues that the current political climate requires Democrats to fight back more forcefully against what he describes as threats to democracy.</p>

          <p>A pair of coyotes, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, have taken up residence in New York's Central Park, drawing the attention of local photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. Their presence is part of a broader trend of coyotes expanding their territory eastward and successfully adapting to urban environments across the United States. Researchers with the Gotham Coyote project note that the decline of natural predators and habitat changes have allowed the species to move into cities, with an estimated 20 living in New York City. Officials and advocates are promoting coexistence, urging the public to observe the animals from a distance and not to feed them.</p>

The vessel, estimated to be over 15 meters long, also includes a cockpit with windows, suggesting it can be optionally crewed.

          <p>Although initial data from a late-stage trial of Eli Lilly's oral obesity pill, orforglipron, disappointed some investors with lower weight loss than expected, analysts believe it remains a formidable rival to Novo Nordisk's oral Wegovy. Orforglipron, a small-molecule drug, is easier to manufacture at scale and does not have the dietary restrictions required for Novo Nordisk's peptide-based pill. These advantages could allow for broader global distribution and potentially a lower price point. Analysts forecast that daily oral pills will capture a significant share of the weight loss drug market, which is expected to reach $95 billion by 2030.</p>

          <p>A new meme and series of public contests have emerged from Gen Z, playfully mocking the archetype of the "performative male." This figure is characterized by an alternative, intellectual aesthetic—carrying tote bags, reading feminist literature, and listening to indie female artists—often perceived as a curated effort to attract progressive women. While largely a lighthearted trend, it also taps into a deeper skepticism about the authenticity of men who adopt these "soft" signifiers. The phenomenon reflects ongoing online conversations about gender performance, privilege, and the difficulty of discerning genuine values from calculated personas in modern dating.</p>

          <p>A first-time Tesla owner shared a one-year review of their vehicle's costs, noting that while the $334 in gas savings was less than expected, the real financial benefit came from reduced maintenance. The owner spent only $600 on two tire replacements over 15,000 miles, a stark contrast to the tens of thousands spent on repairs for their previous gasoline-powered car. This experience highlights a key advantage of electric vehicles: fewer mechanical parts lead to lower long-term upkeep costs, a factor that becomes more significant over the life of the car.
