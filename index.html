          <p>Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, fire attack on pro-Israel demonstrators, has been charged with a federal hate crime. According to the criminal complaint, Soliman admitted to planning the attack for a year, targeting the demonstrators because they supported Israel and called for the release of hostages held by Hamas. The FBI agent's affidavit details that Soliman threw Molotov cocktails while yelling "Free Palestine," and authorities found multiple unlit Molotov cocktails at the scene. Soliman stated he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were dead, which led to the hate crime charge. </p>

          <p>An inquest concluded that the incorrect cessation of benefits led to the suicide of Jodey Whiting, a disabled woman from Stockton-on-Tees. Whiting, who suffered from multiple health issues, took her own life in 2017 after being deemed fit to work despite being hospitalized with pneumonia and missing an assessment. The coroner cited a "deteriorating mental state" caused by the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) decision to stop her benefits, which left her unable to pay bills or afford food. The DWP expressed regret and stated they are shifting towards a more compassionate approach, but the family maintains the DWP's actions directly caused Whiting's death.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis indicates that colleges are slightly less diverse following the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action in admissions.

The drop was more pronounced at elite institutions, with Black students experiencing a significant decline. Experts caution against drawing firm conclusions from one year of data but note that the trend raises concerns about long-term diversity on campuses.</p>

CNN reached a settlement with Young after deliberations on punitive damages began. CNN declined to comment on Marquardt's departure, citing personnel matters, but sources suggest the loss in court contributed to the decision.</p>

The study highlights that publicly insured and uninsured children would be disproportionately affected.
