It details how major corporations like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are now building on its infrastructure, utilizing it for tokenized assets and stablecoin transactions. Founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's staggering growth while warning about the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption accelerates. The piece highlights Ethereum's focus on stability and security as key reasons for its institutional appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency, has confirmed it is investigating former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The OSC enforces restrictions on partisan political activities by government employees but lacks criminal prosecution powers. It remains unclear what action could be taken against Smith, who is no longer a government employee.</p>

          <p>At the close of day three in the fifth Test, England stands at 50-1, requiring another 324 runs to defeat India and win the series. Opener Zak Crawley was dismissed late in the day, but Ben Duckett remains unbeaten, offering hope for the challenging chase. India set an imposing target of 374, largely thanks to a brilliant century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a surprise fifty from nightwatchman Akash Deep. Despite some dropped catches, England's bowlers toiled, with Josh Tongue taking five wickets, setting up a tense and decisive fourth day.</p>

          <p>Cat Eccles, the Member of Parliament for Stourbridge, is being investigated by the parliamentary standards commissioner over a potential breach of rules. The inquiry centers on the late registration of a trip to Israel and Palestine, which was sponsored by Labour Friends of Israel and valued at £2,600. According to parliamentary rules, such interests must be declared within 28 days. A spokesperson for the MP attributed the delay, with the trip taking place in May but registered in July, to an administrative error.</p>

          <p>The 'Tea' app, designed as a 'safe place' for women to share information about men in the dating pool, has suffered a major data breach, leaking sensitive user data including driver's licenses and private messages. The incident has exposed the personal information of its users and sparked a debate about the vulnerabilities of digital 'whisper networks.' While these networks can offer protection, experts note they risk losing the nuance of real-world communication and can lead to unverified accusations and online mob behavior. The company now faces two class-action lawsuits following the breach.</p>

          <p>England's Charley Hull is well-positioned for a final-round challenge at the Women's Open after shooting a six-under-par 66 on Saturday.

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted the Trump administration's sweeping order to close the U.S. asylum system at the southern border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that the government cannot use the proclamation to deport migrants to places where they might face persecution or torture without first hearing their claims for certain mandatory protections. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the discretionary asylum system itself, it affirmed that legal requirements for 'withholding of removal' and Convention Against Torture protections must be upheld.</p>

          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal agents from conducting 'roving' immigration raids based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The decision affirmed that such factors alone do not constitute reasonable suspicion for detaining an individual in the Los Angeles area. The case stems from sweeps conducted by the Trump administration that led to protests and fear within the region's Latino community. The ruling reinforces that immigration arrests cannot rely on broad profiles and must adhere to constitutional protections against unreasonable seizures.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter profit, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its investment in Kraft Heinz. While paper investment values caused net earnings to swing, the company's operating earnings, a measure Buffett prefers, were only down slightly to $11.16 billion. Most of Berkshire's diverse businesses, including its railroad and insurance units, performed well. The report also noted that the company's massive cash pile remains near a record high at $344.1 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a harrowing account of the deteriorating hunger crisis in Gaza, with Palestinians describing their daily search for food as a 'death journey.' Despite some international aid efforts, residents report that the assistance is insufficient and often dangerous to access, with hundreds reportedly killed near distribution sites. The piece contrasts the grim reality on the ground, where families are suffering from malnutrition, with international diplomatic debates over Palestinian statehood. Palestinians quoted in the article express that political statements are meaningless without tangible changes to alleviate their suffering.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that aligning fitness activities with personality traits could lead to more enjoyable and sustainable workout routines. Researchers found that extroverts often prefer high-intensity group workouts like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals may gravitate toward goal-oriented training like preparing for a marathon. Conversely, those with more anxious tendencies might benefit from private, one-on-one sessions, and introverts often prefer solo activities like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest people can find a better fitness fit by exploring different options.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released a weak July jobs report. The report showed that hiring had slowed significantly and included a large downward revision of 258,000 jobs for the previous two months. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes and ordered the dismissal of the Biden-appointed commissioner. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and policy experts, who warn it threatens the integrity of nonpartisan federal economic data.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics has drawn condemnation from several senior Republican lawmakers. Senators including Cynthia Lummis and Thom Tillis criticized the move as 'impetuous' and a sign of immaturity, questioning the rationale of firing a statistician over disappointing economic numbers. They expressed concern that such an action undermines the credibility of objective government data and politicizes a nonpartisan agency. The bipartisan criticism highlights the unprecedented nature of the president's dismissal of the agency head.</p>
