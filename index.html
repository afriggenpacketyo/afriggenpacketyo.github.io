          <p>The UK Transport Secretary has announced a plan to eliminate the driving test backlog by next summer, addressing the current unacceptable wait times. The government intends to provide at least 10,000 extra tests per month, double training capacity for examiners, and reintroduce overtime pay. Additionally, the plan includes cracking down on test booking bots that exploit learners by reselling slots at inflated prices, with the goal of reducing wait times to a maximum of seven weeks by summer 2026.</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced a jump after activist investor Elliott revealed a stake of over 5% in the company, which has recently shifted back to oil investments to regain investor confidence. Elliott's involvement is expected to pressure BP to move away from its green strategy and refocus on its core oil and gas businesses. BP had previously scaled back its emissions targets, citing the need to continue investing in fossil fuels to meet global demand, and since switching gears, BP has ramped up fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027.</p>

The defense is expected to highlight inconsistencies in the accusers' accounts, while the prosecution will likely present expert testimony on the psychological effects of sexual assault, and Weinstein was separately convicted of sexual assault in California in 2022, though he has appealed that conviction as well.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated that China's new export controls on rare earth magnets have impacted the production of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots, which rely on these materials. The restrictions, imposed in response to U.S. tariffs, require exporters to obtain licenses from China's Ministry of Commerce. Beijing is seeking assurances that the rare earth magnets will not be used for military purposes, and the Trump administration is considering potential tariffs on all U.S. imports of critical minerals in response to China's export controls.</p>
