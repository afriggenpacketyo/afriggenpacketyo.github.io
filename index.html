          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current interest rates due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs could trigger inflation while simultaneously hindering economic growth. Fed officials are closely monitoring economic data for signs of rising consumer prices or a weakening labor market, seeking clarity on the potential impacts of Trump's economic policies, including tariffs, spending cuts, and deportations. The central bank faces the challenge of balancing inflation control with maintaining a healthy labor market, potentially requiring difficult policy decisions. The article emphasizes that the Fed's decisions on interest rates will be heavily influenced by how Trump's policies affect both inflation and economic growth.</p>

          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, has risen to its highest level since October 2023, increasing 4.9% year-over-year due to consumer fears of price hikes caused by auto tariffs. While the tariffs primarily affect new imported vehicles, they indirectly impact the used car market by influencing new vehicle prices and demand. Retail used-vehicle sales in April decreased slightly compared to March but were higher year-over-year.
