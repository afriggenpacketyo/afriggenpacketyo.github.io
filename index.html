          <h2>Trump Considers "Baby Bonus" to Encourage Higher Birth Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 17:40:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is exploring proposals to encourage Americans to marry and have children, including a one-time payment or "baby bonus" of $5,000 to mothers after giving birth. This idea has gained traction after Trump expressed support for it at a Conservative Political Action Conference. While baby bonuses are common in other countries, critics view the proposals as a distraction from deeper societal investments needed to support parents, and worry about the political agenda that they may bolster. The article notes that studies suggest baby bonuses do not significantly boost fertility rates but could provide short-term financial relief to new parents. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Mellon Foundation has announced $15 million in emergency funding for state humanities councils after the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled most of its existing grants due to a shift toward President Trump’s priorities. This funding aims to provide a lifeline to humanities programs, particularly in rural states that lack private philanthropy. The Mellon Foundation's one-time infusion will give each council $200,000 in operational support and $50,000 in challenge grants. The National Endowment for the Humanities is redirecting its funding toward projects like the National Garden of American Heroes, leading to staff layoffs and a new grant program called “Celebrate America!”.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock plummeted 13% after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to offer guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties and potential constraints on advertising demand. CEO Evan Spiegel mentioned that the company has experienced headwinds and is balancing investment with revenue growth. Snap's CFO, Derek Andersen, noted that some advertisers reported an impact from changes to the de minimis exemption, which allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. The company lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses and stock-based compensation guidance, reporting 460 million daily active users and 15 million Snapchat+ subscribers.</p>

However, Russia's arms exports have significantly decreased, prompting countries to seek alternative suppliers.

Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>

Finance chief Lindsay Drucker Mann noted that the company has limited exposure to China, which faces a 145% tariff on many exports to the U.S. Oddity's stock has outperformed the S&P 500 this year.</p>

          <p>New York State has agreed to fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (MTA) five-year capital plan with $68.4 billion, the largest in its history, to prevent infrastructure collapse. However, the completion of all projects is uncertain due to potential funding cuts from the Trump administration, which has threatened to withhold funding unless the state ends its congestion pricing program in Manhattan. The plan includes buying new trains and buses, modernizing the subway signal system, and making stations accessible to people with disabilities. The MTA must now deliver on this ambitious plan on time and within budget.</p>

          <p>Bret Stephens writes about his friend Dane Chapin, a business-minded but non-MAGA Trump voter, who is now concerned about the president's tariffs. Chapin, who runs USAopoly, a board game company, faces potential obliteration of his business due to the chaotic and random execution of trade policy. He is frustrated that the president is making tariff exceptions for big tech companies like Apple but not for smaller American businesses. While Chapin doesn't regret his vote, he does regret the current trade policy, highlighting the economic anxieties among a critical constituency of Trump's base.</p>
