          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has proposed a new set of online safety measures designed to increase protections for users, particularly children, on tech platforms. The proposals could compel companies to implement systems that prevent illegal content from going viral and proactively detect terrorist material. Other measures would limit the ability for users to send virtual gifts or record livestreams involving a child, building on the existing Online Safety Act.</p>
