          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's saw a dramatic and volatile surge, echoing the meme stock phenomena of recent years. The stock price more than doubled before partially retreating, with trading volume skyrocketing to nearly 17 times its 30-day average. This activity appears driven by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who noted the stock's high short interest as a potential short squeeze opportunity. Analysts caution that the surge is detached from the company's weak business fundamentals, which include falling sales and leadership instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine is inconsistent and ultimately unhelpful to the Ukrainian cause. While the administration recently approved the transfer of Patriot anti-missile systems, it simultaneously gave Russia a 50-day period before considering new sanctions, effectively allowing Moscow's bombing campaign to continue unabated. The author contends that Trump is merely "stringing Ukraine along" with aid that is insufficient for victory while placing obstacles in their path. The piece suggests that Trump's actions seem more aligned with appeasing Putin than securing a Ukrainian victory.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the percentage of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. Twenty-seven percent of workers now report having a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, the lowest level since 2017. An analyst attributes the drop to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic anxiety that previously drove many to seek extra work. More people are now using side hustle income for discretionary spending rather than essential living expenses, signaling improved financial stability for some.</p>

          <p>Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., has called on the White House to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Her plea came after the Trump administration declassified and released 230,000 files concerning her father's assassination, a move she and her brother met with a request for empathy and respect for their family's grief. On social media, King directly stated, "Now, do the Epstein Files," linking the two controversial cases and adding her voice to the growing pressure on President Trump to provide transparency on the Epstein matter, which he has recently dismissed as a distraction.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is moving forward with a policy to ban people from living in recreational vehicles by implementing strict new citywide parking limits. The new rule, championed by Mayor Daniel Lurie, sets a two-hour parking limit for any vehicle over 22 feet long. The policy is aimed at clearing streets and addressing sanitation concerns but has been criticized as cruel by advocates for the homeless, who argue it displaces people without providing sufficient housing alternatives. A limited permit program will exempt some current RV residents while they work with the city to find housing.</p>

This audio library was used by an AI company to build a text-to-speech app that speaks with her unique cadence and sarcasm. Sotinsky is now a vocal advocate for this technology, pushing for insurance companies to recognize voice replication as a medical necessity for patients who lose their ability to speak.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the announced cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," which will end in May 2026. The author expresses shock and sadness, viewing the show as a cultural staple and a key source of political commentary. While CBS cites financial reasons, with the show reportedly losing $40 million annually, the timing is suspect, coming just after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's legal settlement with Donald Trump. The author argues that regardless of the reason, losing Colbert's principled and authoritative voice is a significant blow to a media landscape facing a powerful and shameless political movement.</p>

About two-thirds of current retirees depend on the program, yet public confidence in its long-term stability is declining, with 78% of Americans worried it won't provide enough to live on. The findings highlight a critical challenge as the program faces a long-term funding shortfall that could lead to benefit cuts by 2034 if Congress does not act to shore up its finances.
