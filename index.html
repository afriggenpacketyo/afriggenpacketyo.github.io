          <p>American businesswoman Michele Kang has significantly influenced women's soccer by establishing a multi-club ownership model that includes the Washington Spirit, Lyon, and the London City Lionesses. She advocates for this structure as a necessity to build scale and invest in infrastructure, such as female-specific research and global scouting, which are crucial for the sport's growth. Kang plays a hands-on role in her clubs, aiming to create an environment where players and staff can succeed, and she defends her model against criticism by emphasizing its purpose is to elevate the women's game rather than function as a simple feeder system. Her vision extends beyond on-field success, aiming to provide a platform for young girls to achieve their dreams.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination at Utah Valley University, students are expressing a renewed commitment to maintaining open political discourse on campus. Both supporters who were inspired by Kirk and those who vehemently opposed his views have stated a desire to ensure that healthy debate continues. Some students, previously apolitical, reported feeling radicalized by the event and the subsequent online reactions, vowing to become more politically involved. The sentiment on campus reflects a resolve to prevent violence from silencing conversation, with many feeling a personal responsibility to uphold the practice of public forum discussions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. health authorities are on alert as Chagas disease, transmitted by the 'kissing bug,' is increasingly being detected across at least eight states, prompting the CDC to consider classifying it as endemic. This shift would mean the disease is no longer viewed as an imported tropical illness but as a permanent domestic health risk. The disease is caused by a parasite in the bug's feces and can lead to serious cardiac and digestive complications years after an initial, often asymptomatic, infection. With no vaccine available, prevention focuses on insect control, and treatment is most effective in the early stages of the disease.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins' football season has taken a dire turn following a 35-10 defeat to New Mexico at the Rose Bowl, marking their third consecutive loss and an 0-3 start for the first time since 2019. The team, which was heavily favored, has yet to hold a lead in any game this season, raising significant questions about both its offensive and defensive capabilities under coach DeShaun Foster. Fans expressed their frustration as the team struggled against another Mountain West Conference opponent, amplifying concerns about the team's prospects for the remainder of the season as they head into Big Ten conference play.</p>

          <p>Despite a stellar performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who allowed only one run over seven dominant innings, the Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the San Francisco Giants 5-1. The Dodgers' offense struggled to provide support, managing only a single run from a solo home run. The game remained tied until the bottom of the 10th inning, when Giants catcher Patrick Bailey hit a walk-off grand slam. The loss was a significant setback for the Dodgers, who had been showing signs of improvement after a recent slump, while it fueled the Giants' surprising push for a playoff spot.</p>

          <p>The Prime Video series 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' has captured a massive audience, sparking intense online debate over its central teenage love triangle involving two brothers. The show's popularity is attributed to its nostalgic evocation of 2000s rom-coms and its effective use of classic storytelling tropes, providing a form of escapism for viewers. Beyond the romance, the series is also praised for its digestible handling of serious themes like grief, which resonates with a multi-generational audience. The frenzy is further amplified by social media, particularly TikTok, where fan theories and video edits set to Taylor Swift's music have built a strong online community.</p>

The research, which analyzed data from over 66,000 nurses for two decades, revealed that women who had been stalked had a 41% higher risk, while those who had obtained a restraining order faced a 70% higher risk. This association remained even after adjusting for other factors like diet and exercise. Researchers suggest these common forms of violence against women should be considered alongside traditional risk factors when screening for heart health.</p>

          <p>As the nights grow longer with the arrival of the autumnal equinox on September 22, stargazers have several celestial events to look forward to. Saturn will be at its closest point to Earth and appear at its brightest on September 21, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, which originates from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November, peaking around October 22. Viewing conditions for the meteor shower are expected to be ideal, as its peak coincides with a new moon, minimizing light pollution in the night sky.</p>

          <p>Keith Rabois, the newly appointed chairman of Opendoor, has stated that the home-buying technology company is 'completely bloated' and that its current workforce of 1,400 could be reduced to just 200. In a recent interview, Rabois, who co-founded the company, also criticized its 'broken' culture, citing remote work and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as problems. He announced a plan to 'fix all that' and return the company's focus to 'merit and excellence.' His comments come as Opendoor's stock has surged, becoming a popular 'meme stock' among retail traders.

          <p>Three elderly nuns in Austria, all in their 80s, have fled the care home they were placed in and returned to their former convent, Schloss Goldenstein. The nuns—Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita—claim they were moved against their will after their religious community was dissolved. With the help of former students and a locksmith to bypass changed locks, they have reoccupied their old apartments. Despite a lack of initial utilities and disapproval from church authorities, who cite health concerns, the defiant nuns are receiving support from the community and are determined to live out their days in their lifelong home.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, artificial intelligence tools rapidly amplified misinformation across social media, a CBS News analysis revealed. X's AI chatbot, Grok, was identified as repeatedly misidentifying the suspect before his name was officially released and generating altered 'enhanced' photos of the person of interest. Other AI-powered services described the confirmed shooting as a 'hypothetical scenario' or incorrectly labeled official statements as fabricated. The incidents highlight the significant danger AI poses in spreading false information during fast-moving news events, as the technology often prioritizes probable language over factual accuracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the 2024 election shows that conservative activist Charlie Kirk played a crucial role in helping Donald Trump improve his performance with younger voters, a demographic long dominated by Democrats. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, was instrumental in persuading the GOP to invest in youth outreach and in organizing young men. According to exit polling, Trump performed better with voters under 30 than any Republican presidential candidate since 2004, even drawing even with Kamala Harris among young men. This shift was a key factor in Trump's victory, particularly in flipping 'Blue Wall' states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian businessman in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm has described how the Israeli military took over his family's multi-story home and business for three and a half months before setting it on fire. Nasser Faratawi said his property was used as a military base and 'hotel' by soldiers during a large-scale operation in the adjacent refugee camp. Upon returning, he found his home and shop destroyed, with lewd graffiti on the walls and personal belongings ruined, resulting in an estimated $700,000 in losses. The Israeli military stated it was unaware of arson by its troops and that the incident is under review.</p>

          <p>New analysis suggests that seven million households in the UK are failing to claim a collective £24 billion in benefits and other financial support to which they are entitled. Research from Policy in Practice identifies a lack of awareness, the complexity of the application process, and social stigma as the primary barriers preventing people from accessing aid. The unclaimed funds cover a wide range of support, including universal credit, pension credit, free school meals, and social tariffs from utility providers. While progress has been made in increasing uptake for some benefits, a significant amount of assistance continues to go unclaimed. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 193 people have died in two separate boat accidents this week in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with many more still missing. One vessel, carrying nearly 500 passengers, capsized on the Congo River after catching fire, while another overloaded boat carrying mostly students sank in Basankusu territory. Such disasters are tragically common in the DR Congo, where river transport is essential but vessels are often old, poorly maintained, and dangerously overloaded. Night navigation, though prohibited, and limited resources in remote regions frequently contribute to the high death tolls and hinder rescue efforts.</p>
