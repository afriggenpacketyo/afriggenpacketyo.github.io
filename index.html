        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a major case concerning the constitutionality of federal limits on coordinated spending between political parties and their candidates. This high-stakes dispute, brought by Republican committees, argues that these long-standing restrictions violate the First Amendment's free speech protections. The case follows a series of rulings by the court's conservative majority that have dismantled other campaign finance regulations, such as those addressed in the Citizens United decision. A ruling is anticipated just months before the 2026 midterm elections and could significantly alter the flow of money in politics.</p>

          <p>The Senate has initiated a marathon voting session on President Trump's signature domestic spending package after advancing the legislation over the weekend. Titled the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," it includes increased funding for border security and defense, offset by cuts to health and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to pass the measure with a simple majority, aiming to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline despite dissent from some within their own party.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been found guilty of the murder and sexual assault of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, UK, nearly six decades after the crime occurred. Mrs. Dunne was found strangled in her home in June 1967, and the case remained unsolved until now. Investigators described the conviction as a combination of old and new policing techniques, making it what is believed to be the oldest cold case ever solved in the United Kingdom. Headley, who was in his 30s at the time of the murder, was identified as a predatory individual with a history of similar crimes.</p>

          <p>Google has announced its first commercial commitment to fusion energy through a partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a company spun off from MIT. The tech giant has agreed to purchase 200 megawatts of clean power from CFS's planned ARC fusion power plant, which is expected to come online in the early 2030s. Fusion generates carbon-free electricity by fusing atomic nuclei at extremely high temperatures. This partnership represents a significant investment in a technology with the potential to transform the world's energy supply.</p>

Fire officials confirmed that a search and rescue dog located the body of the deceased victim in the rubble. The cause of the explosion is under a slow and methodical investigation by multiple agencies to prevent any secondary collapses.</p>

However, economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices remain potential risks to the disinflationary trend.

From early links between independence and the abolition of slavery to enshrining social rights in law, this tradition stands in contrast to the U.S. focus on individual rights.

          <p>The number of people registered as asylum-seekers in Germany rose by 4.1% in 2024, reaching a total of 3.3 million, according to the Federal Statistical Office. Ukrainian nationals make up the largest group, followed by those from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey. The data was released as former Chancellor Angela Merkel publicly criticized her own party's current, tougher asylum policies, arguing that anyone seeking asylum at the border must receive proper due process, highlighting ongoing political division on the issue.</p>
