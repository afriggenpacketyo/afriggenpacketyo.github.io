        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump addressed Elon Musk's recent criticism of his proposed tax bill, suggesting Musk is upset over the elimination of electric vehicle credits and the administration's decision regarding the NASA directorship. Trump stated he prefers Musk to criticize him rather than the bill itself, defending the bill as "incredible." Musk had previously condemned the bill as a "disgusting abomination" and recently left his government post overseeing DOGE, the Trump administration's initiative to reduce federal spending. Trump emphasized that Musk was aware of the elimination of EV tax credits from the beginning. Optimism around the bill is high for Trump, though the relationship between Musk and Trump may be strained.</p>

          <p>Pete Hegseth's position as Pentagon chief faced challenges after an encounter with Elon Musk led to a canceled military briefing, displeasing President Trump. Trump felt the briefing, potentially discussing war plans with China, was inappropriate given Musk's business interests there. Following this incident, Hegseth faced scrutiny over disclosing military attack plans on Signal and other controversies, including personnel changes and media engagement strategies. Despite calls for his resignation, Hegseth maintains Trump's support, though questions linger about his judgment and ability to fulfill the president's military priorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices significantly rising since early 2024, investors should consider whether to wait for a price drop, when the price might change again, and what amount is safe to invest at today's elevated price. Waiting for a price drop carries the risk of missing out on gold's portfolio protection benefits, especially given current stock market uncertainty. The price of gold may fluctuate based on upcoming inflation reports and Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions this June. Investors should limit gold investments to a maximum of 10% of their portfolio and consider dollar-cost averaging. (not investment advice)</p>

A federal court filing cites unconfirmed sightings of Hardin in central Arkansas and southern Missouri, leading authorities to believe he has left the state. Hardin, who was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped by disguising himself in a law enforcement uniform.

          <p>Senators Pete Ricketts and John Fetterman are collaborating on bipartisan legislation to increase oversight of foreign countries buying American farmland.

The bill requires AFIDA reporting for foreign persons holding more than one percent interest in American agricultural land. This effort seeks to protect American food security and prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control of agricultural supply chains.</p>

          <p>Mike Flanagan's "The Life of Chuck," based on a novella by Stephen King, presents a backward-structured triptych where the death of an ordinary accountant, Chuck Krantz, signals the end times for characters in his mind. The film explores the idea that even a seemingly dull person has a rich inner life, though the narrative structure and supernatural elements don't fully succeed. While the apocalyptic opening act is compelling, the film loses momentum as it progresses, despite strong performances and visual emphasis on memory and meaning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy suggests that language is inherently flawed and inadequate for conveying subtle truths or subjective experiences, leading to misunderstandings that lower well-being. He argued that words are merely crude models of the world, and therefore, we cannot fully comprehend the meaning of our lives through reading or talking about it. To find meaning without words, Wittgenstein recommends meditative contemplation and seeking understanding rather than exact answers. By engaging in silent reflection and disengaging from habitual left-brain dominance, individuals can transcend the limitations of language and gain ineffable rewards.</p>
