          <p>Storm Amy is poised to cause significant travel disruption across Scotland, with forecasted wind gusts up to 100 mph in exposed northern regions prompting two amber warnings. In anticipation of the severe weather, numerous ScotRail and ferry services have been cancelled, and several key bridges are closed to high-sided vehicles. A wider yellow warning for heavy rain and strong winds is also active across Scotland and Northern Ireland, leading to some early school closures. Officials are urging the public to verify travel plans and avoid non-essential journeys due to the dangerous conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the sentencing hearing for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, prosecutors argued for a harsh sentence, citing a pattern of "staggering" violence in addition to the charges of transporting individuals for prostitution. The defense team countered by emphasizing Combs' positive impact on the Black community and arguing that his actions lacked a financial motive, comparing him to a client rather than a pimp. Prosecutors pushed back, stating that Combs has not accepted responsibility for his actions and that the violence he inflicted was life-altering for the victims. The judge noted sentencing guidelines suggest five to seven years, while prosecutors have requested eleven.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has reached its third day, with the Senate scheduled to vote again on competing funding bills from both parties, though a resolution appears unlikely before the weekend. Republican leaders are insisting on a clean seven-week funding bill, refusing to negotiate on Democratic demands until the government is reopened. Democrats are holding firm on their proposal, which includes an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. With the political stalemate ongoing, President Trump has threatened mass layoffs of federal workers, while the Office of Management and Budget has frozen billions in funding for projects in Democratic-led areas.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri set the fastest time during Friday practice for the Singapore Grand Prix, while his teammate Lando Norris had a difficult session, finishing fifth. Norris's day was complicated by a pit lane collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, whose unsafe release resulted in a broken front wing for the McLaren and a 10,000 euro fine for Ferrari. The session was also disrupted by two red flags caused by separate crashes involving Mercedes' George Russell and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson. Despite the disruptions, several drivers expressed cautious optimism about their car's performance heading into the weekend.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, both Google and Apple have removed applications from their online stores that allowed users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Apple confirmed it removed 'ICEBlock' and similar apps after law enforcement raised concerns about safety risks to their officers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before paying a debt collector, it is crucial to first validate the debt to ensure it is legitimately yours and the collector has the legal right to pursue it. Under federal law, you can request written verification, which should include details about the original creditor and the amount owed. It is also important to explore all available options, such as negotiating a smaller lump-sum settlement or arranging a structured payment plan, especially since collectors often purchase debts for a fraction of their value. Always get any final agreement in writing before sending money to protect yourself from future claims or misunderstandings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a U.S.-brokered peace plan for Gaza, warning that "all hell" will break loose if the proposal is rejected. The 20-point plan, developed with Israel, calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian detainees. However, reports suggest that Hamas's military leadership in Gaza is likely to reject the deal, partly because it requires the swift release of all hostages, their primary bargaining tool. The plan also proposes a new international body, headed by Trump, to oversee a temporary Palestinian government in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is primarily caused by a dispute over enhanced premium tax credits that help 22 million Americans afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. These subsidies, which have nearly doubled ACA enrollment since 2021, are set to expire at the end of 2025, and Democrats are demanding their extension as a condition for funding the government. If the credits expire, average premiums could more than double in 2026, potentially forcing an estimated 4 million people to drop their coverage. Insurers are already proposing significant rate hikes in anticipation of the policy change.</p>

          <p>Internal government data shows that a federal law enforcement operation in Washington, D.C., initiated by the Trump administration to combat violent crime, has resulted in a high number of immigration-related arrests. Of the more than 3,500 arrests made since early August, nearly 1,400 were administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for civil immigration violations. While the operation also led to arrests for homicide, narcotics, and firearms offenses, the significant focus on immigration contrasts with the publicly stated goal of the surge.

The piece questions at what point military leaders will prioritize constitutional principles over loyalty to a president who is reshaping the armed forces into a partisan tool.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unlike most other Western democracies, the United States experiences frequent government shutdowns due to its unique political structure and budgetary rules. In parliamentary systems like the United Kingdom's, the executive branch controls spending proposals, and a failure to pass a budget can trigger new elections, creating high stakes that ensure passage. In contrast, the U.S. system grants Congress significant power over the purse, and the bicameral legislature with its filibuster rules makes passing a budget inherently more complex. A 1980 legal opinion also made U.S. shutdowns more severe by prohibiting government spending without congressional approval, a problem other nations avoid.</p>

          <p>In his first conference speech as leader of the UK's Green Party, Zack Polanski called for a new tax on the assets of the wealthiest 1% to fund public services and combat the rising cost of living. He argued this measure would end "rip-off Britain" and finance universal free childcare, special needs education, and rural bus routes. Polanski also strongly defended migrants and refugees, accusing the Labour Party of adopting policies similar to the right-wing Reform UK party. He positioned his party as a left-wing alternative focused on tackling social inequality as a core component of environmentalism.</p>

          <p>Fierce internal fighting has broken out in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, between Hamas security forces and armed members of the al-Mujaida clan, one of the region's largest families. Hamas stated its forces were conducting a raid to detain individuals accused of collaborating with Israel, but local accounts describe an assault that killed five family members. This prompted armed retaliation from the clan, leading to hours of clashes with reports of over 11 Hamas members killed. The incident highlights rising internal tensions and fears of civil conflict in Gaza, complicating the landscape as Hamas considers a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown has caused the suspension of the monthly jobs report, leaving policymakers, investors, and the public without critical data at a pivotal moment for the economy. Former officials from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirm that the data has already been collected and processed, but the Trump administration has not released it. This lack of information creates significant uncertainty as economists try to assess whether the economy is heading toward a recession. The delay means the Federal Reserve will have an incomplete picture when making crucial decisions about interest rates that affect households nationwide.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a large farm in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of around 13,000 pigs after the strike ignited a massive fire. Ukraine's state emergency service reported that the attack hit a farming enterprise, injuring one worker and destroying eight stalls that housed the animals. The strike appears to have been part of a broader Russian assault targeting Ukraine's natural gas infrastructure in the region. Ukrainian officials condemned the attack as a deliberate act of terror against civilian facilities with no military purpose, aimed at disrupting the upcoming heating season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's anti-vaccine rhetoric and policy changes are creating significant financial and operational challenges for pediatricians. Doctors purchase vaccines upfront at considerable cost, and inconsistent federal recommendations are making demand unpredictable and increasing financial risks. For example, new guidance on flu and COVID-19 shots has forced practices to order more expensive, harder-to-store versions and has created confusion about insurance coverage. The author contends that these pressures, combined with a pre-existing workforce shortage, may discourage pediatricians from offering certain vaccines and could ultimately harm public health by reducing access.</p>

The company will initially provide access to bitcoin and ether through a partnership with the startup Zerohash. This move positions OnePay to compete with other major financial apps like PayPal and Cash App, which already offer crypto services. As OnePay continues to build out its features toward becoming a financial "super app," integrating crypto could allow users to seamlessly convert digital assets to cash for in-store purchases or bill payments.</p>

          <p>Despite a historically low overall unemployment rate, the number of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment has risen to its highest level in over three years. As of August, 1.9 million people, or 26% of the unemployed, had been jobless for 27 weeks or longer, indicating a cooling job market where hiring has slowed significantly. Workers from various sectors, including technology professionals and recent graduates, report applying to hundreds of jobs with little success. Economists express concern that this trend could lead to more discouraged workers leaving the labor force entirely, posing a risk to the broader economy.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes a recent meeting where President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed hundreds of top U.S. military commanders. The author notes that while the event raised fears of an authoritarian move, it largely functioned as a campaign-style rally, with rhetoric against diversity initiatives and threats to deploy the military in U.S. cities. Although no immediate purge of generals occurred, the event is framed as a significant step in the administration's effort to politicize the armed forces. The article suggests the meeting was more about political posturing than substantive military directives, but still marks a worrying trend.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has warned that equity markets are likely due for a significant "drawdown" within the next one to two years, following a period of rapid growth fueled by the AI boom. He compared the current excitement around artificial intelligence to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, suggesting that market enthusiasm has run ahead of the technology's actual potential. Solomon anticipates that a great deal of capital deployed into the AI space will not generate returns, which will eventually trigger a market reset. He clarified that while he wouldn't use the word "bubble," a correction is likely. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the high-profile call for a boycott, analysts suggest it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Netflix's large subscriber base or financial performance.

The song's narrator acknowledges the pain and betrayal inherent in the pursuit of fame but ultimately declares she "wouldn't have it any other way." This article argues that the statement marks a significant shift for Swift, who is now openly owning her drive for success rather than portraying herself solely as a relatable everygirl. In an era of anti-feminist backlash, this unapologetic celebration of her career and hard work represents a powerful and self-assured stance.</p>
