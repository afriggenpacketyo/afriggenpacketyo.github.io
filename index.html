            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized the El Salvadorian government for obstructing his access to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national formerly residing in Maryland who was mistakenly deported. Van Hollen accused the government of staging photos to depict Abrego Garcia's situation favorably while he was detained in the CECOT prison. Abrego Garcia has since been moved to a different facility and Van Hollen emphasized the importance of upholding constitutional rights, stating that trampling on one person's rights endangers everyone's rights. The senator urged the Trump administration to present evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13 in court instead of relying on social media posts.</p>

Yan, who advises Beijing on cross-strait policy, cautioned against setting a timetable for reunification, suggesting it could be counterproductive.

            <p>Former Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava is reportedly expected to transfer to UCLA after a dispute with Tennessee over NIL negotiations. The UCLA coaching staff has informed its current quarterbacks of Iamaleava's expected arrival. Iamaleava, a five-star prospect from Long Beach, California, allegedly sought a $4 million NIL deal with Tennessee, which the program resisted. His departure from Tennessee has sparked debate about NIL's influence on college football, and his move to UCLA provides a significant upgrade to the Bruins' quarterback position.</p>

            <p>Tyler Glasnow, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, exited Sunday's game against the Texas Rangers after four innings due to lower leg cramping. Glasnow had been performing well but showed discomfort in the fifth inning, leading to his removal from the game. The Dodgers, already dealing with injuries to Blake Snell and Blake Treinen, are hoping Glasnow's issue is not serious. Manager Dave Roberts stated that doctors will assess Glasnow, but the team hopes it is a minor issue, similar to past cramping incidents.</p>
