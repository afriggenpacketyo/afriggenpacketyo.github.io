          <h2>Report Finds Baby Food Pouches Lack Key Nutrients and Mislead Parents</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation reveals that baby food pouches from major UK brands like Ella's Kitchen and Heinz often fail to meet the nutritional needs of infants. Laboratory testing found low levels of vitamin C and iron, with some pouches containing excessive amounts of sugar. Experts caution against using pouches as primary meal replacements, as they can lead to health problems and tooth decay due to high sugar content. The report also criticizes misleading marketing tactics, such as labeling pouches as having "no added sugar" despite containing high levels of free sugars from pureed fruit.</p>

          <p>Tess Segal, a Jewish student at the University of Florida, was arrested and later faced a three-year suspension for participating in a protest calling for the university to divest from weapons manufacturers and boycott Israeli academic institutions. Despite charges being dismissed, the university initially banned her from campus and proposed a one-year suspension, which was later increased by the dean of students. Segal argues that she did not resist arrest and was unable to hear dispersal orders due to the noise level, highlighting concerns about the university's restrictions on protest and the severity of the punishment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's protectionist trade policies, including tariffs, risk isolating the American auto industry and hindering its ability to innovate in key areas like electrification, digitization, and automation. While tariffs aim to shield U.S. automakers from foreign competition, they also threaten to cut them off from the global supply chains and technological advancements necessary to compete with countries like China, which is heavily investing in next-generation vehicles. The opinion piece argues that these policies could ultimately undermine America's industrial power and national security by leaving U.S. automakers unable to keep pace with global trends.</p>

          <p>Planned changes to school uniform policies in England are set to impact over four million pupils, with the government aiming to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students. This initiative, part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, seeks to alleviate financial burdens on families, potentially saving around Â£50 per child. However, school wear manufacturers caution that the changes might lead to increased costs due to the need to replace lower-quality generic garments more frequently. Some worry that stricter uniform policies will persist even after the new limits are implemented.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's decision to close its airspace to Indian airlines has forced carriers to reroute flights connecting India to Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East, resulting in longer and more expensive journeys. Some flights may require refueling stops or face cancellations, impacting Indian carriers' competitiveness against airlines that can still fly over Pakistan. The closure follows heightened tensions between the two countries after a deadly attack in Jammu and Kashmir. Despite potential challenges, analysts suggest that airfares may not significantly increase due to the airspace closure.</p>

          <h2>Border Official Defends Deportation of U.S. Citizen Child to Honduras</h2>

          <p>Former Trump administration border official Tom Homan defended the deportation of a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras alongside her deported mother, asserting that "due process" was followed. This statement contradicts a federal judge's suspicion that the government deported a U.S. citizen without meaningful process. Homan claims the mother chose to take the child with her, dismissing concerns about the child's rights and welfare. The incident is part of a broader pattern of rapid deportations under the Trump administration, raising legal and ethical questions.</p>

Communication equipment, apparel, and chemical products are identified as especially vulnerable due to their high share in U.S.-bound exports from China.
