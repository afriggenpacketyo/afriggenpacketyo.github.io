          <p>An astronomical event, a total lunar eclipse, resulted in a "Blood Moon" visible to observers across Asia, parts of Europe, and Africa on Sunday night. This phenomenon occurs when the Earth aligns between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that makes the moon appear red. The reddish color is caused by sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, a process that filters out shorter blue wavelengths and allows longer red wavelengths to reach the moon. The Americas were not positioned to view this particular celestial event.</p>

Solicitor Christopher Walker stated that his clients want "no stone unturned" in establishing the facts and believe the attack was preventable. The inquiry will examine the perpetrator's history, his interactions with various agencies, and any missed opportunities for intervention. The families are committed to ensuring the legacies of their children lead to positive change and prevent similar events from happening in the future.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's threats of federal intervention and increased immigration enforcement, Chicago church leaders are urging their communities to remain calm but prepared. During services, pastors like Rev. Marshall Hatch advised congregants to carry identification, stay in communication with family, and resist what they term authoritarian tactics. The potential deployment of the National Guard has heightened tensions in Black and Latino communities, where trust in law enforcement is already low. Community leaders are advocating for more resources to address the root causes of violence rather than a military-style presence.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica is on the verge of declaring a fiscal emergency, citing significant budgetary challenges and massive legal settlements. A primary factor is the more than $229 million paid to victims of sexual assault by a former city police dispatcher, with over 180 additional claims still pending. The city has not restored services to pre-pandemic levels after major budget cuts and faces a projected deficit for the upcoming fiscal year. Council members have expressed grave concerns, with one fearing the city is "careening towards bankruptcy" without bold corrective action.</p>

          <p>President Trump has walked back a social media post that suggested he was threatening "war" on Chicago, stating he intends to "clean up" American cities instead. The original post, which referenced the film "Apocalypse Now," drew sharp criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who called the rhetoric authoritarian. Trump has been suggesting a deployment of National Guard troops to cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans to combat crime and assist with deportations, despite objections from local leaders and recent data showing declining crime rates. This plan faces legal challenges, with a recent ruling deeming a similar deployment in Los Angeles illegal.</p>

          <p>Superchief Gallery, an independent art space in downtown Los Angeles, may be forced to close due to financial struggles, reflecting a broader trend of business closures in the area. Co-founder Bill Dunleavy cited a drop in sponsorships and art sales as the primary reasons for the gallery's difficulties, a situation exacerbated by the post-pandemic economic environment. While some officials attribute the closures to the normal churn of business, Superchief's potential demise highlights the challenges facing niche cultural venues. The gallery has launched a crowdfunding campaign in a last-ditch effort to cover its significant monthly expenses and remain open.</p>

The initial rule change, announced by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, would make vaccinations for diseases like chickenpox and hepatitis B voluntary for schoolchildren. However, mandates for other diseases, including polio and measles, will remain in place unless altered by future legislation. The move has drawn sharp criticism from medical experts and public health officials, who warn that it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>

At their fall convention, party members expressed concerns that the measure is a Democratic power grab designed to counter gerrymandering in other states, potentially costing the GOP five House seats. The issue has brought together different factions within the party, who are framing the campaign as a fight for survival and a check on the governor's power.

He points to the recent weak jobs report as an example where the president's policies, such as shrinking government departments and implementing tariffs, may be negatively impacting job growth. Cramer suggests that while Trump's actions generate significant media attention, they don't necessarily translate into positive market movements or job creation in key sectors. He concludes that focusing on company fundamentals through conference calls is more profitable than reacting to the president's "sound and fury." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century in a one-day international match against South Africa, a significant milestone for the highly-touted 21-year-old. The achievement may intensify the debate around his role in the national team, particularly ahead of the upcoming Ashes Test series in Australia. Despite his undeniable talent and success in shorter formats, Bethell's lack of a century had been a talking point. While some commentators believe he needs more experience in long-form, red-ball cricket, his recent performance and aggressive style could make him a compelling, if risky, choice for the Test squad.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers ended a frustrating five-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles, thanks to a powerful offensive display from Shohei Ohtani. Ohtani hit two home runs, including a leadoff shot, to give the team an early lead that they successfully defended. The win was a crucial morale boost for the Dodgers, coming after a particularly painful walk-off loss the previous night where a no-hitter was broken up in the ninth inning. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw also contributed a strong start, helping the team right its course and secure a much-needed win to end a difficult road trip.</p>

          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has indicated he wants the team to incorporate more direct tactics, including long throw-ins and long balls from the goalkeeper, ahead of the next World Cup. This approach would be a shift from the team's recent style, which has featured a lower percentage of long balls compared to previous tournaments. Tuchel acknowledged the limited training time with the national squad but emphasized that such tactical details will be important for success at the World Cup. He stated that these patterns, along with crosses, are becoming relevant again in modern football.</p>

          <p>A drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen successfully breached Israeli air defenses and struck the Ramon International Airport near Eilat in southern Israel. The impact on the passenger terminal caused damage, including shattered windows, and resulted in one person being treated for light shrapnel wounds. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the "qualitative military operation" and warned that other sensitive targets were under fire. This attack represents an escalation in the conflict, occurring days after an Israeli strike in Yemen killed a high-ranking Houthi official, and marks a rare instance of a Houthi attack causing damage to a significant Israeli target.</p>

His comments come amid ongoing pressure from the president on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates.

The concert is part of the band's first tour in over 15 years, following a long and acrimonious split between founding brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher. The tour has been noted for the cathartic, communal experience it provides for attendees, with tens of thousands singing along to classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger." The show itself was musically powerful but featured minimal stagecraft, emphasizing the shared experience between the band and its devoted audience.</p>

          <p>The Formula 1 title fight between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri remained amicable during the Italian Grand Prix, even after a controversial team decision. When a pit stop issue caused Piastri to emerge ahead of Norris, who had been leading, the team instructed Piastri to let his teammate back past to restore the original order. Team Principal Andrea Stella defended the decision as consistent with McLaren's principles of fairness, as the position change was due to a team error. The drivers' professional handling of the situation underscores the positive team culture that has propelled McLaren to its current dominant position.</p>

President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the "deliberate crime," stating it comes at a time when diplomacy could have begun.

          <p>Republican Senator Roger Marshall, a former OB-GYN, defended Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership at the CDC, stating he was chosen by President Trump to be a "disrupter" and increase transparency. In an interview, Marshall argued that not every child needs every vaccine, such as the Hepatitis B shot for newborns in certain low-risk situations, and advocated for empowering parents and doctors to make individual decisions. He attributed public distrust in the CDC to its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic under a previous administration. Marshall differentiated between his support for established vaccines like MMR and his belief in a more selective, less one-size-fits-all approach to immunization schedules.</p>
