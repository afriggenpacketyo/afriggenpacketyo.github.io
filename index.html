          <p>An extensive manhunt is underway for the suspect who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Authorities have released images of a "person of interest" and security footage showing the suspect's movements, including fleeing from a rooftop after firing a single shot. A high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon has been recovered, and the FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information. Officials believe it was a targeted attack and have stated their intent to seek the death penalty once a suspect is apprehended.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix saw its shares surge by over 7%, reaching their highest point since 2000, following the announcement of its successful development of HBM4 high-bandwidth memory. This advanced memory is considered crucial for artificial intelligence applications, driving significant investor optimism. The news contributed to a broader rally in Asian markets, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index also rising, partly due to reports of Alibaba and Baidu deploying their own in-house AI chips. The positive market sentiment is also fueled by expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Catastrophic monsoon floods in Pakistan have led to the evacuation of more than two million people in Punjab province and another 150,000 in Sindh province. The nationwide death toll since late June has surpassed 900, with vast areas of farmland and numerous homes destroyed. In response to the crisis, which critics attribute to both climate change and inadequate government disaster mitigation, Pakistani authorities have declared a climate emergency. The UN has allocated $5 million for the flood response, and the U.S. has deployed disaster personnel to assist with relief efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Audit Office reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has almost doubled in five years, with councils spending an average of £318,400 per child annually. Despite the high expenditure, the report concludes the system does not provide value for money, citing a dysfunctional, profit-driven market where many children receive inappropriate care. The rising costs are attributed to a record number of children in care and the complexity of their needs. The Department for Education acknowledged systemic failures and stated it is pursuing major reforms.</p>

The Aces dominated the game, setting a WNBA regular-season record with 22 three-pointers, and building a significant lead by halftime. Aces star A’ja Wilson delivered a powerful performance with 23 points and 19 rebounds, overwhelming the short-handed Sparks.

          <p>The sacking of Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US is the lead story in most of Friday's British newspapers, raising questions about Prime Minister Keir Starmer's judgment. Several papers report that security services may have raised red flags about Mandelson's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein during the vetting process, a claim Downing Street denies. Conservative critics accuse the Prime Minister of appointing an unfit candidate, while allies of Lord Mandelson state he was transparent about the relationship. The focus now shifts to potential replacements for the high-profile diplomatic post in Washington.</p>

A significant part of this partnership includes Chinese involvement in constructing a 220km high-speed railway line through the corridor, a project expected to take five more years to complete.

However, opponents argue the proposed law is flawed and requires further scrutiny, with one peer tabling an amendment to gather more evidence before a full debate.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States' efforts to reshore manufacturing and implement an industrial policy are fundamentally undermined by its stringent anti-immigration and labor crackdown. The recent raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia, where hundreds of South Korean technicians were detained, is presented as a prime example of this contradiction. The author contends that America's post-industrial economy lacks the necessary skilled workforce for these advanced manufacturing roles. This conflict in policy not only creates friction with key allies like South Korea but also highlights the practical challenges of reindustrialization without accommodating foreign technical expertise.</p>

          <p>An attempt to honor the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk with a moment of silence on the House floor quickly descended into a partisan shouting match. The brief moment of bipartisanship ended when a request for prayer from Rep. Lauren Boebert was met with objections from Democrats. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna then accused Democrats of having "caused this" through their rhetoric, leading to further commotion and calls for order from the Speaker. The incident highlighted the profound partisan tensions on Capitol Hill following the assassination, even as lawmakers from both parties publicly condemned the political violence.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in England are raising concerns that an increasing number of children are starting reception year without fundamental skills, such as being toilet-trained or able to speak in full sentences. A survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers revealed that a third have at least five children in their class needing help with toileting, while nine in ten have seen a decline in speech and language abilities. Experts attribute the decline partly to social isolation and increased screen time. This trend places additional burdens on schools, which are now tasked with addressing these developmental gaps.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 20:19:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help parents cope with fussy eating, a common developmental phase in children, a child nutritionist suggests several strategies to make mealtimes less stressful. Key recommendations include allowing children autonomy by letting them choose whether to eat, avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad," and focusing on making the dinner table an enjoyable place. It is also important to be mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite and to involve them in food preparation to foster familiarity. These approaches aim to build a positive relationship with food rather than turning meals into a battle.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, members of the U.S. Congress are postponing or moving outdoor public events indoors due to heightened security concerns. Lawmakers from both parties, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ruben Gallego, have canceled scheduled rallies and town halls out of an abundance of caution. The shooting, which involved a gunman firing from a rooftop, has drawn parallels to the 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump, prompting a re-evaluation of security protocols for public appearances. The event has underscored a growing anxiety on Capitol Hill regarding the threat of political violence.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," marks a shift from the subdued introspection of his previous two records, aiming to create joy and explore diverse cultures. The album incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern musical elements, featuring instruments like the sitar and collaborations with Indian superstar Arjit Singh. While some tracks are praised for their adventurous sound, the review notes that much of the album retreats to Sheeran's familiar style of frictionless pop and sentimental ballads. The record is seen as a competent, enjoyable effort for his fans but also a missed opportunity to more fully embrace its global influences.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. military strike on a speedboat off the coast of Venezuela reportedly occurred after the vessel had turned around and was heading back to shore, according to sources familiar with a congressional briefing. The Trump administration has justified the strike, which killed 11 people described as gang members, as an act of self-defense against drug traffickers. However, the new details are raising questions among lawmakers about the legality and rationale of using military force for law enforcement purposes. Several Democratic senators have contested the legal justification, arguing Congress has not authorized such military action.</p>

Despite deep political disagreements, figures from across the spectrum have condemned the violence, echoing Kirk's own stated belief that dialogue is essential to prevent conflict.

          <p>Denmark has significantly improved its cancer survival rates over the past 25 years, transforming from one of Europe's poorer performers into a model for others, including the UK's National Health Service. The Danish strategy involved major investments in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting strict national targets for diagnosis and treatment, and giving patients the right to seek care elsewhere if those targets are not met. This long-term, politically unified approach, combined with a focus on the patient experience, has yielded impressive results that UK policymakers are now studying closely for potential implementation.</p>

People report being turned away by pharmacists, facing supply shortages, and navigating confusing rules about prescriptions and self-attestation.

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that husbands now have the right to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The court found that the previous legislation, which only permitted women to change their names, was discriminatory on the basis of gender and a "colonial import." The ruling noted that in many traditional African cultures, women retained their birth names. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the court's decision, which has sparked a mix of progressive praise and traditionalist criticism.</p>
