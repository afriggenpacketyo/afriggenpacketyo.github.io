          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist critiques President Trump's decision to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles, viewing it as an unnecessary escalation and a political maneuver. The author argues that Trump is exploiting the issue of undocumented immigration to score political points and stoke division, particularly regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The piece highlights the economic contributions of immigrants, regardless of their legal status, and defends Los Angeles against what the columnist perceives as unwarranted federal intervention. The article suggests that the deployment is less about maintaining law and order and more about creating a spectacle to further Trump's political agenda.</p>

          <p>Over 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies, expressing concerns about the politicization of research, interruptions to global collaboration, and budget cuts.

NIH scientists claim that their concerns have been repeatedly raised internally without success, prompting them to speak out publicly.

The report also looked at shared parental leave, which was introduced in 2014 and allows parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay after the birth or adoption of a child.</p>

The company has a strong investment-grade balance sheet and estimates that inflation escalation clauses within its existing power purchase agreements (PPAs) will power 2% to 3% annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share. The company expects to grow its earnings per share at a rate of more than 10% annually for the next several years. Given the lackluster returns of many high-yielding dividend stocks, investors seeking market-crushing returns will probably overlook Brookfield Renewable because of its more than 5% yield (not investment advice).</p>
