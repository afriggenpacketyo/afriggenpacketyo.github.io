        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, is actively promoting an "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union, aiming to bolster public finances before the upcoming autumn Budget. She argues that a time-limited exchange scheme for young workers, allowing 18 to 30-year-olds to stay for two years without permanent residency, would significantly benefit the economy, foster growth, and support businesses. Reeves has also called for the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) to integrate the potential economic upsides of such a scheme into its forecasts, hoping this will mitigate the necessity for future spending cuts or tax hikes. The proposal faces criticism from political rivals who view it as a partial reintroduction of freedom of movement, a key issue post-Brexit.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly intensified into a formidable Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, posing a potential threat to the southeastern U.S. coast. As of Friday evening, it was situated approximately 390 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, advancing westward with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph, though no immediate U.S. watches or warnings were in effect. This marks Humberto as the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Gabrielle. Additionally, forecasters are closely monitoring a second system over the northeast Caribbean, which is projected to become a tropical depression and then a hurricane by early next week, bringing significant rainfall to Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of State has announced the revocation of the visa belonging to left-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro, attributing the action to his "reckless and incendiary actions." This development follows Petro's controversial remarks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he publicly urged U.S. soldiers to "disobey the orders of Trump" and condemned the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug-trafficking Venezuelan boats. Petro, a vocal critic of U.S. policies including Israel's military campaign in Gaza, has previously clashed with the administration over the treatment of Colombian deportees, leading to a temporary standoff involving blocked military planes and reciprocal tariffs. The visa revocation signifies a significant escalation in diplomatic tensions between the two nations.</p>

The files include a December 2014 entry inquiring about Musk's planned visit to Epstein's private island, and a May 2000 flight manifest listing Prince Andrew as a passenger alongside Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted of sex trafficking. While both Musk and Prince Andrew have previously denied any involvement or knowledge of Epstein's illicit activities, these partial records also feature other notable figures like internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon. The ongoing release of these documents continues to intensify public and legal scrutiny into the extent of Epstein's network among powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>DNA evidence has definitively linked Robert Eugene Brashers, who died by suicide in 1999, to the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders of four teenage girls, cracking a cold case that spanned over three decades. Brashers, a convicted attempted murderer and suspected serial predator, was identified through new forensic analysis, providing a crucial breakthrough in the long-unsolved crime. This development comes after two other individuals were wrongly convicted and later exonerated, highlighting the complexities of the original investigation. The "Yogurt Shop Murders," involving the binding, gagging, shooting, and burning of the victims, stands as one of Austin's most violent and enduring mysteries, with police set to release further details on the new evidence.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly terminated the employment of as many as 20 agents who kneeled during a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., in the aftermath of George Floyd's death in 2020. Many of these agents, primarily from the FBI's Washington Field Office, were photographed in early June 2020, with sources suggesting their actions were a de-escalation strategy when confronted by a large crowd of protesters, rather than a political statement. The FBI Agents Association has strongly condemned these firings, which include military veterans, describing them as a "dangerous new pattern of actions" by FBI Director Kash Patel. The association argues that such decisions undermine valuable expertise, damage trust within the Bureau, and hinder recruitment and retention, ultimately posing a risk to national security.</p>

          <p>A looming federal government shutdown in the U.S. threatens to furlough hundreds of thousands of federal employees and delay critical economic data, including the closely watched Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report. With only four days remaining for Congress to agree on a stopgap funding bill, Republican and Democratic leaders are at an impasse, primarily over the inclusion of health-care protections. President Trump has intensified the political brinksmanship by canceling meetings and issuing warnings to federal agencies to prepare for mass firings. Such a shutdown would directly affect non-essential government programs and services, potentially closing national parks, curtailing veterans' services, and postponing immigration hearings, while essential functions like national security would continue.

          <p>Shane Tamura, the gunman responsible for July's deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting that killed four people, has been diagnosed with low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), according to the New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Tamura, a 27-year-old former high school football player, left notes referencing CTE and requesting his brain be studied, believing the NFL knowingly concealed brain injury dangers. While the medical examiner notes that the physical and mental manifestations of CTE are still under study, experts like Chris Nowinski emphasize that 12 years of football exposure puts individuals at risk for brain changes affecting judgment and behavior. This finding serves as a sobering reminder of the potential long-term consequences of head trauma in athletes.</p>

Bondi stated that DOJ agents would be deployed to safeguard federal personnel and property, and to immediately arrest individuals committing federal crimes.

While a full collision is deemed unlikely by CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan, any interaction could subtly alter their forecasted paths. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the season, and forecasters are also tracking a second system near it, expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda, which could bring storm surge, wind, and rain to the Bahamas and parts of the southeastern United States.</p>

This emergency order is not a final determination, as the case continues in lower courts. The three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Kagan arguing that the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress authority over federal spending.

          <p>Researchers have reported a breakthrough in Huntington's disease treatment, with a new gene therapy demonstrating a 75% slowdown in disease progression, offering "real hope" where none existed. For families like Gemma Botting's, whose husband Matt was diagnosed in 2011, this news is profoundly impactful, offering the prospect of growing old together. The condition, which combines elements of dementia, Parkinson's, and MND, has historically been fatal with no treatment options. While the therapy is still in early stages and faces hurdles like licensing and affordability for public healthcare, its potential implications extend to other neurodegenerative diseases, providing immense optimism for the Huntington's community.</p>

          <p>Three women—Ashleigh Brown, Cynthia Raygoza, and Sandra Carmona Samane—have been indicted on charges of disclosing a federal agent's personal information and conspiracy, for allegedly "doxing" an ICE agent in Los Angeles. The indictment claims the women followed an ICE agent from a federal building to their Baldwin Park residence, live-streamed the incident, and shouted identifying phrases like "ICE lives on your street." The U.S. Attorney's office stressed that such actions against federal agents or employees will result in prosecution and prison time. This indictment marks a significant legal step amidst heightened tensions and protests against the Trump administration's deportation efforts, reflecting federal law enforcement's growing concerns over the safety and privacy of its personnel.</p>

          <p>Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, Iowa's largest school district, has been arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Roberts, a Guyanese citizen, is accused of overstaying his student visa, which expired in 2020, and faces a separate firearms offense. ICE stated he was found with a loaded handgun, cash, and a hunting knife, and initially fled from police in a school district vehicle. The arrest comes amid a broader U.S. crackdown on immigration, raising questions about how he was hired without proper authorization and his prior weapons charge, as local officials express shock and seek more information.</p>

          <p>Sources reveal that one of the two counts in former FBI Director James Comey's indictment focuses on his alleged role in sharing information about an FBI investigation related to Hillary Clinton.

"PERSON 3" in the indictment is identified as Daniel Richman, Comey's close friend and former personal lawyer, who served as an unpaid "Special Government Employee" at the FBI.

          <p>The cause and manner of death for Travis Decker, the man accused of killing his three young daughters in Washington state, may never be known, according to the Chelan County Coroner. Decker, a former Army soldier with survival skills, was the sole suspect in the May murders of 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn, and 5-year-old Olivia, whose bodies were found bound and suffocated at a campsite. His remains, identified through DNA testing a week prior, were minimal skeletal fragments, making an autopsy impossible. The inability to determine the exact circumstances of his death leaves a tragic element of uncertainty in this horrific case.</p>

          <p>King Charles's long-held urban planning philosophies, once controversial, are now influencing the next wave of new towns expected to be announced in England. The housing ministry's head of placemaking revealed plans for 12 new towns that align with the King's traditional approach, emphasizing walkability, environmental friendliness, and "gentle density" over high-rise buildings. TV architect George Clarke notes a shift in mainstream architectural thought, with younger architects now more empathetic to local context and public preferences, moving away from "ego-driven" modern designs. This article suggests a significant cultural and policy embrace of more traditional, community-focused urban development principles in the UK.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a new round of tariffs, effective October 1, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, 30% on upholstered furniture, 50% on kitchen cabinets, and 30% on heavy trucks. The pharmaceutical tariff exempts companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., potentially softening the impact on drug prices. Trump justified these measures by claiming foreign manufacturers were "flooding" the U.S. market and to protect domestic industries for "National Security and other reasons." However, despite earlier predictions, recent economic data indicates these broad tariffs are now contributing to rising inflation, and there's no evidence of increased factory jobs or manufacturing facility construction.

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart, whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has captivated public imagination for decades. Trump noted Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the world and the enduring mystery surrounding her vanishing. While the widely accepted theory is that she ran out of fuel and crashed, various unproven theories persist, including one about her being a spy captured by the Japanese. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had previously urged declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of her being spotted on Saipan.

          <p>Southern California has witnessed thousands of lightning strikes over the past two days, with more than 2,000 recorded from the Channel Islands to the Central Coast, mostly occurring offshore. This intense atmospheric activity is linked to a low-pressure area that has become detached from the jet stream, trapping significant moisture. The Bay Area additionally reported over 13,000 lightning strikes. Forecasters anticipate a weak low-pressure system will move across Southern California starting Saturday, bringing with it thunderstorms, strong winds, and isolated showers, particularly affecting interior valleys and mountains.
