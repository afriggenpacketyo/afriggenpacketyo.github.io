          <p>A 17-year-old Texas teen, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for murdering his twin sister, Meghan, by stabbing her in the neck as she slept. He immediately called 911, claiming he thought he was dreaming and has since maintained he was sleepwalking, a defense supported by a family history of the condition. A neurologist who conducted sleep studies on Benjamin believes he unintentionally killed his sister during a slow-wave sleep episode. Prosecutors, however, are proceeding with the murder charge, questioning his account and pointing to evidence like the nature of the wounds.</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement deployed tear gas and pepper balls against demonstrators protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) outside a processing center in Broadview, Illinois. The confrontation occurred as protesters attempted to block vehicles from leaving the facility, which is being used for an enforcement operation called "Midway Blitz." An ICE spokesperson confirmed two arrests, one involving a firearm, amid ongoing tensions following similar violent clashes last week. The protests are in opposition to the transfer of ICE detainees to facilities in other states.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 13:43:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for home equity loans have decreased slightly, making them a more affordable option for homeowners. For a $150,000 loan, a 10-year term now averages around $1,847 per month, while a 15-year term is about $1,452, representing a modest saving compared to earlier in the year. While the reduction is not dramatic, it provides some relief for borrowers looking to tap into their home's equity. This article analyzes the specific cost changes and potential long-term savings for homeowners considering this type of loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue, though it missed some Wall Street expectations, causing a slight dip in its stock price. Key metrics like same-store sales growth and membership renewal rates were slightly below forecasts, leading to some investor concern. However, analysts remain largely optimistic, highlighting the company's consistent execution, strong membership fee growth, and its role as an "inflation-fighter." Many firms adjusted their price targets downward but maintained "buy" ratings, viewing the company as a core holding with defensive growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return over 28,000 fossils, including parts of the historic "Java Man" collection, to Indonesia. These fossils, discovered in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois on the island of Java, are among the first known remains of Homo erectus and are crucial for research into human evolution. The decision follows a recommendation from the Dutch Independent Colonial Collections Committee, which concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local population. This repatriation is part of a broader effort by the Netherlands to return culturally significant items obtained during its colonial era.</p>

          <p>Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales, has admitted to accepting bribes in exchange for making pro-Russian statements while he was a Member of the European Parliament. Gill pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery, acknowledging he received money from Oleg Voloshyn, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician, to deliver speeches and make statements favorable to Russian interests between 2018 and 2019. The activities were uncovered through WhatsApp messages seized by counter-terrorism detectives. Gill is expected to receive a substantial prison sentence when he is sentenced in November.</p>

However, the processing of these applications has slowed significantly, with only 5,600 processed in August.

The medical examiner's office found unambiguous evidence of low-stage CTE in his brain tissue. The finding adds a significant layer to the tragic event, although the office did not state whether CTE played a direct role in his actions.</p>

          <p>European football's governing body, UEFA, is facing increasing calls to suspend Israel from international competitions due to the conflict in Gaza and a UN finding of genocide. Several national federations are reportedly pushing for a vote on the matter, with the Turkish FA publicly demanding a ban. The decision rests with UEFA's 20-member executive committee, which requires a simple majority to pass such a measure. The situation is complicated by potential political divisions, including strong opposition from the U.S., which could create a conflict with FIFA if a ban were enacted by UEFA.</p>

          <p>Moldova's Central Electoral Commission has barred the pro-Russia party Heart of Moldova from participating in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The decision follows a court ruling that limited the party's activities amid an investigation into illegal financing and voter bribery. Officials in the pro-European nation have warned that Russia is attempting to sway the election's outcome, an accusation Moscow denies. The party's leader, Irina Vlah, was also recently sanctioned by several EU member states for allegedly assisting with Russian interference. The election is seen as a critical test for Moldova, an EU candidate since 2022.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its "Gold Card" program, offering U.S. residency for a $1 million fee, a significant price cut from the initially proposed $5 million. Immigration attorneys report that the new price point has generated a surge in demand from wealthy individuals globally, making it one of the most competitive "golden visa" programs available. The program, which promises approvals in "record time," aims to issue 80,000 cards and raise substantial federal revenue. However, it faces potential legal challenges as it uses workarounds of existing immigration law set by Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is making immigration a central focus of his government's agenda, a strategic shift largely seen as a response to the rising popularity of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. In a recent speech, Starmer framed the political landscape as a "battle for the soul of this country" and criticized past center-left parties for being "squeamish" about border control. His proposal for a mandatory digital ID to curb illegal working is the cornerstone of this new focus. This analysis suggests the move is designed to create a clear dividing line with political rivals and address public concerns.</p>

Senator Chris Murphy described the situation as a "constitutional crisis," while others pointed to the recent replacement of a U.S. Attorney as a move to ensure charges would be filed. Democrats argue the indictment, for false statements and obstruction, is a "disgraceful attack on the rule of law" with no basis in fact. In contrast, most Republicans have reacted more cautiously, stating that Comey should be held accountable if he lied to Congress.</p>

The timing is notable, as the charges were filed by a newly appointed U.S. Attorney after her predecessor reportedly refused to pursue similar cases.
