          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. The price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, with which Bitcoin typically correlates. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt added to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, said that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval ratings are slightly underwater despite gains in border security and immigration, key issues in his successful 2024 campaign. While Trump's approval on border security stands at 56% and immigration at 50% in a recent poll, his overall approval ratings remain negative. Analysts suggest that the economy and inflation are overshadowing the positive impact of his border policies. Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war, triggering a sell-off in financial markets and increasing recession concerns.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing within the Christian right about whether empathy is a sin, with some arguing that it's a tool used by progressives to manipulate Christians. This idea, initially articulated by pastor Joe Rigney, has gained traction among conservative figures and online reactionaries, influencing mainstream discourse. Critics argue this viewpoint often targets empathy for marginalized communities and liberal perspectives. Despite pushback from religious leaders, the conversation has entered mainstream media, sparking discussions about the role of empathy in society.</p>

          <p>Republicans are facing backlash for trying to revoke California's ability to set its own stricter emissions standards for vehicles. Democrats are calling it a "nuclear" option and an unprecedented use of the Congressional Review Act. California has been a leader in enacting environmental standards for cars and trucks, and revoking those waivers would lead to an increase in pollution. Governor Gavin Newsom called the battle a nail in the coffin for the American car industry.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," critical to advancing President Donald Trump's tax and immigration agenda, by a single vote. The bill includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending, fulfilling many of Trump's campaign promises. The successful vote sends the reconciliation bill to the Senate, where revisions are expected. The bill's passage followed weeks of internal GOP wrangling and a meeting between Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson.</p>

Holdouts have been critical of the bill over concerns that it will add to the national deficit.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. There was also a large drop in the number of dependents accompanying people arriving in the UK on work and study visas, the ONS said.</p>

A federal judge held a contentious hearing about migrants reportedly heading to South Sudan and declared that the administration had violated a previous order.
