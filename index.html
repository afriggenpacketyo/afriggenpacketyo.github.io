        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant downturn after the House Republicans approved a tax bill that eliminates essential clean energy credits. Residential solar installer Sunrun saw a massive drop, and companies like Enphase and SolarEdge also suffered substantial losses. The bill's termination of tax credits for clean energy facilities commencing construction shortly after enactment or entering service after 2028 is a major concern. While First Solar was less affected due to its manufacturing tax credit remaining largely intact, Jefferies analysts anticipate Senate revisions to the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a tense meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Donald Trump made several contested claims regarding the killings of white farmers in South Africa. Trump presented a video purportedly showing burial sites of murdered white farmers, but BBC Verify found the footage was from a protest memorial for a murdered farming couple. Trump also played footage of political rallies where participants sang "Kill the Boer," an anti-apartheid song, claiming those leading the singing were "officials". The BBC article clarified that one leader was Julius Malema, who has never held an official government position, and another was former President Jacob Zuma, who is no longer in office. Ramaphosa emphasized that the EFF, led by Malema, is a small minority party.</p>

          <p>The article discusses whether seniors should invest in gold given its current high price. While gold is known as a safe haven asset, its soaring price presents a tricky choice. Investing in gold can protect a portfolio but won't generate income like dividends or interest. Experts recommend a small allocation, typically 4% to 9%, to act as a stabilizer during inflationary periods or market stress.

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), increasing the cap to $40,000. The increased SALT cap phases out over $500,000 and goes into effect in 2025, increasing annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could reduce the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could still face pushback in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The recent pause on tariffs on Chinese goods has led to a boost in orders from Asia, but it may not be enough to eliminate the risk of retail shortages. Retailers report that even with reduced tariffs, import taxes remain too high to complete full orders, with some companies paying over 30% due to the "stacking of existing tariffs." A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that a majority of respondents are not seeing a restart in holiday orders, leading to concerns about lower inventory and potentially higher prices for consumers.

While the US has paused higher tariffs until July, a base levy remains in place. Nike's finance chief previously noted uncertainty in the operating environment, including tariffs.</p>
