          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four individuals in connection with disruptive cyber-attacks on retailers M&S and The Co-op. The suspects, aged 17 to 20, face charges including blackmail and organized crime involvement. These hacks, which began in mid-April, caused significant operational chaos and financial damage, with M&S estimating a £300 million loss in profits. The arrests mark a major development in the investigation into the attacks that also targeted luxury retailer Harrods.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has condemned US trade practices as "immoral," contrasting them with Beijing's own policies while engaging with Southeast Asian nations. He specifically criticized a high US tariff on Bangladesh, positioning China as a more reliable and stable partner for ASEAN countries. Wang urged the regional bloc to protect free trade and maintain stability in the face of what he described as disruptive American economic measures. This rhetoric aims to strengthen China's influence and economic ties within the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its stock jump over 10% after it reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and reported third-quarter guidance that exceeded Wall Street expectations. Although the airline had previously cut its forecast due to lower demand, CEO Ed Bastian noted that bookings have since stabilized. The company's strong performance was driven by growth in premium seat sales and its partnership with American Express, highlighting a reliance on higher-spending travelers. The positive report has also boosted the shares of other airlines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the midst of catastrophic flooding in Texas' Hill Country, Kerr County officials waited 90 minutes to issue a CodeRED emergency alert after a firefighter first requested it, according to dispatch audio. The initial request was made at 4:22 a.m. as the Guadalupe River began to surge, but the first alert wasn't sent until after 6:00 a.m. This significant delay is under scrutiny as search and rescue efforts continue for the victims of the flood, which has claimed over 100 lives. Officials have deferred questions about the response, promising a later review.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has vowed to impose matching tariffs on US goods if President Trump follows through on a threat to levy a 50% tax on Brazilian imports. Trump's threat was unusually linked to Brazil's prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, whom Trump defended. President Lula asserted Brazil's sovereignty and challenged Trump's claim of a US trade deficit, citing data showing a US surplus. This escalating trade dispute highlights the increasingly political nature of international economic relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is raising concerns among economists about potential price hikes for a wide range of consumer goods. Copper is essential for electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, and electric vehicles, meaning the tariff could have broad inflationary effects. While the administration argues the tariff will bolster the domestic copper industry, experts warn it could increase costs for home repairs, infrastructure maintenance, and electronics. The U.S. currently imports a significant portion of its copper from countries like Chile and Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent back-to-back floods in New Mexico and Texas highlight the critical difference that preparedness can make in disaster outcomes. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where floods killed three people, officials and residents were ready due to awareness of risks from previous wildfire "burn scars." In contrast, the flash flood in Texas caught officials by surprise, leading to a much higher death toll of at least 120 people. Experts note that recent experience with a disaster often informs a community's response, making them more likely to heed warnings and evacuate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New analysis reveals that FEMA's flood maps significantly underestimated the risk for many structures in Kerr County, Texas, the site of the recent deadly floods. According to data from climate risk modeler First Street, at least 17 structures at Camp Mystic, where many campers died, were in the flood path, compared to FEMA's assessment. The discrepancy stems from FEMA's reliance on historical river data rather than modeling for intense rainfall events, a critical flaw as climate change increases such storms. This highlights a systemic issue in how the U.S. assesses and prepares for flood dangers.</p>

Now, a new team is reviewing training at elite units and plans a new study on women in combat, seeking evidence of lowered standards.

In letters to tech companies, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed them to ignore a law banning TikTok, arguing the president can exempt firms from legislation that interferes with his foreign policy duties. Scholars argue this represents a dangerous assertion of presidential power, effectively allowing the president to grant proactive pardons for lawbreaking.

          <p>Double Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that her right to a fair hearing was violated by a Swiss court in 2023. The case centers on World Athletics regulations that require athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) to lower their natural testosterone levels to compete. While the ruling does not immediately overturn the athletic regulations, it finds that the Swiss court's review process was flawed. The decision keeps Semenya's long legal battle alive and renews scrutiny on controversial sex eligibility rules in sports.</p>

          <h2>Texas Floods Highlight Critical Need for Widespread Flood Insurance Coverage</h2>

          <p>The catastrophic floods in Texas, which caused billions in damages, are a stark reminder of the importance of flood insurance, which is not included in standard homeowners policies. In Kerr County, one of the hardest-hit areas, only about 2.5% of homeowners had flood coverage. Experts stress that flooding is a nationwide risk, with 99% of U.S. counties having experienced a flood event in the last 20 years. Many homeowners mistakenly believe they are not at risk, yet about 40% of claims filed with the National Flood Insurance Program come from outside designated high-risk zones.</p>

          <p>A new Republican spending bill has allocated an additional $75 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over the next four years, representing a massive increase in its budget. The funding will allow ICE to more than double its detention capacity to 116,000 beds and expand its enforcement and deportation activities. This move comes despite public opposition to the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies and recent mass protests. Critics worry the cash infusion will be used to intensify indiscriminate enforcement tactics that undermine due process and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>A Colombian soldier was killed and two others were wounded when a bomb attached to a donkey exploded in the department of Antioquia. The attack was attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN), a guerrilla group with whom the government's peace talks are currently suspended. The incident is part of a recent intensification of attacks by the ELN on security forces, contributing to what observers call the country's worst period of violence in a decade. The use of an animal to carry the explosive device highlights the brutal tactics employed in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to US foreign aid by the Trump administration are threatening decades of progress in the fight against HIV/Aids in South Africa. The closure of USAID-funded clinics has left thousands of patients, particularly vulnerable populations like sex workers, struggling to access life-saving antiretroviral drugs. Health experts and organizations like UNAids warn that these funding cuts could reverse a trend that has seen new infections and deaths fall to their lowest levels in 30 years. The cuts also jeopardize vital research for an HIV vaccine being conducted in South Africa.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California's political dynamics, drawing lessons from its use in New York City. The system, where voters rank candidates by preference, could eliminate the need for costly runoff elections in many local California races and potentially increase voter turnout. While RCV is already used in seven California cities, its statewide adoption could alter campaign strategies by discouraging negative attacks and fostering new alliances. The author suggests it could lead to more centrist outcomes and give underrepresented parties a better chance in competitive races.</p>

This is the latest crisis for the Church in Wales, following critical reports on safeguarding failures in another diocese.
