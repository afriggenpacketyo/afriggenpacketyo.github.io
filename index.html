The investigations, initiated by the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services, stem from concerns that the Law Review's policies may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race-based discrimination in federally funded programs. Harvard maintains that the Law Review is a student-run organization legally independent from the law school and is committed to complying with all applicable laws.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed pitcher Tyler Glasnow on the injured list with shoulder inflammation, raising concerns about his health and the team's pitching rotation. Glasnow, who had made changes to his mechanics to prevent injuries, experienced a "grabbing" sensation in his shoulder during his last start. The team is unsure of the recovery timeline and is working to determine the cause of the setback. With other pitchers also sidelined, the Dodgers face challenges in their pitching staff as they approach a demanding portion of their schedule.</p>

          <p>Canadians are voting in an election influenced by U.S. President Trump's threats to annex Canada and his tariffs. Voters are choosing between Liberal Leader Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, considering issues such as affordability, immigration, and sovereignty. Trump has injected himself into the campaign, suggesting Canada could become the 51st U.S. state if voters elect someone who can make it happen. Poilievre has rejected the idea and urged Trump to stay out of Canadian elections, while Carney has emphasized the need for a strong mandate to deal with Trump.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed the bipartisan "Take It Down Act," which makes it a federal crime to post real and fake sexually explicit imagery online of a person without their consent. This legislation, supported by Melania Trump, requires social media companies to remove such images and videos, including AI-generated deepfakes, within 48 hours of a victim's request. While digital rights groups have raised concerns about potential suppression of lawful speech, lawmakers hope the bill will save lives by providing recourse for victims of cyber abuse.</p>
