          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four crew members from the WWII bomber "Heaven Can Wait," which crashed off New Guinea in 1944, are returning home for burial. Family members initiated an investigation that led to the discovery of the wreckage and a Navy recovery mission. The families of Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick can now properly honor their lost loved ones. The recovery effort, led by Project Recover and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, highlights the enduring impact of the war on families and the commitment to finding missing service members. </p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed criticism of President Putin's attacks in Ukraine, describing him as "absolutely CRAZY," but has not joined Europe in imposing new sanctions. Despite condemning the Russian leader's actions, Trump has refused to offer new arms or help to the Ukrainians. Experts suggest that this pattern creates a strategic void, where Trump complains about Russian actions but does not take meaningful steps to make Putin pay a price. This approach signals a pullback from the conflict, which Trump often describes as Europe’s war. </p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the U.S., citing anti-semitism on campus. This threat follows Trump's move to block Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze billions in federal funding. Harvard has filed lawsuits in response to these actions, alleging they are unlawful. The White House has also withdrawn federal funding from other high-profile universities, including Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to exert control over their policies. </p>

          <p>While the official unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates a more concerning reality. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, encompassing not only unemployed workers but also those seeking full-time work and those in poverty-wage jobs. This measure captures labor market nuances missed by other indicators, such as Americans left behind during economic expansion. LISEP argues that the unemployment rate presents an incomplete and misleading picture by counting part-time or poorly paid work as equal to full-time employment. </p>
