          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance on Friday, diverging from Wall Street trends as investors processed a range of economic data across the region. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices recorded declines after Tokyo's core consumer prices increased at a slower pace in August and the unemployment rate eased. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 indices posted gains. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq slipped amidst corruption charges against the former first lady. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also scheduled to meet China's President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, marking Modi's first visit to China in seven years, which could signal a potential thaw in bilateral relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has officially terminated its "de minimis" tariff exemption for low-value items, meaning all imported goods are now subject to duties. This policy, which previously allowed items under $800 to enter duty-free, had been in place since 1938 but faced criticism for harming domestic retailers and potentially allowing unsafe products or drugs into the country. President Trump had initially ended the exemption for China and has now extended it globally. The change has prompted dozens of foreign postal services across Asia, Europe, and Latin America to suspend parcel shipping to the US, citing a lack of preparation time for the new duty collection and documentation processes.</p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has submitted a second criminal referral to the Department of Justice targeting Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook. Pulte alleges that Cook misrepresented details about her mortgage for a Cambridge condominium and two other properties in government ethics filings during her tenure as a Fed governor. This latest action builds on a previous criminal referral concerning alleged false claims on mortgage applications, which has already prompted a DOJ investigation. The referrals coincide with President Trump's ongoing attempts to dismiss Cook from the central bank, a decision Cook is contesting in federal court, asserting that only the president possesses the authority for her removal.</p>

          <p>Investigators in Minneapolis have revealed that Robin Westman, the attacker who killed two children and injured 18 at a church, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children" and driven by a broad sense of hatred. Police Chief Brian O'Hara indicated Westman, who died by suicide, held no specific motive other than a desire to harm children. Officials confirmed Westman previously attended the school and left notes expressing anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish, and anti-Trump sentiments on firearms, leading the FBI to classify the incident as domestic terrorism. The tragedy has prompted calls for stricter gun control measures, including bans on assault weapons, from local lawmakers.</p>

Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later detained by ICE for possible deportation to Uganda, faces ongoing legal battles. His attorneys contend that the officials' public accusations of gang membership and criminal activity are prejudicial, threatening his right to a fair trial and potentially contaminating the jury pool. This legal maneuver highlights tensions between the administration's tough stance on immigration and the due process rights of individuals.</p>

          <p>Four senior officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have resigned, citing profound concerns over political interference in the agency's scientific operations, particularly concerning vaccine policies. Their resignations, including the Chief Science and Medical Officer and the Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, occurred hours after the White House dismissed CDC Director Susan Monarez. The departing officials expressed alarm over decisions allegedly made without supporting scientific data and instances where evidence reviews were altered or removed. They framed their collective departure as a "bat signal," aiming to raise awareness about the perceived "weaponization" of public health and the erosion of scientific independence within the agency.</p>

Should the court remove Paetongtarn, she would become the fifth prime minister in 17 years to be ousted by the Constitutional Court, underscoring Thailand's persistent political instability. The ruling is particularly significant as the country navigates a fragile ceasefire with its neighbor, and no clear successor has emerged.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is revising its "customer of size" policy, which previously guaranteed refunds for extra seats purchased by plus-size travelers if a flight had an open seat. Effective January 27, the refund is no longer assured, a change that is part of the airline's transition to assigned seating next year. This policy shift has drawn significant criticism from advocates for the plus-size community, who argue it imposes new financial burdens and accessibility challenges. Critics contend that this move reverses Southwest's long-standing reputation as an inclusive airline, potentially increasing travel anxiety and costs for a vital segment of its passenger base.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify investigation, utilizing new video footage, has concluded that Israel struck Gaza's Nasser Hospital at least four times during a deadly Monday attack, contradicting initial reports of two strikes. The assault reportedly killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. Analysis indicates two staircases were hit nearly simultaneously in the first wave, and a later "double-tap" strike was actually two distinct projectiles impacting the same spot milliseconds apart. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially expressed regret and later suggested Hamas used a camera in the hospital area, but has not confirmed multiple strikes. International legal experts are raising concerns about potential violations of international law.</p>

Prosecutors assert that Salazar terminated the lease for his Blackstone Avenue establishment, significantly increased its insurance policy by $102,000, and subsequently arranged for the arson. Evidence, including surveillance video and witness accounts, led to the charges. Salazar, who reportedly collected nearly $1 million in insurance payouts, faces a mandatory minimum of five years and a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted.

By analyzing the DNA of approximately 50 of the UK's most iconic ancient oaks, researchers hope to pinpoint genes associated with exceptional longevity and adaptability to extreme environmental conditions.

          <h2>Rohingya Refugees Allege Forced Deportation by India, Raising Human Rights Concerns</h2>

          <p>Rohingya refugees and their relatives are alleging that the Indian government forcibly deported 40 individuals, including women and children, to Myanmar, a country from which they had fled civil war and persecution. Accounts describe the refugees being flown to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, then compelled onto a naval vessel, and ultimately forced to jump into the Andaman Sea with life jackets. Thomas Andrews, the UN's special rapporteur, asserts there is "significant evidence" corroborating these allegations, to which India has not yet responded. This reported treatment underscores the precarious status of Rohingya in India, where they are not recognized as refugees and face increasing deportations, raising serious human rights concerns.</p>
