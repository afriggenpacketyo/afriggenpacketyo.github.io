          <p>Researchers have identified a link between the sun's magnetic cycle and recent precipitation patterns in China, which have led to increased flooding in the north and drought in the south. The study, published in the Journal of Climate, suggests that solar activity significantly influences the positioning of the monsoon rain belt. This finding is considered a crucial development for improving climate predictions and more effectively managing flood seasons throughout the region.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla is expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump, just one day after the president publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, lower their drug prices. Trump sent letters to 17 drug company CEOs, urging them to match the lower prices paid in other countries, a policy known as "most favored nation" status. The attendance of the CEO at the high-profile event highlights the complex relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the administration's policy goals.</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a key funder for PBS, NPR, and numerous local stations, has announced it will close after the U.S. government rescinded its funding. President Trump signed a bill canceling approximately $1.1 billion previously approved for the organization, citing political bias and unnecessary expense. This move ends nearly six decades of support for renowned educational programs like “Sesame Street” and is expected to disproportionately impact smaller, rural stations that rely heavily on this federal support.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant rise in stingray injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to as many as 15. This seasonal uptick is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing stingrays closer to the shore, particularly in an area known locally as "ray bay" due to warm water discharge from a nearby power plant. To avoid stings, officials advise beachgoers to shuffle their feet in the sand, and they recommend treating any stings by soaking the affected area in hot water.</p>

The analysis also projects the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 as a result of the policy reversal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Superstar pass rusher Micah Parsons has officially requested a trade, stating on social media that he no longer wants to play for the Dallas Cowboys. The 26-year-old, who is seeking a long-term contract extension, expressed frustration with the team's negotiation tactics, claiming the front office has engaged in "close door negotiations" without his agent present. This public demand escalates a contract dispute that has kept the two-time All-Pro from participating in on-field activities at training camp.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector has provided a rare, detailed account of how the regime uses thousands of clandestine IT workers to generate foreign currency. The defector, identified as Jin-su, explained that he used fake identities to secure remote work with Western companies, with up to 85% of his earnings sent back to fund the North Korean government. This scheme, which authorities warn is growing, is estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually for the cash-strapped and heavily sanctioned nation.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The lawsuit argues the White House is attempting to create a de facto national ban by threatening criminal prosecution and demanding patient data, creating an atmosphere of fear. This legal action follows the closure of several prominent gender-affirming care clinics in response to the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Tesla partially responsible for a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend, ordering the company to pay up to $243 million. The lawsuit argued that the Autopilot driver-assistance software should have alerted the driver, who admitted to being distracted, and applied the brakes. Tesla, which maintained the driver was solely at fault and plans to appeal, called the verdict a setback for automotive safety technology.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a significant judgment on motor finance mis-selling, closing down one avenue for compensation claims related to hidden commissions paid to car dealers. While the court did not find all hidden commissions unlawful, it did leave open the possibility for consumers to claim compensation in cases where large, unfair commissions were involved. The ruling provides a mixed result for claimants, awarding compensation to one individual on the grounds of an unfair relationship with the lender.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts stated that while the team's existing stars need to perform more consistently, these additions will help "raise the floor for our ballclub." Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage relief option, while Call is expected to provide depth in the outfield.</p>

This article explains that cults can be difficult to spot, often operating from ordinary locations and using manipulation tactics like "love bombing" to draw people in. Key red flags include a charismatic, authoritarian leader, an 'us-versus-them' mentality, and a high barrier to exit, which makes leaving the group feel difficult or dangerous for members.</p>
