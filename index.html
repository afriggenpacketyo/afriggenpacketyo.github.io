          <p>A drive-by mass shooting in Chicago's River North neighborhood left four people dead and fourteen others wounded. The incident occurred when occupants of a dark SUV opened fire on a crowd leaving an album release party at the Artis Lounge nightclub. The victims were mostly in their 20s and 30s, with several listed in critical condition. This location has a history of violence, as a similar mass shooting happened in November 2022 when the venue was under a different name. As of the report, no arrests have been made and police are actively searching for three shooters.</p>

          <p>The BBC has acknowledged an "error of judgement" after punk duo Bob Vylan, who were pre-assessed as a "high risk" act, led a chant of "death, death to the IDF" during their live-streamed Glastonbury performance. Director-general Tim Davie apologized, particularly to the Jewish community, and announced that staff have been moved from their duties pending an investigation. The corporation failed to cut the live feed despite having protocols in place. In response, the BBC will no longer livestream high-risk performances and will enhance on-site compliance at major events to prevent similar incidents.</p>

          <p>Despite initial condemnation of the Ukraine invasion, Malaysia and Indonesia are increasingly fostering stronger relationships with Russia, signaling a shift in their foreign policy alignment. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim have both made recent visits to Russia, praising Vladimir Putin and emphasizing economic, trade, and investment cooperation. This pivot is seen as an effort to maintain non-alignment amid US-China tensions and reflects growing anti-Western sentiment in the region. Both nations are also engaging with Russia through alternative forums like BRICS, seeking a more balanced global stance.</p>

          <p>A strike by French air traffic controllers has caused major disruptions at the start of Europe's busy summer travel season, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations and stranding thousands of passengers. Major airlines like Ryanair and Easyjet have been forced to cancel a combined total of over 400 flights. The UNSA-ICNA union initiated the strike over demands for better staffing, updated equipment, and improved management culture.

          <p>A major legislative package backed by the Trump administration, which combines significant tax cuts with reductions in Medicaid, is poised to pass but faces widespread public disapproval. Historically, large, partisan bills passed via budget reconciliation tend to be politically damaging for the ruling party, often leading to midterm election losses. This bill is particularly unpopular, with polls showing strong opposition due to its potential to increase the national debt and reduce health coverage for millions. The public's negative reaction is often intensified by media focus on partisan conflict and a lack of understanding of the bill's complex details.</p>

The final passage is expected shortly, following a debate period on the House floor. Republican leadership, with direct engagement from former President Trump, had to pressure several party holdouts who were displeased with changes made to the bill in the Senate. The legislation extends tax cuts, increases defense and border security spending, and makes significant cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, drawing unified and vehement opposition from Democrats.</p>

The author dismisses anti-Trump protests as misguided, suggesting that Trump, far from being a tyrant, has fought against the kind of unchecked governmental power seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. The piece posits that just as wealthy signatories of the Declaration of Independence risked everything for liberty, Trump gave up a life of luxury to serve the country.

          <p>In response to Trump administration plans to significantly reduce its research division, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is launching a program to allow for the adoption of some of its 20,000 lab animals. The administration aims to replace the Office of Research and Development with a smaller office focused only on legally required functions, a move critics call a "scientific self-lobotomy." This plan would eliminate about three-quarters of the research staff and reduce animal testing, making the agency more reliant on potentially biased industry-funded research.

          <p>The Republican-backed budget bill, championed by Donald Trump, is projected to cause significant financial harm to the lowest-income Americans while benefiting the wealthy. According to analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and the Yale Budget Lab, the legislation's cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs would result in a net income loss for the bottom 30% of households. Conversely, the extension of tax cuts would provide substantial gains for the top 10%, particularly the wealthiest 0.1%. Critics argue the bill betrays Trump's promises to the working class and will increase the national debt by over $3 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals shocking details in the 2020 murder of his wife, Suzanne. Her remains, found in a shallow grave in 2023, indicate her body was moved at least twice after she had already decomposed elsewhere. The indictment also states that a mixture of tranquilizing chemicals, which Barry Morphew had access to for sedating wildlife, was found in her bone marrow, suggesting she was drugged before her death. This is the second time Barry Morphew has been charged with her murder, following the dismissal of initial charges. He has consistently maintained his innocence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam, which will see a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports, significantly lower than the previously imposed 46% rate. The deal also includes a 40% tariff on products transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a practice often used to circumvent trade barriers. This agreement is causing concern for other emerging Asian economies, as it suggests that future U.S. trade deals may involve higher-than-expected tariffs. The development does not necessarily signal smoother negotiations for the European Union, which faces more complex and contentious trade issues with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing fell, with the 10-year bond yield dropping after Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This eased market fears that Reeves might resign following an emotional appearance in the Commons and a major U-turn on welfare reforms, which created a £5 billion gap in her financial plans. Analysts suggest the market's reaction indicates a preference for Reeves's fiscal discipline, fearing that her departure would weaken control over government finances. The stabilization in bond yields is significant as it can influence the cost of new fixed-rate mortgage deals. (not investment advice)</p>

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has prioritized improving the nation's diet, securing voluntary commitments from manufacturers to remove some artificial dyes.

Although the drone vessel was not carrying drugs, authorities believe it was a test run by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest cocaine trafficking cartel, and had the capacity for a 1.5-ton payload. This discovery highlights a trend towards more sophisticated, unmanned systems for drug trafficking, which are harder to detect and eliminate the risk of crew capture. Manned narco subs have been used for decades, but this autonomous version represents a significant evolution in smugglers' technology.</p>

The $4-billion dam has been a major point of contention with downstream nations Egypt and Sudan, who fear it will reduce their access to vital Nile waters. Abiy sought to reassure the neighboring countries, stating the dam is a "shared opportunity" for development and not a threat. First launched in 2011, the dam began generating electricity in 2022 and is expected to more than double Ethiopia's power output, addressing significant electricity shortages.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court issued a significant ruling, determining that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision ensures that access to abortion procedures will remain legal in the state. The ruling resolves a key legal question that arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had created uncertainty about the enforceability of the 19th-century statute. The court's interpretation prevents the old law from being used to prohibit abortions, thereby preserving the current status of abortion access for Wisconsin residents.</p>

Other potential targets include Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Real Madrid's Rodrygo, and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze. The final cost of a new striker will likely influence how much the club can spend elsewhere, and Arsenal may look to sell an established player to help fund their recruitment efforts.</p>

Manchester City Council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules intended to prevent prosecutions from being jeopardized.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's presidency, contrary to hopes for a populist shift, has reinforced the long-standing American political consensus of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. The author contends that the recently passed domestic policy bill, with its tax cuts for the rich and welfare cuts for the poor, is a clear monument to neoliberal ideology. Similarly, the recent military strike on Iran is framed as a revival of belligerent neoconservative foreign policy. The article concludes that despite his disruptive style, Trump's core policies represent a continuity with the past half-century of American politics rather than a departure from it.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is facing criticism for its handling of recent federal immigration enforcement actions, some of which were reported to 911 as kidnappings by concerned citizens. In one incident, LAPD officers formed a line to protect armed, masked ICE agents from an angry crowd, sparking backlash from activists and city leaders. In response to the surge in such calls and concerns about agents' lack of identification, the LAPD has created new guidelines requiring supervisors to verify agents' legitimacy. However, the department maintains it has no authority to interfere with federal operations, a stance that has intensified debate over its role in immigration enforcement.</p>
