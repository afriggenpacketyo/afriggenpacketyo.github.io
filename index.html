          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit, filed in Delaware, alleges the network made false and damaging statements about a phone call between Newsom and President Donald Trump. Newsom announced the legal action on social media with the message "No more lies," signaling a direct challenge to the conservative media outlet's reporting practices. The case highlights the escalating tensions between political figures and news organizations over factual accuracy and public representation.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Global Health reveals that approximately 17% of cancer medications in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon are defective. Researchers found that these drugs often contain incorrect levels of active ingredients, which can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for patients. The issue stems from a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products, compounded by a lack of regulatory oversight and testing capabilities in the region. Experts are calling for improved regulation and screening technologies to address this critical public health problem.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that the team is holding discussions with four-time world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 season. Verstappen is currently contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but his deal reportedly contains exit clauses. The speculation is fueled by Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' potential advantage with the new 2026 engine regulations. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations may be influenced by Mercedes' pursuit of the Dutch driver, adding a significant layer of intrigue to the Formula 1 driver market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision-making regarding Iran may be influenced by a personal fear of assassination, according to a report in The Atlantic. While officials state that policy is based on national interest, Trump has publicly and privately expressed concerns about threats to his life from Iran, especially after multiple alleged plots were disrupted. This personal anxiety has led to enhanced security measures and a heightened sense of risk within his circle. The article explores how this fear, rooted in past threats against U.S. officials, could be a significant, albeit unspoken, factor in the current conflict.</p>

Critics, however, contend that it's statistically unnecessary and offers lower returns compared to other investment vehicles like 529 plans or brokerage accounts. The decision ultimately depends on a family's specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and concerns about future insurability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of a ceasefire following intense Israeli and U.S. strikes, life in Tehran is slowly returning to a semblance of normalcy, but a deep sense of uncertainty and fear persists among its residents. Many Iranians are counting the cost of the conflict, which killed over 600 people and left thousands injured, and express anxiety that the war is not truly over. The strikes, which targeted military, nuclear, and propaganda sites, have left physical and psychological scars on the capital. The article captures a city on edge, grappling with its future amid ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced that the USNS Harvey Milk, a Navy oiler named for the pioneering gay rights activist, is being renamed. The ship will now be called the USNS Oscar V. Peterson, in honor of a Navy chief who posthumously received the Medal of Honor for heroism in World War II. Hegseth stated the move was intended to "take the politics out of ship naming" and honor a military hero instead of a "political activist." The decision reverses a previous administration's move and reflects a significant policy shift under the current leadership.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of a fixed rate for a set term. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some short-term CDs offering over 4.4%. Experts note that the current market features an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often have higher rates than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, savers are advised to compare offers from different institutions, particularly online banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering a refinance, current mortgage rates remain a key factor in affordability. As of late June 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.87%, while a 15-year mortgage averages around 6.06%. While these rates are higher than in recent years, they have stabilized, and experts suggest they may not rise further if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rate, borrowers should focus on strengthening their credit score and comparing offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team in China has identified a key genetic pathway that could enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability typically seen in animals like salamanders. The study, published in *Science*, found that mammals' limited regenerative ability is linked to an insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating a dormant "genetic switch" in mice, the scientists were able to restore the production of this acid and trigger ear tissue regeneration. This discovery could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in vertebrates, including humans.</p>

In a recent interview, Starmer said neither he nor his speechwriters were aware of the historical parallel and he would not have used the words if he had known. He attributed the oversight partly to being distressed at the time, following an alleged arson attack on his family home.</p>
