The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, completed over 200 scientific experiments during their 146 days in orbit. Their mission also involved replacing the Crew-9 astronauts who had been stranded on the station for an extended period due to issues with their Boeing Starliner capsule.

          <p>Germany's decision to suspend arms exports to Israel has created significant political friction within Chancellor Friedrich Merz's own conservative coalition. Prominent members of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) and its Bavarian counterpart, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have sharply criticized the move, viewing it as a departure from Germany's long-standing foreign policy and special responsibility towards Israel. However, the decision has also found support from other conservatives and the Social Democrats, who argue it is a necessary response to the Israeli government's recent actions. The debate highlights deep divisions over foreign policy and Germany's historical obligations.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has spoken about the significant emotional toll that fame has taken on her, particularly regarding the loss of privacy. In a recent interview, she expressed that at 18, she did not understand the full implications of living in the public eye, from paparazzi at her home to constant media scrutiny. Sweeney noted that the intense spotlight has made her more guarded and has shrunk her circle of trust. Her comments come amidst recent online controversies, including backlash over an ad campaign, which she feels contributes to false media narratives about her.</p>

          <p>A protest in London's Parliament Square resulted in the arrest of at least 365 individuals for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw attendees display signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." The Metropolitan Police stated that anyone holding a placard with this message was subject to arrest, as supporting the group is now a criminal offense. The event highlights ongoing tensions and legal challenges surrounding pro-Palestinian activism and the UK government's classification of certain protest groups.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, predating the Earth by about 20 million years. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which originated from a larger meteor that exploded over the state in June. The analysis suggests the meteorite belongs to a group of asteroids from the main belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely from a larger asteroid breakup 470 million years ago. Scientists have proposed naming it the McDonough Meteorite, marking the 27th such recovery in Georgia.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy are co-hosting a meeting of senior security officials from the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine to discuss the war ahead of a planned summit between Presidents Trump and Putin. The talks, held at the request of the U.S., are seen as a vital forum to align strategies and discuss paths toward peace. This meeting comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasizes that Ukraine will not make territorial concessions, a position potentially at odds with signals from President Trump that a land-for-peace deal might be necessary to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how extreme partisan gerrymandering has reshaped American politics over the last 15 years, focusing on the Republican "Redmap" project. Launched after the 2008 election, the strategy targeted and funded state-level races ahead of the 2010 census to gain control of the redistricting process. This allowed Republicans to draw legislative and congressional maps that locked in their power for a decade, even when their candidates received fewer votes statewide. The use of advanced mapping software and voter data has entrenched hard-right lawmakers, insulated them from electoral consequences, and fueled political polarization.</p>

The award, the Order of Lenin, was intended for Michael Gloss, the 21-year-old son of a senior CIA official, who was killed last year while fighting for Russia in Ukraine. Gloss, who had reportedly suffered from mental health issues, was never a CIA employee and had expressed pro-Russian views online.

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have served as director of both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Known for his integrity and troubleshooting skills, Webster was appointed to lead the FBI in 1978 to restore its reputation after a period of scandal. He was later chosen by President Reagan in 1987 to lead the CIA in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair, where he worked to rebuild trust with Congress. His long career in public service was defined by his role as an apolitical outsider tasked with stabilizing the nation's key security agencies during times of crisis.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to brief him on the upcoming summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. According to Chinese state media, Xi endorsed the U.S.-Russia dialogue and expressed hope for progress in the political resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The communication highlights the strategic alignment between Moscow and Beijing, as Putin ensures his key ally is kept informed of major diplomatic moves. Analysts noted that while the summit could lead to a temporary detente, it is unlikely to produce a lasting peace or shift the broader geopolitical balance.</p>

          <p>A major museum exhibition is shedding new light on the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most celebrated flower painters of her time, even more famous than Rembrandt during her life. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, Ruysch had unique access to exotic specimens, which she depicted in intricate, dramatic still lifes set against dark backgrounds. Despite the challenges faced by women artists, she achieved immense success, becoming a court painter and winning the lottery. The exhibition explores her refined technique and the scientific, aesthetic, and moral dimensions of her work.</p>

Known for his pace and physical dominance, Sesko was a top goalscorer under 23 in Europe's major leagues. The signing is a key part of new head coach Ruben Amorim's project to return the club to competing for major trophies.</p>

          <p>An upcoming meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska is raising concerns that Ukraine's interests will be sidelined in negotiations to end the war. Analysts note that the Trump administration has moved away from the previous "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine" policy, putting Kyiv in a difficult position. The direct talks between the U.S. and Russian leaders, without Ukrainian participation at the table, suggest that a deal could be brokered that potentially forces Ukraine to accept terms it opposes. This shift in U.S. policy signals a significant change in the diplomatic approach to resolving the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported an additional 11 deaths from malnutrition, bringing the total to 212, as a severe humanitarian crisis continues. The rising death toll comes as Israel reveals a plan to take full security control of Gaza City, which reportedly includes a two-month deadline for its one million residents to evacuate south. This plan has been widely condemned by world leaders and humanitarian agencies, who fear it will cause immense suffering for a population already displaced and facing famine. The UN reports that aid entering the territory remains far below the minimum required to meet basic needs.</p>

The funds are intended to establish a public company that will hold its WLFI tokens, according to a Bloomberg News report.

          <p>A coalition of approximately 20 Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, has jointly condemned Israel's new plan to take military control of Gaza City, calling it a "dangerous escalation" and a "flagrant violation of international law." The condemnation comes as the humanitarian situation worsens, prompting the United Kingdom to commit an additional £8.5 million in aid for Gaza. The UK's Development Minister stressed that the aid is only effective if Israel allows supplies to "flood" the region, criticizing the current insufficient flow of essential goods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki reiterates the long-held scientific consensus that there is no mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle. He argues that the high volume of air and sea traffic in the region means that, on a percentage basis, the number of disappearances is no different than any other well-traveled area of the ocean. This explanation, supported by institutions like NOAA and Lloyd's of London, points to a combination of human error and challenging environmental factors. These factors include the volatile weather of the Gulf Stream and potential magnetic compass anomalies, which sufficiently explain the incidents without resorting to supernatural theories.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins suggests that parents who are constantly on their phones may be modeling behavior that hinders their children's development and success. Speaking from personal experience, Robbins noted that children often mirror their parents' screen habits, which can lead to issues with attention, sleep, and mental health. She advises parents to first address their own phone usage, such as not keeping it on their person at home or sleeping with it. By modeling a balanced relationship with technology and showing curiosity about their kids' online activities rather than judgment, parents can foster better connections and healthier habits.</p>
