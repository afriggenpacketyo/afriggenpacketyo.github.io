          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a 30% tariff on all imports from the European Union and Mexico, scheduled to take effect on August 1. The decision follows stalled trade negotiations, with the president warning of even higher duties should the trading partners choose to retaliate. In response, the European Commission stated it would take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the potential adoption of countermeasures. Various European leaders have also voiced their strong disapproval and concern over the escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Start-ups like Better Dairy in London are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to produce casein, the key protein found in milk. These companies aim to launch their products within a few years, targeting what they see as a quality gap in the existing vegan cheese market. However, they face significant challenges, including declining sales of plant-based cheese, consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, and high initial production costs. Despite these hurdles, firms are optimistic they can overcome taste and price barriers to revolutionize the dairy industry.</p>

          <p>After her mother passed away, Jess Basey-Fisher discovered she had an older brother who was given up for adoption decades earlier. Using the limited information she had, she successfully traced him to Australia, and the two siblings connected online, discovering remarkable similarities in their lives. Their reunion became more poignant when her brother, Alistair, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer shortly after they first spoke. Jess then traveled to Australia to support him through his treatment, cherishing the time to build new memories.</p>

          <p>Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known supporter of Vladimir Putin, is scheduled to perform in Italy, breaking a widespread European ban on pro-Kremlin artists that has been in place since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The invitation from the Un'Estate da RE festival in the Campania region has drawn significant criticism from European politicians and Ukrainian activists, who label Gergiev a "cultural mouthpiece for Putin." Despite the considerable backlash, regional officials are defending their decision, arguing that culture should remain separate from politics.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor has retained her undisputed super lightweight titles by defeating Amanda Serrano for a third time in their trilogy fight at Madison Square Garden. Taylor won by a majority decision with judges' scores of 97-93, 97-93, and 95-95. Unlike their two previous close encounters, this final bout saw a more pronounced dominance from the 39-year-old Taylor over her 36-year-old Puerto Rican rival. The victory in front of a large crowd solidifies Taylor's standing and seemingly concludes the intense rivalry between the two prominent female boxers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his longtime critic, comedian Rosie O'Donnell. In a social media post, Trump labeled O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, a "threat to humanity." In response, O'Donnell called Trump "everything that is wrong with America." Legal experts have pointed out that the president has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that protects this constitutional right.</p>

          <p>The murder trial of Erin Patterson, who was convicted of killing three people with poison-laced beef Wellingtons, has captivated Australia and the global true crime community. The case has drawn intense media coverage, courtroom spectators, and widespread online speculation, turning Patterson herself into an object of fascination. The article notes the irony that Patterson was once known as a "super sleuth" in an online true crime group. Experts suggest the public's obsession is fueled by the seemingly benign circumstances and the fact that the perpetrator is a woman.</p>

          <p>While Germany secured its place in the next round of Euro 2025, a 4-1 loss to Sweden exposed significant defensive vulnerabilities. After taking an early lead, the German defense collapsed, leading to a series of errors and goals that highlighted frailties seen in earlier group matches. Coach Christian Wück acknowledged the team's poor performance and the need to address these issues, which are compounded by injuries and key personnel choices. The team now faces a tough quarter-final opponent with pressing questions about its backline and overall strategy.</p>

          <p>According to Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to the US, the universal 10% tariff on most UK goods imported into America is likely a permanent fixture. While this baseline tariff may remain, he indicated there is still potential for negotiation in specific sectors such as technology. This statement comes amid ongoing uncertainty over whether the separate 25% tariff on UK steel will continue or possibly increase. Mandelson also predicted a warm reception for President Trump during his upcoming state visit to the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

The article shares stories of individuals who have had allergic reactions due to confusing labels.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has quietly pushed back against escalating criticism from the Trump administration regarding its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project. The central bank updated its website with an FAQ page to defend the project, directly addressing claims made by OMB Director Russell Vought about "ostentatious" features like VIP dining rooms. The Fed clarified that the project modernizes historic buildings and that cost increases were due to unforeseen conditions and necessary design changes. This defense comes as the administration intensifies its campaign against Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>
