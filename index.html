          <p>Stephen A. Smith has commented on the sexual assault allegations against his co-host, Shannon Sharpe, calling it a "sad situation." Sharpe is accused of assault, sexual assault, battery, and sexual battery, with the accuser seeking $50 million in damages.

Higher tariffs are expected to impact exports to the US, potentially causing a reduction in capital expenditure by producers. The industry is also grappling with a price war resulting from overproduction, which has led to a significant drop in export prices. (not investment advice)</p>
