          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status for nearly 350,000 Venezuelans, reversing a lower court's block on the decision. This move intensifies the administration's hardline stance on immigration, with activists decrying it as the largest single action stripping non-citizens of immigration status in modern US history. Homeland Security hailed the decision as a win for American safety, while critics argue it forces families into impossible choices.
