          <p>Nottinghamshire Police have initiated a corporate manslaughter investigation into the maternity services at Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, following failings that led to the deaths or injuries of hundreds of babies. The investigation will focus on whether the maternity care provided by the trust, which oversees Queen's Medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital, was grossly negligent. This action comes amid an ongoing independent inquiry led by midwife Donna Ockenden, examining approximately 2,500 cases of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, and injuries to mothers and babies. The trust is at the center of the largest maternity inquiry in the history of the NHS, highlighting the severity of the alleged negligence and its impact on numerous families.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times and fewer delays, although changes near London are not expected until the 2030s. The redesign, the largest since the 1950s, aims to reduce aviation's climate impact and accommodate new technologies like flying taxis. While ministers highlight smoother takeoffs and landings, concerns are raised about new flight paths affecting previously unaffected residential areas. Industry leaders like Tim Alderslade of Airlines UK support the changes, emphasizing the need for swift action to achieve CO2 reductions, while pressure groups urge prioritization of environmental impacts and community well-being.</p>

High interest rates could significantly increase the cost of the tax bill for the government and economy, impacting everything from mortgage rates to business loans. While the bond market cannot directly depose a president, its influence could shape the future of the legislation, constraining politicians and making it harder to pass desired tax cuts and spending initiatives (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A concussion lawsuit against rugby authorities has grown to include more than 1,100 former players, with 784 from rugby union and 319 from rugby league, according to Rylands Garth law firm. Notable players, including Steve Thompson, Mark Regan, Phil Vickery, Gavin Henson, Colin Charvis, Ryan Jones, and Harry Ellis, are seeking damages from World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union, and the Welsh Rugby Union. The former players allege that the governing bodies were negligent in failing to protect them from serious brain injuries, and a similar action is being taken against the Rugby Football League and the British Amateur Rugby League Association.</p>

          <p>First-time homebuyers are now taking out mortgages with an average term of 31 years due to persistent affordability challenges, according to UK Finance. This is an increase from 28 years a decade ago, as higher mortgage rates push buyers to extend their repayment periods to lower monthly costs. Despite recent rate decreases, mortgage terms are not shortening, and a significant portion of new mortgages extend into retirement. While long mortgage terms offer manageable repayments, they also mean homeowners may still be making payments later in life.</p>

Departing from Sicily on the ship Madleen, the group aims to draw attention to the plight of civilians in Gaza, which has endured extensive bombardment. Thunberg stated that the world cannot remain silent about the systematic starvation of 2 million people, emphasizing a moral obligation to fight for a free Palestine. The activists anticipate a seven-day journey, though it is unlikely they will reach Gaza due to Israeli authorities' strict control of the enclave's waters.</p>

The three-year program, which started soon after chemotherapy, aimed to have participants exercise at double the recommended amount for the general population, such as brisk walking for 45-60 minutes three to four times a week. Results showed that 80% of people exercising remained cancer-free after five years, compared to 74% in the other group, with a 37% lower risk of death eight years after initial treatment.
