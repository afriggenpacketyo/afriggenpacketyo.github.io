        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports that electric car and heat pump adoption is increasing, but further progress is needed to meet net-zero targets by 2050. While greenhouse gas emissions have significantly decreased since 1990 due to the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, transport and buildings remain major emitters. The committee emphasizes the need for the government to lower electricity bills to incentivize households to switch to cleaner technologies, suggesting the removal of charges supporting older renewable energy projects from household bills. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband acknowledges the advice and reiterates the commitment to providing clean power for families and businesses, but the government must also find ways to offset the costs which would likely fall on general taxation. Optimism surrounds the potential for achieving net-zero through effective policy and rapid technological advancements.</p>

          <p>Regina Higuera, a grandmother who lived in the U.S. for 36 years, chose to self-deport to Mexico due to increased ICE raids in Los Angeles. Fearing the uncertainty of being detained, she returned to her birthplace, leaving behind her children and grandchildren, who are all U.S. citizens. Higuera had crossed into the U.S. illegally at age 15 and worked in garment factories, contributing to the economy and paying taxes without receiving benefits. She expressed relief from stress but sadness at being separated from her family, who talk and text with her daily as they continue the better life she worked to build in the U.S. Her daughter emphasized her mother's strength and resilience in the face of adversity.</p>

          <p>New York City Democrats are choosing their mayoral nominee in a primary viewed as a battle between the party's left-wing and moderate factions. The race pits democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani against former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amidst sexual harassment allegations. Mamdani, endorsed by progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, focuses on affordability with proposals like free public buses and universal childcare. Cuomo, backed by unions, emphasizes experience and public safety, criticizing Mamdani's ambitious promises. The outcome is expected to have national implications as Democrats grapple with internal divisions and strategies to counter Trump's appeal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding $5 billion in funds previously allocated to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The lawsuit, led by attorneys general in California, Colorado, and Washington, argued that the administration's suspension of the Nevi program violated congressional intent. The judge granted a partial injunction, stating that the states were likely to succeed in their lawsuit. The Trump administration's decision to review the program and suspend approvals was seen as contradictory to the program's goal of deploying electric vehicle chargers, especially given Trump's past criticism of electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez have changed the venue for one of their wedding parties in Venice due to security concerns and potential protests. The party was moved from the Scuola Grande della Misericordia to the more isolated Arsenale, surrounded by water and accessible only by boat when connecting bridges are raised. Protests have increased due to concerns about celebrity guests overwhelming Venice with private jets and yachts, as well as disagreements with Bezos's politics. Despite the change, the wedding festivities are expected to proceed with a number of celebrity guests, while organizers have pushed back on the idea that the nuptials will overrun the city.</p>

Witkoff assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program quickly. He emphasized that the proof is in the fact that "no one's shooting at each other."</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago, using data from the Gaia space telescope and other sky surveys. The study of thousands of stars revealed that as the Milky Way evolved, newly formed stars began spinning up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The research presents the first direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study how the galaxy has changed.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment found that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to sources familiar with its contents. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities to be sealed off. The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume their work, ranging from a few months to less than a year. The White House has pushed back on the findings, calling the assessment "flat-out wrong."</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre, was detained by ICE during a green card meeting, leaving her husband to care for their two young children, including a breastfeeding infant. Paola, a Mexican national, had a deportation order from 2018, which she was unaware of. Her husband is now struggling to explain her absence to their children and is concerned about their well-being. Immigration law experts say that the Trump administration's strict enforcement policies have reduced discretion for military families, leading to more deportations.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has declined to testify in his sex trafficking trial, which is expected to conclude this week. Prosecutors rested their case after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days, alleging that Combs used his business empire to coerce women into sex. Combs' lawyers presented a brief defense, arguing that the alleged victims consented to the sex parties. The defense rested its case after asking the judge to issue an immediate acquittal, which the judge did not rule on.</p>

The arrests primarily targeted working-age men, with nearly half being Mexican. The mayor criticized the raids for targeting hardworking people rather than drug kingpins, leading to widespread fear in the community.

          <p>McDowell County in West Virginia, already facing economic decline, is struggling to recover from a devastating flood that left at least three people dead. The city of Welch, once booming during the coal industry's peak, has been hemorrhaging population, and the flood has exacerbated existing challenges. Despite approximately $12 million in federal relief, the money doesn't cover all the cleanup and rebuild efforts. The community's poverty rate is high, life expectancy is low, and drug overdose rates are among the highest in the U.S., leading to frustration with government and low voter turnout.</p>

While the White House and Defense Secretary dismissed the leaks, former CIA director David Petraeus cautioned against drawing conclusions at this stage.
