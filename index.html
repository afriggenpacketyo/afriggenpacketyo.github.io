            <p>Sanya, a resort city in Hainan, China, is experiencing a surge in Russian tourists, surpassing English speakers in the area. The increase in Russian visitors has helped the local travel sector recover significantly from the Covid-19 pandemic. This upswing is attributed to a general recovery in Russian outbound tourism and China's relaxed visa policies, including allowing citizens of 59 countries to spend up to 30 days in Hainan without a visa. This has led to Russia becoming the top source of foreign guests in Sanya's hotels.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans detained in North Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that the detainees were at imminent risk of deportation without due process. The court's order prevents the Trump administration from removing the detainees until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. This action follows previous rulings allowing deportations only if individuals have a chance to argue their case in court.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring the U.S. bond market due to volatility caused by trade tariffs. A rare sharp rise in bond rates and a fall in bond prices suggest a loss of confidence in the U.S. economy. This volatility could affect public spending, household finances, and business borrowing rates, potentially halting economic growth and leading to job losses. President Trump's initial resistance to the stock market sell-off weakened when the bond market showed signs of instability, leading to a pause in tariff implementation. (not investment advice)</p>

While tariffs are expected to increase prices for American consumers, the expectation of rising prices could become self-fulfilling. Senator Elizabeth Warren has cautioned that corporations might use tariffs to price-gouge consumers. A study on Trump's previous tariffs on washing machines found that prices rose even for unaffected products, highlighting the potential for widespread price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's museums are being directed to promote ethnic unity and counter "wrong historical views" by avoiding confrontational portrayals of the Han ethnicity and emphasizing the "China story." Museums should avoid creating binary oppositions between Han and non-Han groups, according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. The goal is to cultivate a "sense of community" and represent China as "diverse but unified." Museums are encouraged to place cultural relics and historical narratives within the context of China's overall development.</p>
