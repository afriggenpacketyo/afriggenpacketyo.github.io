          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured victory in Monday's federal election, a surprising turn influenced by U.S. President Trump's threats to annex Canada and impose sweeping tariffs. These external pressures overshadowed domestic issues such as affordability and immigration, swaying voters' choices. While the Liberals won more parliamentary seats than the Conservatives, it remains uncertain if they will secure an outright majority. The election saw a record 7.3 million Canadians casting their votes in advance, reflecting heightened concerns over sovereignty and economic partnerships amidst U.S. policies.

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a previous withholding order protecting him from removal due to gang persecution risks. Homan claimed the facts surrounding the order had changed, alleging Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist affiliated with MS-13, a claim his attorneys deny. Abrego Garcia was initially arrested for soliciting work and allegedly associated with gang members. The Salvadoran President has refused to send him back to the U.S., leading to diplomatic tensions and a judge ordering the Trump administration to provide updates on its efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to alleviate the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, giving automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. Tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but will be modified to avoid stacking with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some tariff costs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of a new car's value in the first year, phased out over two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart and other major U.S. retailers have reportedly instructed some manufacturers in China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to resume shipments to the United States. This decision comes after a period of slowed shipments due to tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the U.S. and China. According to a major exporter in Ningbo, Walmart notified them to resume normal deliveries, with the costs of the new import duties being borne by the U.S. clients. This development suggests a potential shift in trade dynamics amidst the ongoing trade war.</p>

          <p>A Chinese political scientist has cautioned ASEAN member states to carefully manage their economic and trade relations with China, warning that aligning too closely with the U.S. in the trade war could lead to isolation by China and stalled industrialization.

          <p>Four former opposition lawmakers in Hong Kong were released after completing their prison sentences for subversion under the national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020. The four were among 45 pro-democracy figures convicted last year for organizing a primary election in 2020 aimed at securing a legislative majority and rejecting the government budget. The sentences have been condemned by Western governments and rights groups, while Hong Kong and Beijing maintain that the democrats received a fair trial.</p>

This action follows previous disputes between the administration and Harvard, including demands for DEI program dismantling and international student screening.

A Harvard Law School spokesman stated the school is committed to legal compliance and will investigate alleged violations, while noting the Law Review's legal independence.</p>

This fiscal move aims to stimulate domestic demand, particularly consumption, and mitigate the impact of the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has decided to ease some of his tariffs for automakers, a partial reversal of his "get-tough" trade policy. The administration will prevent the stacking of different tariffs on imported foreign cars, and importers of foreign auto parts will receive government reimbursements for tariffs over the next two years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the move rewards domestic manufacturers while providing a runway for those needing time to invest in domestic plants. The 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imported cars remain in effect, with imported car parts soon to be impacted as well. (not investment advice)</p>
