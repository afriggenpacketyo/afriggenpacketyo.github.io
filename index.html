          <p>In a recent interview, Republican Representative Tony Gonzales defended Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) against criticism, arguing that enforcement actions protect Americans from dangers posed by illegal immigration. He emphasized a strategic shift, enabled by new funding, to focus on deporting violent offenders and high-level criminals rather than all undocumented individuals. Gonzales also addressed the use of military facilities like Fort Bliss for housing detainees, acknowledging the discomfort with mixing military and law enforcement roles but viewing it as a necessary, temporary measure to streamline the process.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump issued a directive on social media for the homeless population in Washington, D.C., to be moved out of the city "IMMEDIATELY," promising to provide alternative places for them to stay. This statement is part of his intensified rhetoric on cracking down on crime in the nation's capital, which he plans to address further at an upcoming press conference. His remarks contrast with Justice Department data showing that violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low in 2024, drawing pushback from local Democratic leadership.</p>

          <p>A high-ranking ally of Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, has warned that unnamed countries are making "titanic efforts" to disrupt the planned summit between the Russian and U.S. presidents in Alaska. The meeting is scheduled to focus on finding a peaceful resolution to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has now entered its fourth year. Dmitriev, often seen as a key figure in Russia's back-channel diplomacy, suggested that these efforts could manifest as diplomatic maneuvers or media provocations aimed at undermining the critical talks.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London resulted in the arrest of 532 individuals for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest involved hundreds of people displaying placards with messages backing the organization, making it the largest number of arrests by the Metropolitan Police on a single day in the last decade. While the Home Secretary defended the ban based on security advice, human rights groups like Amnesty International expressed deep concern that the broad terrorism laws threaten freedom of expression.</p>

The political feud has intensified as Texas Democrats fled the state to prevent a legislative quorum, prompting Governor Greg Abbott to threaten their arrest upon return. Prominent Democrats argue they must fight back against the plan, which they claim originated with Donald Trump and is designed to unfairly influence future elections.</p>

          <p>A toy store in La Puente, California, was burglarized, with thieves stealing approximately $7,000 worth of the highly popular Labubu dolls. The collectible toys, which debuted in China, have seen a massive surge in global popularity, partly driven by their scarcity and a "blind box" sales model that encourages repeat purchases. The incident highlights the extreme demand for these dolls, which can retail for around $30 but often fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars on the resale market, creating a lucrative target for theft.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended his security cabinet's approval of a military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the only way to achieve the "complete the defeat of Hamas." He asserted that Israel's goal is not occupation but to demilitarize the enclave and install a non-Israeli civilian administration, all within a "fairly short timetable." The plan has drawn widespread international condemnation and sparked an emergency UN Security Council meeting amid fears it will worsen the humanitarian crisis and endanger remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>According to branding expert Goldie Chan, an introvert herself, developing a personal brand is a crucial strategy for introverts to gain visibility and advance their careers. She advises that a personal brand is simply what people know you for, and it can be cultivated through small, consistent actions like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online. By proactively shaping their own narrative, introverts can overcome being underestimated and ensure their talents are recognized in the workplace.</p>

          <p>An environmental scientist has effectively shut down a common climate change myth by explaining the difference between natural cycles and human-influenced warming. While acknowledging that the Earth does go through long-term warming and cooling periods, she emphasized that the current rate of warming is drastically accelerated by human emissions from burning fossil fuels. Using verified charts from the EPA, she demonstrates that this accelerated greenhouse effect is the scientifically accepted cause of the current climate crisis and its increasingly severe consequences.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have dismissed claims made in Nicola Sturgeon's forthcoming memoir that Salmond himself may have leaked details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. Key figures in the Alba party, which Salmond founded, labeled the suggestion a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy," reigniting the bitter feud between the two former leaders of Scotland's independence movement. The controversy stems from the 2019 government probe into Salmond, which was later deemed unlawful and biased by the courts.</p>
