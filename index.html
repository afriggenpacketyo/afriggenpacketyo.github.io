          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening to a powerful Category 4 storm. Currently located northeast of Puerto Rico, the hurricane is bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the Caribbean islands as it tracks westward. While the majority of meteorological models predict Erin will curve north and remain well off the U.S. East Coast, its effects will still be felt. Coastal areas from North Carolina to Virginia can expect large waves and life-threatening rip currents in the coming week, posing a risk of significant beach erosion.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the costumed "Zombie Hunter," was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of two women in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The cold cases were solved after 21 years using DNA and genetic genealogy, which led investigators to Miller. His defense argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia and have no memory of the killings. Miller is also a suspect in the 1992 disappearance of 13-year-old Brandy Myers, though he has not been charged in that case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A planned visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi has reportedly been called off as trade tensions between the two nations escalate. The cancellation follows President Trump's imposition of a 25% tariff on Indian exports, with an additional 25% duty expected as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the cumulative 50% tariff rate as unfair, especially as other Western nations continue their own trade with Russia. The U.S. remains India's largest single export partner, making the dispute significant for the Indian economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The action has been met with protests from residents and legal challenges from local officials, who argue it represents federal overreach and is based on a false pretext, as city data shows violent crime is at a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have declined to comment on whether quarterback Matthew Stafford participated in a scheduled workout to test his injured back, increasing concern over his status for the season opener. Coach Sean McVay is expected to provide an update on Monday regarding the 37-year-old's condition, which has been described as an aggravated disc. Stafford has been unable to practice with the team throughout training camp due to the injury. In his absence, backup quarterback Stetson Bennett has been gaining crucial experience, leading the team to a preseason victory over the Chargers with a last-second touchdown pass.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist group, stating its activities go beyond legitimate protest. She cited incidents of property damage and a manual encouraging targeted attacks as justification for the ban. The statement comes as police announced 60 more people will be prosecuted for supporting the group, bringing the total number of arrests to over 700 since the ban was enacted. Civil liberties organizations have criticized the move as disproportionate and a threat to free expression, while Palestine Action is challenging the ban in court.</p>

After finding the owner on Facebook, the mechanic mailed the wallet back to him, much to the original owner's surprise.

The unrest, now in its fifth night, was met with tear gas and stun grenades from riot police. Initially sparked by a deadly railway station collapse last year, the protests have grown into widespread calls for an end to President Aleksandar Vučić's 12-year rule amid allegations of corruption and police brutality.

          <p>Scientists in China are developing a hypersonic drone carrier concept featuring a unique rotating 'scissor wing' design, reviving an idea once explored by NASA. The proposed aircraft would have a single, centrally mounted wing that adjusts its angle based on speed. At low speeds, the wing would be perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as it approaches Mach 5, it would pivot to become parallel, merging with the aircraft's body to function as a 'waverider.' This innovative design aims to solve the challenge of maintaining both low-speed efficiency and high-speed stability in a single airframe.</p>

The defense claimed Craig was suicidal and bought the poisons for himself, not his wife. Angela Craig died in March 2023 after several hospital visits for mysterious symptoms, with an autopsy later confirming lethal concentrations of poison.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A couples therapist outlines five common psychological factors that can lead individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, to risk having an affair. These triggers include a lifelong pressure to always be 'good,' the burnout associated with perfectionism, and having poor personal boundaries often developed in childhood. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can make an affair feel like a form of escape or retaliation. Finally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating one's life and priorities, making boundaries more permeable.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has undergone an astonishingly rapid intensification, strengthening from a Category 1 to a Category 5 storm in just over 24 hours, making it one of the fastest-strengthening Atlantic hurricanes on record. This phenomenon, where storms gain significant wind speed in a short period, has become more common as rising ocean and atmospheric temperatures provide more fuel for hurricanes. Scientists point to this trend as another clear example of the increasing weather extremes caused by climate change. While Erin is expected to remain at sea, its rapid development underscores the growing power and danger of modern storms.</p>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has remained in a Kenyan mortuary for 11 years due to a bitter family feud and a lengthy legal battle. Following his death in 2013, his sons from his first marriage accused his second wife and their daughters of poisoning him to inherit his estate, a claim they denied. The dispute led to the exhumation of his body, but decomposition made the cause of death indeterminable. A magistrate has now concluded the inquest, but the family remains divided on whether to rebury him in Kenya or the UK, prolonging the ordeal.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, during the COVID-19 lockdown of 2021. As 11-year-olds just starting secondary school, they wrote about their fears of the pandemic, their hopes for the future, and more personal questions. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill hope during a disruptive period, provided a moment of reflection for the students as they prepared to receive their exam results. The letters captured the unique challenges their cohort faced, with an education shaped by remote learning and social distancing measures.</p>

The letter addresses the plight of children affected by the Russia-Ukraine war, appealing to Putin to help restore their safety and innocence.

          <p>Villa Baviera, a Chilean village once known as Colonia Dignidad, is now a tourist destination with a hotel and restaurant, but its dark past as a site of torture and abuse continues to cause division. The location was home to a secretive German sect that collaborated with the Pinochet dictatorship to torture political prisoners. The Chilean government now plans to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the victims, a move supported by victims' families. However, some current residents, who were themselves victims of the sect's abusive leader, oppose the plan, arguing it will displace them once again.</p>
