        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dual-certified child life specialist and therapist shares six daily practices parents can implement to build trust with their children. These include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, and being honest about personal challenges. The expert also recommends modeling behavior instead of interrogating, incorporating real talk into routines, and teaching coping strategies for handling emotions. Trust is built through consistent small moments of openness and honesty, creating a safe space for children to share and ask questions. These practices help children learn how to navigate their emotions and build stronger connections with their parents.</p>

          <p>Fast-moving wildfires in Canada have forced approximately 17,000 people to evacuate, particularly in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, where states of emergency have been declared and international assistance has been requested. The Canadian military is assisting in evacuating residents from remote areas, while firefighters grapple with the growing flames amid hot, dry weather conditions. Smoke from the fires has spread across Canada and into parts of the United States, prompting air quality alerts for millions of Americans. Climate change is exacerbating conditions that lead to the spread of wildfires, and authorities are bracing for critical conditions in the coming days. The weather forecast is not promising, as a cold front is expected to bring windy conditions, which will further exacerbate the spread of the fires. Optimism regarding the situation is low, with authorities working to contain the blazes. </p>

          <p>The UK's upcoming defense review is intended to send a "message to Moscow" by outlining plans to deter "growing Russian aggression," according to the defense secretary. The review will also warn of the "immediate and pressing" danger posed by Russia and other countries, including China. A key component of the plan involves a Â£1.5 billion investment to construct six new factories for munitions production, aiming to revitalize Britain's industrial base and address deficiencies highlighted by the war in Ukraine. Cyber attacks from Russia are reportedly taking place "every day" as part of 90,000 attacks on the UK's military networks from adversaries in the last two years.</p>

          <p>A Chinese student's graduation speech at Harvard University, emphasizing "shared humanity" and global unity, has gained significant attention, particularly in light of escalating US-China tensions. The speech was delivered on the same day that a federal judge blocked a Department of Homeland Security order that sought to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students. The Trump administration has pledged to "aggressively" revoke student visas for Chinese nationals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in critical fields, raising concerns about espionage and national security. The student's message of unity stands in contrast to the political climate.</p>

          <p>The women of the "No Sex for Fish" cooperative in Kenya, who gained independence by rejecting sexual exploitation in exchange for fish, are now facing significant challenges due to disastrous floods and U.S. aid cutbacks. The floods have destroyed their village and disrupted their fishing business, while aid reductions have created anxiety about access to anti-retroviral drugs needed to manage HIV. Eleven of the women are HIV positive, and they have experienced changes in the frequency of drug supplies, leading to increased hardship and uncertainty. Despite assurances from the Trump administration, there are conflicting narratives about the impact of the aid cutbacks on the availability of life-saving medications.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, though critics argue that night vision devices are more practical and powerful.</p>

          <p>Analysts are scrutinizing Nvidia's recent quarterly performance, suggesting that Wall Street may be overlooking key issues. Despite reporting adjusted earnings per share of $0.81, which falls short of the estimated $0.93, the company presented a second adjusted EPS figure of $0.96, excluding charges related to its diminished China business due to Trump's chip export controls. While CEO Jensen Huang emphasized strong demand for AI chips and CFO Colette Kress predicted profit margins would return to normal levels later in the year, some analysts believe the company's challenges in China warrant greater attention. The article suggests that Nvidia's historical success may be influencing analysts to downplay current difficulties. (not investment advice)</p>

This funding is particularly crucial for universities outside Tokyo facing budget constraints, despite growing criticism of Japan's increasing defense spending. The program, which began in fiscal 2015, has expanded to include large-scale research projects, attracting universities working on advanced technologies like harmful gas absorption and cyberattack detection.

This change underscores North Korea's increasing focus on space as a strategic domain, highlighted by its claim of successfully placing a reconnaissance satellite into orbit in 2023.

          <p>A new report from Insurify identifies the car models with the highest accident rates in the U.S., with the Kia Soul EV topping the list. The report suggests that factors such as vehicle type, design, safety features, and driver demographics contribute to accident rates. Electric vehicles, including the Chevrolet Bolt EUV and Volkswagen ID.4, also rank high, potentially due to the instant torque of electric motors. Cars with higher accident rates often cost more to insure, as insurers consider risk data when setting premiums.</p>

The show is roughly based on the book Living With Our Dead, by Delphine Horvilleur, which argues for a more liberal form of Judaism.
