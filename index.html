In the lead-up, Israeli airstrikes have intensified, with Hamas-run health officials reporting significant casualties in Gaza City.

          <p>The Trump administration is evaluating a list of 11 potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair, with his term ending in May. The list includes previously unmentioned names such as Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside figures like Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. According to sources, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will conduct interviews to narrow down the choices for the president's final decision. The extensive list and deliberative process suggest a decision is not imminent, potentially avoiding market disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates has triggered a significant 23% weekly increase in refinancing applications, marking the strongest week for the activity since last April. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.67%, prompting many homeowners to seek savings. Notably, there was also a 25% jump in applications for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which carry more risk but currently offer lower initial rates. Despite the refinancing boom, applications for new home purchases saw only a minor 1% increase, indicating high home prices remain a barrier. (not investment advice)</p>

For decades, families of those who disappeared during the country's civil war have lived without answers, and each new discovery brings fresh trauma and fear. Activists and human rights lawyers express little faith in domestic accountability mechanisms, even under the new government. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has noted that Sri Lankans are looking for international assistance due to a lack of trust in local processes.</p>

          <p>Shares of Mediterranean fast-casual chain Cava dropped over 20% after the company lowered its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth. The new projection is 4% to 6%, down from a previous range of 6% to 8%, following a disappointing second quarter where same-store sales grew just 2.1%, far below Wall Street's 6.1% estimate. Cava's management attributed the slowdown to the difficult comparison with the previous year's successful launch of its grilled steak option. The news reflects a broader trend of slowing sales in the fast-casual sector, affecting competitors like Chipotle and Sweetgreen.</p>

Hansen told Fox News Digital that surviving a heart attack and a severe infection has made him more fearful of the risks of fishing and more appreciative of his time with family. He recounted a particularly close call with an infection that could have been fatal had he been at sea. While not ready to retire, the veteran fisherman says his priorities have shifted towards spending more time with his wife and grandchildren.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, small towns from Virginia to Washington are canceling popular Latino cultural festivals due to a widespread climate of fear surrounding potential raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Organizers say the risk of ICE targeting these events undermines their purpose of creating safe, celebratory community spaces. These cancellations have significant economic consequences, depriving local authorities of permit fees and hurting small, immigrant-owned businesses that rely on the festivals for substantial income. The trend highlights the deep-seated anxiety within Latino communities, even among legal residents and citizens, amid the administration's intensified deportation efforts.</p>

Nvidia and AMD will be permitted to sell advanced chips to China in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% share of their revenue from that market. Meanwhile, Apple announced a plan to increase its U.S. investment to $600 billion, a move seen as a successful bid to avoid tariffs on its products. Analysts suggest this flurry of deal-making highlights the significant negative impact of tariffs on Big Tech's profits and may trigger a domino effect across the industry.

The movie centers on Justine (Julia Garner), a single schoolteacher who becomes the prime suspect and is branded a witch by her community, which struggles to comprehend the unexplainable event. The article analyzes how the film taps into a long-standing trope in horror and pop culture where single women are depicted as unstable threats to the social order. Despite the harassment she faces, Justine emerges as the film's resilient heroine, determined to uncover the truth while navigating a world that vilifies her independence.</p>

One key strategy discussed was avoiding a narrowly defined customer profile to maintain broad appeal.

          <p>TikTok has removed an account that was being used to share videos on how to illegally cross the English Channel in a small boat. The user, who is believed to have recently arrived in the UK, gained hundreds of thousands of views by live-streaming from a UK asylum hotel and advising others on making the dangerous journey. TikTok stated it has a zero-tolerance policy for content promoting human smuggling and is working with the UK's National Crime Agency to disrupt such activities. The UK government is introducing new legislation to make it easier to prosecute individuals who promote illegal crossings online.</p>

          <p>The domestic abuse charity Refuge has reported an alarming increase in violent threats and strangulation incidents targeting young women and girls aged 16-25 in Britain. According to the charity's data from April 2024 to March 2025, around half of the young women receiving its support who experienced physical violence were subjected to strangulation or suffocation, a 9% rise from the previous year. Refuge is calling for a major societal shift, including better education in schools about the red flags of abuse, and for the government to strengthen support for young people in its upcoming strategy on violence against women and girls.</p>

The protest, organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, was attended by around 80 people who expressed anger over Vance's past criticisms of the U.K. and the current U.S. administration's policies on international conflicts.

          <p>A Catholic priest in Alabama, Robert Sullivan, is under investigation by the Diocese of Birmingham after a woman alleged he engaged in a years-long arrangement of "private companionship" including sex in exchange for financial support, beginning when she was 17. The accuser, Heather Jones, claims Sullivan later paid her a significant sum to ensure her silence, providing bank records to support her account. The diocese has reported the matter to the Vatican and state authorities, though it's unclear if a criminal probe will proceed.

          <p>Sophie Elmhirst's new book, "A Marriage at Sea," tells the incredible story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, who survived for nearly four months adrift in the Pacific Ocean after a whale sank their sailboat in 1972. The couple endured starvation and illness in a tiny inflatable raft, their survival hinging on their resourcefulness and, crucially, their support for one another. The article explores how their shared ordeal, and their constant planning for a future sailing trip, became a form of "shared meaning" that strengthened their bond. Their story offers a profound, if extreme, example of how a shared purpose can help a relationship endure unimaginable hardship.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by the September 2022 mini-budget, the average interest rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen to 4.99%. Financial data provider Moneyfacts described the drop below the 5% threshold as a "symbolic turning point" that indicates increased competition among lenders. This provides some relief for the 1.6 million borrowers whose fixed-rate deals are set to expire this year. However, with inflation forecast to spike again, analysts suggest that while rates are responding to Bank of England cuts, they are unlikely to fall substantially further. (not investment advice)</p>

The move aims to combat misinformation and is a response to public pressure and accusations that authorities have withheld such details in sensitive cases, such as the alleged sexual assault of a child in Warwickshire. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the guidance as a step toward greater transparency. However, some critics, including a former police chief, warn of unintended consequences, such as creating an expectation for disclosure in every case.</p>

          <p>Scientists are analyzing data from the devastating magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck Myanmar in March 2025 to improve future earthquake forecasting. A new study published in PNAS used data from the quake, which revealed a rapid, "pulse-like" rupture along the Sagaing Fault, to create a computer model. The model incorporates a "memory effect" of past tectonic changes and confirmed that a highly destructive "supershear" rupture was anticipated. While precise earthquake prediction remains impossible, researchers hope that such models can refine probabilistic forecasts about the timing, magnitude, and extent of future seismic events, aiding in disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>Canadian farmers are facing significant uncertainty after China imposed a preliminary 75.8% duty on canola seed imports, escalating a year-long trade dispute. The surprise move has caused grain buyers to halt new purchases, leaving farmers concerned about selling their crops as harvest season approaches. China is Canada's largest market for canola seed, with exports valued at nearly C$5 billion in 2024, and replacing this demand will be extremely difficult. The action has thrown the market into confusion and sent futures prices tumbling, creating financial pressure on growers who need to cover their operational costs.</p>

          <p>This article explores a trend toward safe, generic designs in modern soccer, from the 2026 World Cup logo to new club crests like that of Denver Summit FC. The author contrasts this with the iconic, culturally-infused work of designer Lance Wyman for the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, which is held up as a benchmark for bold, timeless sports branding. While acknowledging the talent of prolific modern designers like Matthew Wolff, the piece suggests that the design process has become committee-driven, leading to less artistic and more corporate-feeling results. This shift, the article argues, can rob a brand of its unique character and edge.</p>

The author contends that Israel has a pattern of baselessly accusing journalists of terrorism to justify targeting them, noting that at least 26 of the 184 Palestinian journalists killed since the war began are believed to have been deliberately targeted. The piece criticizes the muted response from the international community and journalism organizations, arguing that this inaction has emboldened Israel and risks closing the world's window into the conflict in Gaza.</p>
