Following an opening 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par as he seeks his first PGA Tour victory. When play was stopped due to lightning, Collin Morikawa and Akshay Bhatia were tied for second place at nine under.

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15. The summit is scheduled around a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, with the potential for heavy secondary sanctions on Russia's trade partners if a deal is not reached. The meeting is a central element of Trump's foreign policy goal to end the war, though the specific terms of a potential peace agreement remain a major point of contention. Trump has suggested that a deal could involve a "swapping of territories."</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has opened several "warm-hearted convenience stores" as an innovative approach to combatting rising social isolation and loneliness among its residents. These centers provide a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere where visitors can receive free ramen, use massage chairs, and connect with social workers and other people. The initiative has proven far more popular than expected, attracting 20,000 visitors since March, many of whom are young adults. The program aims to address the growing issue of single-person households and "lonely deaths" in a rapidly changing South Korean society.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has stated that he "can't involve" forward Alexander Isak with the first team at present. This decision follows the club's rejection of a £110m bid from Liverpool after Isak expressed a desire to explore other options. While Isak is not injured, he has been instructed to train separately from the rest of the squad. Howe expressed a desire for the player to be part of the team but indicated the situation is unlikely to change before the season opener, creating uncertainty around the star striker's future.</p>

The new variant XFG, also known as "Stratus," is contributing to the summer surge, becoming the third-most common strain. This trend aligns with the seasonal summer spikes seen in previous years, though the rise in cases coincides with the termination of federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore allowing alternative investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies, within 401(k) retirement plans.

While supporters praise the potential for growth, experts caution that adoption by employers may be slow due to concerns about complexity, cost, and fiduciary responsibility under ERISA regulations.

Through archival footage, personal writings, and interviews with his mother and close confidantes, the documentary details his upbringing, his relationship with his famous father Tim Buckley, and his struggles with sudden fame.

This article argues that Netanyahu's decision is primarily driven by his need to appease the hard-right, pro-settler parties in his narrow coalition, whose goal is the annexation of Gaza. While Netanyahu claims the occupation is temporary, critics fear it is a trap that will drain military resources and lead to more casualties. The analysis suggests that without external pressure, Netanyahu will likely continue to follow the agenda of his far-right allies to ensure his political survival.</p>

          <p>A recent trend of fans throwing sex toys onto the court during WNBA games has prompted condemnation from players and the league. In multiple incidents, games have been paused after objects were tossed from the stands, with players calling the acts "super disrespectful" and a dangerous distraction. A meme-coin group has claimed responsibility for some of the disruptions, stating they were publicity stunts, though not all incidents appear to be linked. The WNBA has stated that any fan caught throwing objects will be banned from the league and face prosecution, with two arrests having been made so far.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a regional divergence in home prices, with declines concentrated in the South and West while prices continue to rise in the Northeast and Midwest. According to a Realtor.com report, cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops from their 2022 peaks due to increased housing inventory from a pandemic-era building boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest face tight inventory, which keeps upward pressure on prices. This split market dynamic means that homebuyers and sellers are facing vastly different conditions depending on their location. (not investment advice)</p>

Coach Lincoln Riley confirmed that Brown will be out for "the first few games," a significant blow to the team's defense. Brown was considered a favorite to start at the slot corner position, and his absence will put more pressure on younger defensive backs to step up. His injury timeline remains uncertain, but the team is hopeful for his return at some point during the season.</p>
