        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to increasing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, affluent Chinese investors are diverting their capital away from the U.S. real estate market. In 2024, Thailand, Australia, and Canada emerged as the preferred destinations for Chinese buyers seeking homes priced above US$5 million. This shift marks a significant change from 2023, when the U.S. was the top choice. Factors such as geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals have contributed to this trend, leading Chinese investors to seek friendlier alternatives.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise to provide school choice for Texas families. The program allows parents to use public funds for private school tuition, home-schooling, and virtual learning programs, with families receiving $10,000 per year and children with disabilities qualifying for up to $30,000. While supporters argue it will provide more options for students in underperforming public schools, critics contend that it will drain resources from public education and benefit wealthy families. The program is capped at $1 billion for the first year and could cost up to $4.5 billion by 2030.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift from a coalition government in his first term to a royal court in his second. Unlike Marco Rubio and Doug Burgum, Vance was deeply aligned with the MAGA movement and favored loyalty over dissent. Klein contends that this choice demonstrated Trump's preference for enforcers and loyalists over moderating forces, leading to a presidency defined by recklessness and a lack of internal checks and balances. The column suggests that Vance's selection was a moment that revealed Trump's second term would be defined by ferocity and recklessness.</p>

While purchased passports are now prohibited, "golden visas," which offer residency permits for real estate investments, remain a viable option for accessing the Schengen zone.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a ruling that would have allowed Voice of America (VOA) employees to return to work, creating disarray for the broadcaster. The publicly funded broadcaster had been largely shut down following an executive order by then President Donald Trump. The appeals court determined that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to order the employees' return. The decision leaves the future of VOA uncertain.</p>
