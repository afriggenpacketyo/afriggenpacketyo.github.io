          <p>Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura underwent cross-examination in the federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial against Sean "Diddy" Combs, detailing group sexual encounters, drug use, and her feelings toward Combs. Combs' attorney presented text messages suggesting a loving relationship and Ventura's anticipation of "freak-offs," which Ventura described as Combs instructing her to take drugs and have sex with male prostitutes while he watched. Ventura stated the texts were "just words" and that she sometimes initiated acts out of fear, attempting to manage the situations and please Combs, while also stating that the "freak-offs" felt like a job. The defense also questioned Ventura about jealousy and infidelity within the relationship.</p>

          <p>Economists warn that Europe must adapt quickly to avoid becoming a 'shock absorber' in the evolving US-China trade landscape. While recent talks have led to a temporary reduction in tariffs, the long-term outlook for Europe is bleak if it fails to integrate politically and coordinate fiscal and industrial policies. Without deeper integration, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes, potentially hindering its ambition to become a 'third pole' in a bipolar world.</p>

          <h2>NYU Withholds Diploma of Graduate Who Condemned Gaza War in Speech</h2>

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of a graduate, Logan Rozos, who used his graduation speech to condemn the Gaza war and accuse the US of supporting "genocide." NYU accused Rozos of abusing a privilege to express personal political views. Pro-Palestinian advocacy on college campuses has become heavily politicized, and NYU is one of ten universities being investigated for incidents on campus since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023. The university spokesman said Mr Rozos' diploma would be withheld while NYU pursued disciplinary action against him.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Researchers found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges occurring in both directions. The studied fossils included Dalianensis horses, named after the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, which had a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations.</p>

Syria's transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, citing the inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct war-ravaged cities, and rebuild its healthcare system. Relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions.</p>
