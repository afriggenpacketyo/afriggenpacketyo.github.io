          <p>Israel has identified the remains of two hostages, Ronen Engel and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, whose bodies were handed over by Hamas as part of a recent ceasefire agreement. The deal, brokered by the U.S., involves Hamas releasing all hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Tensions have emerged over the implementation of the peace plan, with both sides accusing each other of violations and disputes arising over the reopening of the critical Rafah border crossing. The process of recovering and identifying all deceased hostages remains a complex and ongoing challenge amid the devastation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, titled "Nobody's Girl," details her experiences after being recruited into Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring at age 16. The book, co-authored with journalist Amy Wallace, recounts her abuse by Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and other powerful men, including her settled lawsuit against Britain's Prince Andrew. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, also discusses her personal struggles, including alleged abuse by her father and a contentious custody battle over her children. The memoir serves as her final account in a lifelong fight for justice for herself and other survivors.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a major initiative to create 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, aiming to double employment in renewables to 860,000 within five years. The plan focuses on training workers for high-demand roles like plumbers and electricians, with new technical colleges and tailored programs for veterans and ex-offenders. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the strategy is designed to lower energy bills long-term and create well-paid, secure jobs in industrial heartlands. The plan has received support from unions, though it faces criticism over the current high cost of electricity.</p>

          <p>As Las Vegas experiences a decline in tourism, a debate is unfolding over its suitability as a vacation spot for families with children. While the city's official travel guide promotes numerous activities for kids, some visitors and online commentators express discomfort with seeing children in smoke-filled casinos and adult-oriented environments. Others argue that Vegas offers good family entertainment but is becoming prohibitively expensive for that demographic. The discussion highlights the city's ongoing struggle to balance its "Sin City" identity with efforts to attract a broader, family-oriented market to revive slumping visitor numbers.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close after several thieves disguised as construction workers stole priceless jewelry from the Apollo Gallery. The suspects broke in on Sunday morning, smashed display cases with small chainsaws, and escaped on motorcycles with at least nine pieces once belonging to Emperor Napoleon. French officials described the items as having "inestimable heritage and historical value" and called the seven-minute robbery a highly organized operation. An investigation is underway by a special police unit, and the museum was shut down to preserve evidence at the scene.</p>

          <p>This opinion article commends two federal district court judges for blocking the Trump administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges, Karin Immergut in Portland and April Perry in Chicago, ruled that the administration's justifications for the deployments were "untethered to the facts" and not conceived in good faith. The author contrasts their actions with what they describe as the Supreme Court's deference to the president, arguing the judges upheld the rule of law against potential military overreach. The article frames these rulings as a crucial defense of constitutional principles against authoritarian tendencies.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has indicated that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While not confirming a specific policy ahead of the November Budget, Miliband acknowledged the financial pressure on families and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." This potential move comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, which have remained high since the 2021 price spike. The long-term strategy, Miliband emphasized, remains a transition to home-grown clean energy to achieve lasting bill reductions.</p>

          <p>In war-torn regions of Ukraine, communities are constructing schools deep underground to provide children with a safe, in-person learning environment away from the constant threat of Russian drone and missile attacks. For years, many Ukrainian children, especially in the east, have only attended school via Zoom, leading to significant learning loss, social isolation, and psychological trauma. This "underground generation" now learns in reinforced concrete bunkers designed to mimic natural light and normalcy. The effort reflects a grim acceptance that the war will continue for years and a determined commitment to preserving the education and well-being of the nation's youth.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Tax Policies May Eliminate Federal Income Tax for Many Americans</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The significant overhaul of the national tax code under the Trump administration could result in millions of Americans having a federal income tax liability of zero. By maximizing available deductions and tax credits, certain families may find their entire bill eliminated. However, the article notes several caveats, including that a $0 federal income tax bill does not account for federal payroll taxes or state and local taxes, which could rise. Furthermore, increased import tariffs may offset some income tax savings, potentially costing taxpayers thousands more annually, according to the Tax Policy Center. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rising popularity of pickleball has been accompanied by a significant increase in eye injuries related to the sport, according to a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that such injuries, including corneal abrasions and lacerations, have been increasing by over 400 cases annually, with adults over 50 being the most affected group. The study's authors call for the development of standardized guidelines for protective eyewear, which could prevent up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries. The findings highlight a growing public health concern and the need for greater safety awareness among players.</p>

          <p>Roman Surovtsev, who came to the U.S. from the former Soviet Union as a refugee at age four, is fighting deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). After a past criminal conviction revoked his green card, ICE is attempting to send him to Ukraine, a country that cannot confirm his citizenship and where he has never lived. Surovtsev, who is considered stateless, was detained during a routine check-in as part of the administration's increased deportation targets. His case, supported by a legal team, highlights the human complexities and due process challenges within the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>The daughter of Ronen Engel, one of the hostages killed on October 7, 2023, shared that her father is "finally home" after his remains were returned by Hamas as part of a ceasefire deal. Mr. Engel, a photographer, and Thai farm worker Sonthaya Akrasri were the latest of the deceased hostages to be returned to Israel. The process has been slow, causing outrage in Israel, with Hamas claiming difficulty in locating bodies amid the rubble in Gaza. The delay has prompted Israel's government to keep the vital Rafah border crossing closed, adding another point of tension to the fragile ceasefire agreement.</p>

This development comes just after the prince announced he would give up his royal titles, including Duke of York.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, memory functions less like a file cabinet for facts and more like a tool for shaping the narrative of our lives. In an interview about his book "Why We Remember," he explains that memory helps us understand the present and plan for the future, making forgetting as crucial as remembering. He discusses how emotion prioritizes what we recall, why traumatic memories persist, and how our "remembering self" often dictates our satisfaction with past experiences. This perspective reframes memory as a dynamic, constructive process that defines our identity.</p>

Unions have filed dozens of lawsuits to challenge executive orders aimed at firing employees, stripping protections from over a million workers, and dismantling federal agencies. These legal battles are framed by union leaders and legal experts as a crucial defense not only of workers' rights but of democratic institutions and a nonpartisan civil service. A recent court victory temporarily blocked mass layoffs, showcasing the significant role unions are playing in this ongoing conflict.</p>
