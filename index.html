          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share amid economic headwinds by focusing on value-oriented promotions. CEO Russell Weiner stated the company is successfully attracting diners from competitors, including low-income customers, by offering deals on popular items, unlike rivals who discount less desirable products. While the company reported strong same-store sales growth, its overall earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its China licensee. The strategy hinges on providing perceived better value than both fast-food rivals and eating at home. (not investment advice)</p>

Following a report about a note from Trump in an Epstein birthday book and the DOJ's statement that no "co-conspirator" list exists, Trump has revived conflicts with Barack Obama and the Washington Commanders. The strategy appears aimed at shifting the narrative away from his long-documented association with Epstein and creating a unifying "us vs. them" dynamic for his base.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has restructured the leadership of its advanced technology research group, which focuses on quantum computing and other emerging fields. The bank has hired Rob Otter, formerly the global head of digital technology and quantum computing at State Street, to lead the division. This move follows the departure of the group's previous head, Marco Pistoia, a former IBM inventor who had led the team since 2020. The change in leadership signals a continued focus by the financial giant on harnessing the potential of quantum technology, which is expected to have significant applications in finance.</p>

The administration is demanding the university alter its policies on admissions, hiring, and diversity programs to combat alleged antisemitism. Harvard argues the White House is infringing on its constitutional right to academic freedom and has not followed proper procedures for suspending funds. In a Boston courtroom, a federal judge questioned the government's lack of clear procedure, noting the "staggering" constitutional implications of its actions in attempting to control the university's internal operations.</p>

          <p>With college costs steadily rising, many students rely on federal student loans, but it's crucial to understand their borrowing limits. This article provides a breakdown of the maximum annual and lifetime amounts available, which vary based on dependency status, year in school, and whether a student is an undergraduate or graduate. For instance, a dependent first-year undergrad can borrow up to $5,500 annually, while the lifetime limit for all undergraduate loans is $31,000. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, students often need to explore private loans to bridge the remaining financial gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Texas Legislature is holding a special session to redraw the state's congressional map, an effort reportedly pushed by President Trump's team to bolster the GOP's thin majority in the U.S. House. The move is unusual as it comes mid-decade, years after the post-census redistricting was completed. While the Justice Department has raised concerns about racial gerrymandering in the current map, critics argue the new effort is a purely political maneuver to secure more Republican seats. This strategy is legally and politically risky, as it will likely face immediate court challenges and could backfire in a demographically changing state.</p>

Recommended strategies include creating physical distance from the device, such as leaving it out of the bedroom, and reducing its rewarding nature by turning off notifications or using a black-and-white screen. For more severe cases, therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction and retrain compulsive behaviors.</p>
