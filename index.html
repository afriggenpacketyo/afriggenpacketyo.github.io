          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest has sacked manager Ange Postecoglou a mere 39 days after his appointment, making him one of the shortest-serving managers in the league's history. The dismissal followed an eighth consecutive game without a win, with the club's owner acting swiftly after a defeat to Chelsea. The article suggests the swift change was due to a combination of poor results and players struggling to adapt to Postecoglou's high-pressing style, which was a significant departure from his predecessor's tactics, leaving the club in a state of uncertainty.</p>

The family was reportedly attempting to inspect their home in the Zeitoun neighborhood during the ongoing ceasefire. The Israeli military stated that its soldiers fired upon a "suspicious vehicle" that approached their troops after crossing a demarcation line. This event marks the deadliest single incident involving Israeli forces in the region since the ceasefire began eight days ago.</p>

          <p>Public funeral events for Kenya's former Prime Minister and opposition leader, Raila Odinga, have been marked by tragedy, with dozens of mourners injured during a public viewing in Kisumu. This follows the deaths of at least five other people in stampedes and security force actions at previous memorials in Nairobi. The immense crowds surged to see the coffin of the 80-year-old political giant, overwhelming security personnel. Odinga was a major figure in Kenyan politics for decades, serving as prime minister and running for president five times.</p>

          <p>A minor ground collision occurred at Chicago's O'Hare airport when a United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft while heading to its gate. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who deplaned normally after a delay. The incident adds to recent concerns about aviation safety in the U.S., following several other runway collisions and near-misses at major airports. The stationary plane's horizontal stabilizer was struck in the low-speed event.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the White House for a lack of coordination and disregard for public safety, labeling the event as reckless. The military insisted safety precautions were in place, but state authorities proceeded with the closure over concerns about driver distraction and potential danger from the overhead ordnance.</p>

          <p>The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center reported that a ship has caught fire in the Gulf of Aden after being hit by an unidentified projectile. The incident occurred approximately 130 miles east of Aden, Yemen, a region where Houthi rebels have frequently targeted international shipping. According to a maritime security firm, the vessel is a Cameroon-flagged tanker, and radio communications indicated that the crew was preparing to abandon the ship while a search-and-rescue operation was initiated.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving their children smartphones until at least age 16 and to avoid social media until the same age to promote better mental health outcomes. She recommends that parents begin teaching responsible technology use and establishing firm ground rules when children are in late elementary school. Key strategies include banning phones from bedrooms overnight, using parental controls to limit screen time, and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone for calls and texts only.</p>

          <p>Michael Berkowitz, a former commodities trader, successfully launched the luxury apparel brand Norwegian Wool from his Bronx apartment with a $50,000 personal investment. He identified a gap in the market for coats that blend high-end Italian style with the warmth needed for harsh winters. After testing his first prototype in a supermarket's walk-in freezer, he built the brand into a profitable company whose coats are now sold in over 100 stores and worn by financiers, politicians, and billionaires.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rule is causing distress and uncertainty for transgender and non-binary travelers. The policy requires airlines to disregard the "X" gender marker on passports and instead input either "M" for male or "F" for female into their systems. While passports with an "X" marker remain legally valid, advocates fear the discrepancy will empower individual agents to subject travelers to invasive questioning, delays, and discriminatory treatment, creating significant barriers to international travel.</p>

          <p>Investor Warren Buffett outlines his framework for investing by dividing assets into three categories: currency-denominated items like bonds, non-productive assets like gold, and productive assets like businesses and farms. He strongly favors productive assets because they generate intrinsic value and deliver tangible returns over time. In his view, gold is a speculative item whose value depends entirely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future, rather than on any inherent ability to produce anything.

          <p>A notable political gender divide is emerging among Gen Z Americans, with young women identifying as the most left-leaning demographic in recent U.S. history while their male peers trend more conservative. The article suggests this shift is driven by a feeling among young women that their material well-being, health, and safety are directly threatened by current political and economic conditions. This has led to a deep disillusionment with mainstream political parties and a rejection of moderate positions in favor of more staunchly leftist ideologies.</p>
