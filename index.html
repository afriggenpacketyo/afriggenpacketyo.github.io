          <p>Despite bipartisan support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Congressional Republicans are deferring to President Trump before negotiating a permanent legislative solution. The program, which protects approximately half a million individuals brought to the U.S. illegally as children, faces an uncertain future as the administration expands its mass deportation initiatives. While some Republican lawmakers have introduced bills to provide a pathway to legal status, most agree that progress is unlikely without a clear directive from the White House. Immigration advocates express concern that DACA recipients could be targeted, even as administration officials state they are not a priority for enforcement.</p>

          <p>Faced with home prices that have surged over 50% since 2020, a growing number of Americans are teaming up with friends or relatives to enter the housing market. This trend, known as co-buying, allows individuals to pool their financial resources to overcome significant affordability challenges, particularly for single buyers who are at a disadvantage compared to couples. While the arrangement offers a path to homeownership and companionship, it also presents unique legal and financial complexities. Housing experts strongly advise co-buyers to create a formal written agreement to navigate potential future disagreements regarding property taxes, maintenance, or selling the home.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a major overnight aerial attack on Ukraine, targeting the capital city of Kyiv and several other regions with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles. The bombardment, one of the most significant in recent months, resulted in at least four deaths in Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl, and injured dozens across the country. Civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, a medical facility, and a kindergarten, were struck during the prolonged assault. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a "vile" act that demonstrates Russia's desire to continue the conflict and called for international pressure on Moscow.</p>

The storm, which previously caused fatalities and flooding in the Philippines, is expected to make landfall with powerful winds and heavy rain. In preparation, four coastal airports have been closed, fishing boats have been recalled to harbor, and thousands of troops have been mobilized for assistance. The national weather agency has warned that the fast-moving typhoon could trigger multiple simultaneous disasters, including flash floods, landslides, and significant coastal inundation in a country highly vulnerable to such events.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that China's semiconductor industry is extremely close to matching U.S. capabilities, describing the gap as being mere "nanoseconds." Speaking on a recent podcast, Huang emphasized China's deep talent pool, competitive work culture, and vibrant high-tech industry as reasons for its rapid advancement. He argued that to maintain its lead and maximize economic influence, the United States should allow its tech companies to compete globally, including in the Chinese market. Huang expressed his belief that it is in China's best interest to remain open to foreign investment and competition.</p>

          <p>Moldovans are voting in a critical parliamentary election that will determine the nation's future alignment with either the European Union or Russia. The pro-EU ruling party, led by President Maia Sandu, faces a strong challenge from pro-Russian opposition parties, with polls suggesting it may lose its majority. President Sandu has accused Russia of "massive interference" in the election, alleging that Moscow is spending hundreds of millions to finance parties and bribe voters to destabilize the country. The election is being closely watched as a barometer of Russian influence in Eastern Europe, particularly given the strategic importance of the breakaway region of Transnistria.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system, after a previous proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses those issues by making the e-ID system entirely optional and keeping it under public control, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the system will streamline many bureaucratic and commercial processes, from signing contracts to age verification. However, opponents remain concerned about potential privacy erosion and data misuse, though recent polls suggest voters may be more receptive this time.</p>

          <p>Four prominent figures from a Scottish organized crime group have been arrested in Dubai, escalating a violent, decades-long feud between the Lyons and Daniel crime families. The detained men, including Steven Lyons, are believed to be linked to drug importation and a recent surge of violence across central Scotland. This international development highlights the global reach of the feud, which originated in Glasgow and has involved numerous tit-for-tat attacks, kidnappings, and murders since 2001. The arrests in the UAE, a location previously seen as a safe haven for such criminals, raise questions about potential extradition and future cooperation between international law enforcement agencies.</p>

Before the Sunday singles matches, each team captain secretly submits the name of one player in a sealed envelope. If a player from the opposing team has to withdraw due to injury or illness, the player named in the envelope also sits out, and the match is declared a tie with each team receiving half a point. Hovland's potential absence from his scheduled singles match could impact the final outcome, as Europe needs only a few points to secure victory.</p>

          <p>The breakaway region of Transnistria remains a significant source of instability as Moldova navigates its political future between Russia and the West. This narrow strip of land, which declared independence after a brief war in 1992, is not internationally recognized but hosts approximately 1,500 Russian troops and a large Soviet-era weapons arsenal. The pro-Russian separatist regime operates as a Soviet-style dictatorship, effectively controlled by an oligarchic group with ties to Russian intelligence. The territory serves as a military and operational base for Moscow, complicating Moldova's sovereignty and its aspirations for European Union integration, making it a central issue in the country's recent elections.</p>

While their methods differ, both leaders share a hostility towards the EU, international law, and multiculturalism, while promoting ultranationalist and hard-right populist movements across the continent. The author argues that this pincer movement manifests through political interference, economic pressure like tariffs and cyber-attacks, and a cultural war against progressive values.

The storm is forecast to impact Hainan before making landfall in Vietnam, affecting coastal areas across southern China. This is the second major storm to threaten the region in quick succession.</p>

          <p>Graham Potter has been sacked as manager of West Ham United after just eight months, following a poor run of results that left the team 19th in the Premier League. This marks Potter's second dismissal in a short period, having previously been let go by Chelsea after seven months. Once considered a potential successor for the England national team manager role, Potter's reputation has been damaged by his struggles at high-pressure clubs. Despite a successful period at Brighton where he was known for meticulous coaching and team building, he failed to replicate that success in the more chaotic environments of his subsequent appointments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sweeping economic and military sanctions on Iran through the "snapback" mechanism of the 2015 nuclear deal. The measure, triggered by the UK, France, and Germany, comes in response to Iran's continued nuclear escalation and lack of cooperation with international inspectors. This development further strains Iran's already struggling economy, where the currency has hit a record low and food prices are soaring, causing widespread anxiety among the population. The sanctions freeze Iranian assets, halt arms deals, and penalize its ballistic missile program, compounding fears of renewed conflict and internal repression.</p>

          <p>Despite having one of the tallest squads in the Premier League, Newcastle United has struggled to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season. The team, which has added a specialized set-piece coach, has only scored once from a corner or free-kick, a stark contrast to their upcoming opponents, Arsenal, who lead the league in this area. Manager Eddie Howe has taken responsibility for the issue, stating that something is "not quite clicking" despite having the right players and delivery. The article explores the team's tactical shifts, including an increased use of long throws, as they seek to capitalize on their physical advantages in dead-ball situations.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's TikTok Deal May Represent a Strategic Victory for China</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent deal structuring TikTok's U.S. operations may not fully sever Chinese influence and could be a strategic win for Beijing. While the framework appears to place American data and servers under U.S. control, a closer look reveals that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, will remain the single largest shareholder in the U.S. entity. The author suggests that despite increased U.S. ownership, this arrangement leaves China with significant leverage over the popular social media platform. The article concludes that what is being presented as a victory for the Trump administration might ultimately serve China's long-term strategic interests.</p>

          <p>This opinion column responds to recent controversial claims about autism from the Trump administration by highlighting positive traits often associated with autistic people. The author argues that qualities such as a capacity for intense focus, adherence to facts, a strong sense of social justice, and profound empathy stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump's public behavior. The article criticizes the framing of autism as a tragedy in need of a cure, instead celebrating the unique perspectives and strengths within the autistic community. It suggests that the world could learn valuable lessons from the joy, love, and honesty demonstrated by many autistic individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the MLB regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are finalizing their roster for the wild-card series, with several key questions remaining. The health of players like Max Muncy and Will Smith is a primary concern, but the team must also decide on the composition of its pitching staff. The bullpen has an abundance of left-handed relievers, and the team is considering options to add right-handed depth, potentially by using starter Tyler Glasnow in a relief role. Meanwhile, late-season performances from veterans like Kiké Hernández could secure them a spot, forcing difficult choices among the position players before the postseason begins.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is confronting its history by dedicating a new, prominent monument to the victims of the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre. In that event, a mob of European migrant miners killed 28 Chinese laborers and burned down their community. This public acknowledgment, which includes an ongoing archaeological dig at the site of the former Chinatown, marks a significant shift for the town. The commemoration occurs at a time of national debate over immigration, with local officials noting the irony of honoring past immigrants while current state and local policies align with stricter federal enforcement measures.</p>
