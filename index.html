          <h2>US Homesellers Withdraw Properties Amid Stagnant Market and Price Resistance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 18:03:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Realtor.com report highlights a significant increase in US homesellers withdrawing their properties from the market, with delistings up 38% since early 2025 and 48% from a year ago. This trend is driven by sellers' frustration with slow sales and their reluctance to lower asking prices, creating a potential deadlock in the housing market. Many homeowners, often locked into favorable mortgage rates, are choosing to wait for conditions that meet their expectations rather than accepting reduced offers. Despite a growing supply of homes in certain areas, high prices and elevated mortgage rates continue to deter prospective buyers, contributing to stagnant sales and a prolonged holding pattern, with sellers' pricing expectations slower to adjust after the pandemic-era boom.</p>

          <p>Australian Open champion Madison Keys experienced a shock first-round defeat at the US Open, losing to world number 82 Renata Zarazua in a match plagued by her own errors. The sixth seed, competing in New York for the first time as a Grand Slam winner, cited intense nerves as the primary reason for her 6-7 (10-12) 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 loss, which she described as "paralysing." Keys accumulated 89 unforced errors and 14 double faults, struggling to maintain consistent play throughout the three-hour, ten-minute contest. This unexpected exit follows a similar early departure from Wimbledon, raising questions about her form since her major title win.</p>

          <p>Major military powers, including China and the United States, continue to invest significantly in costly crewed military systems, such as sixth-generation fighter jets, despite rapid advancements in drone and robot technology. Analysts contend that while autonomous weapons offer benefits like reducing human casualties and costs, human decision-making and direct involvement remain crucial for complex combat operations. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has advocated for accelerated drone adoption, and the US has even proposed a "hellscape" strategy involving drone swarms for Taiwan's defense. However, the article emphasizes that drones are currently redefining military roles rather than entirely replacing human personnel on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada pleaded guilty in a US federal court to charges including money laundering and drug trafficking, facing a mandatory life sentence. This long-awaited plea has ignited significant speculation that Zambada, who admitted his organization fostered corruption by paying off Mexican police, military, and politicians, may now reveal high-level secrets about systemic corruption. Despite his lawyer's denial of cooperation, Zambada's family history of assisting US authorities and his four decades at the cartel's helm suggest he possesses invaluable information. Such revelations could profoundly impact US-Mexico relations, as the US seeks to target corrupt political figures more than just drug traffickers.</p>

          <p>Starbucks officially launched its fall menu, prominently featuring the return of its highly anticipated Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) on Tuesday, August 26. The PSL, first introduced over two decades ago, is the company's most popular seasonal beverage, having sold hundreds of millions since its 2003 debut. This earlier-than-usual August release is strategically timed to invigorate sales, as Starbucks recently reported a 2% decline in US sales for the third quarter. The menu also includes new offerings like Pecan Cold Foam, building on the popularity of cold foam additions, as the coffee giant seeks to attract customers and reverse its recent sales downturn.</p>

Following the altercation, he was hospitalized for a possible overdose. His bail was set at $75,000, and the 26-year-old artist, known for hits like "Old Town Road," is expected to release his second studio album, "Dreamboy," later this year.</p>

Over two days, 423 arrests were made, and while two stabbings occurred, neither resulted in serious injury, a marked improvement from the previous year's fatalities and numerous stabbings. Met Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this success to proactive policing measures, including the controversial use of live facial recognition, metal detectors, and stop-and-search operations. Despite civil liberty concerns, authorities believe these tactics effectively targeted individuals attempting to cause harm, contributing to a safer event overall.</p>

          <p>Destructive wildfires are raging across northern California wine country and central Oregon, destroying multiple homes and prompting thousands of evacuations. In Oregon's Deschutes County, ten structures, including four homes, have been lost to the Flat fire, while in California's Napa County, the Pickett fire has charred over 6,800 acres, threatening 500 structures and forcing 150 evacuations. Firefighters face challenges from searing heat, low humidity, and increasing winds, with over 1,230 personnel and 10 helicopters deployed to the Pickett fire. These intense conditions highlight the escalating fire dangers across the Western US, exacerbated by human-caused climate change.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has significantly escalated its drone attacks on Russia's energy sector, targeting facilities like a gas terminal in the Leningrad region and an oil refinery in Samara. These strikes aim to weaken Russia's war machine by reducing its combat potential and disrupting logistical capabilities, particularly fuel supplies, thereby cutting off foreign currency inflows. Ukrainian military intelligence confirms these systematic measures, which have already led to a more than 13% drop in Russian oil refining capacity in August. President Zelenskyy stated that such strikes are "justice itself" in response to Russia's targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, aiming to revitalize its struggling coffee business. The acquisition, expected in the first half of 2026, will pay JDE Peet's shareholders 31.85 euros per share, a 33% premium. Following the deal, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, US-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger. This strategic move seeks to generate $400 million in cost synergies and enhance appeal to thrifty at-home coffee drinkers, despite an initial 11% drop in KDP stock. (not investment advice)</p>

Jackson's father claimed his son was told he could get "payback" for a prior altercation, but event officials confirmed the incident was unscripted.

          <p>Netflix's animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" achieved notable box office success with a two-day theatrical sing-along release, estimated between $16 million and $20 million domestically. While this performance outpaced many re-released films, analysts believe it will not fundamentally change Netflix's core strategy of prioritizing streaming over extended theatrical runs. The company uses theatrical releases primarily as marketing tools for its streaming service or for awards contention, making one-off deals with theaters. Despite the film becoming Netflix's second-most-watched English-language movie, experts like David Poland view these theatrical events as successful promotions rather than a shift in business model.</p>
