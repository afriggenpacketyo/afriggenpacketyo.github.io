        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for Cracker Barrel dropped significantly after the company revealed a new, simplified logo as part of a broader brand transformation. The redesign, which removed the iconic man-in-a-rocking-chair image, drew sharp criticism online, particularly from conservative commentators who viewed it as a move away from the brand's traditional American identity. The company stated the changes are part of a strategic effort to revitalize its restaurants and offerings, but it faces backlash over both the new logo and modernized interior decor.</p>

          <p>Two senior House Democrats are investigating the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, questioning whether the companies conceded to improper demands from President Donald Trump to secure regulatory approval. The probe centers on a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to Trump to resolve a lawsuit he filed against CBS News, which the lawmakers suggest could be an "illegal bribe" for the FCC's merger approval. The investigation will also examine reported commitments to alter CBS's editorial practices to align with the Trump administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary penalty, which had grown to over $500 million, imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in a civil fraud lawsuit. The court ruled that the fine violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original judge's finding that Trump and his associates committed business fraud by inflating asset values, and it also kept non-monetary sanctions in place to curb the company's business practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that approximately 44% of American adults are now ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants. The primary motivations for this trend are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes amid rising food costs and economic uncertainty. This shift in consumer behavior comes as some fast-food chains report slowing sales, suggesting that diners are actively seeking more affordable options. The trend highlights how diners are adapting their habits to cope with financial pressures.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by AI and digital demand, is creating a critical shortage of skilled trade workers like electricians, plumbers, and HVAC technicians. As experienced workers retire, there are not enough younger people entering these fields to meet the growing need, with projections showing the gap could reach nearly two million jobs by 2033. This labor crisis threatens the operational stability of data centers, which compete with other industries for the same shrinking pool of talent, though unions are increasing recruitment efforts.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates declining in recent months, financial experts advise homeowners with high interest rates to prepare for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key preparatory steps include reviewing credit reports for errors, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity levels. Homeowners should also begin gathering necessary documents like proof of income and existing mortgage statements to be able to act quickly when rates are favorable. Being prepared allows for an opportunistic approach in a fast-changing interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that recent actions, such as endorsing far-right parties and pressuring allies, show a desire to enforce a nativist worldview rather than withdraw from the world stage. Citing historical context, the piece suggests that the post-WWII era of strong transatlantic unity may have been an exception, and the relationship is now shifting towards a more transactional and ideologically driven dynamic.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, exceeding analysts' expectations. The increase is attributed to a slight improvement in housing affordability and a significant 15.7% year-over-year rise in the number of homes for sale, giving buyers more options. While the median home price hit a record for July, the rate of price growth has slowed dramatically to just 0.2% annually, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point where price pressures are easing.

          <p>As Bed Bath & Beyond plans its comeback from bankruptcy, the executive chairman of its new parent company, Beyond, Inc., has declared that no physical stores will reopen in California. In a public statement, Marcus Lemonis criticized the state for creating an "overregulated, expensive, and risky" environment for businesses, making it difficult to operate profitably. The decision was met with a sharp retort from Governor Gavin Newsom's office, highlighting a growing trend of businesses publicly denouncing California's regulatory landscape.</p>

The baby was reported missing after his mother claimed she was attacked and knocked unconscious outside a store, but authorities noted inconsistencies in her statement. Investigators have since stated the parents have stopped cooperating, a claim the father's attorney denies, stating they only refused a polygraph test. The case is further complicated by the father's past conviction for child cruelty involving another child.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion allows wealthy investors to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets by exchanging them for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF). This "like magic" technique involves seeding a new ETF with a portfolio of stocks before it launches, with strict diversification rules required to qualify for the tax deferral. While the use of this strategy is growing, it remains a niche option with high investment minimums and potential downsides, such as being locked into a specific ETF. (not investment advice)</p>

In a farewell letter, she stated her abrupt exit followed a "heated exchange" with an executive, but was rooted in broader frustrations with the corporate direction of radio, which she feels has lost its passion. Alvarez lamented that the station has become a "spreadsheet," run by caretakers motivated by metrics rather than music.

          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing millions of birdsong recordings has found that artificial light pollution is significantly altering the daily routines of birds worldwide. On average, birds in light-polluted areas are starting their vocalizations 20 minutes earlier and ending them 30 minutes later, effectively lengthening their day by almost 50 minutes. The research, which covered over 500 species, found that birds with larger eyes, like American Robins, were most affected. The long-term consequences of this disruption on bird health and reproduction are not yet fully understood.</p>
