          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations of deceptive practices related to its Prime membership program. The FTC claimed the company misled millions of consumers into signing up and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and allocates $1.5 billion for customer refunds, marking a significant enforcement action by the regulatory agency. Amazon admitted no wrongdoing but will be required to make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent.</p>

          <p>A memo from federal prosecutors in Virginia concluded there was not enough evidence to criminally charge former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress. Despite this finding, the newly appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury before the statute of limitations expires. This move follows President Trump's public calls to prosecute political adversaries, creating tension within the Justice Department as career prosecutors have advised against pursuing the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a shooting attack at a Dallas ICE facility, President Donald Trump blamed the incident on the "radical left," specifically singling out Representative Jasmine Crockett. He warned that "bad things happen" when Democrats "play these games" and suggested the political right is tougher than the left. The comments connect recent political violence, including the assassination of Charlie Kirk, to what he describes as inflammatory rhetoric from his opponents. The attack involved a shooter who killed one detainee and injured two others before taking his own life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly questioned the standard medical practice of vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B, suggesting parents should wait until a child is 12 years old. Pediatricians and infectious disease specialists have strongly refuted this advice, labeling it "extremely dangerous" and "irresponsible." Doctors emphasize that the vaccine is crucial at birth to prevent mother-to-child transmission and protect infants from a virus that can cause chronic liver disease and cancer. They clarified that the virus can be transmitted through non-sexual contact, making early vaccination a critical public health measure.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget has issued a memo directing federal agencies to prepare for potential mass firings if a government shutdown occurs. The directive targets agencies whose funding expires on October 1st and are not aligned with the President's priorities, escalating the stakes in the budget standoff with Congress. This move represents a significant departure from past shutdowns where employees were typically furloughed temporarily. Democratic leaders condemned the memo as an intimidation tactic aimed at pressuring them into a funding deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt and interest rates remaining high, many Americans are considering debt relief options. Financial experts suggest that waiting for the Federal Reserve's rate cuts to lower credit card APRs is likely an ineffective strategy, as card issuers rarely pass on such savings to consumers. Instead, borrowers are encouraged to explore proactive solutions like debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans. Acting sooner can prevent interest from compounding daily and help individuals regain control of their finances more effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid internal division on how to handle free speech, some Republicans are advocating for using government power to police the left's speech, while others warn against it. This article argues that if Republicans are serious about protecting expressive rights, they could pass specific laws to do so, rather than engaging in "tit-for-tat" censorship. Proposals from organizations like FIRE include eliminating certain FCC content rules, requiring disclosure of government "jawboning" with tech companies, and passing a federal anti-SLAPP law.

President Trump was allegedly worried about friends being named in the files and that documents could have been doctored to harm him.

          <p>Researchers analyzing a million-year-old human skull, named Yunxian 2, discovered in China, propose that it could push back the emergence of our species, Homo sapiens, by half a million years. The skull is now believed to be an early form of Homo longi, a sister species to Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. This suggests that early versions of all three species may have co-existed far earlier than previously understood, potentially rewriting a key chapter of human evolutionary history. While the claim is significant, other experts urge caution, stating more evidence is needed to confirm the new timeline.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is facing criticism from fellow Labour Party MPs after suggesting he could challenge Prime Minister Keir Starmer for leadership. While Burnham claims some MPs have encouraged him to stand, a BBC survey of Labour MPs revealed little appetite for a leadership change, with many viewing his comments as self-indulgent and unhelpful. In response, Starmer dismissed the comments as personal ambition and contrasted his own commitment to fiscal stability with Burnham's more expansive spending proposals.

          <p>With a potential government shutdown just days away, Congressional Democrats are holding firm on their demand that any funding deal must include an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits. These subsidies, which help lower insurance premiums for millions, are set to expire, and Democrats warn of a "Republican healthcare crisis" if they are not renewed. The White House and Republican leaders are pushing for a "clean" stopgap funding bill without policy additions, creating a high-stakes impasse. The conflict highlights the deep partisan divide over healthcare and budget priorities.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has endorsed buying Starbucks stock, viewing the company's plan to close stores and lay off corporate staff as a "very bullish" and necessary step. He argues that CEO Brian Niccol's strategy to eliminate underperforming locations and reinvest in successful ones is a sound approach to turning around same-store sales. The restructuring, part of a $1 billion plan to boost profitability, aims to address declining sales and operating margins that have lagged since before the pandemic. Cramer expressed confidence in Niccol's ability to restore the company's financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

Zelenskyy emphasized that these potential strikes would be aimed at military and strategic targets, not civilians, asserting that "we are not terrorists."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the costs of senior care rising faster than inflation, financial planners are advising individuals to consider long-term care insurance to protect their retirement savings. Experts point out that Medicare offers very limited coverage for long-term needs, primarily covering short-term skilled nursing after a hospital stay, not the custodial care most seniors require. Since eligibility for long-term care insurance is based on health, it becomes more difficult and expensive to obtain as one ages. Therefore, securing a policy while still in good health can be a crucial step in financial planning for later life. (not investment advice)</p>

The drones were not shot down over safety concerns, highlighting the country's lack of immediate countermeasures.
