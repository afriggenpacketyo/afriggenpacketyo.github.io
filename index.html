          <p>Tesla plans to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, starting June 22, with initial rides in the Model Y limited to invited guests within a geofenced area. Remote drivers will monitor the vehicles as a backup, and the company will begin with a small number of cars before scaling up. Elon Musk has been promising a driverless taxi service for years, and analysts believe it could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization. Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi fleet across the U.S., making Tesla a laggard in the self-driving tech race.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and student negotiator from Columbia University, who was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March. The judge denied the government's motion to stay the ruling, asserting that there was no evidence to suggest Khalil's release would cause irreparable harm or that he posed a flight risk. Khalil's attorney argued that his detention was retaliatory punishment for his protected speech and viewpoint. An immigration judge in Louisiana had denied Khalil's request for asylum, but the federal judge's order supersedes that decision.</p>

Gates allegedly shared photos and videos of the child's face and internal organs on Instagram, even after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from the family.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to expedite consideration of a challenge to Donald Trump's tariffs, leaving the tariffs in place while the case proceeds through lower courts. Learning Resources, a toy company that filed the challenge, requested the Supreme Court to immediately hear the case, bypassing the U.S. Court of Appeals. Two district courts have previously ruled that Trump's tariffs are not justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, but these rulings are currently under appeal. The company expressed disappointment but remains confident that the case will ultimately reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A new Microsoft report reveals that employees are experiencing an "infinite workday" characterized by constant emails, meetings, and notifications, leading to significant burnout. Workers are interrupted frequently and receive a high volume of messages, causing feelings of overwhelm and fragmentation. The report suggests that outdated work models and near-constant virtual access contribute to the problem. Microsoft predicts that AI agents will take over low-value tasks, freeing up employees for more meaningful work, while emphasizing the importance of setting boundaries and fostering human connection to combat burnout.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has voiced concerns about potential cuts to Medicaid and food benefits for her constituents in Alaska within President Trump's "big, beautiful bill." While she has not established any absolute deal-breakers, Murkowski has communicated her reservations regarding the Medicaid proposals. She emphasized the importance of addressing entitlement spending but cautioned against harming vulnerable populations, particularly given Alaska's high healthcare costs and the significant percentage of children on Medicaid. The Senate aims to pass the reconciliation bill by the July 4 holiday.</p>

          <p>Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act could result in higher monthly payments for many federal student loan borrowers, according to a new analysis. The proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP) could increase monthly payments compared to the Biden administration's SAVE plan. Under RAP, borrowers would typically pay between 1% and 10% of their income, with a 30-year repayment timeline before loan forgiveness. Critics argue that larger bills could push more borrowers into default and delay major life milestones. (not investment advice)</p>
