          <p>President Trump's plan to utilize troops to quell protests in Los Angeles raises significant legal questions.

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards cannot be used as a substitute for Real ID at airport security checkpoints. The agency humorously stated that travelers cannot "fly on hot dogs and hope," emphasizing the need for proper identification. This clarification aims to prevent confusion among travelers and ensure compliance with security regulations. Passengers must present valid forms of identification, such as a driver's license or passport, to pass through airport security.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles is being criticized as a provocative move aimed at instigating conflict and expanding his authority. Critics argue that Trump is attempting to create a national emergency to justify authoritarian control and divert attention from his policy failures. The deployment is seen as a deliberate attempt to set neighbor against neighbor and radicalize citizen-soldiers. It is suggested that the most effective response would be for residents to maintain calm and deny Trump the spectacle he seeks.</p>
