        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship violates four Supreme Court precedents during a hearing. Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan questioned the Justice Department lawyer arguing the case, pressing him on how the Supreme Court could rule the order unconstitutional if lower courts were barred from issuing national injunctions. Kagan challenged the lawyer to explain how the Supreme Court could rule on the legality of Trump's order without requiring every affected individual to file a lawsuit. Trump asserted that birthright citizenship was not intended for vacationers seeking citizenship, criticizing those who take advantage of the system. </p>

          <p>Hopes for peace talks between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Russian President Putin in Turkey were dashed after both Putin and former White House counterpart Donald Trump decided not to attend.

The Russian delegation is led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, while senior U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will attend for the U.S. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism about the talks, awaiting confirmation of the Russian representatives before committing Ukraine's next steps.</p>

          <p>Many homeowners find their home equity "trapped" due to factors like elevated interest rates and stricter lending requirements. This article from CBS News explores the reasons behind this issue, such as homeowners being reluctant to sell due to low mortgage rates secured years ago. Experts suggest alternative home equity borrowing options like HELOCs and home equity loans, which allow homeowners to tap into equity without refinancing their existing mortgage. Additionally, the article advises improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history to meet lender requirements, ultimately helping homeowners leverage their built-in wealth.

The founders created Earlybirds to fill a void for women who crave dance parties but have morning commitments.

          <p>The CEO of Pain MD, Michael Kestner, received an 18-month prison sentence for a fraud scheme involving unnecessary injections to patients, despite prosecutors seeking a 20-year term. Judge Aleta Trauger cited Kestner's age and health as factors for the lighter sentence, describing him as a "ruthless businessman" who exploited patients' opioid dependence. Pain MD administered approximately 700,000 injections over eight years, defrauding Medicare and other insurance programs. Former patients testified that they endured the injections out of fear of losing their painkiller prescriptions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed trespassing charges against nearly 100 undocumented migrants arrested along New Mexico's border with Mexico. The Trump administration had declared a strip of land along the border a "national defense" zone, leading to the arrests. Judge Gregory B. Wormuth ruled that the government failed to prove the migrants knew they were entering a restricted military area. Defense lawyers argued that some migrants were arrested before warning signs were posted or were unable to read them, adding to the legal turmoil in the state.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers could start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China. Rainey expressed concern that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer or supplier can absorb. Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Despite the warnings, Walmart reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business.</p>

The impact of interest rate cuts and relative political and economic stability could be more significant than anticipated, leading to increased real incomes and a more robust consumer base.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) found that only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many properties beyond the price range of middle-class households, with the affordability gap worsening in 26 of the biggest 100 cities. The cities with the worst affordability gaps are frequently in regions with zoning or permitting restrictions that make it difficult to construct new properties.</p>
