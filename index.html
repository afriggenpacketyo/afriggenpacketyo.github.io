          <p>Journalism, after a second-place finish in the Kentucky Derby, secured a comeback win at the 150th Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, marking trainer Michael McCarthy's second Preakness victory and jockey Umberto Rispoli's first Triple Crown race win. The race, held at Pimlico Race Course, saw Journalism overtake Gosger in the final stretch, with Sandman finishing third. Notably, Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty did not participate, focusing instead on the Belmont Stakes, setting up a potential rematch with Journalism. This Preakness was the last to be held at Pimlico before its demolition and reconstruction, with the race moving to Laurel Park next year. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The scheme aims to strengthen partnerships with the EU and benefit jobs and borders. While specific details about eligibility and caps are yet to be determined, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the proposal as "free movement through the back door." An agreement is expected at Monday's summit in London. </p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned it would have to raise prices due to tariffs. Trump stated that Walmart should absorb the tariffs rather than pass the costs onto consumers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey noted that the company is pleased with the progress that's been made by the administration on tariffs from the levels that were announced in early April, but they're still too high. The company will try to work with suppliers to keep prices as low as possible. </p>

The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing a more complex body structure than previously understood.
