          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted in the Jeffrey Epstein case, reportedly told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche she had no incriminating information on high-profile individuals like Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. During a two-day interview under limited immunity, Maxwell denied knowledge of any illicit acts by Epstein's associates, claiming no client list or blackmail scheme existed. She also maintained her innocence regarding child sexual exploitation and asserted she was wrongly accused in her 2021 trial. This article details her account amidst ongoing public and congressional scrutiny of the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>Intel shares increased by 6% following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking an equity stake in the chipmaker. President Trump indicated the government aims for about 10% ownership, though White House officials clarified that discussions are ongoing and no deal is finalized. This move reflects a shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government potentially gaining a non-voting stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds. Intel, crucial for advanced chip production, has been slowing its Ohio factory construction, making government backing significant. (not investment advice)</p>

He expressed willingness to deploy "regular military" in D.C. if necessary, a significant escalation. Trump criticized Chicago's mayor as "grossly incompetent" and claimed residents were "screaming" for federal intervention. The article notes that federal authority over city police departments outside D.C. is limited, and state National Guard units are under gubernatorial control, suggesting potential challenges to his plans.</p>

The article highlights concerns over unaccompanied migrant children and the Trump administration's efforts to address a backlog of cases from the previous administration, linking open border policies to increased human trafficking risks.</p>

          <p>This article explains three often-overlooked factors that can reduce Social Security benefits for millions of American retirees. These include the earnings test, which temporarily reduces benefits for those working before full retirement age, and automatic deductions for Medicare Part B premiums, which can significantly impact net payments. Additionally, federal income taxes can apply to up to 85% of benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, surprising many. The article also suggests alternative income strategies like reverse mortgages or part-time work to supplement retirement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are grappling with rising costs due to President Trump's increased tariffs, but are implementing strategies to avoid widespread price hikes for consumers. Companies are diversifying sourcing, pushing back on vendors, and making careful price adjustments. While costs are increasing, consumer spending has largely remained steady, and the impact hasn't been as severe as initially feared. This article details how retailers are mitigating tariff effects, with some noting lower-income shoppers are more sensitive to price changes, and strong brands or new revenue streams offer resilience.

          <p>President Trump has intensified pressure on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, publicly demanding her resignation over mortgage fraud allegations and threatening to fire her if she refuses.

          <p>President Trump's Department of Justice has escalated its pursuit of political adversaries, with the FBI conducting an early morning search of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home. The raid is reportedly linked to an investigation into Bolton for leaking classified information, an issue Trump has previously sought to prosecute. Top DOJ and FBI officials publicly commented on the search, signaling a politically charged motive. This article suggests a shift from Trump's first term, where such prosecutions were often stalled, indicating a more effective and visible effort by his loyalist-staffed DOJ to target perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>Gold, traditionally a safe-haven asset, is experiencing unprecedented interest, particularly in gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as investors seek to hedge against market risk and volatility. Driven by concerns over tariffs and inflation, global gold ETFs saw $3.2 billion in inflows in July, on track for their second-strongest year. The article notes that despite these inflows, gold ETF allocations are still a small percentage of overall equity market hedges, suggesting significant room for further growth.
