          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 20:25:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which he described as the "largest Deal ever." The agreement reportedly involves reciprocal tariffs and a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States. Key provisions include the lowering of U.S. tariffs on Japanese autos from 25% to 15% and Japan opening its markets to more American products like cars and agricultural goods. This development comes after Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faced political pressure following his coalition's loss of a majority in the upper house elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City has reported the deaths of 21 children from malnutrition and starvation over a 72-hour period. United Nations officials have warned that lifelines are collapsing in the territory, with new cases of starvation arriving at hospitals constantly. The U.N. human rights office attributes the crisis to Israel's interference with humanitarian aid, noting that over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed while trying to access food since late May. This dire situation follows a breakdown in ceasefire talks and a subsequent blockade imposed by Israel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of treason, making the claim without providing any supporting evidence. The accusation was linked to the declassification of documents concerning the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump made the remarks while deflecting questions about the Justice Department's engagement with Ghislaine Maxwell. Obama's office responded by calling the allegations "ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction," emphasizing the lack of proof for such an outrageous claim.</p>

          <p>A powerful 1975 photograph taken by Stanley Forman captured the tragic collapse of a fire escape during an apartment fire in Boston, resulting in the death of a 19-year-old woman. The haunting image, which won a Pulitzer Prize, depicted the woman and a two-year-old girl falling five stories. The child survived by landing on the woman's body. The photo's widespread publication prompted immediate action from the city, leading to new regulations requiring fire escape safety certifications every five years, a change that had a ripple effect on safety standards nationwide.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its policy, effectively barring transgender women from competing in women’s sports. This change aligns with a presidential executive order threatening to rescind federal funding from organizations that do not comply. The USOPC informed national governing bodies for sports like swimming and track and field that they must update their own policies accordingly. The move has been condemned by civil rights groups like the National Women’s Law Center as a capitulation to political pressure that sacrifices the well-being of athletes.</p>

          <p>China's ambitious Qianfan satellite internet project, intended to compete with SpaceX's Starlink, may be encountering significant delays. The company leading the project must deploy thousands of satellites by specific deadlines to comply with international regulations and secure its allocated radio frequencies. However, an engineer cited in the article claims that a severe shortage of rockets is hindering progress. China's current rocket manufacturing and launch capacity is reportedly struggling to meet the massive demand required to build out the 15,000-satellite constellation on schedule.</p>

          <p>A Boston court dismissed more than 120 criminal cases on Tuesday because the defendants could not be assigned a lawyer. The dismissals, which included cases of domestic violence and assault on police, are the latest consequence of a pay dispute that has led public defenders to stop accepting new clients. The state's public defenders argue they are the lowest paid in New England and are demanding higher hourly rates. This crisis highlights a nationwide issue of underfunding for public defense systems, threatening both public safety and constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos held a private meeting at the White House last week that lasted for over an hour. While the specific topics of discussion were not disclosed, the meeting signals a warming relationship between the two powerful figures. Trump had frequently criticized Bezos during his first term, but their dynamic has shifted, with Bezos reportedly seeking to capitalize on a falling-out between Trump and Elon Musk. The conversations are said to have touched upon government contracts, a key area of competition between Bezos's Blue Origin and Musk's SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Following England's one-day international cricket series defeat to India, legendary former bowler Katherine Sciver-Brunt has questioned the team's mindset. Sciver-Brunt, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, suggested some players look "lazy" and lack the outward fighting spirit she was known for. She observed timidness and a fear of failure, particularly in the field, during the deciding match. In response, current captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and coach Charlotte Edwards defended the team's commitment and professionalism, stating that outward appearances don't always reflect a player's internal drive.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has released its final report on the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola. The investigation found that the small aircraft was overweight at takeoff with a load of moose meat and experienced significant drag from a set of moose antlers affixed to an external wing strut. These factors, combined with turbulent weather and downdrafts, likely resulted in the plane having insufficient power to clear the terrain. Peltola was the sole occupant of the aircraft during the accident.</p>
