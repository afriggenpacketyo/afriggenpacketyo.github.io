          <p>The Justice Department experienced a reduction of 4,000 employees during the Trump administration due to a controversial downsizing initiative, raising concerns about the impact on community safety. The "fork in the road" deferred resignation program led to an estimated savings of $470 million, with further cuts planned, including 1,500 FBI positions. Former officials and law enforcement analysts criticize the cuts as draining experienced agents and institutional knowledge, potentially jeopardizing Americans' safety. The Justice Department also plans to shutter the Community Relations Service, which was founded during the civil rights era and tasked with resolving racial and ethnic tensions, a decision that has been met with criticism. The article highlights concerns that these cuts will undermine law enforcement effectiveness and community relations.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by masked ICE agents at a federal immigration court while observing proceedings. Lander's office stated he was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of court to prevent their arrest by ICE. Video footage showed Lander being handcuffed, leading to accusations of abuse of power and threats to democracy from the ACLU and other officials. Lander was later released, and New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the charges against him had been dropped, however Lander himself has expressed concern about the due process rights of the person he was escorting out of the courthouse. This event has sparked debates about immigration enforcement and the safety of undocumented immigrants in New York City.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a significant win for the crypto industry. The act sets regulations including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, and grants authority to the Treasury Secretary. The bill faced criticism, with some accusing Republicans of enabling President Trump to profit from crypto ventures. The GENIUS Act now moves to the House, where reconciliation with its version, STABLE, may take time, and it restricts non-financial large tech companies from directly issuing stablecoins unless they establish or partner with regulated financial entities.

Menendez, who resigned from the Senate, maintains his innocence and has appeared to be angling for a pardon from President Trump, however Menendez was convicted for taking bribes of gold and hundreds of thousands of dollars stuffed in his bathrobe.</p>

A search warrant executed at Krebs' home revealed the pipe bombs, leading to the involvement of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Krebs allegedly told detectives he wanted to protest peacefully but also wanted to be safe, however, he was taken back into custody on charges yet to be released, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Speculation has arisen regarding the potential use of the U.S. GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, known as the bunker buster, in response to Israel's attack on Iran aimed at destroying its nuclear program. This weapon, capable of penetrating 200 feet deep, could target Iran's Fordo facility, where enriched uranium is believed to be produced and stored. The bomb contains 5,000 pounds of explosives designed to detonate once it reaches its subterranean target, but only the U.S. military has access to the GBU-57 and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber needed to deliver it. Despite warnings from the IAEA about attacks on nuclear facilities, Trump has remained noncommittal about possible U.S. involvement.</p>

          <p>New Yorkers in the city's Democratic mayoral primary will use ranked-choice voting, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If a candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, they win outright; otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and subsequent rounds count voters' second-choice votes. This system has led to unique alliances, such as cross-endorsements between progressive candidates Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander, aimed at preventing former Governor Andrew Cuomo from winning. Results will be reported a week after the primary due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots, with preliminary totals for first-choice votes available on June 24.</p>

Researchers analyzed data from 24 studies published between 2016 and 2023, noting some limitations including imprecise dosage measurements. As recreational marijuana becomes legal in more states, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is moving to reclassify the drug to a less dangerous category.

          <p>President Trump has delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for another 90 days, marking the third such extension since taking office. The White House stated the extension is to ensure a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, is closed, addressing national security concerns. However, ByteDance has indicated that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval, and Trump has expressed confidence that China will ultimately approve it. Despite bipartisan support in Congress for the ban, little action has been taken in response to the Trump administration's delays.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are considering adjustments to the tax bill, a cornerstone of President Trump's agenda, with new provisions that could lead to conflict in the House. The Senate Finance Committee released legislative text tackling issues like Medicaid and clean energy tax credits, aiming to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. However, Senate Democrats criticized the proposal, and the updated Congressional Budget Office estimate projects the House bill would add roughly $2.8 trillion to the deficit over a decade. Differences between the House and Senate versions, particularly regarding state and local tax deductions (SALT), debt limit increases, and green energy rollbacks, could threaten the coalition needed to pass the bill.</p>

Despite positive reviews, the show struggled at the box office, failing to reach expected sales figures. The musical received two Tony nominations, but the producers expressed pride in representing immigrant communities on Broadway. The story, adapted from Josefina López’s play and the 2002 HBO film, centers on a teen named Ana and her garment factory worker mother in the immigrant neighborhood of Boyle Heights, and highlights themes of immigration and the American Dream.</p>

          <p>Following high-ranking officials from the United States and China emerging from trade talks in London, the public has been given little information, leading to speculation about the discussions. The silence hints at tensions, recalibrated power, and the fragile balance of global trade, deepening uncertainty about the world’s most consequential economic relationship. China's tactics around export controls on rare earth elements, the focus of the talks, may have caught the US delegation off guard. According to one expert, the dynamic has shifted from unilateral US pressure to a more evenly matched contest.</p>

There is not full agreement among Trump's advisers on how to proceed, and the issue was discussed in a meeting with his national security team. Israel alleges Iran is making swift progress toward building nuclear weapons, while a U.S. intelligence assessment earlier this year stated Iran is not currently building nuclear weapons.

French police cite operational rules and safety concerns as reasons for not intervening at sea, focusing instead on intercepting boats before launch.
