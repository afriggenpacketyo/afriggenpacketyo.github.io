        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pandora's CEO, Alexander Lacik, cautioned that U.S. tariffs on imports, particularly from Asia, could lead to widespread price increases in the affordable jewelry sector. While current tariffs are manageable, reverting to previously announced reciprocal rates would significantly impact manufacturers. Pandora, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, has modeled scenarios to address potential price increases. The final consumer price adjustment will likely be industry-led, depending on tariff policies after the current pause expires in July.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold steady its benchmark interest rate, remaining between 4.25% and 4.5%, while acknowledging increasing economic uncertainty due to President Trump's trade policies.

Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's solid shape, allowing the Fed to be patient while calibrating monetary policy.

          <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), plans to eliminate dozens of National Park Service grants, many related to climate change and diversity, according to an internal document. These cuts, potentially saving $26 million, target programs such as Scientists in Parks, climate resiliency studies, watershed protection, and projects supporting children with disabilities and LGBTQ+ history. The administration cites opposition to climate change, sustainability, and diversity, equity, and inclusion as reasons for the cuts.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers cutting interest rates, savers are contemplating whether to renew maturing CD accounts. Despite the likelihood of rate cuts, renewing CDs may still be a smart move due to the potential for the rate cut trajectory to change, the likelihood of small initial rate cuts, and the lost interest-earning opportunity if funds are moved elsewhere. While high-yield savings accounts offer comparable rates, they are variable and subject to change. A CD could still be the smart move to make for your maturing funds now.</p>

The increase is significantly stronger than the typical seasonal trend, indicating a direct response to the anticipated impact of tariffs on vehicle affordability.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has maintained steady interest rates, highlighting increasing risks to the U.S. economy due to President Trump's trade strategy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that tariffs are likely to increase prices, slow economic growth, and raise unemployment. Policymakers noted the rising risks of higher unemployment and inflation, emphasizing their commitment to carefully assess incoming data. The Fed's statement amounted to a critique of the administration’s import tariffs, asserting its independence amid political pressure for rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he will not seek the Republican nomination for Georgia Senate in 2026, a key race for control of the Senate. Kemp communicated his decision to Senate GOP leadership and President Trump, pledging to support a strong Republican nominee. Despite being a top recruiting target and polling well against incumbent Democrat Jon Ossoff, Kemp cited family reservations for his decision. The announcement leaves the GOP field open as they seek to unseat Ossoff in a closely contested state.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest homeowners considering a $100,000 HELOC should understand its advantages and potential risks. HELOCs offer the cheapest way to borrow home equity, with rates around 7.95%, lower than personal loans or credit cards. While HELOC rates are variable, they are expected to decline further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. However, borrowers should factor in potential volatility and calculate repayments under various interest rate scenarios to ensure affordability.</p>

Ford expects a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year, and has withdrawn its full-year financial guidance due to economic uncertainty.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain steady interest rates raises questions about future mortgage rates. While the Fed doesn't directly set mortgage rates, its policies influence the broader interest rate environment.

Experts suggest that potential homebuyers should improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, and consider options like rate buydowns to secure competitive rates.</p>
