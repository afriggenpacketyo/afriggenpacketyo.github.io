          <p>The Trump administration is experiencing internal conflict over foreign policy, with competing factions vying for influence. This includes shifts in the approach to Iran, where Trump has shown a preference for diplomacy despite past hawkish stances.

          <p>A study from Dartmouth College estimates that emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies caused $28 trillion in climate damage between 1991 and 2020. The study attributes a third of the total cost to five companies: Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP. Researchers developed a method to tie emissions to specific climate harms, aiming to hold companies liable for extreme weather costs. The study suggests that the scientific case for climate liability is closed, but the companies have not responded to requests for comment.</p>
