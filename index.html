          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed $90,000, reaching levels not seen since March, as investors seek refuge from stock market volatility and a declining U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency's price increased by over 3%, with a two-day gain exceeding 7%, despite light trading volumes. This decoupling from traditional risk assets is attributed to investors viewing Bitcoin as a resilient alternative amid economic uncertainty and rising tariffs, with potential for further gains if key resistance levels are breached.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's repeated criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has sparked concerns about the independence of the central bank, with some economists suggesting that even firing Powell might not be enough to achieve the desired rate cuts. Analysts argue that Trump would likely need to replace the entire Fed Board of Governors to exert control over monetary policy, which could trigger a market backlash and undermine investor confidence. The speculation surrounding changes at the Fed, coupled with ongoing tariff uncertainty, has already negatively impacted U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its global growth forecast downward, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs, with the U.S. economy expected to be particularly hard hit.

          <p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth stated that the company is not seeing indications of an impending U.S. recession, despite the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on oil demand. Wirth acknowledged signs of slowing growth but emphasized that Chevron is not altering its capital spending plans in response to recent price drops. He also noted that U.S. onshore oil production may decline if prices fall to $60 per barrel, while offshore production is unlikely to be affected.</p>
