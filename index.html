          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 02:38:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash the majority of recently imposed tariffs on each other's imports, a move resulting from high-level trade discussions held in Switzerland. Both nations have also temporarily suspended some reciprocal duties for a 90-day period. Under this agreement, the U.S. has reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China has lowered its tariffs on American products from 125% to 10%. While some tariffs remain, this development signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies, with further negotiations planned to refine the future trade relationship. This article also notes that China has agreed to lift export controls on rare-earth minerals.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% in volatile trading after the company announced a 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) share buyback program. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year exceeded analyst estimates, although it was down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, distributing over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. Despite these positive developments, Sony's outlook for the current financial year was tempered by concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs, though the article also notes that Sony clarified that the estimated tariff impact did not reflect the trade deal made between the U.S. and China on May 12.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has accused members of Congress of committing felonies during an altercation at a Newark immigration detention center. Noem claims the lawmakers attacked law enforcement officers while demanding an "oversight visit" to the facility. The DHS Secretary criticizes the lawmakers for allegedly defending their actions as oversight, accusing them of attacking people who stand up for the rule of law, and she calls for the trio to be censured and formally rebuked by the House of Representatives. The lawmakers, in turn, claim they were assaulted by ICE personnel and were attempting to conduct legitimate oversight.</p>

          <p>A controversial new single by Kanye West, also known as Ye, featuring antisemitic content and references to Nazi symbols, has been banned on several social media platforms but remains on Elon Musk's X. The song's artwork resembles a swastika, and it includes a sample from a Hitler speech. German law prohibits the public display or dissemination of Nazi symbols and slogans, making the song illegal in Germany, where such actions can be punished with imprisonment or a fine. While Nazi symbols are not banned in the US due to First Amendment protections, the incident has renewed scrutiny of tech companies' content policies.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in their homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling, which was adopted by the California Insurance Commissioner. The decision grants the company a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company to alleviate financial strain following the Los Angeles-area wildfires. This increase is lower than State Farm's initial proposal of 21.8% and will take effect on June 1, after another hearing with a neutral judge. The decision has faced backlash from fire survivors and state senators, who requested a delay pending an investigation into insurance payment delays.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which provide personalized wealth management services to the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth but struggling to find qualified money managers. This shortage is attributed to trust issues, the informal structure of family offices, and competition from other financial institutions. Family offices often prioritize trust over qualifications, making hiring decisions difficult, and they seek candidates who can combine multiple roles, which is a rare find. Some families are willing to pay a premium for trusted individuals, but young employees are often reluctant to work in family offices due to a lack of corporate structure and career progression opportunities.</p>

          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers could lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on migrant staff like health and social care. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants seeking work visas, and extending the residency requirement for indefinite stay applications. While the government aims to prioritize British workers, businesses fear that they may not be able or willing to fill the gaps created by reduced immigration. A care home manager reports difficulty in attracting British workers to the social care sector due to low pay.</p>

Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation efforts inside prison and letters of support from corrections officials as factors influencing his decision. While Judge Jesic emphasized that the decision to release them ultimately lies with the governor and state parole board, the brothers are now immediately eligible for parole, and they are scheduled to appear before the board on June 13 as part of Governor Newsom's consideration of clemency.</p>

They argue that the refugee status is based on false narratives and that the new law on land expropriation is not a redistribution initiative targeting the white population.

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washingtonâ€™s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reportedly presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, though Mr. Witkoff's spokesman has denied that the proposal had come up in the talks. The plan entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from participating countries providing oversight. While the feasibility remains uncertain, the proposal aims to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program and create a permanent agreement.</p>

While experts anticipate further price drops in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks, the uncertainty surrounding the virus's progression could cause prices to rise again.

          <p>U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risk posed by Chinese-made power inverters used in renewable energy infrastructure after the discovery of undocumented communication devices inside some of them. These rogue components, including cellular radios, provide additional communication channels that could allow firewalls to be circumvented remotely, potentially destabilizing power grids and causing widespread blackouts. The U.S. Department of Energy acknowledges the challenges with manufacturers disclosing and documenting functionalities and is working to address any gaps in disclosures. This has led to increased scrutiny of China's role in strategic infrastructure and preparations for potential bans on Chinese inverter manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Concerns have been raised about safety at HMP Five Wells in Wellingborough, UK, following a change in its remit to house a high number of sex offenders. Reports indicate a rise in violence, self-harm, and drug use within the prison, with some inmates claiming attacks on sex offenders and bullying are commonplace. The integration of sex offenders into the general inmate population has led to concerns from inmates and their families, who express feelings of unsafety and a lack of rehabilitation efforts. Ministry of Justice data reveals a significant increase in assaults and self-harm incidents since the integration began in 2024.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered an 11-1 loss to the Oakland Athletics, with the team's offense struggling and starting pitcher Landon Knack failing to finish the fifth inning. Despite the loss, there were some positive performances from Michael Conforto and Chris Taylor. However, the Dodgers' starting rotation has been hit with injuries, making Clayton Kershaw's upcoming season debut on Saturday against the Angels even more crucial. Manager Dave Roberts expressed that the team is seeking further 'shots in the arm' in the weeks ahead, while Roki Sasaki has been shut down due to a right-shoulder impingement.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian refugees in Poland are reporting a significant rise in anti-Ukrainian sentiment and abuse in recent months, including bullying in schools and xenophobic incidents on public transport. This change in attitude has been attributed to a polarizing presidential election campaign and an increase in anti-Ukrainian online abuse. While many Poles continue to support Ukraine, some are expressing resentment and hostility towards refugees, with research suggesting a decline in public opinion towards accepting Ukrainians. The article highlights the trauma experienced by many Ukrainian refugees and the challenges they face in adjusting to life in Poland.</p>

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in a federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial against Sean Combs, detailing drug-fueled sex sessions with male prostitutes that she says were orchestrated by Mr. Combs and made her feel "disgusting" and "humiliated." Ms. Ventura described how the sex sessions, known as freak-offs, could last for days and involved drug use and sex with strangers. She claimed Mr. Combs dictated her sex acts and appearance, demanding she reapply baby oil and paying male escorts less if they failed to perform to his standards. Ms. Ventura said she stayed to keep Mr. Combs happy, despite the increasingly abusive nature of the relationship.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants in various ways to treat open wounds and other injuries. The chimpanzees dab these plants on their wounds or chew them up and apply the chewed material to the open injury, sometimes even tending to the wounds of other animals they aren't related to. This research builds on previous discoveries that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate, and it adds to the growing body of evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild. The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body.</p>

The complaint raises questions about the circumstances of the crash, including whether air traffic control responded appropriately and whether the reinforcement of a mound at the end of the runway violated regulations.
