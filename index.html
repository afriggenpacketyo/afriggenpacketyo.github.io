        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article delves into the complex dynamics of sibling relationships, drawing on research suggesting that siblings significantly influence each other's personalities and achievements, sometimes more than parents do. The article highlights that this "sibling spillover effect" can be particularly strong in disadvantaged families, where siblings spend more time together. It also challenges the traditional birth-order psychology, suggesting that qualities associated with birth order may simply reflect developmental stages. The article further explores the role of genetics and environment in shaping personalities, noting that genetic inclinations can elicit responses that further reinforce certain traits.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar as a gift, intended for use as Air Force One until near the end of Trump's term, after which ownership would transfer to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal analyses are being drafted to justify the arrangement, arguing that it doesn't violate bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause because the gift is to the US Air Force, not an individual.

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps has formed an attack drone team to address the increasing use of armed first-person view (FPV) drones in modern warfare, as adversaries like China and Russia advance in this technology.

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in a historic Fort Lauderdale beachfront community has ignited controversy, with some residents alleging racial motivations. The basketball courts, built shortly after the end of segregation, have been a popular gathering spot for a diverse group of players. While developers argue that pickleball would appeal to a broader range of residents, critics fear the conversion would destroy a long-standing community tradition and potentially "whiten" the area.

          <p>The rise of luxury dog hotels in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, has prompted discussions about socioeconomic disparities, as these hotels offer opulent amenities for pets while many people struggle with poverty. These establishments, complete with skydecks, swimming pools, and even dog weddings, contrast sharply with the living conditions of nearby homeless communities. While hotel owners argue they provide employment and support animal adoption programs, critics contend that prioritizing luxury services for pets over addressing basic human needs highlights the country's deep-seated inequality.</p>

          <p>John Cameron Mitchell argues that young people today need to embrace a punk ethos to navigate a post-democratic America, emphasizing DIY collective action and rejecting cancel culture.

Mitchell advocates for community-driven storytelling, kindness, and empathy, urging students to stop canceling each other and create outside approved systems. He recommends the 2012 documentary "How to Survive a Plague" which chronicles a particularly queer brand of AIDS activism that negotiated with Big Pharma.</p>
