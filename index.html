          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a 5% drop in premarket trading following a disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, which revealed the company missed revenue and net income expectations despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase. The Chinese e-commerce giant's net income surged by 279% year-on-year, but this was offset by losses from subsidiary disposals and equity investment valuation changes. The company faces macroeconomic volatility and intense competition in China, despite efforts to boost sales through partnerships and AI investments. Investors are closely watching Alibaba's AI initiatives, particularly the Qwen 3 model, amidst fierce competition from companies like Tencent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would not attend the Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul, despite previously advocating for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, citing scheduling conflicts. Trump downplayed Putinâ€™s decision not to attend and commended Zelenskyyâ€™s ability to secure financial aid from the United States, calling him the "greatest salesman, maybe in history." Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to attend meetings with NATO counterparts in Istanbul.

          <p>While overall inflation has cooled, the prices of certain everyday items, such as coffee and beef, continue to rise rapidly, impacting consumers' budgets. Coffee prices have soared due to droughts in Vietnam and Brazil, restricting global supply, while beef prices have increased due to a drought in beef-producing regions of the U.S. in 2022, leading to a reduced national beef herd. Car repair costs have also climbed due to the increasing complexity of car technology and a shortage of skilled technicians. Conversely, apparel prices have generally decreased, but outerwear for both men and women has seen significant price increases.</p>

          <p>Shares of Ubisoft experienced an 18% drop after the video game company reported lower-than-expected full-year earnings and provided a dismal outlook for the upcoming fiscal year.

Ubisoft cited lower-than-expected partnerships as a primary factor in the decline, and its forecast for the current fiscal year indicates stable net bookings and breaking even on a non-IFRS operating income basis, further disappointing investors.</p>

          <p>A Pennsylvania federal judge, Stephanie Haines, ruled that President Trump can use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, a decision that conflicts with rulings from other judges. While the judge agreed that the act can apply, she also stipulated that the government must give individuals facing removal at least 21 days' notice to challenge their cases. The ruling is narrow, applying to one specific case, but it complicates the legal battle over the Alien Enemies Act, which has been used to deport migrants to El Salvador.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to Israel in his second term appears to be shifting, with a greater emphasis on regional dealmaking and less concern for aligning with Israeli interests. Despite strong rhetoric supporting Israel, Trump has engaged in direct negotiations with its adversaries, including Hamas and Iran, without consulting Israel. This shift reflects a growing frustration with Netanyahu and the rising influence of the "restrainer" wing of Republican foreign policy. The changing dynamics in the Middle East also play a role, as Saudi Arabia and the UAE prioritize regional stability and seek to de-escalate tensions with Iran.</p>

The book delves into the rights of nature discussions and the philosophical shift from viewing rivers as "it" to "who," challenging Western anthropocentrism.

          <p>A Los Angeles construction worker from Vietnam faced near-deportation to Libya after attending a routine immigration check-in, highlighting the Trump administration's controversial immigration policies. The man, along with a group of other immigrants from various countries, was roused from a Texas detention facility, shackled, and told they would be deported to Libya, a country they had no connection to. Attorneys intervened, citing a court order, and prevented the deportation. The incident raises concerns about due process and the administration's authority to deport individuals to third countries.</p>

          <p>The LAPD took 23 years to identify one of their own as the culprit in the 1986 murder of Sherri Rasmussen, a case initially deemed a burglary gone wrong. Stephanie Lazarus, a 25-year-old LAPD officer and former lover of Rasmussen's husband, was eventually convicted of the crime. Despite early evidence pointing to Lazarus, including harassment of the victim and the use of LAPD-issued bullets, she was not questioned as a suspect for years. The delay has raised questions about investigative tunnel vision and the possibility of internal protection within the department.</p>

Researchers found that the Haenyeo exhibit a significantly greater drop in heart rate during simulated dives compared to non-diving women from the same island. Genetic analysis revealed two genes associated with cold tolerance and blood pressure regulation, suggesting that the population of Jeju Island has been genetically sculpted by generations of divers. These adaptations may offer insights into developing therapies for stroke prevention.</p>
