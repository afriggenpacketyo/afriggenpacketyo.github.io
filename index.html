          <p>Federal prosecutors are advocating for Sean 'Diddy' Combs to receive at least 11 years in prison following his conviction on two counts of transportation for prostitution, despite his acquittal on more severe charges. The prosecution argues that Combs remains unrepentant and has instilled fear in his victims, citing his violent and abusive behavior, particularly towards Cassie Ventura, as evidenced by hotel security footage. Defense attorneys have deemed the recommendation as excessively harsh, suggesting that time served would be a more appropriate sentence. The article highlights the stark contrast between the prosecution's portrayal of Combs as a danger to society and the defense's plea for leniency. The author's tone reflects the seriousness of the legal proceedings and the gravity of the allegations against Combs. The article's sentiment leans towards a somber reflection on the legal battle. </p>

          <p>Milorad Dodik, once viewed favorably by the West, has stepped down from his official positions in Republika Srpska after nearly three decades in power, following a months-long dispute with the Bosnian state judiciary. Dodik's withdrawal comes after a Bosnian federal court sentenced him to prison and barred him from politics for six years for defying decisions by the international envoy overseeing the Dayton Agreement. Despite initial defiance and threats of a referendum, Dodik's party has conceded, and he has requested the appointment of an interim president. The article underscores the devastating economic impact of Dodik's leadership, marked by corruption and a shrinking population, as well as his failed attempts to secure support from Moscow, Budapest, and Belgrade. The tone reflects a sense of finality and decline in Dodik's political career. </p>
