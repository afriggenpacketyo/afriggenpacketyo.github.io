          <h2>Escalating Feud Between Trump and Musk Highlights Risks of Politicized Denaturalization</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece explores the escalating public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, which has now included threats from the president to have the naturalized U.S. citizen deported. The article argues that this conflict reveals the alarming potential for denaturalizationâ€”the act of revoking citizenshipâ€”to be used as a political weapon against the administration's enemies. Such a move would set a chilling precedent for the country's 25 million naturalized citizens, suggesting their status could be contingent on political alignment.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks, including those of major renewables developer NextEra Energy, experienced a notable increase after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the final Senate version of the GOP spending bill. The proposed tax, which would have targeted projects using components from countries like China, had drawn outrage from the industry. While its removal was a relief, industry associations caution that the bill still phases out crucial investment tax credits, creating long-term uncertainty for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>
