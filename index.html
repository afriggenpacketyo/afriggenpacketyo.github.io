        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of HBO and CNN, will divide into two separate entities by mid-2026, separating its studio and streaming business from its traditional cable television networks. This restructuring arrives as streaming services gain popularity and cable TV audiences decline. The Streaming & Studios division, which includes HBO Max hits like *Succession* and *The White Lotus*, will be led by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks division, encompassing CNN and Discovery, will be headed by Gunnar Wiedenfels. The move aims to provide each division with the focus and flexibility needed to compete effectively in the evolving media landscape.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have been activated and may be deployed to Los Angeles to support National Guard troops amidst protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests. These Marines, based in Twentynine Palms, are trained in de-escalation and crowd control. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated the Marines are being deployed to restore order. California Governor Gavin Newsom has expressed strong opposition, calling the deployment a blatant abuse of power and threatening legal action, arguing it is illegal and unnecessary given the state's ability to manage the situation. The Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDowell also voiced concerns about the logistical challenges of federal military forces operating without clear coordination.</p>

          <p>Victims of the January 6th Capitol riot and congressional Democrats are accusing the Trump administration of hypocrisy in its response to protests in Los Angeles, citing a stark contrast between the administration's aggressive stance against those accused of confronting police in Los Angeles and their defense of individuals involved in the Capitol siege. Former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn criticized Trump's continued characterization of January 6th as a "day of love." Democrats have also noted the contrast in Trump's swift deployment of the National Guard to California compared to his delayed response during the Capitol attack. Critics argue that Trump's actions and rhetoric are an attempt to rewrite history and create a false equivalency between the two events.</p>

The departure of young people seeking opportunities elsewhere and the lack of immigration have created concerns about the region's future. Despite unfulfilled promises from Donald Trump, such as bringing back coal jobs and addressing the drug crisis, many residents continue to support him due to a sense of abandonment by modern Democrats.

          <p>China's advanced Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50 fighter jets have garnered international attention since their unexpected emergence last year. The J-36, nicknamed "Gingko leaf," features a delta wing platform and tailless design to reduce air drag and enhance radar evasion. The J-50's aerodynamic features include trailing edge control surfaces and split flaps, improving airframe streamlining and maneuverability. These aircraft showcase China's advancements in military aviation technology, though many details remain undisclosed.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are engaged in a dispute over the handling of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles. Trump criticized Newsom's leadership and deployed National Guard members to the city, while Newsom requested the deployment be rescinded and initiated a lawsuit, claiming Trump illegally federalized the National Guard. Trump has characterized the protests as "violent, insurrectionist mobs," while Newsom accused the White House of exacerbating the situation for political gain. The conflict underscores the ongoing political tensions between the Trump administration and Democratic-led states.</p>

A report by the Women and Equalities Committee highlights that paternity leave rules reinforce outdated gender stereotypes and require significant investment to improve. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks. The current system, introduced in 2003, provides only two weeks of leave at a low pay rate, falling short compared to other developed countries.</p>
