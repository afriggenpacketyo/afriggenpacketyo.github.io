        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced new regulations requiring all lithium-ion battery packs, including power banks, to obtain a China Compulsory Certification (CCC) before production or sale. This measure follows several fire incidents caused by faulty products and aims to enhance quality and security. While not an outright ban, the regulation could restrict the use of uncertified power banks in public spaces and on domestic flights. This move formalizes a previous voluntary certification, reflecting a proactive approach to consumer safety.</p>

          <p>The Philippine Navy reported Chinese ships in waters off Batanes, an archipelago strategically located near southern Taiwan and the Bashi Channel. Analysts suggest this increased presence aims to deter the Philippines from intervening in any potential Taiwan conflict. Tensions are already high over the disputed Scarborough Shoal, where a China Coast Guard vessel recently collided with a Philippine vessel. China's Ministry of Defense blamed Philippine vessels for dangerous maneuvers, escalating maritime disputes in the region.</p>

          <p>The persistent human fascination with Mars, exemplified by Elon Musk's ambitious colonization plans, traces back to a 19th-century optical illusion. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli observed what he called 'canali' (channels), mistranslated as 'canals,' leading American astronomer Percival Lowell to theorize artificial irrigation systems built by an advanced Martian civilization. This belief, despite scientific debunking, captured public imagination and inspired generations of scientists and science fiction, ultimately contributing to the drive for space exploration and the eventual close-up imaging of Mars by NASA's Mariner spacecraft.</p>

          <p>A former RAF test pilot claims the 1994 Chinook helicopter crash in Scotland, which killed 29 people, was a 'show flight' to demonstrate the Mark 2 version's safety despite known airworthiness concerns. Squadron Leader Robert Burke suggests internal politics between the Army and RAF influenced the decision to use the Chinook, rather than a safer alternative. Families of the victims, many of whom were senior security service members, are renewing calls for a public inquiry, citing revelations that crash-related files will remain classified for 100 years.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to allow his party to appoint peers to the House of Lords. Farage argues for addressing the 'democratic disparity' in the upper chamber, noting Reform UK's significant electoral support and local government presence despite having no peers. While the Prime Minister has discretion over such appointments, this request highlights the shifting political landscape in Britain. Defence Secretary John Healey criticized Farage, pointing out his past calls for the Lords' abolition.</p>

          <p>President Trump's first one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin of his second term in Alaska highlights their complex and evolving relationship amidst Russia's war in Ukraine.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday to discuss the Ukraine war. The summit will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, chosen for its security and availability during peak tourist season. Alaska's historical ties to Russia and its strategic Arctic location lend symbolic weight to the venue. The meeting is anticipated to be a preliminary discussion, with White House officials playing down expectations of an immediate ceasefire, describing it as a "listening exercise" for President Trump.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to see a nearly 20% increase in data centers, with almost 100 new facilities planned, primarily driven by the growth of artificial intelligence. While the government deems data centers critical national infrastructure, concerns are mounting over their massive energy and water demands, potentially driving up consumer utility bills. Experts are calling for mechanisms to make companies bear the full cost of this energy consumption, rather than burdening consumers. The expansion also faces local opposition and environmental scrutiny, echoing similar challenges seen in other countries like Ireland.</p>

Over 100 countries advocate for production curbs, citing the unsustainable growth of plastic and its toxic chemical content.
