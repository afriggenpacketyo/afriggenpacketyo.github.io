          <p>Former South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has been detained for a second time as prosecutors investigate charges of insurrection. The accusations stem from his declaration of martial law in December and an attempt to use soldiers to prevent his impeachment. Yoon is being held in a solitary cell at the Seoul Detention Center amid concerns he could destroy evidence. He faces a potential life sentence for his actions, which the Constitutional Court deemed a betrayal of public trust and a denial of democratic principles.</p>

          <p>A significant overnight Russian drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least two deaths and thirteen injuries, with fires reported across multiple districts. According to Ukrainian officials, wreckage from a drone struck a residential building, and a primary healthcare center was almost completely destroyed. This attack is part of a recent escalation, following what Ukraine described as the largest-ever aerial assault just days prior. Residents were urged to remain in shelters as air defense systems worked to repel the ongoing strikes.</p>

          <p>Detectives in Wales are investigating historical sexual abuse allegations against a convicted former bishop and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. A BBC investigation revealed that concerns about former Bishop Anthony Pierce, jailed earlier this year for child sexual abuse, were reported to church officials as early as 1986 but were seemingly ignored. Four individuals have come forward, detailing a culture where abuse was overlooked and calling for an independent inquiry. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings and promised a review of its culture and safeguarding procedures.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness reveals that some of the world's poorest countries, including Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen, are paying millions of dollars to lobbying firms with connections to Donald Trump. This spending comes as these nations face significant cuts in U.S. foreign humanitarian aid, following the dismantling of USAID. The report suggests these countries are becoming more desperate, sometimes bartering natural resources for humanitarian or military support. Firms like Ballard Partners, with strong ties to Trump, have secured multi-million dollar contracts, raising concerns about exploitation and unfair dealmaking.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party continues to gain political traction, highlighted by the defection of Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister. This follows several other recent defections from the Conservative party, signaling a significant trend. Sir Jake's sharp criticism of the last two decades of government underscores the deep divisions on the right of British politics. This development is forcing a strategic shift from the ruling Labour party, which is now reportedly focusing more of its attention on countering Reform UK's growing influence.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that these policies have contributed to massive inflation for everyday items. This legal challenge is part of President Trump's broader vow to lower egg prices, which have risen sharply due to factors including a major bird flu outbreak.</p>

          <p>Chinese exporters are facing significant uncertainty as the Trump administration threatens high tariffs on goods transshipped through Southeast Asian nations. While the tariffs have been announced, a lack of implementation details has left manufacturers who moved production to countries like Vietnam and Malaysia in limbo. This ambiguity is a strategic blow to Chinese companies that have been using Southeast Asia to circumvent direct U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. In response, many businesses are adopting a cautious "wait-and-see" approach, delaying investment and operational decisions until U.S. policy becomes clearer.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a pause on some shipments that was implemented last week. Trump stated that Ukraine must be able to defend itself from Russia's attacks, which he said are killing too many people. The Pentagon confirmed it is sending additional defensive weapons at the president's direction. The initial halt was part of a broader review of weapons transfers, but Trump has recently expressed increased frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in the ongoing war.</p>

Another individual, Pojoy Sajqui, was also found deceased at the scene from the same cause.

          <p>Economists and industry experts are warning that President Trump's newly announced 50% tariff on copper could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer goods. Copper is a critical component in electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. Experts argue that increasing the cost of this vital imported metal will force companies to pass on the expense to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. While the administration says the tariff will reshore the U.S. copper industry, analysts note that ramping up domestic production would be a multi-year process. (not investment advice)</p>

Bishop Alberto Rojas of the Diocese of San Bernardino stated that the fear of potential immigration enforcement action constitutes a "grave inconvenience" for the faithful. This comes as the Trump administration's enforcement push has led to nearly 2,800 arrests in the Los Angeles area, causing many in the community to go into hiding.

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has only partially rebounded from its sharp decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, the average lifespan remains nearly a year shorter than in 2019, with drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease now being the primary drivers of the deficit, rather than the virus itself. The recovery has been notably slower for Black and Hispanic Californians, widening pre-existing disparities. The research highlights that while the most acute phase of the pandemic is over, its ripple effects and underlying health inequities continue to impact mortality rates across the state.</p>

In response, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva asserted his country's sovereignty and the independence of its judiciary.

According to documents obtained by Politico, the cuts are part of a broader push to reduce the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements. This move would deprive the agency of decades of institutional knowledge and comes amid proposed budget cuts that would cancel numerous science programs. The planned layoffs have caused chaos within the space industry and drawn condemnation from former NASA officials.</p>
