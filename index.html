          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the revocation of her student visa due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Judge Sessions stated that the government's case rested solely on the op-ed and lacked evidence of violence or advocacy for violence. The court ordered her release with no travel restrictions, allowing her to return to her studies at Tufts, while the Trump administration maintains that her visa was revoked due to associations that undermined U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay Texas nearly $1.4 billion to settle allegations that it violated the data privacy rights of Texas residents by unlawfully tracking and collecting their private data. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, and this settlement is said to be the largest of its kind between a state and Google. This settlement comes after Texas secured a similar $1.4 billion settlement from Meta for unauthorized use of biometric data. Google stated that the settlement resolves old claims related to product policies that have since been changed and that they are committed to building robust privacy controls into their services.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a move that would curtail the constitutional right to challenge detention in court. Miller justified this potential suspension by arguing that the U.S. faces a national security threat due to undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a president cannot do so unilaterally. This consideration follows a federal judge's order to release Tufts University student Rumeysa Öztürk, who was detained after her student visa was revoked.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs based on national security interests.

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks due to concerns about heat damage to crops in China's agricultural heartlands. The purchases include milling quality wheat for delivery in July or August. The bookings from Australia mark the first such purchases since last year. Despite the recent increase, China's wheat imports slowed sharply after large harvests last year, and the long-term impact of the heat concerns on future purchases remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a former commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), plans to sue the Trump administration over his dismissal, calling it illegal. Trumka claims his firing came after he and other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency. Consumer Reports and several Democratic senators have condemned the firing, arguing it undermines the independence of the CPSC. Trumka believes his dismissal will allow the administration to weaken the agency's lifesaving functions.</p>
