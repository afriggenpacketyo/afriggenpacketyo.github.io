          <p>A planned visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off as trade tensions between the two nations continue to escalate. The cancellation comes as India faces a cumulative 50% U.S. tariff rate, one of the highest for any American trading partner, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. While both sides remain in contact, no new date has been scheduled for the talks, leaving Indian exporters concerned about the impending implementation of additional duties. The U.S. is India's largest single export partner, making the outcome of these negotiations highly significant for the Indian economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening to a Category 4 storm. While currently lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain and wind, its projected path is expected to keep it several hundred miles off the U.S. East Coast. However, the powerful storm is forecast to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from North Carolina to Virginia next week. A cold front is anticipated to steer Erin out to sea, but coastal erosion remains a significant concern for areas like the Outer Banks.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created a new method that makes biological tissues, including the brain, transparent for clearer observation of their internal structures. The technique produces highly accurate and vivid three-dimensional images by preserving the tissue's original morphology while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. This process involves creating an "ionic glassy tissue" that forms a stable, solid state at low temperatures. The development promises to provide unprecedented views into the complex workings of organs and can be used for long-term storage of samples.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting in Alaska with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has reportedly signaled support for a peace proposal that would see Russia take full control of Ukraine's Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would agree to freeze the current front lines in other occupied areas like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This represents a significant shift from seeking a simple ceasefire to pursuing a permanent peace agreement, a move that aligns with Putin's stated goals for a long-term settlement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is scheduled to meet with Trump, has previously rejected any surrender of Ukrainian territory.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Dodgers capitalized on a series of sloppy plays by the Padres, including poor baserunning that led to three runners being caught stealing and a costly defensive error that scored two runs. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, while San Diego's starter struggled with walks. This win not only restored the Dodgers' division lead but also clinched the season's head-to-head series against their rivals.</p>

The call comes ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's critical visit to the White House, where he will meet with President Trump. While Starmer commended Trump's efforts to end the conflict, he emphasized that any path to a lasting peace cannot be determined without President Zelenskyy's direct involvement and agreement. The European allies are reportedly prepared to offer robust security guarantees to Ukraine as part of any potential deal.</p>

          <p>Health officials are observing a significant increase in tick bites and associated medical visits this summer, with the CDC reporting the highest rate of tick-related ER visits since 2019. Experts attribute the rise to several factors, including warmer and more humid conditions that allow ticks to thrive, and the expansion of tick habitats into more populated areas. While increased public awareness may be leading to more people seeking early treatment, the trend highlights a growing public health concern due to the risk of tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease. Officials are reminding the public of prevention methods and proper removal techniques.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the costumed "Zombie Hunter," has been found guilty of the 1990s murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. The cold case was solved after 21 years using DNA and genetic genealogy, which linked Miller to the crime scenes. His defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia. The judge rejected this defense, sentencing Miller to death for the brutal sexual assaults and murders that had long haunted the Phoenix community.</p>

Stafford, 37, has been dealing with an aggravated disc that has prevented him from practicing with the team. Coach Sean McVay is expected to address the situation on Monday, but the lack of information is creating uncertainty around the veteran quarterback's availability. In the Rams' preseason win against the Chargers, backup quarterback Stetson Bennett performed well, completing 28 of 40 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier based on a "scissor-wing" design once explored by NASA. The proposed aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates as the vehicle accelerates, optimizing performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This innovative design aims to solve the aerodynamic challenges of balancing low-speed stability with high-speed efficiency, potentially enabling a new class of long-range vehicles.</p>

The investigation began after a business partner grew suspicious about a package of cyanide delivered to the dental office.

          <p>A couples' therapist and executive counselor outlines five common psychological reasons why people, even those considered "good," risk their careers and families for an affair. These triggers include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to be "good," the burnout from perfectionism, having poor boundaries developed in childhood, and being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage. Additionally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating one's life and priorities. The article suggests these factors can create an internal pressure that leads to a sudden break from established norms.</p>

Some parents also rely on local food pantries that provide surplus food from supermarkets at a low cost.

          <h2>U.S. State Department Halts Medical Visas for Gazan Children After Far-Right Pressure Campaign</h2>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has stopped issuing visitor visas for individuals from Gaza, a program often used to bring severely injured children to the U.S. for medical treatment. The decision came after Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer, launched an online pressure campaign falsely characterizing arriving Palestinian children and their families as security threats. The State Department announced it would conduct a "full and thorough review" of the medical-humanitarian visa process. The move was immediately condemned by aid charities, who warned it would have a devastating impact on their ability to provide lifesaving care.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the accessories chain once a staple for tweens and teenagers in the UK, has appointed administrators after facing falling sales and intense competition. For decades, the store was a go-to destination for affordable jewelry, ear piercing, and glittery accessories, representing a rite of passage for many young shoppers. However, the brand has struggled to compete with fast-fashion giants like Shein, which can replicate TikTok trends at lower prices within days. Analysts also note that children are adopting more premium brands at a younger age, leaving Claire's caught in the middle.</p>

          <p>The risks of playing starters in the preseason were highlighted when Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston was carted off the field after a significant hit during a game against the Rams. Johnston appeared to be knocked unconscious after taking a helmet-to-chin shot from a Rams safety while attempting to catch a deep pass. After several minutes of medical attention, he was able to leave the field sitting upright. Coach Jim Harbaugh later confirmed that Johnston sustained a concussion and was taken to a hospital as a precaution, casting uncertainty on his availability.</p>

          <h2>UK Experiences Signs of an Early Autumn as Prolonged Heatwave Stresses Trees and Wildlife</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 19:12:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an ongoing heatwave, parts of the UK are showing signs typically associated with autumn, such as leaves turning yellow and berries ripening prematurely. Experts explain this is not a true early autumn but rather a stress response from nature due to the prolonged hot and dry summer. The lack of rainfall has caused trees to enter survival mode by shedding leaves and branches, while the unusual conditions are disrupting the natural cycles for wildlife like birds and bees. This "false autumn" highlights the tangible impact of extreme weather on the UK's ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A 66-year-old homeless man named Bill Theodie has spoken out after being unknowingly photographed for a social media post by President Trump, which was used to justify a crackdown on homelessness in Washington D.C. Four days after the post, the encampment where Theodie had lived for years was dismantled by a bulldozer with little notice. Theodie described the experience as shocking, stating he felt used as a political tool. The city's accelerated removal of the encampment is part of a new White House initiative that offers shelter placement but threatens fines or jail time for those who refuse.</p>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has been held in a Kenyan mortuary for 11 years due to a bitter and protracted legal battle between his children. Following his death in 2013, his sons from his first marriage accused his second wife and their daughters of poisoning him to inherit his estate, leading to the body's exhumation. A decade-long inquest has now concluded, with a magistrate ruling that the cause of death could not be determined due to decomposition. The court has released the body for reburial, but with the family deeply divided, the dispute is likely to continue.</p>

          <p>A group of students preparing for their GCSE exams opened letters they wrote to themselves four years ago, at the beginning of their secondary school education during a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters captured their 11-year-old perspectives, with questions about girlfriends, hopes for the pandemic's end, and dreams of attending university. The exercise served as a poignant reflection on their journey through a uniquely disrupted education, which included remote learning and strict "bubble" systems. The students and their teacher reflected on the perseverance their year group showed in navigating these unprecedented challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Vladimir Putin during their summit, addressing the situation of children affected by the Russia-Ukraine war. While officials initially suggested it mentioned the abduction of Ukrainian children, the released text is more philosophical, speaking of childhood innocence and urging Putin to "restore their melodic laughter." The letter does not explicitly mention the abductions for which Putin has been indicted by the ICC. Ukrainian officials nevertheless expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the issue of forcibly deported children.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a German-style village in Chile, is grappling with its dark past as Colonia Dignidad, a secretive sect that served as a torture center during the Pinochet dictatorship. Founded by the abusive Paul Schäfer, the colony was a site of forced labor, child sexual assault, and the murder of political prisoners. Today, some remaining residents have transformed it into a tourist destination, but the Chilean government plans to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the victims. This plan has divided the community, with some residents feeling victimized anew while victims' families support it as an act of remembrance.</p>
