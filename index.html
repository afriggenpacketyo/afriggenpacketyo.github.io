            <p>President Trump underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed, his first exam of his second term. Detailed health information has been scarce since 2018, with no disclosures during the 2024 campaign. The 2018 evaluation indicated "excellent" cardiovascular health for his age, with high cholesterol and being overweight as the only noted issues.  In October 2020, Trump was hospitalized with COVID-19, receiving experimental treatments. Recent reports from his personal physician claim excellent overall health, weight reduction, and normal cardiovascular and cognitive function.  In July 2024, Trump was wounded in a Pennsylvania rally shooting, with his former physician confirming a gunshot wound to the ear.</p>

The crash occurred around 10:20 a.m., leading to road closures on North Military Trail and the I-95 overpass at Glades Road. Witnesses reported the plane appeared to have trouble shortly after takeoff, attempting to return to the airfield before crashing.  Debris from the crash is scattered across the Tri-Rail tracks, suspending train service, and the NTSB is investigating the incident.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has extended the deadline for the Justice Department to provide information on steps taken to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the directive for the government to "facilitate" his release from Salvadoran custody. Abrego Garcia was deported last month after being accused of gang ties, which his lawyers deny. The Justice Department argued the court lacks jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government, but the Supreme Court directed clarification, emphasizing deference to the Executive Branch.</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's boast that foreign leaders are "kissing his ass" to avoid tariffs, China's leader Xi Jinping is unlikely to yield to pressure. Xi's power is built on a new Chinese nationalism and standing up to foreign oppressors.  China has retaliated against Trump's tariffs, signaling a calm resolve. Analysts suggest that Trump's team misunderstands Xi's political realities, and that neither leader can afford to appear weak.</p>

Experts warn that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains, raise drug prices, and worsen existing shortages of critical medicines. Generic drug manufacturers, which already operate on thin margins, could be particularly vulnerable. The tariffs could undermine efforts to control healthcare costs in the U.S.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador, must be returned to the US. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate and effectuate" his return, but also said a judge in the case may have exceeded her authority. The Trump administration had appealed against the district court's order. The government has conceded he was deported due to an "administrative error", though it also alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies.</p>
