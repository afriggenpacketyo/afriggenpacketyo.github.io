          <p>Shares in both Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance experienced a significant surge following reports that Paramount is preparing a buyout offer for its rival. The potential bid for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, which includes major assets like HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. film studio, signals further consolidation in a media industry being reshaped by the rise of streaming. This development comes as media firms face increased scrutiny and just weeks after Paramount Skydance completed its own major merger, highlighting a period of aggressive strategic maneuvering within the sector.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her role in a wide-ranging bribery case. She was convicted of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for her husband's political influence. During sentencing, the judge acknowledged her health issues and personal trauma but emphasized she was a "central participant" in the scheme, not an innocent observer. This sentence follows her husband's conviction; he is currently serving an 11-year term for his part in the corruption.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly predicted the failure of rival Spirit Airlines, stating the budget airline will go out of business "because I'm good at math." Kirby criticized the entire discount airline model, arguing that its reliance on low base fares supplemented by numerous fees creates a negative customer experience that is ultimately unsustainable. His comments come as Spirit struggles with weak demand and high costs after recently filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in a year, reflecting significant financial distress.</p>

          <p>An article from Fox News argues that Wikipedia editors framed Charlie Kirk's biography with a negative, left-wing narrative, particularly after his death. The piece points to the use of labels like "right-wing" and a focus on controversies, which it claims are not applied to comparable figures on the left. It also critiques the site's reliance on mainstream media sources and its influence on AI search results, suggesting this creates a biased information ecosystem that disproportionately feeds into Google and other platforms, shaping public perception.</p>

The company also provided an optimistic forecast for the fourth quarter, projecting continued growth and raising its full-year outlook for its digital media segment.

          <p>A majority of justices on a Brazilian Supreme Court panel have voted to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro on multiple counts related to an attempt to stage a coup after his 2022 election defeat. The ruling finds him guilty of orchestrating a plot to illegally remain in office, which could result in a prison sentence of several decades. The trial has deeply polarized Brazil and drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who described the proceedings as a politically motivated "witch hunt" against his ally.</p>

The article explores whether additional protocols like drone surveillance could have been employed, highlighting that for public figures like Kirk, security arrangements are not standardized and often depend heavily on individual budgets and threat assessments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging that the company engages in systemic discrimination against riders with disabilities, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The complaint claims that Uber drivers frequently refuse service to individuals who use service animals or stowable wheelchairs and sometimes impose improper fees on them. The federal government is seeking injunctive relief, monetary damages, and civil penalties, arguing that Uber has failed to adequately modify its policies and practices to ensure equal access for all users.</p>

          <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has completed a loan move to Turkish club Trabzonspor for the rest of the 2025-26 season. The transfer occurred just before the Turkish transfer window closed. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 to be the club's starting goalkeeper, had not featured in any of United's first three Premier League matches this season. His only appearance for the team this year was in a surprising Carabao Cup defeat, signaling he was not in the new manager's immediate plans.</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have declined to 6.35%, marking their lowest level in nearly a year and presenting a potential window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers and homeowners considering a refinance. This downward trend is largely attributed to market expectations of an impending interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a corresponding drop in the 10-year Treasury yield. The article suggests that while waiting for even lower rates is a gamble, the current climate is favorable enough to warrant exploring mortgage options now. (not investment advice)</p>
