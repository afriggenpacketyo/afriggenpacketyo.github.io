          <p>A 61-year-old man was killed and 13 others, with ages ranging from 7 to 61, were injured after a lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey.

Despite CPR efforts by bystanders, the man succumbed to his injuries, while the other victims were hospitalized for various conditions, including burns and shock. This marks the third significant lightning strike incident in the Tri-State Area in the past month, highlighting the recent dangers of severe weather.</p>

          <p>The stock price for Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings dropped by over 9% after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard rescinded its $47 billion acquisition offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. The Japanese company expressed disappointment, disagreeing with Couche-Tard's statements. Analysts suggest that Japan's protectionist business environment and the classification of Seven & i as core to national security made the deal's success highly unlikely from the start.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 21:29:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data obtained by CBS News on over 100,000 deportations under the Trump administration shows a small fraction had convictions for violent crimes like homicide. Of the 70,583 deportees with criminal records, only 0.58% were convicted of homicide, while many infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. This contrasts with the administration's public focus on removing the "worst of the worst" violent criminals and gang members. The data indicates that the expanded deportation efforts have significantly impacted undocumented immigrants without serious criminal histories, raising questions about the stated priorities of the enforcement push.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has been fired by the Justice Department. According to sources, her dismissal was formally communicated via a memo citing presidential powers under Article 2 of the Constitution. Comey was a prominent figure in the Southern District of New York, having led the prosecution against Sean "Diddy" Combs and helped lead the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Her father, James Comey, was famously terminated as FBI director by President Trump in 2017, adding a layer of political context to her dismissal.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly questioned President Trump's dismissal of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation files as a "hoax," suggesting on social media that the president should release the documents to prove his claim. The exchange followed Trump's sharp criticism of his own supporters, whom he called "stupid" and "weaklings" for believing there was more to the Epstein case. The president's attempt to deflect questions about the files his own Justice Department has withheld has created a notable public fissure. Musk's pointed commentary highlights the growing pressure and skepticism surrounding the administration's handling of the sensitive materials.</p>

According to sources, failure to reach an agreement will trigger the "snapback" mechanism, which would automatically reimpose all previously lifted United Nations sanctions. This ultimatum follows a period of heightened pressure, including U.S. and Israeli military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, aimed at compelling Tehran to scale back its nuclear program.

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June year-over-year, marking the second straight month of contraction and fueling concerns that the export-reliant economy could enter a recession. The decline was driven by weakening shipments to major partners, including an 11.4% drop in exports to the United States. The situation is exacerbated by the U.S. imposing a 25% "reciprocal tariff" on Japanese imports, with no trade deal in sight. Exports of automobiles, a key pillar of Japan's economy, have been hit particularly hard, falling over 26% to the U.S. in June. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scrutiny Mounts Over Trump Administration's "Waste and Fraud" Claims Used to Justify Foreign Aid Cuts</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's justification for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid, which it claims is based on evidence of "waste, fraud, and abuse," is facing significant scrutiny. Current and former officials, including the fired USAID Inspector General, state that the administration has provided little proof for its claims. Sources allege the review process was a superficial search for politically charged keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than a thorough investigation into program effectiveness. Critics argue the move is politically motivated and undermines lifesaving humanitarian programs, while a lack of transparency makes the specific cuts and their rationale difficult to verify.</p>

          <p>Early findings from the investigation into last month's fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad suggest the captain may have deliberately cut fuel flow to the engines. According to the Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. officials, the cockpit voice recorder captured the first officer questioning the captain about moving the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position just after takeoff. This action would have caused the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to lose thrust, leading to the crash that killed 260 people. While a preliminary report noted the switches were moved, it did not assign blame, making this new information a critical development in the investigation.</p>

          <p>The southern African nation of Lesotho has declared a two-year state of disaster in response to threats of debilitatingly high tariffs from the United States. As a small, landlocked kingdom, Lesotho's economy is particularly vulnerable to such trade measures. The potential imposition of what are described as the highest U.S. tariffs in the world has created a national economic crisis. This situation highlights the significant and sometimes severe impact of U.S. trade policy on smaller, developing nations whose economies heavily depend on access to the American market.</p>

A switch would align U.S. Coke with versions sold in other countries like Mexico but could negatively impact American corn farmers.

          <p>The cost of placing a child in a summer holiday club for the full six-week break in Britain has risen to an average of £1,076, according to research from the charity Coram. Prices have increased in many regions, with some seeing hikes of up to 13% compared to last year, driven by high demand and a shortage of affordable council-run options. This presents a significant financial burden for working parents who rely on this childcare, especially as costs for essentials like art supplies and food have also risen for providers. The data highlights a growing affordability crisis in childcare for working families during school holidays.</p>

          <p>Thousands of UK leaseholders are planning a class-action lawsuit against major freehold companies, alleging they were secretly overcharged for building insurance. The legal claim asserts that freeholders received undisclosed commissions from insurance brokers, which were then added to the service charges paid by flat owners. Lawyers argue this practice is unlawful and are seeking compensation that could amount to £2,000 per owner. The issue has gained prominence as post-Grenfell insurance costs have soared, potentially increasing the commissions collected by property owners. The targeted companies deny any wrongdoing and state their practices are in line with regulatory frameworks.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are warning that an attempt by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would create significant market instability and a complex legal battle. A research note from Wolfe Research predicts such a move would trigger an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The legality of the firing would likely be challenged in court, potentially reaching the Supreme Court to decide if the president has the authority to remove a Fed chair for cause. The unprecedented scenario raises questions about the independence of the central bank and could undermine confidence in U.S. financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

Eleven airports have raised prices, with hubs like Gatwick and Bristol now charging £7 for a brief stop, a stark contrast to most major EU airports which offer free drop-offs. Airports defend the fees as necessary to manage congestion and fund sustainable transport initiatives, noting that free options are available further from the terminals.

The piece cites a letter from 80 former judges and a whistleblower's allegations that Bove encouraged Justice Department lawyers to defy court orders.

Despite the administration's claims that tariffs would revitalize the U.S. economy, economists have consistently predicted that the costs would be passed on to consumers. The article notes the fluctuating tariff rates and the persistent 10% or higher tax on most imported goods. It frames the central question as not if consumers will pay for the tariffs, but when the financial burden will become apparent in their everyday expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files is creating a significant rift with his base. By dismissing interest in the files as a "hoax" and refusing to release them, Trump is contradicting the core of his political appeal: the promise to expose government secrets and tell truths other politicians won't. The Epstein case is particularly potent because skepticism about the official narrative is widespread, even beyond his base. This reversal forces Trump to ask his supporters to trust the very government institutions he taught them to distrust, revealing a fundamental conflict in his political identity.</p>
