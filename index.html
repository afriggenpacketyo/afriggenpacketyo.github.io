The legislation provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities receive up to $30,000 annually, and home-schooled students get $2,000 a year.

          <p>The IRS has lost almost one-third of its tax auditors after two months of DOGE cuts, according to a report, raising concerns about the agency's ability to collect revenue from wealthy taxpayers and corporations. The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in 31% of auditors leaving through deferred resignation or layoffs. Experts warn that this reduction could lead to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, potentially costing the government billions in lost revenue. (not investment advice)</p>
