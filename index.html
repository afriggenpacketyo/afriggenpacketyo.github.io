          <p>Three House committees are convening to discuss and vote on proposals for a major budget package addressing President Trump's priorities in defense, energy, and tax, with Republican leaders aiming for a floor vote next week. The committees are debating changes to Medicaid and food stamps to fund tax cuts, facing divisions among Republicans on Medicaid overhauls and expiring tax deductions. Democrats are protesting proposed Medicaid cuts, asserting that they will harm children and people with disabilities, while Republicans defend the changes as necessary to achieve savings. The proposed changes include work requirements for able-bodied adults without children and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children.</p>

          <p>During his first major foreign trip, President Trump affirmed that the U.S. has "no stronger partner" than Saudi Arabia, announcing a $142 billion arms deal and other investments potentially worth $1 trillion. Speaking in Riyadh, Trump also declared the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria to provide the country "a chance at greatness". The visit comes as Trump continues to try woo foreign investors to the US to boost the US economy, a key focus of his administration in the nearly four months of his second term. Trump lauded the U.S.-Saudi relationship as "more powerful than ever before" at a U.S.-Saudi investment forum.</p>

The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, holding off on further interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of the tariffs become clearer.

Concerns have also been raised about the project's high cost, the selection of the technology without independent review, and the anti-vaccine stance of some health officials within the administration.</p>

Despite claiming $170 billion in savings, only $70.9 billion is itemized, with many entries raising doubts about their accuracy. One example includes a $38.7 million contract for wastewater monitoring that DOGE claimed to have canceled, but the CDC confirmed it was merely modified, not canceled.

          <p>A small nodule was discovered in former President Joe Biden's prostate during a routine physical exam, prompting further evaluation. While the nature of the nodule is yet to be determined, it follows Biden's previous removal of a cancerous lesion from his chest in 2023. The news coincides with excerpts from a new book alleging Biden's declining health, which his spokesperson has refuted, defending Biden's effectiveness as president.</p>

          <p>California's plan to require ethnic studies for high school graduation is in jeopardy as Governor Gavin Newsom withholds state funding, delaying the mandate amid ongoing controversy. The pause leaves school districts uncertain about offering the course this fall, with some proceeding regardless and others shelving it until required. The political environment complicates the issue, as some view the curriculum as promoting "woke" ideologies, while concerns arise about the presentation of Jews and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
