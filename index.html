        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant decline in volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining emergency services and could force many towns to switch to costly paid departments. The number of volunteers has dropped by over 20% since 1985, while emergency calls have tripled, leading to burnout and resource shortages. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment, as the current volunteer system saves taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually and is crucial for community safety.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has placed former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest amid an ongoing trial for allegedly plotting a coup. The decision, made by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, was prompted by Bolsonaro's failure to comply with previous restraining orders, including communicating with supporters via allies' social media. The ruling has drawn condemnation from the U.S. State Department and has been framed by Donald Trump as a politically motivated "witch-hunt."</p>

The campaign had previously drawn online criticism, with some accusing it of promoting eugenics, a claim the company denied. Trump's endorsement contrasted the ad with what he termed "woke" advertising, contributing to a meme-driven rally for the financially challenged retailer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that Taiwan's energy and resource supplies would be rapidly depleted in a Chinese military blockade. War-gaming scenarios suggest natural gas would last only 11 days, coal seven weeks, and oil 20 weeks, posing a significant challenge to the island's resilience. The report also notes that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could escalate into a wider conflict involving the U.S.</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in prizes from the UK's government-backed Premium Bonds savings program have gone unclaimed, according to a BBC investigation. The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include eleven awards of £100,000 each. Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to trace winners, particularly those with older, paper-based bonds or those who have moved without updating their contact details.</p>

          <h2>Southern California Fires Drive State's Pace for Potentially Worst Wildfire Year</h2>

          <p>California is on track for one of its most severe wildfire seasons in recent memory, with acreage burned so far significantly outpacing the five-year average. The surge is largely driven by major fires in Central and Southern California, where dry conditions and heat waves have created a volatile landscape. While Northern California has had a slower start, officials warn that conditions are drying out statewide, and a coming heat wave is expected to increase the fire risk and potential for erratic fire behavior.</p>

          <h2>California May Counter Texas Redistricting Push With Its Own Map Changes</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that Democrats are preparing a "trigger" measure that would ask voters to approve a mid-decade redrawing of the state's congressional maps. This action would only be initiated if Texas Republicans succeed in their own effort to redraw their state's maps to gain more seats for the GOP. The potential standoff between the two populous states could have significant implications for which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A BBC report highlights the plight of Korean survivors of the 1945 Hiroshima atomic bombing, many of whom were in the city as forced laborers under Japanese colonial rule. Survivors, now living in a South Korean county dubbed "Korea's Hiroshima," continue to suffer from chronic illnesses and believe these health issues have been passed to their descendants. They face a long-standing struggle for recognition and accountability from Japan, the U.S., and their own government for the unique hardships they have endured.</p>
