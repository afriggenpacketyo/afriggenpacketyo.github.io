          <p>A significant crypto regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, did not pass the Senate due to key Democrats withdrawing their support. The bill aimed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, digital assets pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The vote tally was 48 in favor and 49 against, falling short of the 60 votes needed to proceed. This outcome highlights the ongoing challenges in achieving bipartisan consensus on crypto regulation in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced sharp criticism from Senate Democrats during a hearing on the 2026 DHS budget, particularly regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and asylum policies. Senators accused Noem of defying court orders and mismanaging department funds, with concerns raised about due process for migrants and the potential defunding of FEMA. Noem defended the Trump administration's actions, citing concerns about national security and illegal immigration, claiming the Biden administration let in 20 million people into the country illegally.

          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her attempt to have her 2022 fraud conviction appeal reheard. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals rejected her request, and no judge requested a vote for a full court rehearing. This decision means Holmes' last legal recourse is the Supreme Court. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison for defrauding investors about Theranos' blood-testing technology, which she claimed would revolutionize healthcare. The company collapsed after investigations revealed the technology's shortcomings.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, political scientists argue that the United States has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition to the government comes with a price. They cite the Trump administration's weaponization of government agencies and punitive actions against critics, raising the cost of opposition for a wide range of Americans. The authors contend that citizens must now think twice about criticizing the government due to potential retribution, marking a significant departure from a full democracy. The article suggests that the administration's actions are more extensive than those of elected autocrats in other countries during their initial years in office.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the termination of a program granting humanitarian parole to over 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela. This action challenges a lower court ruling that blocked the administration's attempt to end the program, arguing that individual decisions are required instead of mass terminations. The administration contends that the program's revocation is essential for deterring illegal entry and aligns with democratically approved policies. The program, initiated by the Biden administration, allowed migrants to enter the U.S. with a sponsor and work legally for two years.</p>

          <p>An autopsy reveals that a South Carolina man executed by firing squad may have suffered prolonged pain before dying, as the bullets largely missed his heart. Mikal Mahdi's lawyers argue that the execution was "botched," citing the autopsy and a forensic report indicating that Mahdi experienced conscious pain for 30 to 60 seconds after being shot. The state's Supreme Court previously ruled that the firing squad was legal because any pain would last only 10 to 15 seconds unless there was a "massive botch." Mahdi's lawyers are seeking to prevent similar executions.</p>

          <p>Economists are revising their forecasts for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts due to President Trumpâ€™s tariffs, which raise the risk of higher inflation and slower economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need to wait and see how Trump's policies impact the economy before making any decisions on interest rates. Economists are increasingly targeting September as the most likely time for the Fed to restart cutting rates, with some suggesting a larger-than-usual half-point cut may be necessary to shore up the economy.</p>

This occurred as the House prepares to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, while eliminating taxes on tip income, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits. Trump is pushing to raise the top tax rate from 37% to 39.6% for individuals earning $2.5 million and higher or joint filers earning $5 million. The current plan calls for offsetting tax cuts by reducing spending on Medicaid and nutrition support programs.</p>
