        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US labor market is experiencing a significant shift from the "great resignation" to a new trend dubbed "job hugging," where employees hold onto their jobs due to widespread economic and political uncertainty. This behavior is driven by a cooling job market, with hiring and quit rates near decade lows, reflecting workers' anxiety about finding new employment. While providing stability, experts warn that this stagnation can lead to reduced wage growth and career progression, potentially making it harder for new graduates to find work.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, has publicly condemned India for its continued purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling the act as "opportunistic" and undermining international sanctions against Russia. In an op-ed, Navarro stated that if India wishes to be a strategic partner to the U.S., it must align its actions accordingly, accusing the nation of acting as a global clearinghouse for embargoed Russian oil. This criticism follows the Trump administration's plan to impose additional tariffs on India, raising concerns over escalating trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>A London court has convicted Javon Riley for his involvement in a gang-related shooting that left a nine-year-old girl with a bullet lodged in her brain and life-altering injuries. The attack, which occurred at a restaurant in Dalston, was part of a violent feud between rival Turkish gangs, with the girl being an innocent bystander. Riley was found to have conducted reconnaissance before the shooting and assisted the gunman's escape, though the shooter himself remains unidentified and at large. The girl's family described their future as being "torn away" by the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear energy startup Kairos Power have announced a partnership to deploy an advanced nuclear reactor connected to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. The Hermes 2 reactor will supply up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free electricity, primarily to power Google's regional data centers, supporting the energy demands of artificial intelligence. This collaboration aims to commercialize smaller, more affordable nuclear technology, with Google and Kairos bearing the financial risks of this first-of-a-kind project to avoid passing costs to consumers. The project is seen as a crucial step in revitalizing nuclear construction in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As US and Chinese negotiators work towards a new trade agreement, they face significant hurdles, including a more assertive Beijing and a lack of simple solutions. China has learned from past negotiations and is now likely to demand a more balanced deal, seeking concessions such as relaxed export controls and lower tariffs. The country has also successfully diversified its trade partners, reducing its dependency on the U.S. market since 2018. Furthermore, Beijing has developed its own retaliatory tools, like export controls on critical minerals, giving it more leverage in the current talks.</p>

The scale categorizes hurricanes from 1 to 5 based on sustained wind speeds, providing estimates of potential property damage, from "some damage" for Category 1 to "catastrophic" for Category 5. Storms reaching Category 3 or higher are classified as "major hurricanes" due to their potential for significant loss of life and destruction. This article provides a breakdown of each category, citing historical examples like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Ian to illustrate the devastating real-world impact of these powerful weather events.</p>

          <p>The investment platform Yieldstreet, which promised retail investors access to deals typically reserved for the wealthy, is facing scrutiny after numerous real estate projects resulted in substantial or total losses for its customers. An analysis of investor documents reveals that over $370 million was invested in 30 projects, with at least $78 million in defaults already recognized and many more investments at risk. The company attributes the poor performance of its 2021-2022 offerings to rising interest rates and market pressures, but customers have filed complaints with the SEC, alleging they were misled about the risks involved.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a powerful Category 4 storm, is expected to generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along the U.S. East Coast throughout the week. While the hurricane's core is not projected to make direct landfall, its large size and strength will produce significant coastal effects, including high waves exceeding 20 feet. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, advising residents to monitor the storm's progress.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced significant tax reforms aimed at boosting the nation's domestic economy, which is currently facing pressure from U.S. tariffs. The plan involves simplifying the goods and services tax (GST) regime into a two-rate structure, which is expected to lower the tax burden on small enterprises and cut levies on essential goods. Indian markets rallied following the announcement, with analysts suggesting the stimulus to domestic consumption could more than offset the negative impact of Washington's tariffs. The reforms are anticipated to particularly benefit India's manufacturing, logistics, and automotive sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump explicitly ruled out Ukraine's future membership in NATO and stated that Ukraine would not regain control of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. These remarks signal a significant pressure campaign on Kyiv to accept territorial concessions for a peace deal, following Trump's recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The 41-year-old suspect, who had no known criminal history, was shot and killed by Holly's husband during the incident in their Virginia home.

Research shows that nearly 60% of workers retire earlier than planned, often due to unforeseen health issues, age discrimination, or employment challenges rather than financial readiness. The decline of pensions has shifted the burden of saving onto individuals through 401(k) plans, which can be derailed by market downturns or unexpected expenses. Experts emphasize that the labor market does not always accommodate older workers, making the plan to simply work longer an unreliable solution for many. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a remarkable medical case, surgeons at a Shanghai hospital have saved a patient whose head was nearly severed in an accident involving a robotic arm. The patient suffered a complete separation of the cervical vertebrae and severe damage to neurovascular structures, causing instant paralysis and a heart attack. Doctors noted that the spinal cord, while seriously contused, remained intact, which was crucial for survival. The medical team stated they had never encountered such a severe case of cervical separation in medical literature where the patient survived following treatment.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturers Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid are facing significant revenue challenges following the Trump administration's overhaul of federal environmental regulations. The companies have profited substantially from selling regulatory credits to automakers that fail to meet fuel economy standards, but recent changes have effectively eliminated the market for these credits. In a court filing, Rivian stated that the new policy has put over $100 million of its revenue in limbo. Tesla also warned in its latest earnings report that the repeal of these schemes contributed to a $1.11 billion decrease in expected revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Famed director Francis Ford Coppola has undertaken an unusual six-city tour in an attempt to build a fan base for his critically panned and commercially unsuccessful 2024 film, "Megalopolis." The events, billed as in-depth discussions of the film's themes, have been described as awkward, with the director seemingly trying to single-handedly facilitate a cult following for his self-funded $120 million epic. While cult status for films typically develops organically over time through audience devotion, Coppola's direct intervention represents a unique effort to control his work's legacy. The tour has drawn crowds, but it remains unclear if it will successfully resuscitate the film's reputation.</p>

          <p>Raging wildfires across Spain and Portugal, fueled by a persistent heatwave, have resulted in at least four deaths, including two firefighters who died in separate accidents while battling the flames. Spain has deployed an additional 500 troops, bringing the total to 1,900, to combat several large, out-of-control fires that have forced the evacuation of 27,000 residents. The Castile and León region is among the worst affected, with reports of "unbreathable" air due to smoke. This year, wildfires have burned nearly double the amount of land in Spain compared to the previous year, highlighting the increasing severity of fire seasons in southern Europe.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after losing his reelection campaign, former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has announced he will run for the Senate again in 2026 to represent Ohio.

          <p>Shipping container data reveals that major retailers like Walmart and Target engaged in a "front-loading" strategy, accelerating imports of popular goods to get ahead of looming tariffs and potential strikes. Items ranging from holiday decorations and toys to electronics were shipped into the U.S. earlier than usual throughout 2024 and early 2025. This preemptive action aimed to manage costs and ensure product availability, though it also led to higher short-term freight expenses for companies like Target. The data illustrates how retailers are navigating an unpredictable trade environment by adjusting their supply chain tactics in real-time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This marks the first government-coordinated operation of its kind during the conflict, involving the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children will be selected based on medical need by doctors in Gaza, with the World Health Organization coordinating their travel.

The lengthy trial is widely viewed as a critical test of press freedom and judicial independence in Hong Kong following Beijing's imposition of the national security law in 2020.
