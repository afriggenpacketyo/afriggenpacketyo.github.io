          <p>The author expresses skepticism about the impact of Vatican diplomacy on President Trump's approach to the Ukraine conflict.  Three key factors are cited: the alignment between Trump and Putin's worldviews, Trump's erratic decision-making, and his tendency to prioritize displays of power over strategic outcomes.  The author emphasizes the need for Europe to prepare for a potential standoff with Russia independently of the US. The author questions whether the temporary effect of Vatican diplomacy will last.</p>
