          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged universities to take decisive action against antisemitism, citing an "unacceptable increase" in incidents and Jewish students feeling unsafe. The UK government is funding training for staff and students to combat this issue, with Phillipson writing to vice-chancellors to emphasize the need for protection from harassment. This initiative follows a report by the Community Security Trust, which revealed a 117% rise in antisemitic incidents on campuses over the past two academic years. The government is also allocating funds for projects to teach about misinformation and promote interfaith understanding, alongside Holocaust education for secondary school pupils.</p>

          <p>Amidst the ongoing US government shutdown, some Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) workers who received layoff notices were reinstated, with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) citing errors in the notifications. Approximately 700 of 1,300 initially fired CDC employees had their jobs restored. Vice President JD Vance, however, warned of deeper cuts if the shutdown persists, attributing the situation to Democrats' stance on funding disputes. The Trump administration's broader goal is to reduce the federal workforce, though an exception was made to ensure US service members receive paychecks using unobligated defense funds.</p>

          <h2>New Research Reveals How Dietary Fiber Protects Against Sugar Damage</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UC Irvine study has shed light on how dietary fiber, specifically inulin found in vegetables like onions and garlic, protects the body from the harmful effects of sugar. Researchers discovered that inulin reshapes gut bacteria in the small intestine, enabling them to metabolize fructose before it overwhelms the liver and causes fat buildup. This process not only prevents damage but can also reverse signs of fatty liver disease by reducing fat accumulation and boosting liver antioxidants. The article emphasizes that metabolic damage isn't exclusive to overweight individuals and suggests personalized nutrition strategies based on gut microbe activity.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology company Wingtech reported that control of its Dutch subsidiary, Nexperia, has been effectively frozen by a Dutch court order, following an intervention by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Dutch government confirmed the action was taken under the Goods Availability Act due to "serious governance shortcomings" at the semiconductor manufacturer, citing a threat to crucial technological knowledge and capabilities on Dutch and European soil. Wingtech criticized the move, which it views as a "national security" dispute. This development could strain China's relations with the European Union, particularly concerning strategic technology sectors like automotive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Jets experienced a historic offensive collapse, finishing with minus-10 net passing yards in a 13-11 loss to the Denver Broncos. Quarterback Justin Fields completed only nine of 17 passes for 45 yards, and the team managed just 82 total net yards of offense. Despite their struggles, the Jets had a chance to win late but failed to convert on fourth down. Meanwhile, the Denver Broncos secured their third consecutive victory. The article also briefly mentions other NFL games, including the Rams beating the Ravens and the Chargers defeating the Dolphins, but the Jets' performance stands out for its unique futility.</p>

          <p>Australia, led by captain Alyssa Healy's brilliant 142 runs, achieved a record-breaking women's one-day international chase to defeat India in the World Cup. India had posted a formidable 330, the highest total Australia had ever conceded in an ODI, driven by a strong opening partnership. Healy's chanceless 107-ball innings, featuring 21 fours and three sixes, masterfully dictated Australia's pursuit. Despite losing her wicket with 66 runs still needed, Ash Gardner and Ellyse Perry finished the job with six balls to spare.

The article warns of disciplinary action or job termination for policy violations.

          <p>An expert who studied over 200 parent-child relationships identifies seven common parenting habits that hinder the development of mentally strong children. These include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection, silencing big feelings, prizing achievement above all, hoarding power, making kids responsible for parental emotions, and glorifying burnout. The article emphasizes that resilience is built when children learn to navigate discomfort, process emotions, and understand their worth extends beyond success. Parents are encouraged to model responsibility, allow choices, manage their own emotions, and demonstrate the importance of rest to foster emotional intelligence and autonomy.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's presidency announced an attempt to illegally seize power, hours before an army unit, CAPSAT, claimed control of all armed forces. This unit was instrumental in the 2009 crisis that brought President Andry Rajoelina to power. The situation escalated from youth-led protests against utility cuts to broader dissatisfaction over unemployment and corruption. Rajoelina condemned the destabilization attempt, while CAPSAT joined demonstrators who successfully occupied a key square in the capital. Reports of shoot-outs and casualties have emerged, prompting Air France to suspend flights and the African Union to urge dialogue. The crisis marks the biggest challenge to Rajoelina since his 2023 re-election.</p>
