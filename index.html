          <p>A shouting match erupted during a DOGE subcommittee hearing on transgender women in sports, with Democrats arguing the hearing was a distraction from real issues and Republicans calling on athletes who have criticized transgender athletes in competitions. Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury's motion to adjourn the hearing failed, and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene asserted the hearing was within their jurisdiction. Witnesses included fencer Stephanie Turner, who criticized transgender athletes, and National Women's Law Center CEO Fatima Goss Graves, who spoke about the harm of anti-trans bans. USA Fencing Board Chairman Damien Lehfeldt defended his organization's inclusive policies, stating mixed-gender competition poses no significant safety risks.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby sent a letter to employees outlining steps he believes the FAA should take to resolve ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, including limiting flights during construction, reinstating slot controls, modernizing the air traffic control system, and fully staffing air traffic control. The delays began after a radar and communications outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control facility. The FAA is taking steps to improve speed, reliability, and redundancy by installing new high-bandwidth communications, replacing copper wires with fiber optics, standing up a backup system, and adding a radar data center. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to announce a plan to revamp the air traffic control system nationwide.</p>

          <p>Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his legal challenges to the election results.

          <p>Three former Memphis police officers were acquitted on state charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of Tyre Nichols, who died after a violent arrest during a traffic stop in 2023. The jury deliberated for about 8 1/2 hours over two days before reaching the verdict. The officers still face federal charges, and two other officers involved have pleaded guilty. The prosecution argued the officers used excessive force, while the defense claimed Nichols resisted arrest and that the officer who acted with the most violence is not standing trial. The Justice Department previously found the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.</p>

The FDA announced the recall after a customer discovered the almond-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of almonds.

Historians suggest the transatlantic order established after WWII is disintegrating, urging Germany and the EU to develop independent security policies.

          <p>A new study found that climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 deaths and $160 billion in economic costs in the United States due to wildfire smoke exposure from 2006 to 2020. The study focused on deaths linked to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke, which can cause both short-term and long-term health issues. Researchers analyzed climate conditions during wildfires and compared them to scenarios without climate change to estimate the impact. While land management practices can reduce wildfire fuel, the study emphasizes the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the problem.</p>

          <p>Special Operations Command officials are seeking upgrades for their fixed-wing aircraft, including radio frequency countermeasures, new aerial refueling methods, and improved networking. The MC-130J Combat Talon III is envisioned as a battlefield nexus, connecting operators with space, air, and commands in the homeland, requiring networked data and advanced communication systems. The OA-1K Skyraider II is also slated for upgrades, with modular sensor payloads and weapons enhancements. For drones, special operators seek hardened data links, adaptable autonomous behavior profiles, and AI/ML to reduce bandwidth requirements.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders and eight other Democratic senators have penned a letter urging Paramount Global not to settle Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News over its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. The senators argue that settling the lawsuit would embolden Trump's attacks on the media and freedom of the press. They describe Trump's lawsuit as an attack on the United States Constitution and the First Amendment and call on Paramount Global to stand up for freedom of the press and democracy.</p>

          <p>Senior British trade negotiators have arrived in Washington to accelerate talks on a trade deal between the UK and the US. The UK is aiming to finalize an agreement before the planned UK-EU summit on May 19. However, Trump's recent announcement of film industry tariffs has created a setback. UK officials are targeting tariff relief on specific sectors in exchange for a lower digital services tax. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has ruled out reducing food production standards to facilitate more trade of US agricultural products.</p>

          <p>Following recent cross-border strikes between India and Pakistan, both sides are assessing the situation and considering their next steps. While India emphasizes its actions were limited and targeted, Pakistan claims to have downed Indian aircraft. The question remains whether Pakistan will retaliate further, or if both sides will de-escalate. Analysts suggest that domestic political considerations and economic constraints will play a role in determining each country's response. The international community is urged to facilitate sustained engagement to prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>An immigration judge has denied bond for Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student from Turkey, who was detained after her visa was revoked. Öztürk's lawyers argue her detention violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights, alleging she was targeted for co-writing an op-ed critical of Israel. The State Department memo revoking her visa cited her involvement in associations that "'may undermine U.S. foreign policy'" due to creating a hostile environment for Jewish students.

The panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments in emergency appeals from the Trump administration after two federal judges issued separate decisions in favor of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, and Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University, last month. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that at least 300 students studying at American universities have had their visas rescinded after they were accused of expressing support for Palestinians or participating in campus protests.</p>

          <p>After a highly volatile April, Tesla (TSLA) stock is facing more uphill battles as it enters May. Many of Tesla’s problems can be attributed to CEO Elon Musk and his political affiliations, which have sparked a global backlash and severely impacted Tesla’s vehicle sales. In April 2025, Tesla confirmed some analysts’ fears by reporting extremely disappointing Q1 earnings. Now the company has announced a decision that indicates its demand problem is even worse than many expected.</p>

The price hikes apply only to imported vehicles that were built after May 2. Those models are expected to arrive dealership lots in late June.

The discovery led Springfield Township Police Officer Austin Branham, who conducted the traffic stop, to search the vehicle more thoroughly. He and other officers found methamphetamine, crack cocaine and three used methamphetamine pipes elsewhere in the car, according to the Springfield Township Police Department.</p>
