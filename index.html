          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation enacting 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, along with 10% tariffs on imported buses. This measure aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and incentivize domestic manufacturing. The administration will offer credits to manufacturers importing parts for U.S.-based vehicle production, seeking to boost American labor and cost competitiveness. This policy reflects a broader strategy to influence trade balances and support national industries. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent near-total loan wipeouts at regional banks like Zions and Western Alliance, linked to alleged fraud by a commercial real estate firm, have sparked investor fears reminiscent of the 2023 banking crisis. Concerns are focused on loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), a rapidly growing, less-regulated category that reached $1.14 trillion. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of more hidden risks, as these loans, often with high loss rates, are difficult to assess. While some analysts deem the selloff an overreaction, the article highlights systemic vulnerabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced the immediate commutation of former New York Representative George Santos's prison sentence for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Trump cited Santos's alleged "horrible mistreatment" in prison and a letter from Santos pleading for a chance to rebuild. This decision follows a push from Republican allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Trump's comparison of Santos to Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom Trump accused of fabricating military service. Santos had been serving an 87-month sentence after being expelled from Congress for his extensive fabrications and misuse of campaign funds.</p>

          <p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith suggested that LeBron James's responses to critics might be influenced by race, referencing a past confrontation with James. Smith implied James has not confronted white critics in the same manner he confronted Smith, who is Black. This discussion stemmed from Smith's previous criticisms of James's son, Bronny, which James had addressed as a father protecting his child. James maintained that criticism of on-court performance is acceptable, but personal attacks are not.</p>

These include law enforcement-assisted diversion programs, which guide substance users toward recovery and support, and increased access to medication-assisted treatments like methadone and buprenorphine. The widespread availability of naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, and a generational shift among young people avoiding opioids are also contributing factors.

          <p>Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has been indicted on 18 counts for allegedly sharing over 1,000 pages of classified information with family members for a tell-all book. Prosecutors allege Bolton used a group chat to transmit sensitive documents during his White House tenure, including details around the Trump-Putin Helsinki summit. While Bolton argues political retribution, the Justice Department claims the case is "righteous," especially after a hacked email account containing some of this information was reportedly accessed by Iran. The article differentiates this case from other Trump-era prosecutions, noting the detailed allegations and potential severity.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff apologized for supporting President Trump's idea of deploying National Guard troops to San Francisco, stating he no longer believes it's necessary for city safety. His initial comments, made ahead of his company's Dreamforce conference, drew backlash for violating federal law and suggesting a shift from his past liberal stances. Benioff emphasized the importance of local officials and community partnership for progress. The apology follows Trump's false claims about San Francisco's crime rates and Governor Newsom's rebuttal highlighting declining crime figures.</p>

          <p>The US-China trade war is marked by escalating "shock tactics," including blame games, tit-for-tat threats, and erratic meeting schedules between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. This diplomatic instability, characterized by a disregard for traditional norms, is attributed to a lack of clear communication and mutual misreadings. Recent actions, such as expanded US sanctions and China's export controls on rare earth minerals, reflect a cycle of retaliation. Analysts suggest these aggressive maneuvers risk undermining any chances of a peaceful resolution to the ongoing trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who negotiated Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 plea deal, testified to Congress that a trial would have been a "crapshoot" due to victims' non-cooperation and inconsistent accounts. Acosta, later Trump's labor secretary, argued the plea ensured Epstein went to jail and registered as a sexual offender, sending a strong message. He stated prosecutors anticipated continuous confinement and would not have agreed to the deal if they knew Epstein would receive work release.

          <p>A new study reveals exciting results for the Galleri blood test, which can detect over 50 types of cancer, many of which lack current screening programs. A trial of 25,000 adults in North America showed the test identified cancer in 62% of positive results, often at early, more treatable stages. The test also correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative cases and significantly increased overall cancer detection when combined with existing screenings. While more evidence is needed to confirm its impact on mortality, these findings suggest a major breakthrough in early cancer diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has given up the use of his royal titles and honors, including Duke of York, amid mounting pressure from continuous scandals linked to Jeffrey Epstein. This decision, made in consultation with King Charles and Prince William, allows Andrew to voluntarily step back, avoiding parliamentary intervention. The Palace was reportedly exasperated by the "constant parade of headlines" and recent revelations, such as emails contradicting Andrew's claims about cutting ties with Epstein. The impending posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre and comments from US House Oversight Committee members further intensified the pressure, making his position untenable.</p>

          <p>Lamborghini's CEO, Stephan Winkelmann, announced the company will continue using internal combustion engines for at least another decade, prioritizing hybrid power over a fully electric future. He noted a perceived decline in enthusiasm for electric cars among high-end buyers, creating an opportunity to retain the "sound and emotion" customers desire. The decision puts a long-planned all-electric model, the Lanzador, into question, potentially shifting it to a plug-in hybrid. Winkelmann also asserted Lamborghini's limited environmental impact as a low-volume manufacturer, despite social responsibility.</p>

While Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz clarified that price negotiations are ongoing, the president's comments signal a strong push to align U.S. drug prices with international rates.
