        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final practice session of the Japanese Grand Prix was interrupted by trackside grass fires, causing concern for the race. Lando Norris led Oscar Piastri in a McLaren one-two, but the session was halted twice due to the fires. The FIA is focusing on dampening the grass before qualifying to prevent further incidents, believed to be caused by sparks from the cars and dry grass. Mitigation measures were implemented after similar issues occurred during Friday's practice, including removing loose grass and stationing response teams around the track.</p>

          <p>Despite market turmoil following Trump's announcement of global tariffs, many in Delta, Ohio, a Republican-leaning industrial town, support the president's plans. Residents believe the tariffs will address unfair trade imbalances and boost US industry, even if it means higher prices for consumers. While some businesses, like steel companies, may benefit from protectionism, others, such as the automotive industry, face potential disruptions due to complex global supply chains. Locals express a willingness to endure short-term economic pain if it leads to long-term benefits for American workers and businesses.</p>

          <p>Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike manufactures most of its shoes, have raised concerns about potential price increases for iconic sneakers like the Air Jordan 1s. Nike's shares fell following the tariff announcement, and analysts predict the company may have to raise prices to offset increased import taxes. However, large price increases could reduce demand in the competitive footwear industry. Nike may also explore options like downgrading technology or extending design cycles to keep retail prices low, but a significant reshaping of its supply chain is unlikely in the short term.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, defending World Series champions, suffered their first loss of the season to the Philadelphia Phillies in a 3-2 defeat. Despite a ninth-inning rally, the Dodgers' comeback fell short due to miscues on the bases and strong pitching from the Phillies. Tommy Edman's late-game home run narrowed the gap, but ultimately the Dodgers' perfect start to the season ended. The game highlighted the competitive nature of the National League and the challenges the Dodgers will face in their pursuit of another championship.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are requesting a prison sentence of over seven years for former congressman George Santos after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges. The US attorney argued that Santos' crimes had made a mockery of the election system and that he had shown a lack of remorse. Santos admitted to deceiving voters, donors, and stealing identities to fund his campaign. The sentencing decision will be made by a federal judge on Long Island, with Santos facing significant financial penalties as part of his plea deal.</p>

          <p>A home DNA test revealed that Susan, now in her 70s, was swapped at birth in a busy NHS maternity ward in the 1950s. She was contacted by a stranger whose data matched hers in a way that could only mean they were siblings. After investigating, Susan found that she was swapped with another baby at the same hospital on the same day.
