        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's second fiscal-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, driven by strong iPhone sales and overall hardware performance, although Services revenue fell slightly short of estimates. CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the impact of tariffs, estimating a $900 million cost for the current quarter. Apple is already shifting production, with a significant portion of iPhones for the U.S. being sourced from India and other products from Vietnam. Despite these challenges, Apple authorized a $100 billion share repurchase program and increased its dividend, demonstrating confidence in the company's long-term prospects.

          <p>New York Giants General Manager Joe Schoen provided insight into the team's plans for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, selected in the NFL Draft. With veterans Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston already on the roster, Dart is expected to spend his rookie season learning the offense and developing behind the experienced players. Schoen emphasized the complexity of NFL offenses and the value of Dart's opportunity to learn from seasoned professionals, indicating a redshirt-like season for the young quarterback.

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed concerns about potential price increases resulting from his administration's tariffs, suggesting that Americans might need to accept paying slightly more for goods, including children's toys. He claimed that Americans don't "need" many imported products and that the tariffs are necessary to combat unfair trade deficits. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller argued that consumers would be willing to pay more for American-made products with higher quality and safety standards. Trump insisted that his tariff plan will bring manufacturing back to the U.S., despite warnings from businesses about price hikes and product shortages.</p>

          <p>Sectarian violence in Syria, particularly in Druse-controlled regions, has resulted in over 100 deaths, according to a war monitoring group. The unrest began after an audio clip allegedly insulted the Prophet Muhammad, leading to clashes between pro-government forces and Druse militants. Druse leaders have expressed a new willingness to cooperate with the Sunni Muslim-dominated government to restore order. The government has agreed to deploy forces to secure key roads and protect vulnerable areas, signaling a potential integration of armed groups into a national military. This outbreak of violence highlights the fragility and deep-seated tensions among minority groups in Syria.</p>

This has resulted in chemotherapy postponements and treatment denials for responders with life-threatening illnesses. Without formal certification, treatment for new conditions cannot proceed, leaving patients in limbo.

Beattie sought records mentioning Trump, his associates, and specific keywords, drawing comparisons to Soviet-style political policing. Critics view this as an attempt to build a blacklist and chill contact between the State Department and those deemed disloyal. The article suggests the effort is reminiscent of historical attempts to identify ideological saboteurs, raising concerns about constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times opinion piece, David Brooks reflects on the pervasive influence of Donald Trump's "pagan" values, such as power, manliness, and ego, on American culture. Brooks argues that this ethos threatens democratic values by undermining compassion and equality. He advocates for rooting oneself in rehumanizing forces like art, literature, and selfless service to combat the dehumanizing aspects of paganism. Brooks also notes a potential religious revival as a response to the failures of materialism and hyperindividualism.</p>
