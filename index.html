          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 23:37:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, marking an end to four months of decline, largely fueled by strong growth in shipments to Asian markets, especially China. Despite a new trade deal, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued their significant decline, dropping 13.3%, with automobile shipments particularly affected. The recent appointment of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female Prime Minister, alongside her proposed loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, is anticipated to weaken the yen, potentially enhancing the competitiveness of Japanese goods for exporters. However, analysts caution that the rebound is partially due to a low base from the previous year, and persistent U.S.-China trade tensions continue to cloud the economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named Atlantic storm this year, has formed in the Caribbean, located south-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. While unlikely to significantly impact the mainland United States, the storm is forecast to bring heavy rainfall, up to 10 inches, to Haiti and the Dominican Republic through Friday, with potential for flash flooding and landslides. Its path remains uncertain, with models showing possibilities of it stalling near Haiti and Jamaica as a Category 1 hurricane or turning towards Cuba or Central America. Authorities have issued a hurricane watch for Haiti's southern coast and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica, urging preparations.</p>

          <p>Former Rep. George Santos, whose federal sentence was recently commuted, shared details of his 84-day imprisonment in a wide-ranging interview, describing it as "mentally torturous" and revealing he wrote three suicide notes. Santos expressed apologies to his constituents and former colleagues for betraying their trust, vowing to "rewrite the ending of my life" honorably. He also recounted a conversation with President Trump about contributing from the outside, focusing on prison reform and helping troubled youth, though he clarified he has no immediate plans to seek office. Despite the commutation, local legal challenges remain a possibility, which Santos said he was unaware of.</p>

          <h2>Philip Pullman Urges UK Government to Address 'Wicked' AI Copyright Scraping</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 22:45:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Acclaimed author Sir Philip Pullman has vehemently condemned the practice of artificial intelligence (AI) systems "scraping" writers' works to train language models without providing compensation or acknowledgment. He argues that this amounts to "stealing people's work" and is a "wicked system" that undermines creative industries, urging the UK government to swiftly amend copyright laws to ensure creators are paid for the use of their material. This call for action aligns with broader concerns raised by other prominent authors regarding the potential destruction of growth in creative fields. While the government has launched consultations and formed expert groups on AI and copyright, Sir Philip emphasizes the urgent need for legislative reform to safeguard intellectual property rights.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines on Wednesday as investors reacted to Japan's latest trade data and the country's new political leadership. While Japanese exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, breaking a four-month slump, the figure still missed analyst expectations, and shipments to the U.S. notably dropped. The Nikkei 225 led losses, falling 0.48%, and SoftBank shares plunged over 10% before recovering some ground, despite the Nikkei briefly hitting a new intraday record the previous day. This market movement reflects ongoing assessment of the economic implications of Japan's trade performance and the policies of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's new cabinet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>National Guard troops are slated to arrive in New Orleans by late November, as confirmed by Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, following a request from Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry. This deployment aims to bolster local law enforcement for major upcoming events like the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras, serving as a "force multiplier" for the understaffed police department. While acknowledging the need for assistance, Kirkpatrick emphasized that the Guard's role is a partnership, not an takeover, and she does not believe they should be deployed for general law enforcement outside of major events, citing their different training. Crime rates in New Orleans are currently down compared to last year.</p>

Mahmood, while regretting the resignations, affirmed that the inquiry will explicitly investigate the ethnicity and religion of offenders, emphasizing the government's commitment to the original mandate and the importance of survivor input in shaping its terms.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is currently facing a significant crisis due to rampant copper wire theft, which has plunged numerous communities into darkness, with over 37,000 streetlight repair requests pending and millions in estimated repair costs for infrastructure like the Sixth Street Bridge. In response, a new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is poised to take effect next year, aiming to curb these crimes by imposing stricter responsibilities on junk dealers. The legislation will mandate buyers to verify sellers' identities and lawful ownership, make possession of certain public infrastructure scrap metal illegal, and increase penalties for recyclers who fail to ensure proper authorization. This initiative seeks to dismantle the economic incentive for theft, thereby enhancing public safety and restoring essential services across affected areas.</p>

The potential tragedy was averted thanks to the vigilance of a citizen who reported Cagle's threats, made during a FaceTime call, to the police. Law enforcement, including the Atlanta Police Department and FBI, acted swiftly to locate and take Cagle into custody at the airport's South Terminal, where his truck containing the weapon was later discovered.

This prospective extension is a key element of an ongoing lawsuit brought by the District of Columbia attorney general, which contends that the federal government is exerting "pervasive control" over the deployed troops, effectively establishing a federal military police force. The suit argues that this arrangement overrides local authority and potentially infringes upon the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <h2>Haircare Experts Debunk Four Common Myths About Hair Repair and Washing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, emphasizing that no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which only a haircut can fix. They clarify that washing hair in cold water does not enhance shine, and conversely, not washing hair regularly is detrimental, as the scalp accumulates dirt and oils, leading to odor and worsened conditions like dandruff. Furthermore, dry shampoo is acceptable for occasional use between washes, but not as a substitute for regular cleansing, as prolonged use can cause scalp issues. The experts stress the importance of basic scalp care, akin to facial skincare, for overall hair health.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has claimed a successful strike on the Bryansk Chemical Plant in Russia, utilizing UK-made Storm Shadow missiles, which reportedly bypassed Russian air defense systems. The Ukrainian general staff identified the plant as a critical component of the aggressor state's military-industrial complex, responsible for producing gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel essential for ammunition used in attacks on Ukrainian territory. This offensive action aligns with recent pledges from UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders to escalate economic and defense industry pressure on Russia until a peaceful resolution is reached. The strike highlights Ukraine's continued strategy of targeting key Russian military infrastructure, despite the Kremlin's warnings against Western nations supplying Kyiv with long-range weaponry.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a wrongful death lawsuit, stating he never witnessed signs of drug use from his late teammate Tyler Skaggs, who died from an overdose in 2019. The lawsuit alleges the Angels are responsible for former communications director Eric Kay supplying Skaggs with fentanyl-laced pills. Trout described his close friendship with Skaggs but admitted noticing Kay acting "wired" and suspected drug use, though he didn't know specifics. His testimony is part of a trial where Skaggs' family seeks $118 million, contending the team's reckless decisions enabled Kay, who was later convicted for providing the fatal pill.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why President Trump achieved a breakthrough in brokering a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, but has struggled to find a resolution for the war in Ukraine. It suggests Trump's success in Gaza stemmed from unique leverage over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, bolstered by his long-standing support for Israel and economic ties to Arab nations. In contrast, Trump's diplomatic efforts in Ukraine have faced greater challenges, with less direct leverage over both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The article highlights how Putin may be strategically using Trump's desire for a deal to influence U.S. policy, demonstrating the complexities of international diplomacy in different conflict zones.</p>

Academics stress these differences can be clinically important, potentially affecting patient health and adherence to medication.

          <p>This article offers a detailed explanation for the dramatic increase in UK supermarket prices, using orange juice as a compelling case study, which has seen a 134% price hike since 2020. Factors contributing to this surge include crop diseases like citrus greening, extreme weather events, and an over-reliance on single-nation supply (Brazil). Additional pressures stem from new packaging regulations, trade wars, and Brexit complexities. The article suggests that while some price volatility may normalize, the concentrated market power of a few giant producers and a changing climate mean consumers might need to brace for persistently high food and drink costs, reflecting broader vulnerabilities in the UK's food security.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic eight-vehicle collision occurred on the westbound I-10 in Ontario, California, involving four semitrucks and four passenger cars, resulting in three confirmed deaths and four injuries. The fiery pileup was triggered when a semitruck reportedly failed to slow down in traffic, crashing into another truck and crushing two cars, one of which "exploded on impact." This severe incident has led to the closure of all westbound lanes, except for the FasTrak lanes, and the transition roads from the I-15 to the I-10 westbound, causing significant rush-hour traffic chaos. Authorities have not yet provided an estimate for when these critical freeway sections will reopen, urging commuters to seek alternative routes.</p>
