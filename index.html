          <p>The United Nations humanitarian office has reported a record 383 aid workers were killed in global conflict zones in 2024, a significant increase from the previous year. Nearly half of these deaths occurred in Gaza during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, prompting urgent calls for greater protection for civilians and humanitarian staff. The report highlights that most victims were national staff serving their own communities and points to a disturbing upward trend in violent attacks against aid operations worldwide.</p>

          <p>While diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine were underway, with President Trump calling President Putin to arrange talks, Russia launched a significant missile strike on the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk. The attack damaged key infrastructure and caused widespread power outages, underscoring the persistent conflict on the ground. Ukrainian officials highlighted the contradiction, stating that the assault demonstrates Russia's lack of genuine interest in peace, even as international leaders push for a ceasefire and negotiations.</p>

This move could make the U.S. government the company's largest shareholder, aiming to revitalize the nation's domestic chip production capabilities amid global competition. The plan, which aligns with the administration's strategy of creating government-backed national champions, comes as Intel seeks to regain its market dominance and has also secured a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank.

          <p>A former coach at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute, an Iowa academy known for training Olympic champions, has been arrested by the FBI on a federal child pornography charge. The coach, Sean Gardner, was suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022 following accusations that he sexually abused at least three young gymnasts and secretly recorded others. The case highlights concerns about the slow and opaque disciplinary process for handling abuse allegations within Olympic sports.</p>

          <h2>Contrasting Fortunes: US Honeybee Colonies Collapse While China's Population Thrives</h2>

          <p>While the United States experienced a massive decline in its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has grown to a record high, solidifying its status as the world's top honey producer. Researchers suggest the key difference lies in management practices. The U.S. model often involves large, clustered apiaries with minimal intervention, whereas Chinese beekeepers tend to use more intensive, hands-on management techniques that may contribute to the health and growth of their colonies.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: EU's Inaction on Gaza Reflects Deeper Issues of Systemic Racism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union's failure to take meaningful action against Israel's conduct in Gaza is rooted in structural racism and a persistent colonial mentality. The author contends that the EU's double standards are evident when comparing its swift, strong response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its paralysis regarding the suffering of Palestinians. The piece calls for a moral reckoning that confronts how these biases shape EU foreign policy and undermine its credibility as a defender of international law.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a preliminary injunction for USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson, effectively preventing them from playing this season. The players had sued the NCAA, arguing its "Five-Year Rule" violated antitrust laws by unfairly limiting their eligibility and NIL earning potential. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility requirement was not commercial in nature and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny, dealing a significant blow to both teams' rosters.</p>

          <p>Florida is scheduled to execute Kayle Bates, a 67-year-old man convicted of the 1982 abduction and murder of Janet White in Bay County. This will be the state's tenth execution in 2025, setting a new annual record since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 and making Florida the leading state for executions this year. Despite last-minute appeals to state and federal courts, which have so far been denied, the execution is set to proceed by lethal injection.</p>

          <p>Following a walk-off loss to the Colorado Rockies, Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts met with manager Dave Roberts and president Andrew Friedman. The loss was punctuated by two key defensive mistakes in right field by Teoscar Hernández, fueling speculation about a potential position change. The private meeting suggests the team is seriously addressing its defensive alignment, with one option being to move Betts, a six-time Gold Glove winner in the outfield, back to his former position to strengthen the defense.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to end mail-in voting, stating that an executive order is being drafted to ban the practice before the 2026 midterm elections. Despite the U.S. Constitution granting states the authority to regulate elections, Trump claims the federal government can dictate voting procedures, repeating unsubstantiated claims that mail-in ballots are inherently corrupt. This move signals a renewed focus on election integrity from the White House, though it faces significant legal and constitutional hurdles.</p>
