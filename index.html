            <p>Millions of Beijing residents were urged to remain indoors as northern China experienced its strongest winds in decades, resulting in the suspension of flights and public transportation. The meteorological bureau issued an orange-level warning due to a cold vortex originating from Mongolia, which also brought sandstorms expected to reach Shanghai. Wind speeds reached Force 14 in some areas, leading to the cancellation of over 400 flights at Beijing Capital Airport and the suspension of high-speed rail services to major cities. The disruption highlighted the impact of severe weather events on daily life and infrastructure in densely populated urban areas.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Department of Education is moving forward with plans to withhold federal funds from Maine after the state refused to agree to a Title IX resolution agreement banning transgender athletes from girls' sports. The department is also referring the matter to the Department of Justice for further enforcement action. Maine's Assistant Attorney General stated that Title IX does not prohibit schools from allowing transgender girls to participate on girls' sports teams, citing federal court rulings. This action follows President Trump's executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports, setting the stage for a legal battle between the state and the federal government.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's recent reversal on tariffs has created confusion and uncertainty in the global economy, raising questions about his dealmaking abilities. After initially announcing significant tariffs on numerous countries, Trump paused the measures for 90 days, leading to market volatility. Economists warn that this erratic policymaking undermines confidence in international trade agreements and creates a chilling effect on business investment. The US is now charging a tariff of 145% on Chinese exports, and China is charging a tariff of 125% on US exports. Concerns about stagflation, a combination of stagnant growth and high inflation, are also rising. (not investment advice)</p>

Brown calls for an updated global charter to address global problems through multilateralism and practical cooperation, urging nations to act together to enforce international law and strive for a more inclusive world.

            <p>Market volatility, influenced by President Trump's trade policies and fluctuating oil prices, is creating uncertainty for Alaska lawmakers as they craft the state budget. The state's reliance on oil revenue makes it vulnerable to price swings, impacting funding for essential services and the annual oil-wealth fund dividend. Lawmakers are grappling with balancing the dividend payout with the need for funding in education and other sectors. Some hope Trump's policies could spur investment in Alaska's natural gas projects, but overall, the volatile economic landscape is complicating budget decisions.</p>

Trump announced early on Thursday he would pause the “reciprocal tariffs” for 90 days for most countries, but hit China harder with additional tariffs to a cumulative rate of 145 per cent this year as the trade war continued to escalate.</p>
