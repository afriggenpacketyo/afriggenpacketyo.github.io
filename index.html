          <p>Walmart executives publicly warned that President Trump's tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers, a shift from their initial downplaying of the issue. This outspoken response, while risky given Trump's history of attacking companies, highlights a growing willingness among corporate leaders to criticize trade policy. Walmart's CFO stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases was too large for any retailer to absorb. The company affirmed its commitment to low prices, but acknowledged the reality of small retail margins. This situation illustrates the delicate balance businesses must strike between appeasing customers, shareholders, and a transactional White House, as Trump's trade policies create uncertainty.

          <p>Sable Offshore Corp. has resumed crude oil production in federal waters near Santa Barbara, nearly 10 years after a major oil spill prompted the closure of drilling platforms. The announcement, which has sparked outrage from environmental groups and some officials, comes one month after the California Coastal Commission ordered the company to halt work and levied an $18-million fine for permit violations. Environmentalists claim that the Newsom administration has not done enough to avert a future spill. Sable plans to restart 70 wells at its other two platforms in July and August.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have sharply criticized Israel's plans to escalate the war in Gaza and its blockade of humanitarian aid, labeling the actions "disproportionate" and "egregious." Britain suspended free-trade talks with Israel, while the three nations jointly demanded Israel cease its renewed military offensive. The message underscores growing international concern over the high Palestinian death toll and dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The United Nations warns of potential famine as Israel blocks aid, prompting allied countries to threaten further action if the offensive and restrictions continue.</p>

          <p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told a House committee that the US has “plenty of time” to solve the climate crisis, defending President Trump's budget that would cut $5 billion from the Department of the Interior. The budget proposal slashes spending on national parks, renewable energy, and environmental programs. Burgum argued that the administration's priorities are addressing Iran's nuclear capabilities and competing with China in AI, and that climate change is not an existential threat. Activists have criticized Burgum's approach and his efforts to sell off public lands to the fossil fuel industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to unveil plans for a massive missile shield system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," to protect the United States against missile threats. The project, reminiscent of President Reagan's "Star Wars" program, could cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. The system aims to defend against threats from North Korea and elsewhere. Critics question the need for such a shield, citing existing missile defense systems and the U.S.'s geographic advantages. The initiative could also divert funds from other vital programs, such as the Air Force's replacement of intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>

However, there is no firm agreement yet on further discussions. While Ukraine seems open to the Vatican as a host, the Kremlin might prefer Turkey. The Catholic Church has a history of helping to mediate conflicts and has already been involved in talks to free prisoners and return Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill is facing resistance from Republican rebels in the House of Representatives, creating four major sticking points. The primary disagreements involve the extent of spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and the level of state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Some right-wing lawmakers are pushing for steeper cuts to reduce the national debt, while others are objecting to cuts to Medicaid, which they say would harm lower-income constituents. Trump met with dissenting Republicans but failed to convince all holdouts, raising concerns about the bill's passage.</p>

The move aims to intensify economic pressure on Russia and encourage peace talks in Ukraine. The sanctions target Russia's shadow fleet of old tankers used to covertly transport and sell oil. While Russia's economy has rebounded, sanctions have caused lasting consequences, including a drop in fossil fuel export revenues and rising inflation.

          <p>With gold prices rising significantly, investors are exploring ways to safely invest in the precious metal. Limiting gold investments to a maximum of 10% of an overall portfolio is a recommended strategy, as gold primarily serves as an income protector rather than an income producer. Investors should avoid riskier gold investment types like mining stocks, opting instead for gold bars, coins, or gold IRAs. Monitoring the economic climate and portfolio performance is crucial to identifying potential selling opportunities and ensuring gold's effectiveness as a hedge against inflation.
