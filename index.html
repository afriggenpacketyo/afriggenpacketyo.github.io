          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages, are protesting against the government's plan to expand military operations in Gaza. Demonstrators fear the strategy endangers the remaining hostages and are calling for a deal to secure their release, with some soldiers refusing to serve. The plan has also drawn international condemnation and prompted Germany to halt military exports to Israel, as the UN Security Council prepares to meet on the matter. This article highlights the significant domestic and international pressure facing the Israeli government over its wartime conduct.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing asylum applications for immigrants who entered the U.S. between 2019 and 2022, citing their failure to receive a mandatory "credible fear" screening at the border. This procedural issue, often caused by a shortage of asylum officers, is now forcing applicants who have been living and working legally in the country for years to restart their cases. Immigration lawyers express concern that this policy strips protections from those following the rules and could lead to their detention and deportation.</p>

          <p>The UK is anticipating its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures forecast to climb above 30C and potentially peak at 34C in the south Midlands. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England from Monday to Wednesday. This significant shift in weather follows Storm Floris and is caused by warm air moving up from the south. While England and Wales will experience the most sunshine, scattered thunderstorms are also possible.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant rise in tourism from Turkey, with visitors drawn by the island's affordability and relaxed atmosphere compared to Turkish holiday destinations. This influx is providing a welcome economic boost to local businesses like restaurants and strengthening cross-border relations through new ferry connections. Despite ongoing political tensions between Athens and Ankara over maritime borders, the people-to-people connections fostered by tourism offer a sign of goodwill and potential for improved bilateral ties.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a new set of genome editing technologies, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), that can precisely edit large DNA fragments. This breakthrough makes a previously complex gene-editing tool more efficient and easier to use, potentially revolutionizing crop improvement and the treatment of genetic diseases. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this advancement could also accelerate the development of artificial chromosomes and open new avenues in the field of synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned U.S.-Russia summit, key European leaders have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace negotiations must include Ukraine. This united front comes after US President Donald Trump suggested he might broker a deal involving territorial swaps, a proposal Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky firmly rejected. European allies are concerned about being excluded from decisions affecting their security and have reiterated their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and the principle that international borders cannot be changed by force.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that a transformative "ChatGPT moment" for robotics could occur within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new environment. While hardware capabilities are advancing, Wang believes the crucial missing piece is more sophisticated AI for "embodied intelligence," suggesting current models are not yet sufficient for this leap in general-purpose robotics.</p>

          <p>Investigators solved the murder of Alexandra Pennig, a 32-year-old nurse found shot in her apartment, by focusing on a small piece of evidence that contradicted the suspect's story. Matthew Ecker, who was with Pennig, claimed she had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide. However, detectives found a metal ring from the door lock underneath Pennig's body, proving the door was forced open *before* she was shot.
