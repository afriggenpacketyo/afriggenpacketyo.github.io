          <p>Donald Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the United States, citing concerns about the American film industry's decline and foreign incentives attracting filmmakers. Trump argues that these incentives pose a national security threat, viewing foreign-made films as messaging and propaganda. The UK media union Bectu warned that the tariffs could devastate the industry as it recovers from the pandemic. Several major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas, potentially including capturing and holding Gaza territory, which has drawn criticism from the UN and aid agencies citing humanitarian principles. The military has called up tens of thousands of reservists to increase pressure on Hamas, aiming to secure the release of remaining hostages and defeat the organization. The plan reportedly involves seizing additional areas of Gaza and expanding the buffer zone along the borders with Israel and Egypt. Critics argue this strategy has not been effective in freeing hostages, while the Hostages and Missing Families Forum accuses the government of prioritizing territory over the hostages' well-being.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite pressure from President Trump. In his acceptance speech, Pence repeatedly invoked the Constitution as the common ground binding Americans together, emphasizing the need to find common ground in divided times. Pence acknowledged differences with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, were recognized as a principled stand against efforts to overturn the election results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, acting as a workout that reshapes neural pathways. Neuroscientists have found that multilingual individuals process information differently due to the rewiring of brain circuits involved in language processing. Studies show that learning a language increases gray matter structure in areas related to language processing and executive function. While multilingualism may improve cognitive skills like memory and problem-solving, it's unclear if this directly translates to higher intelligence.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Jack Goldsmith argues that the presidency has become too powerful, with Donald Trump's actions building on excesses of previous administrations. Goldsmith notes that Trump's use of emergency powers and claims of national security authority echo those of Richard Nixon and George W. Bush. He suggests reforms are needed to limit presidential power, including potential constitutional amendments to narrow the pardon power and confine Justice Department politicization. Goldsmith emphasizes the importance of electing a leader who embraces checks and balances and moderates presidential power.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed a widely effective antivenom using blood from Tim Friede, a man intentionally bitten by numerous deadly snakes over 18 years to self-immunize. Researchers isolated antibodies from Friede's blood that reacted with neurotoxins from 19 of the world's deadliest snakes. The new antivenom, tested in mouse trials, proved protective against venom from black mambas, king cobras, and other dangerous snakes. Friede's unique immune history offers hope for a broad-spectrum antivenom that could be administered in rural settings or by hikers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated the office at the National Institutes of Health responsible for leading the 'Safe to Sleep' campaign, a public awareness initiative credited with significantly reducing sleep-related infant deaths. The decision comes at a time when such deaths have been increasing, raising concerns among pediatricians and non-profit organizations. The campaign provided crucial safe sleep recommendations to parents, including placing babies on their backs on firm mattresses in their own space. While the NIH states that campaign materials remain available online, the termination of the office raises concerns about the future of outreach and education efforts.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere soon after orbiting the planet for over five decades. The probe, originally intended for Venus, malfunctioned and remained in low Earth orbit. Experts believe that the lander, designed to withstand Venus' atmosphere, may survive reentry without burning up completely. While the exact impact location is uncertain, it is estimated to be somewhere across a large area stretching from Canada and Russia to the southern tip of South America.</p>

He described Sheinbaum as a "lovely woman" but believes she is afraid of the cartels, hindering her ability to address the issue effectively. The relationships with both neighboring countries have been strained over trade and immigration.</p>

Simion's victory is causing concern in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, as Romania is a key transit route for weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania, adding further uncertainty to the political landscape. A potential Simion victory could significantly alter Romania's foreign policy and its relationship with key international partners.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house Americaâ€™s most ruthless and violent offenders. Trump claims this move is necessary to address the problem of repeat criminal offenders who contribute nothing but misery to society. The directive faces practical challenges, including the high costs of rebuilding and maintaining the island facility, which has been closed for over 60 years. Nancy Pelosi questioned the feasibility of the proposal, noting that the island is now a popular national park and tourist attraction.</p>
