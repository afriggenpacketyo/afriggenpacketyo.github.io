          <p>Germany's socialist Left Party is experiencing a surge in popularity, defying earlier predictions of failing to meet the threshold for Bundestag representation. Recent polls show the party's support nearly doubling, especially among young voters attracted to their focus on affordable housing. The party aims to leverage this momentum with a strategic plan emphasizing peace and diplomatic solutions, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Despite past internal conflicts, the Left Party has nearly doubled its membership and seeks to influence policy by engaging in negotiations with other parties, signaling a renewed sense of self-confidence on the political stage.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin hosted Russia's Victory Day parade in Red Square, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, amidst tight security following Ukrainian strikes. The event included a military parade and addresses from Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with several international leaders in attendance. Putin used the occasion to reinforce the narrative of Russia's righteousness and unity in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which he refers to as a 'special military operation.' A unilateral ceasefire declared by Russia was rejected by Ukraine, who views it as a theatrical performance.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin commemorated Victory Day with a large military parade in Moscow, joined by Chinese leader Xi Jinping and other international dignitaries. The event was intended to project Russia's image as a leader of an emerging alliance against Western influence, despite ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, the display of military strength contrasts with Russia's lack of decisive victory in the war and economic challenges due to falling oil prices and high interest rates. Putin has used the historical triumph over Nazi Germany to legitimize the invasion of Ukraine, but this moment has become a source of division rather than unity.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports experienced a notable surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which helped offset a sharp decline in trade with the United States due to tariffs. The data highlights a shift in global trade flows, with Chinese exports to ASEAN countries jumping significantly while shipments to the U.S. plummeted. Despite the overall export increase, economists caution about potential unemployment spikes if factory orders continue to decline. The Chinese government is signaling readiness to boost domestic demand to mitigate the impact of the trade war, cutting interest rates and encouraging spending.</p>

          <p>Despite tariffs imposed on imported aluminum by the U.S. President, the domestic aluminum sector is failing to revive due to high electricity costs. The tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, but have not led to increased domestic production. Rising electricity prices in the U.S. are causing smelter closures, as U.S. smelters struggle to compete with those in Canada, Norway, and the Middle East that have access to competitively priced, long-term power contracts. The artificial intelligence boom and data centers are also increasing demand for electricity, further impacting the aluminum industry.</p>

          <p>Household brands such as Pandora, Puma, and Hugo Boss are reassessing their pricing strategies in the U.S. due to potential tariffs imposed by President Trump. Some retailers are also adjusting their supply chains and revising sales forecasts amid uncertainty in U.S. trade policy. The potential tariffs are expected to lead to industry-wide price hikes, as many brands rely on manufacturing in Asia. The uncertainty around tariffs, recession risks, and immigration policy are also dampening consumer spending in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The United States has shown renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, driven by strategic and geopolitical considerations. Greenland's location is critical due to its proximity to both Russia and Europe, and the opening of the Arctic Sea has increased Russia's access to open waters. The interplay of climate and geopolitical considerations makes a revival of U.S. strategic interest and involvement in Greenland unsurprising. The author suggests the U.S. should consider a "Compact of Free Association" agreement with Greenland and Denmark, similar to those in place with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.</p>
