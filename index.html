          <p>A report issued by Senator Elizabeth Warren's office accuses Elon Musk of leveraging his position as a "special government employee" overseeing DOGE to enrich himself and his businesses. The report details over 100 instances where Musk allegedly abused his role, raising concerns about corruption, ethics, and conflicts of interest. It claims that Musk violated norms at an "astonishing pace" during his four months leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a period marked by significant upheaval in the federal workforce. The White House and representatives for Musk have not yet responded to requests for comment. The gravity of these accusations casts a shadow on Musk's legacy in public service.</p>

          <p>An 88-year-old woman in the Czech Republic, declared dead by a coroner after being found unresponsive, was discovered to be alive while being placed in a coffin. Morticians made the startling discovery, prompting emergency services to transport her to a hospital. This rare medical occurrence is known as the Lazarus Effect, where a person shows signs of life after being clinically pronounced dead, often following CPR. According to the Cleveland Clinic, this phenomenon typically occurs after a cardiac arrest and CPR administration, with 74 confirmed cases in the U.S. between 1982 and 2022. The fact that she was found alive is a great blessing and there is hope that she will fully recover.</p>

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official resigned from her role overseeing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations following an order from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to force an update to the agency's guidance. Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos cited her inability to continue helping the most vulnerable members of the population as the reason for her departure. Kennedy's directive broke with the committee by ordering the agency to exclude pregnant women from its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, a decision that concerned experts due to the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in pregnant women. The resignation highlights the tensions surrounding the politicization of public health decisions.</p>

          <p>Aylo, the parent company of Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn, has blocked access to its sites in France to protest new regulations requiring age verification for users. The French government is mandating that explicit sites verify users are 18 or older using methods like credit cards or government-issued IDs, with a double anonymity system to protect user identities. Aylo argues that age verification should be done on devices rather than websites, citing privacy concerns and ineffectiveness. France's digital regulator reports that 2.3 million minors in the country access adult content platforms monthly, representing 12% of the total porn users. The move underscores the ongoing debate about balancing online safety and privacy.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" and accusing it of burdening American citizens with unsustainable debt. Musk's comments reflect wider tensions within the Republican Party over the bill, which includes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and increased defense spending. The bill has been estimated to increase the budget deficit by about $600 billion in the next fiscal year. Musk, who recently concluded his service in the Trump administration, had previously vowed to fund campaign challenges against any Republican opposing Trump's agenda. The bill also pledges to extend tax cuts passed during Trump's first administration, as well as an influx of funds for defense spending and to fund the administration's mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded a Biden-era policy that required hospitals to provide emergency abortions, reigniting the debate over access to reproductive healthcare.

This move is likely to face legal challenges from advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers who argue that it endangers women's health. The decision underscores the ongoing political and legal battles surrounding abortion rights in the United States. The decision has caused many people to feel unsafe.</p>

Trump indicated that the US might increase tariffs on the UK on or after July 9, 2025, if the UK does not comply with relevant aspects of the EPD.

          <p>Over 100 prominent British athletes, including Sir Mo Farah and Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, have urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer to support London's bid to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships. The proposal involves holding the event at London Stadium, requiring a one-off public funding injection in 2028, with a projected Â£400 million national economic impact. Athletes emphasize the inspirational effect of hosting the championships on British soil, particularly for the next generation of athletes. London previously hosted the event in 2017. The support from such a great group of athletes is encouraging.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that President Trump's actions, particularly tariffs and a jingoistic approach, distort market valuations and prompt investors to make misguided moves. He claims that short sellers are emboldened by Trump's unpredictable statements, leading to market volatility. Cramer suggests Wall Street is overly skeptical about the need for artificial intelligence infrastructure, despite evidence to the contrary. He asserts that Trump has "almost singlehandedly revived the short selling business." Cramer believes that the market's mistakes stem from the president's influence on investor sentiment.

          <p>President Trump has reportedly expressed private frustration with his Supreme Court appointees, particularly Justice Amy Coney Barrett, feeling they could do more to support his agenda. Sources indicate that Trump allies have labeled Barrett as "weak," leading the president to seek future nominees in the mold of Justices Alito, Thomas, and Scalia. While Trump has not publicly attacked Barrett, he recently criticized Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo, who advised him on judicial nominations. The administration maintains that Trump will always stand with the Supreme Court, despite disagreements with some rulings. The situation is causing unrest.</p>

Hegseth's absence, coupled with no new military aid announcements and warnings against Ukraine's NATO bid, signals a shift in U.S. policy towards the conflict. France and other NATO nations are concerned that the U.S. is prioritizing a potential conflict with China at the expense of supporting Ukraine.

Morales-Reyes' lawyer asserts he is a victim of a crime and has applied for a U visa. The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged the ongoing investigation.
