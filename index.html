          <p>NHS data in England reveals a more than threefold increase in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms among 16-24 year olds over the past decade, making it the second most prevalent mental health disorder for young adults. Charities attribute this "OCD crisis" to societal pressures, social media, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Many young people struggle to access timely NHS treatment, with national specialist waiting times reaching 41 weeks. This article highlights the devastating impact on lives, with some families resorting to expensive private care, underscoring an urgent need for increased government investment in services.</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated all trade negotiations with Canada, accusing Ontario's government of using a "fake" Ronald Reagan ad about tariffs to influence U.S. court decisions. The Reagan Foundation confirmed the ad misrepresented Reagan's 1987 address, used without permission. This abrupt decision further escalates trade tensions, impacting the review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Ontario's Premier had launched a significant campaign against U.S. tariffs, which Trump cited as "egregious behavior." This move signals continued instability in bilateral trade relations.</p>

          <p>The UK's inquiry into grooming sexual assault cases is in disarray, struggling to find a suitable chair after experienced candidates, including one who worked during The Troubles, have ruled themselves out. Government sources acknowledge the immense difficulty of finding a universally accepted leader for this sensitive investigation. Further complicating matters, victims are deeply divided over whether Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips should remain in her role, with some demanding her replacement while others insist on her retention. This ongoing turmoil highlights the profound challenge of building trust and consensus among those repeatedly failed by state agencies over many years.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Attorney for Maryland reportedly informed the Department of Justice that there is insufficient evidence to charge Senator Adam Schiff with mortgage fraud, despite President Trump's public calls for his indictment. MSNBC, citing anonymous sources, reported that prosecutor Kelly Hayes conveyed this assessment to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. However, Blanche publicly denied the meeting and the reported assessment. Schiff's lawyer described the investigation as a "politically-motivated" and "baseless" effort to intimidate a critic. The investigation's continuation remains uncertain amid these conflicting reports, raising questions about political influence in legal processes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has finalized plans to open the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, fulfilling a key campaign promise. This decision, announced by U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, paves the way for future lease sales in the 1.5 million-acre area, which is considered sacred by the Indigenous Gwich'in. The plan also restores previously canceled oil and gas leases and advances a land exchange deal for a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

          <p>Germany's efforts to tighten laws against small-boat migrant smugglers, making it explicitly illegal to facilitate passage to a third country like the UK, may face delays beyond the promised end-of-2025 timeline. While the Interior Ministry intends to introduce the bill, it cannot guarantee parliamentary approval this year, causing uncertainty in the UK. The current loophole means facilitating smuggling to the UK is not explicitly illegal in Germany, which has been used as a hub for dinghy storage. Any postponement could frustrate the UK Labour government, which emphasizes international collaboration to tackle illegal crossings and prevent human trafficking.</p>

          <p>"No Kings" rallies, protesting President Trump's perceived authoritarian tendencies, have seen participants don inflatable animal costumes, including frogs, lobsters, and unicorns. This tactic, inspired by a Portland protest, aims to counter the Republican narrative of protesters as "hate-filled radicals" by employing humor and absurdity. Participants believe the costumes make protests less threatening and highlight the farcical nature of government force against such displays. Experts suggest this absurdist humor is an effective strategy against autocrats, as any government response risks making them appear worse.
