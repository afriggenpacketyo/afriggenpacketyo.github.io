          <p>Michael Bolton's daughters revealed that the Grammy-winning singer experienced unusual symptoms, such as confusion and balance issues, before his glioblastoma diagnosis in December 2023. These symptoms, initially attributed to stress and fatigue, included bowling out of turn and falling from a chair. An MRI later revealed a brain tumor, leading to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, is known for its rapid development and resistance to treatment, though ongoing clinical trials offer hope for advancements. The article emphasizes the importance of seeking medical attention for unexplained behavioral or motor control changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychiatrist, Dr. Awais Aftab, argues that while antidepressants are transformative for some, a less advertised side includes sexual side effects, manic episodes, suicidal thoughts, and severe withdrawal symptoms. He notes the medical community's alarm at comparisons to heroin, yet many patients feel validated by such concerns due to their experiences with withdrawal. Given the long-term use of antidepressants, Dr. Aftab stresses the need for more research into their long-term effects and safe tapering strategies, highlighting the current lack of high-quality trials and official guidelines. The article calls for scientific transparency and engagement with patients' concerns to maintain credibility in psychiatric care.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese of Australia secured a second term as Prime Minister, overcoming months of trailing in the polls due to a cost-of-living crisis. His victory represents a defeat for the conservative opposition and a rejection of Trump-like messaging and policies. Voters cited cost-of-living concerns and a desire for a leader who could navigate global challenges in an Australian way. The election results also indicate a shift away from the two major parties, with increased support for minor parties.</p>

          <p>Slow TV, characterized by unnarrated, real-time coverage of long events, is gaining popularity, particularly nature live streams. These streams, such as the Great Elk Trek in Sweden, offer viewers calmness and relaxation, contrasting with the fast pace of modern media. The broadcasts also serve as educational tools, fostering a deeper connection with nature and inspiring climate-conscious behavior. Researchers suggest that these virtual experiences can promote conservationist attitudes and provide benefits similar to being physically present in nature.</p>
