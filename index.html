          <p>A massive Russian strike on Kyiv resulted in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries, marking the deadliest assault on the capital since last July, as peace talks appear to have stalled. President Zelenskyy cut short his trip to South Africa to return home, branding the strike as "one of (Russia's) most outrageous." The attack involved a barrage of missiles and drones targeting residential areas and infrastructure. The EU's foreign policy chief condemned the attack, underscoring that Russia is the main obstacle to ending the war, while Zelenskyy noted that negotiations depend on Russia's intention.</p>

          <p>Residents of St. Louis are grappling with a legacy of nuclear waste contamination in Coldwater Creek, leading to a cluster of cancer cases. Starting in 1942, uranium production for the Manhattan Project resulted in waste being dumped around the city, contaminating the creek. A 2019 study indicated increased risks of lung, bone cancer, and leukemia for those living near the creek from the 1960s to 1990s. Residents are calling for a closer examination of the issue and accountability for the contamination.</p>

Economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa is expected to meet with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to push for tariff exemptions or revisions, with additional steps possible depending on negotiation outcomes.</p>

          <p>Warnings of potential retail shortages are surfacing as the trade war impacts supply chains, with apparel and footwear being key consumer areas to watch. Imports from China account for a significant portion of U.S. apparel and footwear, and high tariff rates are acting as import bans. Companies are expecting price increases and consumer wariness, with declining Chinese freight ship visits to the U.S. signaling disruptions. The risk of retail shortages depends on the duration of high tariff levels and the extent to which companies frontloaded inventory.</p>

A formal “Crimea Declaration” had pledged the nonrecognition policy would remain “until Ukraine’s territorial integrity is restored.” Now, he is prepared to walk away from that declaration.</p>
