          <p>Former President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis was made after doctors discovered a nodule during an evaluation for urinary symptoms. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians, with the expectation that hormone-sensitive treatments may prove effective. The news has elicited reactions from both sides of the political spectrum, including well wishes from former President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have announced a comprehensive deal aimed at resetting relations after Britain's departure from the bloc. The agreement covers areas such as security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, with British officials hailing it as a 'historic day' and a 'new chapter' in their relationship. Key provisions include easing import and export processes for food and drink, establishing a new 'Security and Defence Partnership,' extending fishing rights for EU trawlers, and simplifying travel for British holidaymakers and their pets. Both sides will also explore a 'youth experience scheme' to facilitate work and travel for young people across the continent.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce new regulations for the 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) sector, aiming to protect shoppers from potential debt traps. The proposals will require BNPL firms, such as Klarna and Afterpay, to conduct upfront checks to ensure consumers can repay what they borrow and to provide easier access to refunds. Consumers will also have the ability to escalate complaints to the Financial Ombudsman, a service that resolves disputes between consumers and financial services firms. These rules are designed to bring a sense of order to what City Minister Emma Reynolds described as a 'wild west' in the BNPL space.</p>

          <p>Diageo, the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker, anticipates US trade tariffs will cost the company approximately $150 million annually. This follows President Trump's implementation of a 10% tariff on UK and European imports into the US. To mitigate the impact, Diageo is launching a $500 million cost-saving program aimed at supporting further investment and improving its financial leverage. The company reported a 2.9% increase in net sales for the recent quarter, driven by strong Guinness sales, but noted a dip in European sales due to 'softness' in spirits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. According to analysts at Cornwall Insight, a typical household's annual energy bill will decrease by Â£129, a nearly 7% reduction. This would bring the average annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to Â£1,720, down from the current Â£1,849. While this decrease is a welcome development, experts caution that prices remain significantly higher than pre-decade levels, raising concerns about affordability for many households.</p>

In Poland, Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, secured a spot in a runoff against a nationalist historian, Karol Nawrocki, though the margin of victory was narrow.

          <p>Despite efforts to refine polling methods, the accuracy of polls remains a concern, as evidenced by the 2024 elections where polls underestimated Donald Trump's support by a similar margin as in 2016. The article explores the challenges of nonresponse bias, where those who participate in polls differ from those who do not, particularly in their trust of institutions and engagement in politics. It highlights the limitations of weighting samples based on demographic characteristics and partisanship, and discusses the difficulties in accounting for the biases of pollsters themselves. The piece concludes that while polls can still be valuable, their reliability is limited, especially in close elections.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis in its schools, forcing temporary closures and rigorous inspections. The city's health officials initially collaborated with the CDC, but federal support was withdrawn due to restructuring within the US Department of Health and Human Services. This has left Milwaukee to navigate the crisis independently, inspecting schools and providing free blood testing. The city is also working to replace lead water service lines, but lacks the necessary funding to complete the project. The situation highlights the challenges cities face when federal assistance is reduced during public health emergencies.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an "aggressive form" of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office said in a statement. According to the statement, Biden was diagnosed with "prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone." The statement noted that while this is a "more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management." Mr. Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he and first lady Melania Trump are "saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pulling back Medicaid funding for social services like housing and nutrition, reversing a policy that allowed states to use Medicaid money for non-traditional healthcare needs. This decision impacts states that expanded their Medicaid programs to address social determinants of health, such as homelessness and food insecurity, arguing it distracts from the core mission of healthcare. Critics warn that this disinvestment will lead to more suffering and higher healthcare costs, while the administration proposes cutting funding for low-income housing and food programs, exacerbating the problem.</p>
