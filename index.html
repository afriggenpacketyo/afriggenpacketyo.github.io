        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights indicates Germany has seen the bloc's largest increase in anti-Black racial discrimination, a trend activists fear could worsen with the rise of anti-immigration political rhetoric. Economically, immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa face significant disadvantages, including an unemployment rate more than triple that of German citizens and a substantial pay gap. Rights organizations are calling for more comprehensive data collection and national action plans to understand and combat the systemic issues contributing to both hiring discrimination and social exclusion for Black people in the country, drawing parallels to successful initiatives in Luxembourg.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has proposed new measures that would halve the tariff-free quota for imported steel and impose a 50% tariff on any excess. This move is seen as a response to pressure from member states struggling with cheap imports and protectionist actions taken by the US. The UK steel industry, which relies heavily on the EU as its most important export market for nearly £3 billion in annual trade, has described the situation as potentially its "biggest crisis." Industry leaders are now urgently calling on the UK government to leverage its trading relationship to negotiate a specific country quota to avert disaster for the already struggling sector.

          <p>Around 900 hikers, guides, and staff have been brought to safety after a weekend blizzard stranded them in a high-altitude valley on the Chinese side of Mount Everest. The storm, which struck at over 16,000 feet, cut off access and trapped the large group during a popular weeklong national holiday. Rescue teams provided food, medicine, and oxygen to some individuals suffering from hypothermia, successfully evacuating everyone from the Karma valley after trails were broken through the heavy snow. The scenic area has been temporarily closed to ensure safety, and local authorities are organizing the return journeys for all rescued individuals.</p>

          <p>Freida Parton has reassured fans after her earlier request for prayers for her sister, country music legend Dolly Parton, caused widespread concern about the singer's health. She clarified in a subsequent social media post that she "didn't mean to scare anyone," explaining that Dolly had been feeling only "a little under the weather" and the call for prayers was simply a sisterly gesture of support. This follows Dolly Parton's recent postponement of a Las Vegas residency due to unspecified "health challenges" that she stated would require her to undergo a few medical procedures, forcing her to delay the shows until next year.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is leading the largest-ever British trade mission to India to build upon the free trade agreement signed between the two nations in July. The deal aims to significantly boost bilateral trade by reducing tariffs on a range of goods, including textiles from India and cars and whisky from the UK, with a goal of increasing trade by over £25 billion by 2040. During his visit, Starmer emphasized the "huge opportunities" the pact provides for businesses and urged his team to implement it as quickly as possible, setting the stage for further economic collaboration between the two countries.

          <p>An attack by Myanmar's military has resulted in at least 24 deaths and 47 injuries after a motorized paraglider dropped two bombs on a crowd gathered for a national holiday protest. The incident occurred in the Sagaing region, a key battleground where resistance forces oppose the ruling junta. This attack highlights the military's escalating and brutal tactics, including the increased use of paramotors for airstrikes, as the country's civil war continues to displace millions and cause widespread casualties. Amnesty International has called the trend "disturbing" and urged regional leaders to increase pressure on the junta.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The resignation of France's fifth Prime Minister in under two years has intensified concerns about the country's fiscal stability, as political deadlock prevents necessary economic reforms. With a budget deficit at 5.8% of GDP and a national debt of 113%, France is significantly non-compliant with EU rules, placing it under the bloc's "excessive deficit procedure." Economists warn that without a stable government capable of passing a budget, little progress can be made on fiscal consolidation. This ongoing turmoil threatens to trigger further credit rating downgrades from agencies like Moody's and could lead to increased market instability across the eurozone. (not investment advice)</p>

The prosecutor's rare public explanation revealed that despite months of requests, witness statements from the government did not meet the required standard to proceed to trial, leading to the charges being dropped just before the trial was set to begin.</p>

          <p>The price of spot gold has surpassed $4,000 an ounce for the first time, driven by strong investor demand for safe-haven assets during a period of significant global instability. This major rally is fueled by concerns over economic and political turmoil, including the ongoing US government shutdown and international trade tensions that have persisted since April. Analysts attribute the surge to investors seeking to protect their capital, with a record $64 billion invested in gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) so far this year. This trend reflects a broader flight to safety as confidence in other assets wanes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Everton's Jordan Pickford has solidified his role as England's top goalkeeper, silencing past criticism with consistent and crucial performances at major tournaments. Former players and analysts note that while he has technical idiosyncrasies, his elite shot-stopping ability, long-range distribution, and improved maturity have made him indispensable to the national team. With over 78 caps and a remarkable record of making only one error leading to a goal for England since his 2017 debut, the debate over the number one spot is considered settled, providing critical stability for the team ahead of upcoming competitions.</p>

          <p>Nearly 4,000 people have filed the UK's largest-ever environmental pollution lawsuit at the High Court, targeting major poultry producers and a water company for their alleged roles in contaminating key waterways. The claimants argue that pollution from chicken manure and sewage has severely damaged the Wye, Lugg, and Usk rivers, impacting local businesses, property values, and recreational activities. The lawsuit seeks substantial damages and a court order for the firms to clean up the rivers, which are protected habitats for rare wildlife like otters and Atlantic salmon, marking a significant community-led push for corporate accountability.</p>

          <p>A misconduct hearing has detailed the contents of a WhatsApp group involving six Cambridgeshire police officers, which contained jokes about murder victims, including George Floyd, and rampant discriminatory comments. The messages, exchanged over two years, were described as a "grotesque carnival of discrimination and abuse," also featuring racist, misogynistic, and ableist content alongside the sharing of police data. Five of the officers resigned before their hearings, while a sixth, an inspector, was dismissed, with the panel concluding all would have been fired had they still been serving in the force.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is facing a highly fragmented and polarized European Parliament, marked by two no-confidence votes in just three months initiated by both far-right and far-left groups. While she is expected to survive the votes, the challenges highlight a fragile trust and a breakdown in cooperation between the parliament's traditional centrist powers, which no longer hold a stable majority. Critics point to her centralized leadership style and controversial policies on climate, migration, and foreign affairs as sources of the growing discontent and political instability at the heart of the EU.</p>

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is exacerbating a critical shortage of air traffic controllers, leading to significant flight delays and cancellations across the country. Controllers are designated as essential workers and are therefore forced to work without pay, and an increase in sick calls has left towers in cities like Nashville, Dallas, and Chicago dangerously understaffed. The union representing controllers states that while staffing has long been an issue, the shutdown is highlighting the fragility of the national airspace system. This situation places employees under immense financial and professional stress, raising serious safety concerns for the aviation industry.</p>

          <p>The government of Chad has terminated its partnership with African Parks, a prominent conservation charity where the Duke of Sussex serves on the board of directors. The Chadian environment ministry accused the organization of failing to curb poaching, lacking investment, and showing a disrespectful and arrogant attitude towards government authorities during its 15-year mandate to manage two protected wildlife reserves. This move adds to the controversies facing the charity, which recently admitted to abuses by its employees in a park it managed in the Republic of Congo, raising questions about its operational practices.</p>

          <p>A multi-story building undergoing renovation in Madrid partially collapsed, resulting in the deaths of four construction workers and injuring at least three others. Emergency services recovered the bodies of the victims, identified as workers from Mali, Guinea, and Ecuador, from the rubble after a complex search operation. The building was being converted into a four-star hotel when several ceiling structures gave way, leading to what is being investigated as a fatal workplace accident. Witnesses described hearing a loud bang that sounded "like a bomb" at the time of the collapse.</p>

          <p>Researchers have successfully used enzymes to convert the blood type of a human kidney from Type A to the universal Type O, a breakthrough that could significantly expand the organ donor pool and reduce wait times. After the conversion, the kidney was transplanted into a brain-dead recipient and functioned for two days without signs of hyperacute rejection, the immediate and aggressive response that typically occurs with incompatible blood types. This innovative technique offers hope for addressing the critical shortage of donated organs and overcoming challenges related to the equality of organ allocation by making more organs universally compatible for transplantation.</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived at a military facility near Chicago as part of a controversial federal deployment to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and facilities. The move, ordered by the Trump administration, has been met with strong opposition from Illinois state and local leaders, who have filed a lawsuit to block it, calling it an "aggressive overreach." This deployment is considered highly unusual, as it involves federalizing one state's National Guard and sending it to another, creating a tense political and legal standoff over federal authority and states' rights.</p>
