          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump spent the second day of his visit to Scotland playing golf at his Turnberry resort. His trip also includes significant diplomatic engagements, with meetings scheduled to discuss transatlantic trade with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. He is also set to meet with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Scotland's First Minister John Swinney to discuss trade and international issues before officially opening a new golf course.</p>

          <p>Reporting from across the United States reveals a divided response among President Trump's supporters regarding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. While some influential conservative voices have been critical, many voters in places like Pennsylvania remain unfazed, prioritizing issues like the economy and border security. These supporters often dismiss the controversy as a politically motivated distraction or a media-driven double standard, showcasing a resilient base of support despite the ongoing pressure on Republican lawmakers.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: To Avoid Enabling a Fascist Future, Science Must Acknowledge Its Political Nature</h2>

          <p>This essay argues that the scientific community must confront the reality that science is inherently political and has historically been entangled with systems of oppression like racism and eugenics. The authors assert that denying this entanglement leaves science vulnerable to bad-faith political attacks and allows it to unknowingly perpetuate harm against marginalized groups. They advocate for scientists to integrate political analysis into their work, which they believe will lead to a more rigorous, resilient, and just scientific practice.</p>

          <p>China has announced the discovery of a super-large zirconium deposit, a crucial material for developing hypersonic technology, which could significantly bolster its strategic reserves. The deposit, the first of its kind found in a non-marine basin in the country, is estimated to contain 2 million tonnes of zirconium dioxide. This amount is four times China's current total reserve, potentially eliminating a key vulnerability in its supply chain for advanced aerospace and defense manufacturing.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the nickname "Alligator Alcatraz," used in reference to a Florida migrant detention facility, is a modern manifestation of a deeply racist historical trope. The author draws a direct line from this term to the post-Civil War "alligator bait" slur, which dehumanized Black babies and was widely circulated on memorabilia. The article contends that, like its historical predecessor, the nickname uses morbid humor to dehumanize a vulnerable group and manufacture public consent for their suffering.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece presents two opposing viewpoints on whether California should counteract a Republican-led redrawing of Texas's congressional map by gerrymandering its own districts. One argument posits that it is a necessary, defensive measure to protect democracy from authoritarian tactics and offset partisan power grabs. The counterargument warns that such a move would betray the will of California voters who chose independent commissions and could set a dangerous precedent, ultimately causing more harm to democratic norms.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a daily "tactical pause" in its operations in three areas of Gaza to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid. This move, coordinated with the UN and other international groups, will establish secure corridors for aid convoys to distribute food and medicine amid a worsening malnutrition crisis. The announcement follows weeks of international pressure and failed attempts by activist groups to breach the blockade by sea, representing a shift in procedure.</p>

          <p>The ongoing war in Ukraine is receiving less global attention as other crises, such as the conflict in Gaza and U.S.-led trade wars, dominate the international agenda. The article highlights President Trump's 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal or face severe sanctions, a threat analysts doubt will influence Moscow. Meanwhile, Ukraine faces growing internal political challenges and a sense that international support is becoming more transactional, dimming prospects for a resolution.</p>

          <p>A recent government report indicates that student suicides have reached an alarming level in India, accounting for 7.6% of the country's total suicides with an estimated 13,000 such deaths annually. Experts attribute the crisis to a combination of extreme academic pressure, inadequate mental health support within educational institutions, and a societal focus on narrow definitions of success. In response, there are growing calls for integrated mental health education, gatekeeper training for faculty, and systemic reforms to reduce this tragic trend.</p>

          <p>A mother in Apple Valley, California, has experienced a remarkable coincidence by giving birth to all four of her children on the same calendar day, July 7th, across different years. Nauzhae Drake's four children were born on July 7 in 2019, 2021, 2022, and most recently, 2025. None of the births were induced, and a mathematics professor noted the odds of such an event are incredibly low, making it a heartwarming and statistically improbable family story.</p>

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old woman from rural China, has become an unlikely stand-up comedy star with routines about her abusive ex-husband and patriarchal social norms. Her viral performances have resonated deeply with audiences but have also drawn a veiled warning from provincial officials, who claimed such jokes "provoke gender conflict." The official reaction highlights the sensitivity of women's rights and feminist themes in China, where the government is actively promoting more traditional gender roles.</p>

          <p>Four people have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children aged 7 to 16. Authorities allege the adopted children in the home were treated unfairly, kept in plywood cages under bunk beds, and subjected to punishments like being sprayed with vinegar. The investigation was initiated after a legally mandated reporter from the family's local church raised concerns about potential abuse and neglect. All children have been removed from the home.</p>
