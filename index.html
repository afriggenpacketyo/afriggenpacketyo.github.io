            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as the new vice minister of commerce, replacing Wang Shouwen, to lead international trade negotiations amid escalating trade tensions with the U.S. Li's extensive experience in trade issues and his previous role as China's ambassador to the WTO are expected to bring a fresh perspective to the ongoing disputes. This move comes as both countries have been increasing tariffs, raising concerns about the potential damage to the global economy. The appointment is seen as a strategic effort by Beijing to de-escalate tensions and potentially find a breakthrough in trade negotiations with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Hong Kong's post office will suspend shipping non-airmail parcels to the United States in response to Washington's decision to impose a 120% tariff on small-value parcels from the city starting May 2. The U.S. government is ending a customs exception that allowed shipments worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. tax-free. The Hong Kong government criticized the U.S.'s "unreasonable and bullying acts" and stated that Hongkong Post will not collect tariffs on behalf of Washington. This decision highlights Hong Kong's position caught in the middle of trade disputes between the U.S. and China.</p>

This news comes amid concerns about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans on the semiconductor supply chain.

            <p>In Oakland's special mayoral election, former City Councilmember Loren Taylor took a slight lead against former Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee in early results, though the race remains too close to call. The election was triggered by the recall of Mayor Sheng Thao due to frustrations over crime, homelessness, and financial mismanagement. Oakland uses ranked-choice voting, which means final results could take several days to tally. Taylor's campaign focused on his experience in City Hall and appealing to voters seeking a change, while Lee emphasized her decades of experience and commitment to unity.</p>

            <p>A new report warns that the growing demand for data centers, driven by artificial intelligence, could lead to higher utility bills for consumers in the U.S. due to special contracts and overbuilt infrastructure.

Experts suggest tightening oversight of special contracts and implementing zonal pricing to ensure data centers pay for their energy usage.

            <p>Conservationists are warning that the UK's rarest wildlife is being pushed closer to extinction due to intense grass fires, exacerbated by a record dry spell and high temperatures. Endangered species like hen harriers and water voles are particularly vulnerable, with significant habitat loss reported across the country. Wildfires have increased dramatically in Wales, with fire crews battling almost 1,400 blazes this year. Conservation groups are calling for increased funding to restore peat bogs and better monitoring of controlled burns to protect vulnerable ecosystems.</p>

Google required manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome, and exclude rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model.

            <p>Premier Li Qiang has called for stronger efforts to boost domestic demand and diversify export markets in China, aiming to mitigate external risks amid rising trade tensions with the U.S. He emphasized the need to strengthen the domestic economic cycle and unleash the potential of China's massive market. Li also pledged greater support for the property sector, and vowed to boost employment, incomes, and social welfare. This shift reflects China's strategy to hedge against external shocks by focusing on internal economic growth.</p>

            <p>A new Texas bill, Senate Bill 6, could delay or derail President Trump’s AI initiative, “Stargate”, which aims to build 20 ultra-powerful data centers across the country, with Texas chosen as ground zero for the first 10 centers. The legislation adds a six-month regulatory review on top of an existing 6–18-month timeline, while also requiring new fees and mandatory backup generators, doubling approval time and inflating costs. Allies warn it could torpedo a generational opportunity. Critics say it’s a misguided effort rooted in fear of energy scarcity, fear of AI, fear of the future.</p>
