        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), in collaboration with allies like the US, Germany, and France, has revealed a Russian cyber campaign targeting organizations providing foreign assistance to Ukraine since 2022. This campaign, attributed to GRU Unit 26165 (Fancy Bear), involves hacking techniques to access networks of public and private entities involved in supplying defense, IT services, and logistics support. Notably, internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian borders were compromised to monitor aid shipments, and legitimate municipal services like traffic cams were also exploited. The NCSC urges organizations to review the advisory for mitigation advice to defend their networks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data indicates a surprising rise in UK inflation, reaching 3.5% in the 12 months to April, driven by higher energy and water bills, food and service costs, and a spike in airfares. While pay rises are outpacing price increases for some workers, economists worry about the potential for further inflation due to bosses passing on wage cost increases and government policies. This could lead to the Bank of England cutting interest rates only once more this year. However, factors like weaker global growth and potential for cheaper imports could help bring inflation down, making the overall economic situation uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing significant internal divisions as they attempt to push through a large bill advancing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which includes changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, and immigration policy, has encountered resistance from Republican hard-liners. Trump has reportedly threatened to primary those who vote against the bill, but key holdouts like Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris believe the bill will not pass due to ongoing disagreements over Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions.</p>

One interpretation is that these billionaires are drawn to the Culture's technological prowess, seeing it as the brute force that backs up its ideology.</p>

The circuit is a unique challenge for drivers, with roads around the principality narrow with tight turns and a mile-long tunnel. With modern cars now much larger, this makes overtaking difficult, with the track averaging just 10 overtakes per race, the lowest of any track in the last 10 years.</p>

          <p>Tax cuts pushed by the Trump administration are amplifying debt and deficit concerns among bond investors, influencing interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen back above 4.5 percent, reflecting deficit worries, while the 30-year yield has jumped above 5 percent. The administration’s tax bill is expected to add to the federal deficit, leading to more borrowing and potentially higher interest rates. Economists warn that this unsustainable budget path could lead to market turmoil if investors back away from the Treasury market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Aid Deliveries to Gaza Delayed Despite Israeli Pledge to Ease Blockade</h2>

          <p>Despite Israel's announcement that it would ease its blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, little of the desperately needed supplies have reached Palestinians. The United Nations has been unable to move trucks from the Kerem Shalom border crossing to warehouses inside Gaza, citing delays in securing Israeli permission. The situation has left Gazans waiting for food, fuel, and medicine, with some relying on limited resources and soup kitchens.</p>

          <p>A project is underway in Sonora, Mexico, to conserve jaguars by changing their image from beef-hungry villains to valuable features of the ecosystem that can bring ranchers financial reward. The Northern Jaguar Project's Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of wild cats taken on their land, creating an incentive to protect the animals. The program is helping to protect wild cats in Sonora, and that is having a positive effect on the community.</p>
