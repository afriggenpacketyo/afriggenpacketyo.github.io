          <h2>Experts Assess Iran's Strait of Hormuz Closure Threat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 03:03:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supplies, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites; however, experts suggest the likelihood of closure is minimal. Closing the strait would risk alienating Iran's neighbors, provoking hostilities, and harming its trade relations, particularly with China, a major importer of Iranian oil. Analysts believe Iran has little to gain and much to lose by disrupting oil flows, potentially making it a target for U.S. and Israeli military action, and therefore the closure is unlikely. The stability of the strait is in China's best interest given its dependence on Gulf oil flows.</p>

          <p>Rising uncertainty in the Middle East, fueled by U.S. strikes and Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, is causing concern for the global economy. Analysts warn that a potential shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz could significantly increase crude oil prices, intensify inflation in the United States, and complicate the Federal Reserve's plans to cut interest rates. Gold is expected to benefit from geopolitical shocks, while Chinese assets may remain relatively shielded from the conflict. Despite a broader downtrend in oil prices limiting the immediate impact, a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could drive prices to $100-120 per barrel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian attacks on Kyiv resulted in at least five deaths and numerous injuries, with Ukrainian officials describing the assault as "massive," involving drone and missile strikes. Residential areas were hit, causing fires and significant damage, particularly in the Shevchenkivskyi district where a high-rise building was severely impacted. Ukraine's commander-in-chief had recently vowed to increase strikes on Russia, preceding this attack, and the strikes come amid escalating tensions between the two countries.

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge increased defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, driven by U.S. pressure to address ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. While some member states are aligned with this target, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold, creating potential friction during the summit in The Hague. The U.S. seeks concrete plans and commitments from allies, but some European nations may attempt to dilute their pledges, leading to potential clashes. European aerospace and defense companies emphasize the need for long-term commitments and investment contracts to scale up production capabilities.</p>

Winning Queen's is a positive sign for Alcaraz, as he also won the title in 2023 before triumphing at Wimbledon, and his current form suggests he is the player to beat.

          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation on Earth following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience, outgrowing all G7 nations in 2024, according to official figures. This growth is largely attributed to record military spending and stable oil exports redirected to China and India, facilitated by a "shadow fleet" of tankers. However, high inflation, soaring interest rates, and labor shortages are creating an "uncomfortable situation," with some economists predicting a mild downturn or even collapse. While the Kremlin maintains macroeconomic stability, the impact of sanctions continues to affect the economy's ability to grow and diversify. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Essex Police have renewed their appeal for information ten years after the murder of John "Goldfinger" Palmer, a notorious criminal shot dead in his home garden. Palmer, known for his alleged involvement in the Brink's-Mat robbery and timeshare fraud, was shot six times in a planned execution. Detectives believe the key to solving the murder lies within the underworld and may be linked to the fraud trial, urging those with information to come forward as loyalties may have changed. Despite initial missteps in the investigation, police are determined to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is planning to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy, showing growing interest in ketamine's potential to treat treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not officially licensed for depression treatment, it can be prescribed 'off-label' and is believed to make patients more receptive to psychotherapy. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on psychedelics, including ketamine, later this year.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained calm, with many strategists believing the conflict to be contained. The MSCI World index experienced only a slight decline, and safe havens traded mixed, suggesting investors are not perceiving the situation as a systemic risk. Some analysts believe the attack on Iran could be viewed as a relief, removing the nuclear threat from the region.

          <p>Western leaders are facing criticism for their passive response to the escalating conflict involving the U.S. and Iran, with some observers arguing they are failing to address the root causes of the crisis. While advocating for diplomacy and de-escalation, these leaders are seen as unwilling to challenge Israel's actions and are perpetuating a status quo of unconditional support. This approach is viewed as hypocritical and detached from the public's concerns, as it disregards international law and human rights. The perceived lack of a moral compass and the prioritization of political expediency are contributing to a growing gap between political discourse and the realities of the conflict.</p>

          <p>As NATO sets ambitious goals for defense spending and troop levels, Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, faces significant challenges to meet these demands. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, achieving NATO's target of 5% of GDP for defense spending could be difficult. In addition to financial commitments, the Bundeswehr needs to increase its troop numbers by 50,000 to 60,000 soldiers, requiring new recruitment strategies. The potential withdrawal of US troops from Europe could further increase pressure on Germany to enhance its military capabilities.</p>
