          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>CNBC's 2025 MLB team valuations reveal the average team is worth $2.62 billion, with the New York Yankees topping the list at $8 billion, trailing only the Dallas Cowboys and Golden State Warriors among North American sports franchises. The Los Angeles Dodgers follow as the second most valuable baseball team, valued at $5.8 billion. MLB faces revenue challenges due to the decline of regional sports networks and national TV rights concerns, impacting EBITDA margins compared to leagues with salary caps. However, overall MLB revenue reached a record $12.1 billion in 2024, driven by attendance, ticket sales, and sponsorship revenue, with international prospects showing promise, suggesting baseball may be undervalued.

            <p>California Senator Alex Padilla is championing the Fix Our Forests Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at overhauling federal forest management to prevent wildfires, particularly in Los Angeles County. The bill seeks to create a wildfire intelligence center, streamline risk reduction efforts, and boost research into mitigation technologies. While the House passed a similar measure, some environmental groups have criticized it for potentially weakening endangered species protections. Padilla asserts the Senate version addresses these concerns, including provisions for prescribed burns based on Native American tribal expertise, highlighting the potential for bipartisan cooperation on a critical issue. </p>

            <p>Pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a Green Card holder, faces possible deportation under the McCarran-Walter Act, a controversial law used to deport immigrants whose activities are deemed to have adverse foreign policy consequences. The Trump administration argues that Khalil's actions support terrorism, while free speech advocates raise concerns about the limits of free speech for non-citizens. This case highlights the potential for the government to use immigration laws to suppress dissenting opinions, echoing concerns from the Cold War era when the act was used to target communists.</p>

            <p>Despite the challenges posed by President Trump's policies, Canada may find an opportunity to strengthen its economy and identity. Trump's threats have inspired solidarity and a re-evaluation of Canada's reliance on the U.S. By diversifying its trade relationships, investing in green energy, and reducing internal trade barriers, Canada can emerge as a stronger and more independent nation. The article suggests that Trump's actions could inadvertently spur positive changes in Canada's economic and political landscape.</p>

            <p>This week's key takeaways reveal President Trump's actions are causing chaos and instability. His tariff policies have sent markets reeling, and his campaign of retribution continues against those who oppose him. The Supreme Court has given him some legal victories, but his approach is testing constitutional limits. While his base remains supportive, many Americans disapprove of his handling of trade, highlighting the ongoing challenges and uncertainties of his administration. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A recent study reveals that certain large tropical trees, particularly Dipteryx oleifera, not only survive lightning strikes but also benefit from them. The lightning's immense power clears parasitic vines and reduces competition from nearby trees. This tree has evolved to withstand these strikes, potentially due to its electrical conductivity, highlighting the surprising benefits that can arise from seemingly destructive events.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is under scrutiny for potentially misusing Social Security data to promote voter fraud narratives. A DOGE staffer, Antonio Gracias, claimed that millions of noncitizens received Social Security numbers and appeared on voter rolls, despite court orders preventing DOGE staffers from accessing sensitive SSA systems. This raises concerns about privacy violations and the use of government data for inappropriate purposes, with experts questioning the accuracy of the claims and the legality of the data cross-checking.</p>
