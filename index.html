          <p>President Trump highlighted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting it would maintain U.S. Steel's presence in Pittsburgh and involve significant investments across multiple states. Trump claimed Nippon would invest $14 billion in U.S. Steel, earmarking $2.2 billion for increased production in Pittsburgh and $7 billion for modernizing mills and expanding facilities in other states. He also announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% and pledged that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, ensuring no layoffs or outsourcing, and even promising a $5,000 bonus for each U.S. steelworker. He emphasized U.S. Steel would be "controlled by the USA" under the deal, though specifics on the ownership structure were not provided. Optimism is tempered by the lack of specific details and the prior opposition to the deal.</p>

          <p>The BBC Three drama "What It Feels Like For A Girl," based on Paris Lees' memoir, portrays a gender-questioning teenager's coming-of-age in a working-class town near Nottingham in the early 2000s. The series delves into themes of identity, class, and the challenges faced by trans individuals, particularly those from working-class backgrounds, as Byron navigates a difficult home life, explores his identity in nightclubs, and becomes involved in an exploitative sex work industry. The show doesn't shy away from difficult subjects such as grooming and child abuse, but also emphasizes the importance of humor and heart in the face of adversity. The production explores the complexities of Byron's journey as he begins to transition, highlighting the need for safe spaces and the impact of societal pressures on self-discovery. The series aims to authentically represent the experiences of trans individuals and the intersectionality with working-class struggles.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed reinstating an "asset test" for low-income and disabled individuals applying for Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services. The proposal aims to address rising costs in these programs by limiting eligibility to those with assets totaling less than $2,000. This would include evaluating a person's primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund. Disability and health advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing it would force vulnerable populations into poverty and result in increased healthcare costs in the long run.

The GHF aims to bypass the UN as the main aid supplier, but has been condemned and boycotted by aid agencies. The initial distribution sites were overrun by desperate civilians, with reports of gunshots and the use of non-lethal deterrents by GHF personnel. Palestinians seeking aid have described the operation as disorganized, with a lack of communication contributing to the chaos.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a near collision between two passenger jets at San Francisco International Airport. The incident occurred on May 13 when a United Airlines flight veered into the path of a SkyWest Airlines flight during takeoff. The United flight reportedly made a sharp turn to the left instead of turning right, resulting in the planes coming within 0.4 nautical miles horizontally and 280 feet vertically. Both United and the FAA are reviewing the incident.</p>

          <p>The CDC has updated its vaccine schedules to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for children through shared clinical decision-making with a doctor, removing the previous routine recommendation for all children. This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who announced the removal of the COVID vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule. Medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to recommend COVID vaccines for children and pregnant women based on scientific evidence. The decision has raised concerns among public health experts about the transparency and stability of vaccine policymaking.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that targets public broadcasting. The lawsuit accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violating the First Amendment. The suit alleges the executive order is an attempt to cut off funds to PBS due to the content of its programming and a desire to alter its speech. The executive order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS" and prevents indirect funding by prohibiting local stations from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations.</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities and supporters are expressing frustration over the sport's lack of knighthoods or damehoods in its 130-year history. The Rugby Football League spokesperson stated it is surprising and disappointing that no one has been deemed worthy of such an honor. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, added that the lack of rugby league knighthoods is unjust compared to other sports like rugby union. Concerns have been raised that the lack of recognition may be linked to class prejudice and the working-class backgrounds of many rugby league players.</p>

The government plans to move the celebrations to the post-exam period to reduce social exclusion, peer pressure, and high costs for young people.
