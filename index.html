        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Sean Combs trial, Sharay Hayes, a male escort, testified about alleged sexual encounters between Sean Combs and Cassie Ventura. Hayes stated that Ventura did not appear uncomfortable during these encounters and seemed focused on Combs' desires. However, on re-direct examination, Hayes acknowledged that Ventura sometimes winced or sighed at Combs' directions, indicating a consistent awareness of Combs' perceptions. The defense attorney questioned Hayes about his book on erectile dysfunction and his feelings towards Ventura, which Hayes denied, saying he felt "special" because Ventura chose him for the encounters. The testimony concluded with Hayes affirming that the alleged encounters were sexually charged, unlike his usual exotic dancing performances.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic discusses the recurring theme of Joe Biden's age and its impact on his presidency, noting how concerns about his fitness for office have been a constant topic of discussion. The article references a new book, 'Original Sin,' which portrays Biden as frail and out of touch, highlighting instances where he forgot names and had internal discussions about using a wheelchair. The author argues that while the 'cover-up' of Biden's condition is problematic, it's difficult to hide something so apparent to the public eye. Despite efforts to portray him otherwise, Biden's public appearances often reinforced the perception of his infirmity, making the issue hard to ignore.</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to balance rapid access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence in lower-risk groups. The agency urges vaccine makers to conduct randomized studies in adults aged 50-64 and children under 5, with potential interim results available by next year.</p>

Some Republicans, particularly those from high-tax states like New York, California, and New Jersey, are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservative hardliners seek deeper budget cuts. Despite Trump's claims of unity, some members remain opposed to the bill in its current form.

          <p>Walmart has shifted its tone on the impact of President Trump's tariffs, warning that higher duties on imports will soon lead to increased prices for consumers. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb, despite Walmart's commitment to everyday low prices. This announcement risks drawing Trump's public criticism, as he has previously attacked companies opposing his agenda. Walmart's decision to warn of higher prices is driven by a sense of obligation to explain the reasons behind potential price increases to customers and investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two teenagers in Ruislip, west London, pleaded guilty to torturing and killing two kittens. The investigation began after a kitten was found hanging from a tree, and another was found nearby with ropes attached and cut open. The 16-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy admitted to causing unnecessary suffering to the animals and possessing a knife. Knives, blowtorches, and scissors were found at the scene, and the pair has been remanded into the care of the local authority with strict conditions until their sentencing.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, stating that it is a constitutional right for the president to remove people from the country. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, explaining that habeas corpus is the right to challenge unlawful detention. Noem's remarks are notable given her role in overseeing detentions and deportations that have been challenged in courts for violating habeas corpus rights. The incident follows similar claims from White House officials about suspending habeas corpus for migrants.</p>

The settlement is for ¬£200m, with ¬£100m earmarked for consumers to claim by the end of the year.
