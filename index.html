          <p>Shares of SK Hynix have reached a two-decade high following reports that its parent company, SK Group, is planning to construct South Korea's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Telecom and SK Broadband are expected to spearhead the initiative, with support from SK Hynix, a leading supplier of DRAM, a type of semiconductor memory used in PCs and servers. Counterpoint Research notes that SK Hynix's earnings outlook has improved due to rising DRAM prices, with Morgan Stanley revising its estimates upward, while Samsung's market cap has declined due to struggles capitalizing on AI-led demand. SK Hynix has become a leader in high bandwidth memory, supplying to clients such as Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv resulted in at least 14 fatalities and 44 injuries, devastating a residential building and destroying numerous apartments, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack occurred while world leaders gathered at the G7 meeting in Canada, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to attend, and Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported that a U.S. citizen was among those killed by shrapnel. Moscow has intensified its attacks following Ukraine's Security Service operation targeting war planes inside Russia, and while prisoner exchanges are expected to conclude next week, direct peace talks have seen little progress. Russia's security chief, Sergei Shoigu, also traveled to North Korea to meet with leader Kim Jong Un, reportedly under special instructions from President Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases at a slower pace starting in April of next year, while maintaining its benchmark policy rate at 0.5%. The central bank will decrease its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, with total purchases declining to approximately 2 trillion yen by early 2027. This decision reflects a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amidst economic uncertainties, especially with concerns about U.S. trade policies impacting Japan's export-oriented economy. Despite ending a decade of unorthodox easing, the BOJ remains vigilant about the potential impact of global trade policies on economic activity and prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Perry's death was ruled to be primarily caused by ketamine, and Plasencia admitted to illegally supplying Perry with the drug and instructing Perry's assistant on how to administer it. The plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, with sentencing to be determined.</p>

          <p>Gold has surpassed traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys in performance this year, with spot prices surging 30% amid fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical tensions. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference highlighted gold's appeal due to its independence from government liabilities, contrasting it with assets tied to specific economies. While the dollar index has weakened and yields on U.S. government bonds have decreased, gold's demand has been driven by instability, particularly in the Middle East, and doubts about the U.S. dollar and Treasury market.</p>

          <p>Group of Seven leaders have jointly affirmed their support for Israel and called for de-escalation in the escalating tensions in the Middle East. The G7 leaders condemned Iran as the "principal source of regional instability and terror," reiterating their stance that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. President Trump left the summit early, citing the situation in the Middle East, while the G7 economies comprise the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, and this year's summit also invited leaders from the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Ukraine, and South Korea.</p>

The claims are related to Assembly Bill 218, which opened a window for adults to file lawsuits over childhood sexual abuse, and the district has also established its own insurance company to manage future abuse claims.</p>
