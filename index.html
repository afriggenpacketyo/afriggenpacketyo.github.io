          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested at least 355 individuals during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the UK government. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, proceeded despite calls from police and political leaders to postpone it following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers stated the protest was necessary to avoid "letting terror win," while critics, including Jewish community leaders, called the timing "phenomenally tone deaf" and a drain on police resources needed for community protection.</p>

          <p>Virginia's Democratic attorney general candidate, Jay Jones, is facing intense pressure to withdraw from his campaign after text messages from 2022 were revealed. In the texts, Jones made violent remarks about former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert, including a comment about shooting him. Governor Glenn Youngkin condemned the rhetoric as "violent" and "disgusting," calling for Jones to step down "in disgrace." Jones has since issued a public apology, expressing shame and stating he has reached out to Gilbert's family directly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown negotiations, a significant political battle has erupted over Republican claims that Democrats are seeking to provide "free healthcare for illegals." Democratic leaders, including Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, have vehemently denied these assertions, clarifying that federal law already prohibits such funding for undocumented immigrants. The debate centers on a Democratic proposal to restore healthcare access for lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, which was curtailed by recent Republican-led legislation. This messaging conflict highlights the deep partisan divide on both immigration and healthcare policy.</p>

          <p>The populist ANO party, led by billionaire and former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has won the parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic, securing just under 35% of the vote. While this makes ANO the largest party, it did not achieve an overall majority, necessitating the formation of a coalition government. Babis is expected to initiate talks with smaller right-wing eurosceptic parties, such as the Motorists for Themselves and the Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party. Potential coalition discussions may face challenges over key policy differences, including the SPD's demand for a referendum on EU and NATO membership.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprising pole position for the Singapore Grand Prix, outperforming Red Bull's Max Verstappen by 0.182 seconds. This marks Russell's first pole since the Canadian Grand Prix and a significant result for Mercedes at the Marina Bay circuit. Championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren will start in third, ahead of his teammate and title rival Lando Norris in fifth. Verstappen expressed frustration after his final qualifying lap, suggesting he was impeded by a slow-moving Norris, an incident Norris later dismissed.</p>

          <p>Kristi Noem, serving as Donald Trump's homeland security secretary, has stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents "will be all over" next year's Super Bowl, warning that people should not attend unless they are "law-abiding Americans." The comments came during an interview where she also criticized the NFL's choice of Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny for the halftime show due to his past criticism of Trump's immigration policies. The White House press secretary later clarified that there was "no tangible plan" for increased ICE enforcement at the event, slightly contradicting Noem's assertive stance.</p>

According to Ashley Parker of The Atlantic, Trump is leveraging the shutdown to advance his goal of deconstructing the administrative state, though his administration is aware of potential public blowback. The panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" explored the dynamics of the shutdown, highlighting the president's comfort with conflict and his belief that it advantages him and the Republican party, a conclusion that remains to be tested.</p>

          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has earmarked over £60 million for a redress scheme to compensate individuals who allege they were victims of historical abuse by its former owner, the late Mohamed Al Fayed. The scheme, which is open until March 2026, is expected to handle claims from over 100 former employees, with potential individual payouts of up to £385,000. Multiple women have accused Fayed, who owned the store from 1985 to 2010, of sexual assault, and police are investigating reports from 146 people. The financial provision for the scheme contributed to Harrods reporting a £34.3 million loss in its latest accounts.</p>

          <p>A journal associated with China's military has detailed the development of new, intelligent unmanned underwater systems designed for stealth and integrated combat. According to the article, these systems operate at noise levels below 90 decibels to evade sonar detection, making them highly effective for covert operations. The technology can be integrated with submarine-launched missiles and smart mines, forming a "multilayered strike network." The report underscores China's advancements in unmanned naval technology, showcasing new submersibles and surface vessels aimed at enhancing its maritime capabilities.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has placed the national park system in a state of uncertainty, with many parks remaining partially accessible but operating with skeleton crews. While roads and trails in some major parks like Yosemite are open, visitor services, maintenance, and fee collection have ceased, leading to confusion for tourists and concern among advocates. This situation has furloughed thousands of park employees and raises risks of environmental damage and safety issues, similar to problems seen during the 2018 shutdown, such as vandalism and overflowing waste. The shutdown also impacts gateway communities that depend on park tourism.</p>

          <p>Small college towns across the United States are facing economic hardship due to a sharp decline in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration policies. Universities like Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, have seen their international student populations plummet, resulting in significant revenue losses for both the institutions and local businesses that depend on them. The article attributes the drop to factors like stricter visa vetting processes, fears of deportation, and a general chilling effect from the administration's rhetoric. This decline threatens the economic stability of communities whose economies are heavily reliant on their universities.</p>

          <p>A new report from the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice reveals that prosecutors have charged 412 people with pregnancy-related crimes in the two years since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The article highlights that these cases, often involving low-income women and allegations of substance use, are increasingly using laws meant to protect children to prosecute actions taken during pregnancy. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which could lead to broader surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals' behavior. The author draws parallels to the total abortion ban and aggressive policing of pregnancy in El Salvador as a potential model for the U.S. future.</p>
