          <p>David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair due to a "fundamental disagreement" regarding the role of the vice chair within the party. Hogg, who rose to prominence as an activist after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, intends to focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC Chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision, though tensions had been escalating between Hogg and senior DNC leaders, including Martin himself, over the direction of the party. The DNC will proceed with the election re-do without Hogg on the ticket, allowing the party to focus on other priorities. The young activist feels that he can better serve the party by focusing on his organization rather than staying in the DNC role. The role is now free for other candidates to compete for.

Bessent defended the administrationâ€™s trade policies and stated that China had met its agreements under President Trump in 2020.

          <p>New, more aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across Los Angeles, ordered by top Trump aide Stephen Miller, have triggered intense protests in the city. The protests, reflecting the city's deep-blue Democratic coalition, include young Hispanic people, older liberals, college students, and left-wing activists. Miller's push for mass deportations and maximal assertion of executive power has been met with resistance, as many Angelenos feel their right to belong is under attack. The protests have also drawn attention to the use of force to suppress dissent and the cultural war between Miller's conservative vision and Los Angeles's diverse and immigrant-friendly environment.
