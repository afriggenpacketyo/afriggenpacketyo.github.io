            <p>A helicopter crash in the Hudson River near New York City resulted in the deaths of six people, including a family of Spanish tourists and the pilot. The chopper, operated by New York Helicopter Tours, plunged into the water shortly after takeoff, and an investigation is underway by the National Transportation Safety Board to determine the cause, focusing on wreckage examination and witness accounts. The family was celebrating the wife's 40th birthday, adding a tragic layer to the event. President Trump and the Spanish Prime Minister expressed their condolences regarding the 'terrible' crash.</p>

            <p>An advisor to President Trump, Stephen Miran, hinted at a potential shift towards establishing a new global economic order beyond just tariffs. Miran suggested the need for a Bretton Woods-style meeting to reform the international economic system, possibly devaluing the dollar or compensating the U.S. for its role as the reserve currency. Some believe Trump's tariffs aim to strengthen the U.S.'s hand in negotiations for a grand economic bargain, though experts debate the true costs and benefits of the dollar's reserve currency status.</p>

            <p>President Trump's strategy of unpredictability and chaotic tariff implementation is causing significant damage to the U.S. economy and its global reputation. Investors are responding negatively by selling off U.S. bonds and currency, driven by concerns about instability and reliability. While Trump may aim for "big, beautiful deals," his actions are creating long-lasting harm and challenging the U.S.'s position in the global economy.</p>

            <p>The number of measles cases in the U.S. has surged, with weekly cases topping 90 for the first time since 2019, indicating a significant outbreak.
