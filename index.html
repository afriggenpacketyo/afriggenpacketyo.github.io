          <p>A new study in The Lancet medical journal estimates that the Trump administration's decision to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could lead to 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. Researchers found that USAID programs, which cost the average taxpayer about 18 cents per day, have averted an estimated 91 million deaths over the past two decades, particularly from diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria. The administration has defended the cuts, citing inefficiency, while the study's authors and other experts highlight the significant life-saving impact of the foreign aid. The findings provide a comprehensive look at the agency's broad effects on global mortality rates.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed it is halting some weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision made to prioritize "America's interests" following a Defense Department review. An official stated the move was prompted by concerns over dwindling U.S. military stockpiles, though the specific weapons or scale of the pullback were not disclosed. This action follows previous pauses in military aid and intelligence sharing under the Trump administration, which were later lifted. The U.S. has been a primary military supplier to Ukraine, providing about 20% of its military hardware since Russia's 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>Parts of England are already in an official drought, and other regions across the UK could soon follow due to prolonged dry weather and low rainfall. The UK experienced its sixth driest spring since 1836, leading to below-normal river flows and exceptionally low reservoir levels, particularly in northern England. While June brought some rain to western areas, central and eastern regions remained dry, straining water supplies for homes, businesses, and agriculture. Experts warn that climate change is exacerbating these conditions, increasing the likelihood of more frequent and intense droughts in the future.</p>

In a social media post, Trump stated that during this period, efforts would be made with all parties to bring an end to the war. He urged Hamas to accept the proposal, which he said was brokered with help from Qatar and Egypt, warning that the terms would only worsen for them. The conflict, which began after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, has resulted in significant casualties on both sides.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has filed for an initial public offering (IPO), planning to trade on the NYSE under the symbol "FIG." The move comes after a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory issues, resulting in a $1 billion termination fee for Figma. The company has shown strong growth, with first-quarter revenue up 46% to $228.2 million and a growing base of high-value customers. CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public aims to allow the community to share in Figma's ownership and signals the company will "take big swings," including further acquisitions.

Nvidia's triumph is credited to its continued dominance in the AI chip sector and persistent high demand, despite earlier concerns about competition and U.S. sales restrictions in China.

Maruf Hossain, a deliveryman, tripped on a chipped platform at a Bronx station and was struck by an incoming train, also suffering a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. His lawyer argued the MTA was negligent and tried to "bully" Hossain into a small settlement, while the MTA contended he had attempted suicide.

Kohberger, a former criminology Ph.D. student, was linked to the crime by DNA from a knife sheath, cellphone records, and surveillance footage of his car.

          <p>California has passed significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in an effort to boost housing construction. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas zoned for multifamily use. This change aims to eliminate lengthy environmental studies and the threat of lawsuits that have historically delayed or blocked new developments. While other obstacles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the reform removes a key tool that groups have used for decades to stall housing projects, signaling a major policy shift.</p>

          <p>Warner Music Group has announced a major restructuring plan that includes reducing annual costs by approximately $300 million. According to a memo from CEO Robert Kyncl, $170 million of these savings will come from layoffs, referred to as "headcount rightsizing." The move is described as a final step in a multi-year effort to "future-proof" the company and increase agility. While the exact number of affected employees is unknown, the company plans to reinvest the savings into its artist and repertoire (A&R) department and pursue mergers and acquisitions, including a new $1.2 billion joint venture with Bain Capital.</p>

          <p>A provision within the new GOP spending bill that would block abortion clinics from receiving Medicaid funds for non-abortion services is being seen as a significant win for the anti-abortion movement. If passed, clinics like Planned Parenthood would lose federal reimbursements for services such as cancer screenings and STI testing, which could force some to close or limit services nationwide. This marks a departure from the "leave it to the states" approach, affecting clinics in both red and blue states. The move, combined with a recent Supreme Court decision, signals a strategic shift toward restricting abortion access through financial means.</p>

Leaders secured the necessary votes by making last-minute deals, such as adding a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals to win over Senator Josh Hawley and provisions for Alaska to persuade Senator Lisa Murkowski.

          <h2>UK Government Passes Welfare Bill After Making Major Concessions to Party Rebels</h2>

          <p>The UK government has won a key vote on its controversial benefits bill but only after making significant last-minute concessions to rebellious Labour MPs. Fearing a defeat, ministers agreed to delay changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) eligibility rules until after a review is completed, effectively gutting the bill of its most contentious measures. The U-turn is seen as undermining the authority of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and creates a Â£5 billion hole in the chancellor's spending plans. Critics from all parties described the legislative process as chaotic and shambolic.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Note China is Increasing Science and Technology Collaboration with the Global South</h2>

          <p>As its scientific collaboration with the United States declines, China is significantly boosting its science and technology outreach to countries in the Global South. According to analysts, Beijing has signed numerous bilateral science and technology agreements, marking a strategic departure from its previous focus on the U.S. This shift comes as the U.S. State Department is reportedly closing its own Office of Science and Technology Cooperation, which oversees such international agreements. Experts suggest this trend highlights a need for greater dialogue to preserve areas of scientific cooperation that are mutually beneficial to the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>A person walking on a beach in Walton County, Florida, discovered 25 kilos of cocaine, with an estimated street value of nearly half a million dollars, that had washed ashore. The drugs were found wrapped in distinctive packaging featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The Walton County Sheriff's Office confiscated the narcotics and warned the public not to touch any suspicious packages found on the beach, as their contents could be dangerous. This incident is the latest in a series of discoveries where large quantities of illicit drugs, often in unique packaging, have washed up on Florida's coasts.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing its first major heat wave of the summer, with record-breaking temperatures causing disruptions across the continent. In Paris, the summit of the Eiffel Tower was closed to visitors, and hundreds of schools were shut down as temperatures were forecast to hit 104Â°F (40Â°C). Barcelona recorded its hottest June in over a century, while Spain as a whole saw a new national high for the month. Health warnings are in effect in multiple countries, with experts linking the early and intense heat to global warming and noting that rising sea temperatures are reducing any cooling effects for coastal regions.</p>
