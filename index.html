          <p>The second Trump administration is facing scrutiny for blurring the lines between public office and personal benefits, as illustrated by the plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from the Qatari royal family. This and other actions, including the creation of a meme cryptocurrency and pressure on law firms for free legal services, are raising concerns about the potential for corruption and the erosion of traditional legal and political guardrails.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has put India in a tight spot, as it goes against the country's long-standing policy of opposing third-party mediation. While Pakistan has welcomed the offer, India has historically maintained that the issue should be resolved through bilateral negotiations. Trump's intervention has sparked debate and concern in India, with opposition parties calling for an explanation from the government.</p>

          <h2>Art Market Shows Caution as Auction of Riggio Collection Falls Short of Expectations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 22:50:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The auction of the Riggio family's art collection at Christie's in New York proved anticlimactic, signaling caution in the art market. The sale fell short of expectations, with some artworks presold and little enthusiastic bidding. Experts attributed the lackluster performance to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the global art market.</p>
