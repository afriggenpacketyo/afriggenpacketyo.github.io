          <p>Unprecedented flash floods devastated Texas Hill Country over a holiday weekend, resulting in at least 119 fatalities and leaving dozens of people missing. Fueled by remnants of a tropical system, the Guadalupe River experienced a dramatic and rapid rise, inundating communities and a girls' summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors tragically died. The catastrophe has triggered a massive search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies. It has also prompted intense scrutiny over the effectiveness and timeliness of the region's emergency warning systems, with officials facing questions about their preparedness for such a severe weather event.</p>

Founded in 2004 by 86-year-old Ellis Ferrell Jr., the club aims to teach valuable life lessons, build confidence, and help youth overcome personal challenges and fears. Participants describe the experience as therapeutic and transformative, with many alumni going on to successful careers, including one who will be the first in the club to attend college.

          <p>Idaho's Attorney General, Raul Labrador, is preparing to argue before the Supreme Court in a case concerning a state law that bars transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. Labrador stated his goal is not just to defend Idaho's law but to establish a new, binding national precedent on the issue, believing the court is poised to make a significant ruling. He intends to argue that the 14th Amendment does not prevent states from creating sex-specific sports categories to protect female athletes. The case originated from a lawsuit filed by a transgender athlete at Boise State University who sought to join the women's cross-country team.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued letters to at least six more nations, including the Philippines and Iraq, informing them of forthcoming steep tariffs on their exports to the United States. This action follows a similar move two days prior when 14 other countries were notified of new duties, with rates ranging from 20% to 40%. The letters indicate the new tariffs will take effect on August 1, with the administration stating that no extensions will be granted. This aggressive trade policy continues the president's effort to reset global trade relationships and leverage tariffs to influence foreign policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe funding crisis is crippling operations at Dzaleka, Malawi's largest refugee camp, forcing the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) to significantly scale down its activities. The shortfall has led to staff layoffs and the suspension of essential services and community programs, creating a dire situation for the camp's more than 56,000 residents. The camp, originally built for 12,000, is severely overcrowded, housing people primarily from the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa regions. Activists are deeply concerned about the welfare of the refugees, particularly women and children, and fear the situation could lead to forced repatriations.</p>

While acknowledging the "kids these days" fallacy, the report points to a real, pre-pandemic decline in NAEP scores, particularly among lower-achieving students.

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University, announcing plans to issue administrative subpoenas for detailed records concerning its international students. The Department of Homeland Security stated the demand is related to the university's certification to enroll foreign students, accusing Harvard of allowing them to "abuse their visa privileges." This move follows a previous attempt to revoke the school's enrollment ability, which was blocked by a federal judge after Harvard sued. The administration's actions are part of a broader campaign against the university, which includes accusations of failing to address antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>Poland has reintroduced spot checks at its border with Germany, a move that further strains the European Union's Schengen agreement of open travel. The decision is a direct response to Germany's recent toughening of its own migration policies, which includes turning away some asylum seekers at its borders. The new controls are causing disruptions for daily commuters and commerce in the integrated border region of Frankfurt an der Oder and Slubice. The situation has also attracted self-proclaimed "citizen patrols" to the border, reflecting rising tensions over migration policy within the EU.</p>

          <p>Sir Brian Langstaff, chair of the public inquiry into the UK's infected blood scandal, has harshly criticized the government's compensation scheme, stating that long delays are causing "further harm" to victims. The disaster saw 30,000 people infected with HIV and hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products in the 1970s and 80s. A new report from the inquiry highlights "obvious injustices" in the scheme's design and execution, noting that only 460 people have received full compensation so far. Sir Brian urged the government to prioritize the seriously ill and elderly and allow all victims to apply rather than wait for an invitation.</p>

          <p>Colorado State University has slightly lowered its forecast for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season but still anticipates above-normal activity. The updated prediction calls for 16 named storms, eight of which are expected to become hurricanes, with three strengthening into major hurricanes. The slight reduction is attributed to strong, cyclone-disrupting wind shear observed in the Caribbean. However, this is counteracted by warmer-than-average Atlantic sea surface temperatures and a neutral El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) pattern, both of which create conditions conducive to storm formation and intensification. The forecast remains more active than a typical season.</p>

The collision created the vast South Pole-Aitken basin and resulted in volcanic rock that is chemically different from any samples previously collected from the moon's near side.

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is facing legal and public scrutiny over its approach to fulfilling a settlement agreement to clear 9,800 homeless encampments. Critics and a federal judge have objected to the city's method of counting the removal of a tent as an "encampment resolution," even when the unhoused resident is not offered or placed in shelter or housing. Advocacy groups argue this focus on a quota system leads to the destruction of personal property without addressing the root causes of homelessness. The city maintains its cleanups are necessary for public health and safety, highlighting the complex challenge of balancing sanitation with providing permanent housing solutions.</p>

For example, telling a player to "push the ground away" or "accelerate like a Ferrari" resulted in a 3% improvement in sprint times. Researchers concluded that focusing on the environment or an evocative image, rather than on body movements, allows for more natural and powerful performance.</p>

During Prime Minister's Questions, Starmer committed only to his manifesto pledge of not raising the headline rates of key taxes.

The discussion includes Trump's reported idea of naming a "shadow chair" to publicly undermine Powell's policies until his term ends.

This approach risks alienating the sport's rapidly growing female fanbase and undermines initiatives like the F1 Academy, which are meant to support women in motorsport.
