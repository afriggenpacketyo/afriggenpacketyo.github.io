          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla has weakened from a hurricane off Mexico's Pacific coast, but still poses a significant flooding risk to the southwestern U.S. from Thursday through Saturday. Regions including central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, southwest Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico could experience up to four inches of rain, leading to scattered flash flooding. The storm, currently with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, is moving northwest and is expected to further weaken into a remnant low by Friday. Additionally, large swells generated by Priscilla are causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along parts of Mexico's coast and the Baja California peninsula, urging caution for coastal residents.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry is actively churning over the central Atlantic Ocean, positioned 505 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, and currently poses no direct threat to southern Florida. Forecasters anticipate Jerry will strengthen significantly, potentially becoming a hurricane later this week or over the weekend, which entails minimum sustained winds of at least 74 mph. A tropical storm watch is now in effect for several Leeward Islands, where two to four inches of rain and a considerable risk of flash flooding are expected, particularly in higher terrain. Furthermore, swells generated by Jerry are forecast to reach these islands, causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.</p>

          <p>A'ja Wilson delivered a dramatic seven-foot fadeaway jumper with just 0.3 seconds remaining, securing a 90-88 victory for the Las Vegas Aces over the Phoenix Mercury in Game 3 of the WNBA finals. This crucial win gives the Aces a commanding 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, positioning them on the brink of clinching their third WNBA title in four seasons. Wilson's stellar performance included 34 points and 14 rebounds, and she also broke the WNBA record for most points in a single postseason. The Aces, who never trailed in the game and shot 56% from three-point range, will aim to clinch the championship in Game 4 on Friday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has implemented stricter export rules for rare earths and related processing technologies, which are crucial for manufacturing high-tech products like electric vehicles, smartphones, and jet engines. The new regulations formalize existing controls on processing technology and unauthorized overseas cooperation, making licenses unlikely for foreign arms manufacturers and some semiconductor firms. This move intensifies amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and could significantly impact countries like the U.S., which has a rare earths mining industry but lacks extensive processing facilities. The article specifies restricted technologies, including mining, smelting, separation, magnetic material manufacturing, and recycling processes, further solidifying China's dominance in the global rare earth supply chain.</p>

Petro, a leftist president who has periodically clashed with the Trump administration, did not provide specific evidence for his claim.

The acquisition means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business.

Democrats and some Republicans questioned the legality and rationale of the Trump administration's campaign, which has reportedly killed at least 21 people. The administration asserts these strikes are justified against "unlawful combatants" in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, a claim that has generated significant constitutional debate and raised concerns about setting dangerous precedents for unilateral military action.</p>

While the Pentagon dropped a requirement for reporters to explicitly agree to the new policy, the Association argues it still threatens First Amendment rights by discouraging contact with unauthorized sources.

          <p>President Trump's proposed 20-point Gaza peace plan, now in its "first phase" of agreement, outlines a comprehensive roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, Israel's phased withdrawal to an "agreed upon line," and Hamas's release of all remaining hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. It also proposes Gaza's demilitarization under international monitors, with governance by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee," not Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. This article details provisions for full aid, economic redevelopment, and a temporary International Stabilization Force, alongside a commitment to an "interfaith dialogue process" and a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan has restricted access to major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat on multiple providers, according to global internet monitor NetBlocks. This action follows the Taliban's previous ban on TikTok in 2022 and a complete internet and telecommunications suspension across the country in late September. Users in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif reported being unable to access these platforms without Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), experiencing slow or intermittent service. This article highlights growing concerns from rights groups about the severe implications for Afghan citizens, particularly women and girls, as the Taliban continues to tighten its control over information access and freedom of expression, despite some platforms like WhatsApp and X remaining functional.</p>

          <p>Portland, Oregon, is experiencing heightened anxiety as President Trump attempts to deploy the National Guard to quell protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, describing the city as "war-ravaged" and "burning to the ground." Business owners, like Lisa Schroeder of Mother's Bistro and Bar, report significant financial downturns since the 2020 pandemic and ensuing protests, exacerbated by the president's rhetoric, which they argue damages the city's image. A federal judge initially blocked the deployment of Oregon's National Guard, though an appeals court later granted a White House request to keep 200 Oregon troops under federal control, while still prohibiting their deployment to Portland. This article highlights the local impact of federal actions and the contentious political climate.</p>

          <p>Consumers planning holiday decorations, from artificial Christmas trees to lights and wreaths, are advised to shop early due to anticipated shortages and higher prices. One of the nation's largest artificial Christmas tree importers, National Tree Company, warned of 25% less inventory this year, attributing the shortfall to trade war tariffs. CEO Chris Butler indicated a 10% price increase and advised against waiting for peak Black Friday sales. This article highlights that while most consumers might absorb the price hike, those at the lower end of the economic spectrum could struggle. The Christmas Trade Group is actively engaging the Trump administration to mitigate these significant supply chain and affordability issues, aiming to "save Christmas." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, appeared largely unconvinced by arguments in a case challenging Illinois' voting regulation that allows mailed ballots to be counted up to 14 days after Election Day. Representative Michael Bost, a Republican who won his election, sued, claiming harm due to a lowered margin of victory and increased staff costs during the extended count. Justices like John Roberts and Elena Kagan questioned the standing for a winning candidate, while Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor criticized the lack of factual allegations in Bost's brief. This article highlights the justices' skepticism towards both sides, particularly regarding the definition of harm and who should automatically be able to sue over election rules, noting the potential for a "disaster" if any candidate could challenge rules.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed national military medical center on Friday, marking his second such exam since returning to the White House in January.

This article notes that his previous April exam included cognitive and cardiology tests, and his physician declared him "fully fit" despite a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency and visible bruising. Speculation about Trump's health has been persistent, intensifying after he briefly faded from public view over the summer. This visit aims to provide an updated assessment of his physical and mental wellbeing, as he is the oldest man to be inaugurated US president.</p>
