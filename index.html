          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 06:43:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Japan have announced a significant trade deal that will lower tariffs on Japanese exports, including automobiles, to 15%. As part of the agreement, Japan has committed to investing $550 billion in the U.S. and opening its markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the tariff reduction from the previous 25% rate, a move that provided relief to the country's vital auto industry. The deal also reportedly includes a separate component involving liquified natural gas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Relations between the European Union and China have deteriorated significantly ahead of a planned summit in Beijing, which has been shortened at China's request. The EU's primary grievances include a €400 billion trade deficit, restricted market access for its producers, and the dumping of subsidized Chinese electric vehicles. Additionally, China's export curbs on rare earth minerals, essential for technology and manufacturing, have created major supply chain disruptions for European firms. The EU's recent sanctions against Chinese companies for aiding Russia's war effort have further strained the relationship, with little optimism for a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man from Casco, Michigan, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder after police responded to a welfare check. The investigation began when authorities received a 911 call that was immediately disconnected, prompting them to dispatch officers to the Shelby Township apartment. Upon arrival, the suspect, Terrance Lamar Bowie, allegedly told officers there was a deceased person inside, where they discovered the body of a 27-year-old woman. Police stated the incident was not random, as the suspect and victim knew each other, and Bowie is now being held on a $2 million bond.</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for interest rate manipulation quashed by the UK Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were among 19 traders convicted in the UK and US for rigging the Libor and Euribor rates, which influence global borrowing costs. The traders had long maintained their innocence, arguing they were scapegoated to appease public anger over the 2008 financial crisis for engaging in what they considered normal commercial practices. Hayes, who served five and a half years in prison, described the experience as having "destroyed" his family.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed its first wave of sanctions aimed at disrupting people-smuggling operations across the English Channel, targeting 25 individuals and entities. The measures include asset freezes and UK travel bans for suspected gang leaders, middlemen, and suppliers of small boats, such as a Chinese company accused of manufacturing the inflatable vessels. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the move a "landmark moment" in the fight against illegal migration. However, some experts, including from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, have expressed skepticism, suggesting the impact may be limited given the vast scale of the smuggling networks.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old Florida woman, Janita Phillips, has been sentenced to five years of probation for killing her infant son in Connecticut in 1986. The cold case was solved in 2021 after new DNA testing connected her to the crime, leading to her arrest for murder, a charge later reduced to manslaughter. The judge granted probation, an unusual sentence for a homicide, after a psychological assessment concluded Phillips was under "extreme emotional distress" at the time, having recently been homeless and told by her husband he wanted no more children. Phillips, who hid the pregnancy, expressed deep regret for her actions during the sentencing.</p>

The new law places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) under the control of the Prosecutor General's Office. This move has sparked protests in Kyiv and other cities, with demonstrators concerned about a slide towards authoritarianism and a threat to Ukraine's EU accession goals.

While the U.S. initially controlled the market, China recognized the elements' strategic value, learned processing techniques, and leveraged low costs to build its industry. To combat internal price wars and severe environmental pollution from unregulated mining, Beijing implemented a ruthless consolidation campaign, winnowing hundreds of small firms into six state-controlled giants. This "secret war" against illegal production gave China the power to control global supply and prices, a tool it now wields in international trade disputes.</p>

Researchers from Peking University People’s Hospital observed that patients began regaining weight just eight weeks after stopping treatment, a trend that continued over 20 weeks. The analysis, published in BMC Medicine, suggests that the challenge of maintaining weight loss with these drugs is similar to that of traditional methods. The findings underscore the need for patients to have realistic expectations and for clinicians to establish long-term treatment strategies for obesity management.</p>

          <p>Three veteran unscripted television producers have launched Elixir, a production company aimed at creating high-quality online content for platforms like YouTube. Jeff Kmiotek, Michael Zinman, and Andrew Watnick are leveraging their experience on shows like "The Masked Singer" to fill a perceived gap in the booming creator market, which they note often lacks a polished aesthetic. As network TV faces budget cuts and declining viewership, the trio sees an opportunity in the creator economy's rapid growth and creative freedom. Their company, Elixir, aims to produce visually distinct shows and collaborate with influencers to elevate their content with professional production value.</p>

Six months later, a review of the grants shows the funds supported immediate needs like cash aid, food, and shelter, as well as longer-term challenges such as mental health services and navigating bureaucracy. Organizations like the L.A. Regional Food Bank and direct-aid group The Change Reaction were able to provide urgent assistance to thousands of displaced residents.

          <p>An FDA expert panel convened to discuss the use of SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy has alarmed many healthcare professionals due to its composition and the spread of misinformation. Nine of the ten panelists have previously questioned the safety of SSRIs, and during the discussion, several cited flawed studies or made misleading statements about the drugs' risks. Critics, including reproductive psychiatrists, noted that the panel largely ignored the significant dangers of untreated maternal depression and failed to provide a balanced view of the existing scientific data. The event is seen by some as part of a broader political movement to discredit the medications, potentially preventing women from receiving necessary care.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Governor Gavin Newsom's threat to dismantle California's independent redistricting commission is an arrogant move that ignores the will of the voters. In 2010, Californians overwhelmingly passed a measure to take the power of drawing congressional districts away from partisan lawmakers to increase fairness and competition. Newsom has suggested undoing this reform to gerrymander districts for Democrats as a countermeasure to Republican efforts in states like Texas. The author contends that while fighting partisan power grabs is important, it should not come at the cost of overriding a clear voter mandate and further eroding public faith in democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>State officials have warned that damage claims from the recent Eaton wildfire could completely exhaust California's $21-billion fund, which was created to shield utilities from bankruptcy. Investigators are determining if Southern California Edison's equipment sparked the fire that killed 19 people and destroyed 9,000 homes. If the utility is found liable, the resulting claims could be substantial enough to wipe out the entire fund, according to a draft report. Concerns are also being raised that Edison has little incentive to control settlement costs, as the fund, not the company, would cover the payments, prompting discussions about legislative reforms.

The article highlights recent cases where the court lifted lower court injunctions—allowing deportations to a third country and the firing of federal employees—without any written opinion from the majority. This practice, the author contends, ignores legal precedent for deferring to lower courts and creates the impression that the justices are exercising raw power.</p>
