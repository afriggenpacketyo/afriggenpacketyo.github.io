          <p>A 19-year-old British woman, Bella Culley, has told a court in Tbilisi, Georgia, that she was tortured and coerced into smuggling drugs.

During a pre-trial hearing where she was denied bail, she pleaded not guilty and claimed she was threatened with a hot iron, showing the judge a scar on her wrist as evidence of her ordeal.</p>
