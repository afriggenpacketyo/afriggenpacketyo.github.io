          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating a massive spending and tax bill central to President Trump's second-term agenda, aiming for a vote before the July 4th holiday. The legislation, which narrowly passed the House, includes increased funding for border security and defense offset by cuts to social programs. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, fueling intense debate and procedural delays from Democrats. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to advance the bill with a simple majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to buy TikTok, with an announcement possible within two weeks. The statement comes as the deadline for Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations approaches, following a 2024 law passed due to national security concerns. Trump, who previously extended the divestiture deadline, has expressed a desire to keep the popular social media platform operational under new, American ownership. Any potential sale would likely require approval from the Chinese government in Beijing.</p>

SÃ¶der's call for a major military expansion also includes hundreds of new tanks, fighter jets, and cruise missiles, emphasizing the need for Germany to achieve deterrence capabilities.

The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Barry is expected to weaken as it moves inland but will continue to bring significant rainfall. Forecasters have warned of potential flooding and mudslides, with predictions of three to six inches of rain, and isolated totals up to ten inches, across several Mexican states.

          <p>A detailed report from the eastern German city of Dessau highlights a troubling trend of right-wing extremism becoming "cool" and part of pop culture among young people. Nazi symbols and slogans are increasingly common, with some youths glorifying Hitler and chanting xenophobic phrases at parties. The article connects this phenomenon to the region's economic struggles post-reunification and a history of racially motivated violence, despite significant investment and cultural initiatives. The rise of the far-right AfD party, whose local mayor has a neo-Nazi past, underscores the mainstreaming of these extremist views.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity shrank for the third straight month in June, with the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) at 49.7, just below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from expansion. While production and new orders showed slight improvement, factory employment and inventory levels continued to decline, signaling persistent economic weakness. The data reflects ongoing challenges for Chinese manufacturers, including sluggish consumer demand and a protracted price war, despite government stimulus efforts.

The blockades followed a massive rally the previous night, where an estimated 140,000 people gathered, and were a response to the arrest of numerous protesters. The ongoing anti-government movement was initially sparked by a deadly train station roof collapse in November 2024, which activists have blamed on government corruption and negligence.

The author posits that Russia's costly and protracted war in Ukraine has drained its military and financial resources, crippling its ability to project power and support its allies. Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, Moscow offered only platitudes and mediation proposals instead of concrete military or diplomatic aid. This pattern of neglect, according to the article, shows that Russia's credibility as a reliable international partner is rapidly declining.</p>

          <p>The arrest of two elementary school teachers in Japan for allegedly taking and sharing voyeuristic photos of young girls has raised serious concerns about child safety in schools. The teachers are accused of posting the images, some reportedly taken with a school camera, to a private social media group that included other educators. The case came to light during a separate investigation into another teacher in the group, prompting calls for better safety measures. The incident has led to the implementation of a new system to check job applicants at schools for prior sexual offenses.</p>

          <p>Two people were killed in a street racing accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Montgomery County early Sunday morning.

A third vehicle, not involved in the race, then crashed into the wreckage, resulting in minor injuries to its two occupants. The incident led to a significant closure of the turnpike's eastbound lanes as authorities launched an investigation into the fatal crash.</p>

          <h2>Study Explores Why Electric Vehicles May Be More Likely to Induce Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and new research suggests why. Studies indicate that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, can be a primary cause. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, results in a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness and discomfort in passengers. Researchers are now exploring solutions, such as emitting specific tones, to counteract the physical sensations that lead to this modern form of travel sickness.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came just hours after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenger against him. The rift emerged from Tillis's opposition to the president's "big, beautiful bill," a massive spending package, with the senator citing devastating Medicaid cuts for his state. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented that bipartisan and independent-thinking leaders are becoming an "endangered species" in Washington. His departure will open up a key Senate seat in a politically important state.</p>

          <p>An attorney for the family of Oscar Omar Hernandez, a 13-year-old boy allegedly murdered by his soccer coach, has revealed the cause of death was acute alcohol poisoning. The finding adds a new layer to the case against coach Mario Edgardo Garcia Aquino, who is charged with murder with special circumstances. The boy was found dead in a ditch in April after visiting the coach's home, and it was later revealed the coach had been the subject of two prior investigations into misconduct with children. The new information raises further questions about the events that led to the seventh-grader's tragic death.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for the peak of a four-day heatwave, with temperatures forecast to reach 34Â°C (93Â°F) in parts of central and eastern England on Monday. The Met Office noted that such high temperatures in June have only been exceeded three times since 1960. An amber heat-health alert remains in effect for five regions, signaling likely impacts on the health service and potential travel delays. The London Fire Brigade has also warned of a "severe" risk of wildfires due to the heat and recent low rainfall, urging the public to take precautions.</p>

          <p>The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has assessed that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" but did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities. His comments contradict more definitive statements from U.S. officials, aligning more closely with a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that the strikes only set back the program by months. Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological knowledge to restart its activities and stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to sites. He warned that a military solution alone cannot definitively resolve the nuclear issue.</p>

          <p>Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Tomos Williams has been forced to withdraw from the team's tour of Australia due to a hamstring injury. Williams sustained the injury after scoring a try in the Lions' victory over Western Force on Saturday. In his place, Scotland's Ben White has been called up to join the squad. The departure of Williams, who was named Premiership player-of-the-season, is a significant blow to the touring side and leaves just one Welsh player, flanker Jac Morgan, remaining in the 38-man squad.</p>

          <p>The UK's public inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic has turned its focus to the devastating impact on the social care sector, a moment long awaited by bereaved families. The inquiry will investigate key decisions, including the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes without testing in early 2020, which is blamed for seeding the virus among vulnerable residents. It will also examine issues like staff shortages, lack of protective equipment, and controversial "do not resuscitate" orders. Nearly 46,000 care home residents died with Covid in England and Wales, a failure that families and staff hope the inquiry will fully investigate.</p>

The event has been officially banned by authorities since 2015, with this year's ban citing the need to protect "social peace, family structure, and moral values." Despite a heavy police presence, activists attempted to gather with rainbow flags, leading to clashes. The crackdown reflects an increasingly harsh stance against the LGBTQ+ community under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government human rights groups say is fostering a hostile and discriminatory environment.</p>
