        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator found that a fire at an electrical substation, which caused a major shutdown at Heathrow Airport, was likely due to moisture issues first identified seven years prior. The failure at the North Hyde substation disrupted power to the UK's largest airport, leading to thousands of flight cancellations and affecting approximately 270,000 travelers. Heathrow Airport criticized National Grid for its failure to maintain infrastructure and cited outdated regulations as contributing factors. The incident highlights significant vulnerabilities in critical national infrastructure due to unaddressed maintenance problems.</p>

          <p>The first day of NBA free agency saw significant shifts, with center Myles Turner agreeing to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from an Achilles tendon rupture and will likely miss most of the upcoming season. Other major deals included Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's record-setting $285 million extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Duncan Robinson signing with the Detroit Pistons. These moves signal major roster realignments for several key teams ahead of the new season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new version of a major US policy bill passed by the Senate proposes to increase tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing from 25% to 35%. This measure aims to incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to expand advanced chip production within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS Act. The legislation, which still needs House approval, is part of a broader effort to onshore critical supply chains and reduce reliance on Asia. Analysts suggest the combination of increased tax credits and potential tariffs creates a strong financial motivation for chipmakers to accelerate their US-based projects. (not investment advice)</p>

This development comes ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, negotiations remain complex, with Israel insisting on the dismantling of Hamas and Hamas demanding a permanent truce and full withdrawal of Israeli forces.</p>

          <p>China is strategically increasing its investments in African copper mining, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and now Botswana, to secure supplies for its green energy transition. As Western nations, like Canada, restrict Chinese access to critical minerals, Africa has become an essential source for copper, which is vital for electric vehicles and solar power systems. Chinese firms are making significant investments, such as JCHX Mining's plan to invest $800 million in a Zambian mine.

Downing Street scrambled to manage the dissent but ultimately had to concede, weakening the Prime Minister's authority and leaving his policy agenda in disarray.

          <p>The G7 has agreed to a deal that effectively exempts U.S. multinational corporations from a previously agreed-upon global minimum tax framework. This decision, criticized by the article's authors, is seen as undermining the OECD's Pillar Two agreement, which was designed to ensure large companies pay a minimum tax rate of 15% and to halt a global "race to the bottom" on corporate taxes. The authors argue this move prioritizes corporate interests over public welfare, creates an unfair advantage for U.S. firms, and weakens global tax justice efforts at a time when public funds are desperately needed.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of Michael Sockwell, a Black man sentenced to death, by systematically excluding Black individuals from his jury. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals found a pattern of discriminatory intent in the jury selection process for his 1990 trial. Sockwell was convicted for a 1988 murder, and although the jury recommended a life sentence, the judge overrode their decision to impose the death penalty, a practice no longer permitted in the state. This ruling makes Sockwell eligible for a retrial.</p>

This dynamic leaves Brussels in a difficult position, attempting to rebalance the relationship to better serve European interests. The article suggests that significant divisions persist, and the EU faces challenging negotiations on multiple fronts, including with the United States on trade issues.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on Japanese imports to "30% or 35%" if a new trade agreement is not finalized before a July 9 deadline.

The President expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo would be reached, while Japanese officials stated they would not make concessions that could harm the country's agricultural sector.

The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner.

This shift is aimed at better competing with rival TSMC for major clients like Apple and Nvidia.
