          <p>Scholar Zheng Yongnian expresses concern over "intellectual colonialism" in the age of artificial intelligence, arguing that China's social sciences are overly reliant on Western theories. He contends that these Western-based systems fail to adequately explain non-Western civilizations like China's. To build a better AI and maintain its cultural identity, Zheng advocates for China to develop its own knowledge system rooted in its unique secular civilization. This approach, he believes, would allow China to play a more authentic and proper role in the international order.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Salt Lake City, Utah, have arrested two men, aged 58 and 31, on suspicion of planting an incendiary device under a news media vehicle. The bomb had been lit but failed to detonate as intended, preventing any injuries or damage. A subsequent search of a residence linked to the suspects uncovered additional explosives, firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction. A motive for the attempted attack has not yet been established by investigators, and the relationship between the two men remains unclear.</p>

          <p>A relative of the transgender roommate of Tyler Robinson, the man accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, has claimed the roommate harbors a strong dislike for conservatives and Christians. The relative, who remained anonymous, stated that the 22-year-old roommate was in a romantic relationship with Robinson and may have influenced his political views. However, an FBI official noted that the roommate has been "extremely cooperative" with the investigation and reportedly had no knowledge of Robinson's alleged plans. Robinson's father was the one who identified him from surveillance footage and reported him to authorities.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide in April, has stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States. Their criticism follows Mandelson's dismissal after emails revealed he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced jail time for sex offenses. A UK government official acknowledged that had the full extent of Mandelson's relationship with Epstein been known, his appointment would have been "highly unlikely." The family is calling for greater accountability for those associated with Epstein to prevent future abuse.</p>

          <p>The percentage of U.S. drivers who are "underwater" on their auto loans, meaning they owe more than their car is worth, has reached a four-year high. According to data from Edmunds, 26.6% of new car trade-ins in the second quarter of 2025 had negative equity, with the average amount owed being a substantial $6,754. This trend is exacerbated by longer loan terms, such as 84-month financing, which consumers use to lower monthly payments but which can increase the risk of negative equity. Experts advise consumers to research financing options and consider gap insurance if they need to buy a new car while in this situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has documented a devastating rise in maternal and infant mortality in Afghanistan following the Trump administration's decision to cut nearly all U.S. aid. The funding withdrawal led to the closure of over 400 medical facilities, including a critical clinic in Badakhshan province where a woman named Shahnaz and her newborn baby died after being unable to receive care. The report highlights multiple firsthand accounts of similar tragedies, directly contradicting U.S. claims that no one has died due to the aid cuts. The crisis is compounded by the Taliban's severe restrictions on women's education, which has halted the training of new midwives and female nurses.</p>

          <p>The rapid adoption of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is creating concern among traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are seen as a direct competitor, diverting transactions that would otherwise generate revenue for card issuers. A significant issue for lenders is that BNPL usage often isn't reported to credit bureaus, creating a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of visibility makes it difficult for traditional financial institutions to accurately assess a borrower's total debt and credit risk. (not investment advice)</p>

Farmers and industry groups express frustration over the politically motivated tariffs, which have caused market prices to spiral downward.

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware identified the internet as a primary driver of extremism in the United States. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Coons stated that while he strongly disagreed with Kirk's political views, the activist "should not have paid with his life for the opportunity to speak out." He described the internet as an "accelerant" that hardens political divisions and called for leaders from both parties to reject political violence. Coons also advocated for passing bipartisan legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act to mitigate some of the internet's harmful effects.</p>

          <p>Bobby Hart, one half of the prolific songwriting duo Boyce and Hart that crafted some of the biggest hits for The Monkees, has passed away at the age of 86. Alongside his partner Tommy Boyce, Hart wrote iconic 1960s songs including the band's debut single "Last Train to Clarksville," "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone," and the group's catchy theme song. The duo also served as producers, helping to create the signature sound for the made-for-television pop group. Hart's work was covered by a wide range of artists, and he later received an Oscar nomination for his work on the film "Tender Mercies."</p>

          <p>The small Idaho town of Stanley, which narrowly avoided being destroyed by two major wildfires in 2024, serves as a case study for the increasing threat fires pose to communities across the American West. Heroic firefighting efforts and favorable weather shifts were all that saved the tourist town from the Bench Lake and Wapiti fires during an "unprecedented" fire season. The incident underscores the vulnerability of communities as climate change contributes to hotter, drier conditions that fuel larger and more intense blazes. The town's survival highlights the precarious balance between human settlement and the growing risk of catastrophic wildfires.</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan government has accused the United States of a "direct provocation" after alleging that a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Jason Dunham, illegally seized a Venezuelan fishing boat. According to the statement from Caracas, the incident occurred Friday in Venezuela's exclusive economic zone, where armed U.S. agents allegedly boarded and occupied the vessel for eight hours. Venezuela claims the action is part of a U.S. effort to justify escalating military tensions in the region. The accusation comes amid heightened strain between the two nations, as the U.S. military conducts anti-drug cartel patrols in the Caribbean.</p>

Seville, who is coached by Bolt's former mentor Glen Mills, ran a personal best of 9.77 seconds to lead a Jamaican one-two finish with Kishane Thompson taking silver. The win fulfills the long-held expectations placed on the 24-year-old and suggests a resurgence for Jamaica in an event recently dominated by the United States.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his NFL earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. Instead of spending his salary, Barkley lives off his endorsement deals and has invested in companies like AI firm Anthropic and Elon Musk's Neuralink, as well as Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. This strategy was partly inspired by a serious injury in 2020, which reminded him of the finite length of an NFL career. His approach focuses on building long-term generational wealth by placing his earnings into both traditional index funds and higher-risk, high-reward tech ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

Athletic director Martin Jarmond stated the move was necessary to signal that the program's performance was unacceptable, especially as it enters the competitive Big Ten conference.
