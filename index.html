          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, convicted of murdering her children, presented her closing argument in an Arizona trial where she's accused of conspiring to kill her fourth husband. Daybell claims her brother acted in self-defense when he shot her husband, Charles Vallow, while prosecutors argue it was a plot to obtain his life insurance and be with Chad Daybell. The prosecution emphasized text messages and religious beliefs as motives, while Daybell defended her actions, urging jurors to review her police interview. The jury is currently deliberating the verdict after the state presented evidence suggesting the shooting was premeditated, and the defense argued it was a tragic event.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the lawsuit was initiated after an initial $2.2 billion funding freeze and signals of suspending an additional $1 billion, which Harvard claims is part of a pressure campaign to control its academic programs. The university alleges that the administration violated its constitutional rights and jeopardizes critical research, while the Trump administration has not yet responded to the request for comment. The suit claims the funding halt will impede critical scientific and medical research as well as diminish economic innovation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that providing trials for everyone the US wants to deport would take an unrealistic 200 years. This statement follows increased deportations of Venezuelan migrants, many without criminal records, and comes after lawyers argued that the administration was deporting migrants without due process under a 1798 law. The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, stipulating that detainees must be given due process to challenge their removal. The American Civil Liberties Union had urged the Supreme Court to intervene.</p>

The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US. Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax. It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.</p>

Critics argue this action comes at a particularly difficult time for borrowers facing economic uncertainty. The Education Department said that, later this summer, it will begin the process of garnishing wages—meaning payments would be automatically deducted from borrowers' paychecks.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, is transitioning to a new role at the Pentagon following a series of staffing changes. The move comes after multiple top Hegseth aides were fired amid a leak investigation ordered by Kasper. Hegseth shared information about airstrikes in Yemen in a Signal messaging app group chat that included his wife, brother, and personal attorney, raising concerns about security protocols. President Trump has publicly supported Hegseth, denying any dysfunction at the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses are facing significant challenges due to the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods, with the U.S. tariff rate now at 145%. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free, is putting additional pressure on these businesses. Many dropshippers source their products from China, and the tariffs are leading to decreased revenue and products being stopped at the border for inspection. Some are shifting their focus to the European market as a result. (not investment advice)</p>
