          <p>Burberry is set to reduce its workforce by approximately 1,700 roles globally as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy, aiming for £60 million in cost savings by 2027. This move, impacting about 20% of its overall headcount, follows previous cost-cutting measures and a decline in sales across all regions, especially in Asia-Pacific. Despite a difficult macroeconomic backdrop, CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future, focusing on timeless pieces and addressing geopolitical risks like potential tariff increases. Burberry shares experienced a notable increase following the announcement of these organizational changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Green Bay Packers star Clay Matthews delivered a humorous stunt at the NFL Draft, impersonating Donald Trump by reading a fake message declaring that the "Bears still suck!" The stunt, conceived to make his appearance memorable, involved Matthews' wife photoshopping Trump's letterhead onto the message. Matthews kept the plan secret from the NFL, anticipating disapproval due to the current political climate, but NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell found the joke amusing. Despite the success of the stunt, Matthews jokingly suggested he might not be invited back.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation by The Guardian US, Consumer Reports, and the Food & Environment Reporting Network reveals a pattern of Kroger stores overcharging customers through expired sale prices. The investigation found expired tags that resulted in overcharges in 14 of the 26 stores reviewed in Washington DC and 14 states, including Arizona, Michigan, Oregon, Virginia and Ohio. The tests in March, April and May identified more than 150 items with expired sale tags for which Kroger was charging more than the sale price – producing average overcharges of about $1.70 per item, an 18% markup over the discount price. Customers express frustration over the constant overcharges, with some feeling they are "going into battle" every time they shop. </p>

The author recalls how VOA and NPR helped him learn the American language and culture, and how VOA inspired a wealthy Somali man's desire to immigrate to America. He argues that the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle these institutions will diminish America's storytelling power and allow rival nations to gain influence. The author laments the potential loss of the American dream, which once compelled people worldwide to seek opportunity in the United States.</p>
