        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee has issued a warning that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), responsible for the U.S. nuclear stockpile, is facing severe staff reductions. As the government shutdown persists, the agency's carry-over funding is nearly depleted, which could necessitate placing approximately 80% of its employees on furlough. This development raises significant national security concerns, as these employees manage critical strategic assets. The Department of Energy has also indicated that tens of thousands of contractors working with the agency could be cut if the funding lapse is not resolved soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates a significant drop in public approval of President Trump's handling of the economy, reaching the lowest point of his two terms. His net economic approval rating now stands at -13, with 42% approving and 55% disapproving, a downturn attributed to the ongoing government shutdown and persistent inflation. The survey reveals that a majority of the public blames the president and congressional Republicans for the potential economic fallout from the shutdown. Furthermore, only 34% of respondents approve of his policies on inflation and the cost of living, reflecting widespread economic anxiety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A landmark global agreement aimed at cutting carbon emissions from the shipping industry has been abandoned following successful opposition from the United States and Saudi Arabia. The deal, which would have established the first internationally mandated emissions targets for a global industry, was derailed when Saudi Arabia passed a motion to adjourn the talks for a year. The Trump administration had labeled the plan a "green scam" and reportedly threatened other nations with tariffs if they supported it. The collapse of the talks has disappointed industry bodies and climate advocates, who now face renegotiating the entire framework.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Donald Trump's first administration, has pleaded not guilty to 18 federal charges related to the mishandling of classified documents. The indictment accuses Bolton of illegally sharing and retaining sensitive national defense information, including top-secret materials, by transmitting diary-like entries to relatives and using personal email. Bolton, who has become a prominent critic of Trump, has framed the charges as the latest instance of the Justice Department being weaponized against the president's political opponents. His case follows recent indictments of other high-profile figures who have drawn Trump's ire.</p>

          <p>Beijing has warned the United Kingdom of unspecified "consequences" following a second delay in the decision to approve its application for a new, large-scale embassy in London. China's foreign ministry accused the UK of politicizing the matter and going against its commitments to improve bilateral relations. The proposed complex near the Tower of London has faced opposition due to its size and security implications, with concerns that it could be used to intercept sensitive financial data. The UK government has pushed the final decision to December, stating it needs more information from the Foreign and Home Offices.</p>

          <p>After maintaining a presence for over 60 years, CBS News is closing its workspace inside the Pentagon, joining most major news organizations in refusing to sign a new press agreement. The new policy, which reporters' associations argue could infringe on First Amendment rights, requires journalists to get formal authorization before publishing certain unclassified information. This departure marks the end of an era of on-the-ground reporting from within the building, which journalists say was crucial for building trust and breaking major national security stories. The Pentagon states the new rules are intended to prevent leaks and control narratives about the military.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown extends into its third week, Democratic lawmakers say a primary obstacle to resolution is their profound distrust of President Donald Trump. In past standoffs, bipartisan groups known as "gangs" have formed to break legislative deadlocks, but no such coalitions have emerged this time. Democrats express concern that the president could undermine any agreement reached with Republican legislators, as he has done previously. They are demanding an "ironclad path forward" on key issues, such as extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, before they will agree to reopen the government, reflecting a deep-seated belief that Republicans cannot be trusted on a handshake deal.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor found herself in a surreal situation while reporting on the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski. The investigation led her back to her small Pennsylvania hometown and to Heather Snyder, Shymanski's ex-wife and the reporter's former high school classmate. Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was the prime suspect and was later convicted of the murder, though Snyder herself was never charged. In an exclusive interview, Snyder addressed suspicions from the victim's family and her decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment at trial, stating she had no involvement in her ex-husband's death.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with delinquent credit card debt, wage garnishment represents a severe consequence where a creditor can legally take a portion of one's earnings. Federal law limits this amount to the lesser of either 25% of disposable income or the amount by which weekly earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage. However, state laws can offer greater protections, with some prohibiting wage garnishment for unsecured debts entirely. This article outlines these rules and explores proactive strategies to avoid garnishment, such as negotiating settlements with creditors, working with debt relief companies, or, as a last resort, considering bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>At its recent meeting in Washington, the International Monetary Fund issued a stark warning about growing risks to the global economy, despite its current stability. The IMF's Global Financial Stability Report highlighted concerns over overstretched tech stock valuations, government bond market volatility, and significant dangers within the burgeoning private credit sector. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva expressed particular anxiety about these less-regulated "shadow banks," which could trigger global chaos if loans begin to fail. The report cautioned that banks in the U.S. and Europe have a combined $4.5 trillion exposure to these non-bank financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors successfully argued that a wealth of circumstantial evidence, including a heated argument overheard by a neighbor on the night she vanished, pointed to his guilt.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has halted funding for two major New York infrastructure projects, the Gateway rail tunnel and the Second Avenue Subway extension, in what appears to be a move to pressure Democratic leaders. The White House is using an onerous new regulatory review process concerning diversity mandates for contractors, applying the rules retroactively to work that has already begun. This stance threatens to shut down not only these critical projects but potentially all federally subsidized transportation initiatives nationwide. The move is seen as ironic for a president who campaigned on cutting red tape and once gained fame for efficiently rebuilding a city project.</p>

The 38-year-old Ukrainian fighter, who most recently stopped Daniel Dubois in July, intends to return to the ring in 2026 after recovering from a back injury. While his next opponent is still under negotiation, Usyk has definitively ruled out a future bout with rising British heavyweight Moses Itauma. After his fighting career, Usyk plans to open a sports academy to train the next generation of athletes.</p>

Having failed to win in his first seven games, Postecoglou addressed the pressure by recounting his successful tenure at Tottenham, where he won the Europa League, the club's first trophy in 17 years. He argued that perceptions of him are skewed and asserted that, if given time, he will achieve his consistent record of winning silverware.
