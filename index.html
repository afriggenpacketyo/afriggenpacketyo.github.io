          <p>The Chinese central government is escalating its involvement in a lead poisoning case at a kindergarten in Gansu province. A high-level task force from the State Council will join provincial leaders to investigate after local tests failed to identify the issue. The kindergarten is suspected of using inedible paint in food, and eight individuals, including the principal, have been detained. This national-level response highlights the severity of the food safety scandal and the government's effort to address public concern.</p>

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a notable shift towards religious conservatism, challenging the current government of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, which includes the conservative Islamic Party (PAS), has gained significant electoral ground, particularly among younger Malay voters. This "green wave" is pushing for policies like stricter dress codes and Islamic criminal law in states it governs. Analysts debate whether this is genuine religious conviction or a political tool, but it reflects a growing societal trend that could reshape the nation's multi-ethnic fabric.</p>

          <p>A UK government-backed report warns that antisemitism has become normalized in middle-class British society, particularly within the NHS, universities, and the arts. Other top stories include ongoing negotiations for a migrant return deal with Iraq and criticism of a similar deal with France. The papers also cover government plans for new grants to boost electric vehicle adoption.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several companies, including UK-based Better Dairy, are using precision fermentation to create cheese without cows, aiming for a taste and texture comparable to the real thing. The process involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats. While the technology shows promise, these startups face significant challenges, including high initial costs, regulatory approval for "novel foods," and a recent decline in consumer demand for plant-based alternatives. The industry hopes to overcome these obstacles and launch products within the next few years.</p>

          <p>Britain's historic steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are grappling with a severe industry decline exacerbated by high energy costs and uncertainty over US trade policy. The potential for continued 25% tariffs on UK steel exports to the US is costing orders and fraying nerves in communities already hit by thousands of job losses from plant closures. While some former workers have found new careers, many face lower pay and an uncertain future. The article explores whether these towns can pivot to new industries or if government intervention can revive a greener version of their foundational trade. (not investment advice)</p>

Speculation arose following reports of a rift between the FBI and the Department of Justice over the decision to not release further files on Jeffrey Epstein.

In a social media post, Patel affirmed his commitment to serving as director, calling the resignation rumors and conspiracy theories untrue.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted access to the massive Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, which is a vital source of the world's coltan and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. Thousands of miners work daily at the site, which the rebels claim they have secured and organized, though a UN report alleges the M23 profits heavily from taxing the mineral trade. The visit comes after a US-brokered ceasefire deal between DR Congo and Rwanda, which some analysts believe is linked to American interest in the region's vast mineral resources. The future of the mine and its workers remains uncertain amid complex peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>After years of declining viewership, the reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, largely driven by its presence on TikTok.

This shift allows viewers to keep up with the show's discourse without committing to nightly hour-long episodes.

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas killed at least 129 people over a holiday weekend, with dozens still missing. The disaster, which devastated a Christian summer camp, was caused by a massive, slow-moving weather system that dumped extreme rainfall on flood-prone terrain. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness of their emergency warnings and evacuation orders, with some survivors saying they received no alert. The tragedy has prompted a massive search and recovery effort and a debate over the need for more robust, state-funded flood warning systems.</p>
