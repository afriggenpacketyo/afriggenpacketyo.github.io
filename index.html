          <p>President Trump has granted a further 90-day extension for TikTok's sale in the US, following a law passed last year requiring the app to be banned unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, due to national security concerns. Trump, who had vowed to save TikTok during his presidential campaign, signed an executive order delaying the enforcement date for the third time, with the new deadline set for September 17. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's leadership and support in keeping the app online for its 170 million US users, indicating ongoing collaboration with Vice President Vance's Office to finalize the sale agreement, which is expected to require approval from Beijing authorities. The White House emphasized that the extension would ensure the continued use of TikTok by Americans while safeguarding their data.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, after rapidly intensifying, made landfall on Mexico's Pacific Coast in Oaxaca as a Category 3 storm, bringing sustained winds of 125 mph and heavy rain. The storm had briefly reached Category 4 status before being downgraded, and it is the first Pacific Category 3 hurricane on record to make landfall over Mexico in June. President Claudia Sheinbaum reported damage mainly to the coast of Oaxaca and the Costa Chica of Guerrero, with a hospital affected by flooding and reports of landslides and stranded vehicles. Erick is expected to produce heavy rainfall across southeastern Guerrero and west-coastal Oaxaca, potentially triggering life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, as the storm weakens over land.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not fund the appeal of President Trump's $83 million defamation case brought by columnist E. Jean Carroll. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers represent him in the appeal, which stems from his denial of Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s. DOJ lawyers had argued that Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, justifying government-funded defense, however, the court denied this request. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24, and this decision follows a previous denial of Trump's request to rehear his challenge to a $5 million civil judgment awarded to Carroll in 2023.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a high-profile Massachusetts retrial; however, she was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The jury reached this verdict on their fourth day of deliberations, following a first trial that ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury. Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and leaving him to die, but her defense argued that she was framed by a group of people, including law enforcement. The timeline of events included a night of drinking, a strained relationship between Read and O'Keefe, and conflicting evidence regarding a Google search about how long it takes to die in the cold.</p>

The agents' operation and whether arrests were made remain unclear, prompting speculation on social media, though the agents declined to comment. The parking lot, owned by Frank McCourt, is considered Dodgers property, and the team requested police intervention after protesters arrived. The Dodgers, facing pressure to support immigrants, announced plans to assist affected communities, and singer Nezza protested immigration raids by singing the national anthem in Spanish at Dodger Stadium, despite a team employee's request to sing in English.</p>

          <p>The principal of Dundee University and two senior members of its governing body have resigned following a report revealing a £22m government bailout due to financial mismanagement. The independent report cited poor financial judgment and weak governance, leading to overspending and failure to address a worsening crisis. The report noted that almost £40m of ringfenced money had been spent elsewhere and there was a lack of action to address an £8m shortfall from a decline in international student recruitment. Former principal Prof Iain Gillespie was criticized for an "overbearing leadership style" and resisting difficult conversations, while the current principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, also stepped down.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of military action against Iran's Fordo nuclear site, viewing its disablement as necessary due to the risk of rapid weapons production, according to multiple sources. While attack plans have been approved, Trump has not made a final decision, awaiting potential negotiations with Iran within the next two weeks. He is considering the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs and the possibility of Iran disabling Fordo independently. Diplomatic efforts are underway, with the U.K. and other nations seeking a deal with Iran, even as intelligence reports suggest Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons, a claim disputed by some intelligence officials.</p>

          <p>Social Security is now projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, a year earlier than previously estimated, potentially leading to a 20% reduction in monthly benefits. The Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report attributes this change partly to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. If the trust funds are depleted, beneficiaries could face benefit cuts ranging from 19% to 23%, significantly impacting the average retiree's monthly income. Experts suggest that Congress needs to act quickly to address the program's finances, either by raising revenue, such as lifting the income cap, or by cutting benefits, with some lawmakers proposing an increase in the retirement age.</p>

          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" offers a unique take on the war film genre, focusing on the existential uncertainties and dazed souls amidst the American Civil War. The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army during the winter of 1862, emphasizing the minutiae of their daily lives rather than intense combat. Minervini's naturalistic style and close collaboration with the cast create a sense of place and time, highlighting the characters' inner thoughts and rudimentary musings about God, war, and manhood. By avoiding typical anti-war tropes, the film subtly explores the economic inequalities, senseless brutality, and thwarted masculinity that continue to plague the nation.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at William & Mary University in Virginia have unearthed a secret cellar beneath the Williamsburg Bray School, the oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children. The cellar contained artifacts like slate pencil fragments and jewelry, offering new insights into the lives of enslaved students who were taught at the school in the 1760s. The school, which used a religious framework to justify slavery, was later transformed into a dormitory for some of the first women to attend college. Other finds included handmade ceramics associated with sites of enslavement and a shard of glass depicting Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom.</p>

Magic Johnson praised the deal, noting Walter's commitment to the Lakers' legacy of winning. NBA valuations have skyrocketed since the league completed its recent media rights agreement, and the Lakers finished the 2025 season as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are increasing the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, leading homeowners to reconsider their plans. Suppliers of lumber, steel, and aluminum have already raised prices for builders, with the National Association of Home Builders estimating a typical price increase of around $10,000 per project. Strategies to save money include pre-ordering materials before prices rise, focusing on paint jobs instead of new appliances, and budgeting an additional 30% for tariff-related costs. Builders also advise homeowners to prioritize fixing exterior damage and working with suppliers to lock in prices when possible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Public pools are essential for mental, physical, and social health, providing a space for exercise, relaxation, and community engagement. Swimming has been shown to boost moods and offer a unique sense of buoyancy and embrace, but many public pools have become neglected and underfunded due to racial tensions and the rise of private pools. Historical perspectives highlight the role of pools as recreational hot spots and social hubs, but desegregation led to the decline of public pools as some retreated to private clubs. Revitalizing public pools could address health disparities, promote community unity, and offer a vital resource for all, especially during hot summers.</p>

Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies stated the ban aims to reduce plastic and microplastic pollution, encouraging the shift towards reusable and non-plastic products.

He downplays the potential for internal unrest, suggesting that only a small percentage of Iranians would actively oppose the regime. However, independent surveys conducted before the current war indicate that a majority of Iranians oppose the cleric-led government.

The UK, along with G7 allies, has called for de-escalation, while Israel reportedly did not inform the UK in advance of its attack on Iran, viewing it as an unreliable partner. The UK's diplomatic role includes joining European allies in talks with Iran, and its military and strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, such as Diego Garcia and RAF Akrotiri, could be involved. However, the Attorney General has advised that any UK military involvement needs to be purely defensive to remain within the law.</p>
