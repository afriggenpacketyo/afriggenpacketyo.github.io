        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's suggestion to delay auto tariffs to allow automakers time to increase U.S. production faces significant challenges. A 25% auto parts tariff is set to take effect, raising vehicle costs even if assembled in the U.S. Relocating production lines requires years of planning, construction, infrastructure development, and establishing a parts supply chain, making quick shifts difficult. The fastest way to increase U.S. production involves utilizing existing facilities with established supply chains, while constructing new assembly plants can take years and billions of dollars.

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault retrial has commenced in New York, with prosecutors accusing him of exploiting his Hollywood influence to sexually harass and abuse women. The retrial centers on allegations from actress Jessica Mann, former TV production assistant Miriam Haley, and former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein's attorney argued that the women had consensual relationships with him and are motivated by money and fame. Weinstein's previous conviction was overturned due to the inclusion of testimony from women regarding uncharged conduct. He has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 100 women.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has criticized Volodymyr Zelensky for making inflammatory statements that harm peace negotiations with Russia. Trump's comments follow Vice President Vance's warning that the U.S. might withdraw from the peace process if an agreement isn't reached. The U.S. proposal reportedly involves recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, a condition Zelensky has rejected. Meanwhile, Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine after a brief Easter lull.</p>
