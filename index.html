          <p>Russia and Belarus have commenced major joint military exercises, showcasing advanced firepower including aircraft, tanks, and various drone systems. The drills, taking place in Belarus and Russian territories, occur amid heightened regional tensions following a significant incursion of Russian drones into NATO member Poland's airspace. While Moscow frames the exercises as defensive, the maneuvers have put NATO on high alert, with neighboring countries increasing their military readiness and closing borders. The war games are notably smaller than in previous years due to Russia's ongoing conflict in Ukraine but may include demonstrations of nuclear-capable weapons.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is executing a disciplined sale of 35 shares of Broadcom, reducing its portfolio weighting in the high-performing stock. This decision is not a reflection of diminished confidence in the company's future, particularly its accelerating AI-related revenues, but rather a strategic move to rebalance the portfolio after the stock's value surged. The article notes that Broadcom shares have gained approximately 55% year-to-date, with a significant 17% increase following a recent earnings report and news of a major new AI chip customer. The sale will realize a substantial gain on shares purchased in the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Christian Brueckner, the primary suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has refused to be interviewed by British police days before his scheduled release from a German prison. Brueckner is completing a seven-year sentence for a separate sexual assault conviction that occurred in the same region of Portugal where McCann vanished. Although he remains under investigation for the McCann case, he has never been charged and maintains his innocence. German prosecutors are seeking supervisory oversight measures, such as an ankle monitor and travel restrictions, to monitor Brueckner upon his release, a decision pending court approval.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a deal has been finalized with China to prevent a U.S. ban of the social media app TikTok. The announcement comes ahead of a September 17 deadline for the app's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a shutdown over national security concerns. In a social media post, Trump alluded to saving a company popular with young people and mentioned a planned conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. For months, the administration has sought a resolution that would give the U.S. more autonomy over the app's operations, with several American companies and investors previously expressing interest in an acquisition.</p>

          <p>Beijing has issued a stern warning of retaliation if the United States imposes sanctions on China over its energy and economic cooperation with Russia. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry described potential U.S. actions as "unilateral bullying and economic coercion," asserting that China's trade with Russia is legitimate and should not be subject to external interference. The statement emphasized that China will take firm measures to protect its national interests and sovereignty.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City secured a decisive 3-0 victory over Manchester United by tactically exploiting weaknesses in United's defensive system. City manager Pep Guardiola focused attacks down the left flank, using clever player positioning to create a numerical advantage in the midfield and disrupt United's pressing scheme. This strategy left United's defenders in difficult situations, unable to effectively mark players like Jérémy Doku, who provided the assist for the opening goal. The analysis suggests United's struggles stemmed from systemic issues rather than just individual errors, highlighting a failure to adapt to City's strategic overloads and pinning tactics.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares, marking his first significant open-market acquisition of the stock since early 2020. The move was interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer, leading to an immediate surge of over 7% in Tesla's stock price during premarket trading. This substantial insider purchase comes at a time when the company has faced challenges, including declining sales and analyst concerns over brand perception. The action is seen by some experts as Musk reaffirming his commitment to Tesla's long-term strategy, particularly its pivot towards artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports to encourage a greater focus on long-term strategy. In a social media post, he argued the change, which would require SEC approval, would save money and allow corporate managers to prioritize sustainable growth over short-term results. This idea aligns with proposals previously advocated by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the pressure for quarterly guidance.

Trump characterized the change as "'Sissy' football," suggesting it is detrimental to both the sport and the country.

Issues such as government fragility, environmental degradation from mining, and inequitable revenue sharing mean African nations currently generate only about 40% of the potential income from mineral extraction.

          <p>Convenience stores are successfully capturing a growing share of the breakfast market from traditional fast-food chains. According to market research, morning traffic to food-focused convenience stores like Wawa and Casey's grew by 9% recently, while fast-food breakfast visits saw only a 1% increase. This trend is driven by convenience stores expanding their fresh, made-to-order food offerings, effectively adopting strategies from their quick-service rivals. As budget-conscious consumers look for value and variety, convenience stores are becoming a significant alternative, prompting fast-food giants like McDonald's to acknowledge the increased competition in this economically sensitive daypart.</p>

          <p>A firsthand account from the front lines in Kherson reveals the brutal effectiveness of Ukraine's drone warfare, which has been transformed into a competitive, gamified system. Small, agile drone units operate with lethal precision, using inexpensive, locally produced "suicide" drones to hunt Russian targets. Pilots earn points for confirmed kills of soldiers and equipment, which can be exchanged for better gear, creating a highly motivated and efficient force. This innovative approach has made these small teams some of the deadliest units in modern warfare, responsible for a disproportionately high number of Russian casualties while operating under constant threat of retaliatory drone strikes.</p>

          <p>The horror genre is experiencing a banner year at the box office, having already surpassed $1 billion in domestic revenue with successful films like "The Conjuring: Last Rites" and "Sinners." This success is notable not only for its financial performance in a struggling market but also for the critical acclaim many of these films have received, positioning them as potential awards contenders. Experts attribute this trend to the genre's low-budget, high-return model and a new wave of respected directors, many of whom transitioned from comedy. The article suggests that horror and comedy share a structural DNA in their use of timing and tension to elicit a physical audience reaction.</p>

The agreement, expected to be signed during President Trump's state visit, seeks to streamline regulatory approvals for new nuclear reactors in both countries, potentially halving the time required. One key project involves a deal for U.S. firm X-Energy and the UK's Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. The partnership is intended to bolster energy security, create thousands of jobs, and unlock billions in private investment, though critics raise concerns about the high costs and long timelines associated with nuclear power.</p>

A TransUnion survey found that 13% of renters now have their payments reported, a practice particularly beneficial for those who are "credit invisible" or have thin credit files. Enrolling in such services can lead to an average credit score increase of 60 points. However, experts advise consumers to carefully consider the costs, ensure the service reports to all three bureaus, and understand whether late payments are also reported, which could negatively impact their score.</p>

The nationwide effort, known as Predator Free 2050, heavily depends on a network of community volunteers, including students and homeowners, who set and monitor traps in local parks and their own backyards.
