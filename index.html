          <p>Robinhood announced second-quarter financial results that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it experienced substantial growth in its user base, with funded customers increasing by 2.3 million. This strong performance was driven by robust net deposits and higher valuations in equities and cryptocurrencies, alongside a 76% surge in subscribers to its premium Robinhood Gold service. The report reflects a period of major growth for the company, with its stock having rallied over 400% in the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's shares climbed after the company reported second-quarter earnings that beat revenue expectations and provided a strong forecast for the upcoming quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion, with net income rising 36% to $18.34 billion, largely driven by a significant beat in advertising revenue. The company also raised its capital expenditure outlook, signaling major investments in AI, including the hiring of Scale AI's CEO to co-lead its new Superintelligence Labs. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs division, overall user growth across its apps remained strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury has convicted dentist James Craig of first-degree murder for the 2023 poisoning death of his wife, Angela. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig, driven by greed and extramarital affairs, administered a lethal cocktail of arsenic and cyanide to his wife through her protein shakes. Key evidence included Craig's incriminating internet searches on undetectable poisons and the existence of $4 million in life insurance policies. Despite the defense suggesting suicide, the jury found him guilty on all counts, resulting in a mandatory sentence of life in prison. </p>

He also responded to scrutiny over his previous calls to defund the police, stating he is not currently running on that platform and acknowledging that a past social media post was out of step with his current views.

The walkout, the 12th since spring 2023, concluded after previous negotiations over pay and working conditions broke down. Streeting stated he is not willing to negotiate further on pay but will resume discussions on other issues like career progression and exam fees. He warned the union that the recent strike had squandered governmental goodwill, though the BMA expressed hope for a tangible settlement offer this time.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations and reinstated its full-year guidance, which now includes an estimated $2 billion net impact from tariffs. The automaker had previously suspended its outlook due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's auto tariffs. While total revenue for the quarter rose 5% to $50.2 billion, the company reported a net loss of $36 million, largely due to special charges from a vehicle recall. The company's commercial "Pro" business remains a growth engine, while its "Model e" electric vehicle division continues to post significant losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from SmartAsset has identified the ten most expensive metropolitan areas in the U.S. to purchase a home, with five of the top spots located in California. For the second consecutive year, San Jose leads the nation with a median home price exceeding $1.6 million. The analysis highlights how strong local economies, particularly in the tech sector, combined with high demand and limited housing supply, continue to drive up real estate costs. Other cities on the list include San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Honolulu, underscoring the significant affordability challenges facing homebuyers in these desirable markets.

          <p>The dating advice app Tea, designed to help women vet potential partners, suffered a massive data breach that exposed the sensitive personal information of its users. After gaining popularity on social media, the app became a target for angry men who organized online, leading to the leak of user photos, government IDs, and private messages. The leaked conversations included discussions of sexual assaults and other personal matters. While the app's premise of a female-centric safety network was appealing, the breach has highlighted its significant security flaws and validated the very safety concerns its users initially had.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.5% range, citing elevated economic uncertainty while noting solid labor market conditions.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the economy is in good shape but faces risks, including the potential inflationary impact of tariffs. This hold strategy defies persistent calls from President Donald Trump for aggressive rate cuts to stimulate the economy and lower borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite poor online reviews, its distinctive look has made it a popular filming location for television shows and music videos.

          <p>There is renewed hope in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murder case, where four teenage girls were killed, due to new DNA testing possibilities. A key piece of evidence, a male DNA profile found on one of the victims, had previously exonerated four initial suspects but remained unidentified for decades. Although a promising lead from a public DNA database in 2017 ultimately did not match, investigators believe that some of the original DNA sample still exists. Officials are now waiting for forensic science to advance further, hoping that future testing on the limited remaining evidence will finally identify the killer.</p>

This statement marks a shift from his more neutral stance during their recent meeting and aligns with the U.S. State Department's position. The comments come amid growing criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza from some of Trump's own prominent supporters and polling that shows declining American sympathy for Israel's offensive.

Sesko has become a more versatile player, contributing significantly to Leipzig's attack with 39 goals over the past two seasons. With Leipzig failing to qualify for European competition, an informal agreement may allow him to leave if a top club meets the asking price, setting the stage for a potential high-profile transfer.</p>

The move follows a similar action in May that targeted goods from China and Hong Kong, significantly impacting online retailers like Temu and Shein that relied on the provision to ship low-cost products directly to American consumers.
