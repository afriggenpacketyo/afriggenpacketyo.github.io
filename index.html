          <p>The Trump administration has deployed 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the deployment aims to address lawlessness, while California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, fearing it would escalate tensions. The protests began Friday evening, resulting in clashes between demonstrators and authorities. The governor believes the federal government is purposefully trying to inflame the situation by taking over the California National Guard. Optimism is tempered by the potential for further conflict.</p>

Students are forming clubs and writing op-eds to encourage tech-free spaces and classes, while professors are experimenting with banning electronic devices and limiting ChatGPT use. The article suggests Pomona is well-positioned to become a leader in creating a less tech-dependent campus due to its resources and close-knit community. However, the administration has not yet aligned itself with these efforts, and challenges remain, including accessibility requirements and the integration of technology into coursework.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates Americans have mixed views on the Trump administration's deportation program, with overall net approval but significant divisions based on the perceived targets and scope. Support is strong among those who believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but it drops significantly if people think it targets others. Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most in this group disapprove of the program, citing concerns about due process. While more people see the program as making the U.S. safer, there are concerns about its potential to weaken the economy.</p>

These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing external interference. The report blames regional tensions on external actors that fuel rival claimants' actions and weaken maritime cooperation. China's expansive claims over the resource-rich waters are contested by several ASEAN member states, leading to frequent face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels.</p>

He notes that the average monthly Social Security benefit isn't enough for most Americans over 65, and the program's sustainability is in doubt. Instead, Robbins encourages people to build their own nest egg by saving roughly 20 times their annual expenses and following the 4% withdrawal rule. He emphasizes the importance of starting to invest early and diversifying portfolios to achieve long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that sleeping position can significantly impact skin aging, with side and stomach sleeping potentially leading to wrinkles and sagging. Dr. Svetlana Danovich explains that compression and friction from these positions weaken collagen and elastin. Back sleeping is recommended as the most skin-friendly position, preventing direct contact between the face and pillow. Preventing sleep-related damage involves smart skincare, lifestyle adjustments, and internal wellness, such as silicone chest pads, retinoids, and minimized salt intake. In-office treatments like Botox, dermal fillers, and laser therapy can also help revive sleep-damaged skin.</p>

          <p>At least four Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near an aid distribution center in Gaza, according to local health workers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that troops fired warning shots after a verbal challenge to a group deemed a threat. The incident occurred near Rafah, and the army declared that movement to and from aid sites should only occur between 06:00 and 18:00 local time. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by Israel and the US, operates the aid distribution points. The GHF opened three sites on Sunday.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom denounced as "deranged" the potential deployment of US marines in the state, following a threat from the secretary of defense amid immigration protests. The protests erupted after immigration raids in Los Angeles, with law enforcement using tear gas on demonstrators. Trump promised to send in the national guard, a move Newsom criticized as inflammatory. The Los Angeles mayor stated that no national guard had yet been deployed, while the US attorney warned protesters would face federal prosecution. Trump praised the national guard on Truth Social and stated masks would not be allowed at protests.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the threat of "peaceful evolution" from the United States has receded for China due to the policies of President Trump. The author recalls being taught to be vigilant about American conspiracies aimed at subverting the Communist Party through peaceful means. However, the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts, while China has emerged as a major economic power. Mao Zedong warned about a peaceful evolution in response to US policies that promoted Western values and incited dissent against the Communist Party's rule.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The poem reflects on the beauty and minutiae of life, contrasted with the human drive to explore and conquer. The speaker rejects the desire for extreme exploration, instead finding joy in simple observations like the gold flare in cottonwood leaves and the smell of piÃ±on. The poem references Blake's idea that persistence in folly leads to wisdom, and concludes with a sense of acceptance and wonder at life's exploding, birthing stars. The tone is contemplative and appreciative of the present moment.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's question about ethical non-monogamy in her marriage, where her husband is interested in pursuing a colleague while she is not. The columnist emphasizes the importance of openness, clear communication, and personal growth, drawing on Erich Fromm's philosophy of love. The advice encourages the reader to assert her needs, explore her feelings about non-monogamy, and work on strengthening the emotional security within her current relationship. It also suggests the couple consider a staggered approach or temporary relationship structure if they decide to explore non-monogamy.</p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were forced to take a bus to their final destination after the aircraft diverted to Rome.

American Airlines apologized for the disruption, noting that they usually fly a smaller Boeing 787-8 to Naples.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers to build and maintain airplanes. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic is 54, and the U.S. will be short 25,000 technicians by 2028. The industry is working to attract younger people, with companies like GE Aerospace offering training and competitive salaries. While experts don't expect jobs that have been shipped abroad like clothing manufacturing to come back to the U.S., high-value sectors tend to pay much more and are more likely to stick around.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the story of a Chinese American football team, the Chongqing Dockers, was adapted into a Chinese movie called "Clash." The author, who originally wrote about the team, explores how the film's creation reflects the changing relationship between the United States and China. What began as a tale of cross-cultural teamwork has become a symbol of misunderstanding and disinterest between the two countries. The movie's shift in focus from the American coach to the Chinese players highlights a growing emphasis on domestic narratives and a rejection of Western influence.</p>

Some argue that Obama should take a more vocal role in challenging Trump's actions and abuses, while others defend his approach as strategic and respectful of the next generation of Democratic leaders. His legacy of community organizing is contrasted with his current semi-retirement.</p>
