        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded significantly on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 1,000 points, following a sharp sell-off triggered by President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Investors seemed to shrug off concerns about a potential Fed shakeup and trade policy uncertainties that had previously caused market instability. Positive factors contributing to the rebound included the possibility of a U.S.-India trade deal and support for Fed independence from key Congressional Republicans. Despite the positive day, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its U.S. growth forecast due to escalating trade wars and policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla reported lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings, with automotive revenue dropping 20% due to production line updates and lower average selling prices. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts has raised investor concerns about his focus on Tesla. The company cited increasing uncertainty in automotive and energy markets due to evolving trade policies, which are adversely impacting the global supply chain and cost structure. Tesla's shares have declined significantly this year, and the company has faced protests in the U.S. and Europe over Musk's political activities.</p>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter results revealed disappointing sales and profits, prompting investors to question Elon Musk's dedication to the company amid his involvement in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Investors are worried that Musk's political activities and association with the Trump administration are alienating consumers and negatively impacting Tesla's brand. Analysts suggest that Musk's focus on DOGE could permanently reduce demand for Tesla vehicles. The company acknowledged that trade policy and changing political sentiment could affect near-term demand.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order preventing the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU argued that two Venezuelan men were at risk of deportation to a prison in El Salvador, where 11 men from Colorado have already been sent. The order requires that individuals subject to deportation under the AEA receive 21 days' notice, be informed of their right to judicial review, and be able to consult with an attorney. President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the detention or deportation of noncitizens deemed 'dangerous'.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a major overhaul of the U.S. State Department, aiming to streamline what he calls a 'bloated' bureaucracy. The plan involves cutting approximately 700 positions and 132 offices, with a focus on eliminating programs deemed misaligned with America's core national interests. Rubio criticized the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, accusing it of left-wing activism and anti-Israel bias. Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over the reorganization, warning against America's retreat on the global stage.</p>

          <p>A jury concluded that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control that incorrectly linked Palin's political action committee to an atmosphere of violence prior to a 2011 mass shooting. Palin claimed that the editorial damaged her reputation and caused increased death threats. The Times corrected the article shortly after publication, and the jury found that the newspaper did not act with 'actual malice'.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers may contribute to an economic slowdown. Roughly 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections, potentially leading to wage garnishments and reduced consumer spending. Experts note that the debt collections could also damage borrowers' credit scores, making it harder to secure loans for major purchases. While the policy may increase government revenue, it could also create short-term pain for borrowers and the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dallas Mavericks General Manager Nico Harrison acknowledged underestimating the level of fan outrage following the trade of Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers. Harrison maintains that the trade, which brought Anthony Davis to Dallas, was based on a 'defense wins championships' strategy. However, injuries prevented the intended starting lineup from playing together, exacerbating fan discontent. Harrison believes winning will help repair the relationship with fans and expects the team to compete for a championship next season.</p>

          <p>After suing CBS for billions over a '60 Minutes' story, and railing against coverage he viewed as negative, Trump achieved his knockout blow with the news that award-winning '60 Minutes' executive producer Bill Owens would resign after nearly 40 years on the program. This move qualifies as one of those instances where mere appearance perfectly embodies what journalists often refer to as a “chilling effect” — that is, something that dissuades people from exercising their First Amendment rights in advance based on the fear of reprisals.</p>

          <p>Meta's online advertising business could suffer a $7 billion revenue hit this year due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein, major advertisers on Meta's platforms, may reduce their ad spending amid the trade dispute. Analysts suggest that a prolonged economic downturn combined with trade tensions could significantly impact Meta's advertising revenues and earnings. Despite the concerns, analysts maintain a 'Buy' rating on Meta but have lowered their target price.</p>

The January wildfires also likely contributed to the decline. A sustained pullback in housing development could lead to higher prices and rents in the future.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., insists he has "accepted full responsibility" for a series of fraudulent schemes despite a "social media blitz" that federal prosecutors said suggested otherwise. Santos, in a letter to the judge Tuesday, said he can be both "profoundly sorry" and upset by the Justice Department's recommendation of a lengthy prison sentence. Prosecutors repeated their request for a prison term of more than seven years when Santos is sentenced Friday, saying his recent social media posts show the 35-year-old Santos "remains unrepentant for his crimes."</p>
