          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership had sought to replace Kim, believing Han had a better chance of winning the upcoming elections on June 3, leading to Kim denouncing the move as a "political coup". Following a vote by PPP members, Kim was reinstated, thanking supporters and pledging to lead South Korea towards becoming a greater nation. The PPP has faced turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, with the opposition candidate currently leading in the polls.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine to be held in Turkey on May 15, brushing aside demands from European leaders for a 30-day cease-fire. This New York Times article details how the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland visited Ukraine and threatened ‚Äúnew and massive‚Äù sanctions on Russia‚Äôs banking and energy sectors if Putin refused to agree to a cease-fire. Putin stated Russia was prepared for serious negotiations ‚Äúwithout any preconditions,‚Äù but did not directly address the European call for a cease-fire. Ukraine has not responded, and authorities reported an attack by Russian drones in several cities, including Kyiv, shortly after Putin's announcement.</p>

Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles heals this divide, it could define his reign, contrasting with his messages of tolerance and inclusiveness.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited Ukraine to participate in "direct talks" on May 15, following calls from European leaders for a 30-day ceasefire. This BBC article details how Putin stated Russia seeks "serious negotiations" aimed at a "lasting, strong peace" in a rare televised address. Earlier, leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and Poland traveled to Kyiv to urge Russia to commit to an unconditional ceasefire starting Monday.

Putin also suggested the talks could lead to a new truce, proposing Istanbul as the venue and planning to discuss details with Turkey's President Erdogan.</p>
