          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline, dropping over 34% in May, marking the most significant decrease since February 2020, according to Wind Information. This decline is attributed to the effects of prohibitive tariffs imposed earlier, despite a preliminary trade deal aimed at easing tensions. Overall exports rose 4.8%, but imports fell 3.4%, indicating weak domestic demand, and the automotive industry's price war also contributed to downward pressure on consumer prices. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is expected to meet with U.S. trade representatives in London for renewed trade talks to address these ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice) </p>
