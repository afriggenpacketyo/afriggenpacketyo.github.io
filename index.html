          <p>Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, is strategically expanding into the U.S. market by launching USAT, a new token specifically designed for American institutions and regulated under the GENIUS Act. This move is underscored by the appointment of Bo Hines, a former White House advisor, as CEO of Tether U.S., highlighting the company's commitment to regulatory engagement. USAT will be issued by Anchorage Digital and its reserves managed by Cantor Fitzgerald, aiming to integrate digital assets more deeply into the U.S. financial system. This initiative, which aligns with the goal of strengthening the U.S. dollar's digital dominance, represents a significant step for Tether's global presence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, urging it to "think twice" before implementing proposed tariff hikes of up to 50% on Asia-made cars, threatening countermeasures. Mexico's Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard confirmed the plan, which is part of a larger federal budget proposal impacting billions in imports. Beijing emphasized its reluctance to see economic cooperation affected and called for safeguarding free trade, contrasting Mexico's stance with U.S. tariff practices. This development underscores growing global trade protection protectionism, as China asserts its right to defend its economic interests and influence over supply chains.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating he is "sort of" running out of patience over the stalled Ukraine conflict negotiations. This follows the Kremlin's announcement that peace talks with Ukraine are "on pause." Trump emphasized the need for "very, very strong" action against Russia, including imposing severe sanctions on banks, oil, and tariffs, similar to measures he previously applied or threatened. The article notes this comes amid rising tensions, including a recent incident where Russian drones entered Polish airspace, triggering a multi-nation NATO response and further complicating diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched a new pilot program to accelerate the rollout of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis, with leading companies Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation participating. This initiative involves establishing at least five public-private partnerships with state and local governments to promote the safe usage of these advanced aircraft. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted the program's role in securing America's global leadership in transportation innovation. These efforts, spurred by a recent executive order from President Donald Trump, aim to bring supervised air taxi trials to the U.S. as early as next year, promising reduced emissions and eased traffic congestion.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Clive Lewis has publicly questioned Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, asserting he "doesn't seem up to the job," amidst growing backlash over Peter Mandelson's controversial appointment and subsequent dismissal. Mandelson was fired due to his connections with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, with new details emerging after his initial selection as an ambassador. This incident, combined with the resignation of Angela Rayner, has created a "very, very dangerous atmosphere" within the Labour Party, as MPs express concern about the party's direction and the rising influence of Reform UK. Calls for significant changes reflect a period of profound internal struggle and public scrutiny for the government.</p>

Trump cited inspiration from Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who reportedly highlighted Memphis's crime issues. Despite the Memphis Police Department reporting a 25-year low in overall crime, Trump intends to "fix" the city's problems.

          <p>A zookeeper at Thailand's Safari World, Jian Rangkarassamee, was tragically mauled to death by five lions after stepping out of his vehicle, leading to the temporary closure of the park's predator zone. An autopsy revealed multiple severe injuries, including a broken neck. This incident has intensified scrutiny on Safari World's animal treatment, with wildlife officials identifying damaged fences and inadequate safety measures, and noting the zoo's permit had expired. Conservation groups like WFFT and PETA are calling for stricter controls on dangerous animal ownership in Thailand, highlighting broader concerns about captive wildlife and public safety.</p>

          <p>Brian Gavidia, an LA man and U.S. citizen, is suing the Trump administration for alleged racial profiling by federal immigration agents, who accosted him at a tow yard despite his citizenship.

Gavidia recounts being violently detained and questioned, leaving him with lasting fear and his business closed. He is determined to continue the fight, stating, "I will not stay quiet," challenging the administration's actions that he believes are destroying communities and targeting law-abiding citizens rather than criminals.</p>

          <p>China's DF-5C nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has reportedly achieved significant advancements, particularly in its readiness for launch. Unlike older liquid-fuel rockets that require lengthy fueling processes and cannot be stored fueled for long, military experts suggest the DF-5C has overcome these limitations. The article highlights protective membrane-like materials on its rocket nozzles, indicating improved fuel storage technology. This allows the missile to remain in a silo "ready to launch any time," according to a defense expert. These developments signify a substantial enhancement in China's strategic nuclear capabilities, enabling it to project power globally with increased speed and flexibility.</p>

          <p>Multifamily offices, representing high-net-worth investors, are increasingly directing capital into alternative investments, with commercial real estate (CRE) being a top priority. This model allows wealthy families to pool resources, share expertise, and access larger deals that might be out of reach individually, as exemplified by platforms like Realm. Travis King, Realm's CEO, notes that while institutions have significantly increased their CRE allocations, family offices are now seeking similar diversification. The article highlights opportunities in the office sector, where pricing has potentially bottomed out, while generally avoiding broad, over-invested categories like large-scale data centers, and notes that lower interest rates would boost transaction volume.

          <p>A UN report reveals that conflict and insecurity have led to the closure of nearly 15,000 schools in West and Central Africa by mid-2025, displacing millions of children from education, particularly in Nigeria and Cameroon. Experts suggest the actual number of affected children could exceed 5 million, with hundreds of schools shut in Nigeria alone due to ongoing insurgencies like Boko Haram. This crisis pushes children out of the education system, raising fears of boys being recruited as child fighters and girls facing teenage pregnancies. Despite some government interventions, such as mini-camps, experts advocate for the re-implementation of COVID-era virtual learning plans to ensure continued education amidst persistent conflict.</p>

Israel defended its actions, asserting "no sanctuary for terrorists."
