          <p>Zijin Gold's shares experienced a surge of over 60% during their Hong Kong trading debut, following the company's nearly $3.2 billion IPO. This made it the second-largest IPO globally this year, trailing only CATL. The debut was initially delayed due to Super Typhoon Ragasa. The surge in Zijin Gold's valuation is attributed to the rising gold prices amid safe-haven demand and global economic uncertainties, with spot gold reaching a new all-time high. Zijin Gold's IPO contributes to Hong Kong's IPO market resurgence, and the company is the overseas gold-mining arm of China's Zijin Mining, with investors including GIC, HHLRA, and BlackRock Funds.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading patterns as China's manufacturing activity contracted for the sixth consecutive month, according to official data, although the contraction was less severe than anticipated. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 49.8, slightly above expectations. Investors are closely monitoring the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) upcoming interest rate decision, with expectations leaning towards a steady cash rate at 3.6% due to persistent high inflation. Shier Lee Lim of Convera noted that any shift in the RBA's tone could impact AUD crosses, especially after recent volatility in building approvals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Harvard astrophysicist, Avi Loeb, has proposed that a massive comet, named 3I/ATLAS, traveling through the solar system could potentially be an artifact of alien technology, rather than a natural space object. Loeb's claim is based on new data indicating that the comet is significantly larger and more massive than initially estimated, weighing over 33 billion tons and spanning at least 3.1 miles across. The comet, only the third interstellar visitor ever detected, is shedding large amounts of carbon dioxide and dust as it approaches the Sun. Loeb has called on NASA to use the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to further refine estimates of the comet's dimensions.</p>

          <p>China's official gauge for manufacturing activity indicated a contraction in September, although the contraction was smaller than expected, reflecting Beijing's efforts to curb industrial overcapacity. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 49.8, slightly above Reuters' poll expectations of 49.6. China's official manufacturing PMI has remained below the 50-benchmark since April, as manufacturers grapple with tepid domestic demand and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs. Private surveyor RatingDog's manufacturing purchasing managers' index, however, showed expansion, coming in at 51.2 for September.</p>

          <p>Stef Reid, a Paralympic athlete who had her right foot amputated after a boat accident, is advocating for major brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to sell single shoes instead of pairs. Reid argues that this change would benefit amputees and individuals with different-sized feet, reducing waste and costs associated with buying two shoes when only one is needed. She notes that while brands often display models with prosthetic blades, they don't cater to the actual buying needs of athletes like herself. Reid's campaign aims to align inclusive imagery with practical purchasing experiences for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a 100% tariff on films not made in the U.S., claiming that the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries. He stated that California has been heavily affected and the tariff would solve this problem. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce expressed deep concern, noting that American production houses rely on Canadian facilities, crews, and talent. Investment analysts question the practicality of such a tax, considering that tariffs are typically imposed on goods, and filmmakers often choose other countries due to better incentives.

          <p>Donald Trump has suggested a criminal investigation into Christopher Wray, his former appointee to lead the FBI, following false claims that FBI agents were involved in the January 6th Capitol attack. Trump's suggestion follows a report from The Blaze, citing an unidentified congressional source, that 274 FBI agents were embedded in the pro-Trump mob. The Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General found no evidence of undercover FBI employees in the protest crowd. Trump's comments come after James Comey's indictment, and he appears emboldened to call for the prosecution of more political opponents.</p>

The White House budget chief has circulated a memo outlining how the Trump administration would use a shutdown to make long-term reductions in federal spending and employment rolls. Democrats believe healthcare is a winning issue for them, so they want the debate to be on whether millions of Americans will lose the ability to afford medical insurance.</p>

The airport is designed to be a hub with advanced technology for check-in, security, and baggage handling, but faces challenges regarding connectivity and regulatory issues.

          <p>Charlie Javice, founder of a startup acquired by JPMorgan Chase, was sentenced to over seven years in prison for defrauding the bank by overstating her fintech firm's customer base. Javice and her chief growth officer were found guilty on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy. In addition to prison time, Javice was sentenced to supervision, forfeiture, and restitution to JPMorgan. JPMorgan discovered that Frank, Javice's startup, had far fewer real customers than claimed, leading to her arrest and conviction.</p>

          <p>California and other Democratic-led states have sued the Trump administration for allegedly stripping them of federal security and disaster relief funding based on their unwillingness to aid in federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit comes after a federal judge barred the administration from conditioning similar federal grant funding on states rescinding their "sanctuary" policies. California expects a $55 million cut in funding. The states argue that the funding reductions are an illegal effort to force compliance with a federal immigration campaign.</p>

In distinguishing China’s approach from that of the US toward trade with Global South countries, Xie highlighted that “China also offered zero-tariff treatment, or 100 per cent tariff refunds, to all least-developed countries maintaining diplomatic relations with it.”</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's strategy of retaliation against his perceived enemies is not progressing as anticipated, with several attempts to silence or prosecute opponents backfiring. Efforts to censor Jimmy Kimmel have increased his popularity, and the prosecution of James Comey faces legal challenges. Trump's attempts to use state power for propaganda and intimidation are undermined by the fact that his election relied on his defiance in the face of a "woke," illiberal mob. The article suggests that Trump's strategy of using state power for submission is beyond his grasp.</p>

The plan includes familiar ceasefire proposals such as the release of hostages and a staged withdrawal of Israeli forces. It also includes new elements, such as the Palestinian Authority taking power in Gaza after reforms and a temporary government overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump.

          <p>Jim Cramer believes that a government shutdown won't have a major effect on the market, based on past stock market reactions to shutdowns.

Cramer acknowledges the shutdown seems unnerving, but points out that the market has seen gains after some past shutdowns. He notes that the market can distinguish a shutdown from a debt ceiling default. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan focuses on optimizing the industrial structure to achieve an average annual growth rate of about 5% in value-added output.

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's decision to convene a meeting of 800 generals and admirals at Quantico, Virginia, has drawn criticism. The meeting, reportedly to discuss the "warrior ethos" and personal grooming, is seen as disruptive and potentially dangerous, given the security risk of gathering so many top military leaders in one place. There is speculation that Hegseth may be conducting a "loyalty check" or planning personnel-related changes, though the exact purpose of the meeting remains unclear.
