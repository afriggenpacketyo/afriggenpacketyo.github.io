          <p>The upcoming film "Superman," directed by James Gunn, aims to present a more relatable version of the iconic hero. Actor David Corenswet, who plays the lead, and Gunn explain that this Superman is not indestructible and experiences loneliness, wanting to connect with humanity despite his alien origins. The film explores his vulnerability and sense of humor, with Gunn noting that in a world full of meanness, Superman's defining rebellious trait is his unwavering goodness. Corenswet embraces the iconic role, acknowledging it may define his career but feeling it is a worthwhile endeavor to embody such a positive character.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologist and "Shark Week" host Forrest Galante advises beachgoers to remain respectful of sharks but not to succumb to hysteria, noting the 50th anniversary of 'Jaws' has fueled fear. He explains that recent tracking of large sharks, like the great white 'Contender,' creates alarm, but these animals have likely followed the same routes for years unnoticed. Galante emphasizes that sharks do not intentionally hunt humans and offers practical advice to minimize risks, such as avoiding swimming at dawn and dusk, staying away from marine-rich areas like river mouths, and not wearing shiny jewelry which can mimic bait fish.</p>

In a joint statement, the festival and organizer Emily Eavis declared the comments "crossed a line" and affirmed there is no place for antisemitism or incitement to violence at the event. The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the comments as "revolting," noting the irony that Israelis were attacked and sexually assaulted at a music festival.</p>

Grossi emphasizes the urgent need for diplomatic reconnection and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify remaining materials and activities, as Iran's knowledge and industrial capacity cannot be destroyed.

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to partner in tackling obesity by making healthy food more appealing to customers. Under the strategy, retailers will decide on methods such as offering promotions, adjusting loyalty point incentives, or changing store layouts to encourage healthier shopping habits. Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the approach as a collaborative effort, differing from past "nanny state" policies. The initiative is part of a broader 10-year plan for the NHS, aiming to reduce obesity rates, which currently cost the health service Â£11 billion annually.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has advanced a sweeping tax-cut and spending bill, a key legislative priority for President Donald Trump, after a crucial 51-49 procedural vote. The legislation aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, introduce new breaks like no taxes on tips, and increase funding for the military and border security. The bill faced opposition from Democrats, who argue it disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and some conservative Republicans concerned about its impact on the national debt. Despite some internal GOP dissent and criticism from figures like Elon Musk over its potential economic harm, Republican leadership secured the necessary votes to begin debate.

          <p>Approximately 12,000 Chinese immigrants in Taiwan face a June 30 deadline to prove they have relinquished their household registration in China or risk losing their Taiwanese residency and potential deportation. This measure is part of a broader national security push by President Lai Ching-te's administration, which has labeled China a "hostile foreign force." The policy primarily affects Chinese-born spouses of Taiwanese citizens and has caused significant distress, as obtaining the required documentation involves submitting sensitive information to Chinese authorities. Critics argue the policy is rushed, unfair, and heightens mistrust towards immigrants amid rising cross-strait tensions.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples therapy suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, if they can be their authentic selves, if their partner is genuinely curious about their inner world, and if their partner takes accountability for mistakes. The article argues that healthy relationships require collaborative problem-solving, freedom of self-expression, sustained curiosity, and mutual responsibility. A consistent negative response to these points could signal that a relationship is on autopilot or mired in unhealthy dynamics.</p>

Indigenous influencers and fans have criticized the pop star on social media for promoting a harmful framing of American history that ignores the context of U.S. imperialism and land theft.

While data shows young people are having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are also the most diverse in terms of gender and sexual identity and are highly politically engaged. The piece suggests that Gen Z's approach to sex is shaped by the overturning of Roe v. Wade and a desire to dismantle restrictive gender expectations. They are reframing concepts like virginity and fighting for sexual and reproductive freedoms with unprecedented activism.</p>

          <p>Priyanka Jain, CEO of the health company Evvy, emphasizes that she looks for candidates who demonstrate a willingness and ability to both strategize and execute. She finds it concerning when potential hires are only interested in high-level strategy and view hands-on execution as beneath them. Especially in a startup environment, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, devise a solution, and then actively implement it. To assess this, she asks candidates to detail how they solved a past problem, looking for a deep understanding of the process and genuine excitement for both planning and doing.</p>

          <p>A new report from Vanguard shows a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 have a median balance nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The data highlights that despite economic uncertainty, many Americans continue to prioritize long-term savings. The study also found that automatic enrollment in company retirement plans has a major positive impact, with auto-enrolled employees having median balances roughly 60% higher than those who had to opt-in voluntarily.

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of "sludge," or deliberately created friction in customer service systems, which is designed to impede customers and save companies money. Drawing on expert interviews and personal experience, it reveals how tactics like complex phone trees, undertrained agents with limited authority, and even intentionally dropped calls are used to frustrate customers into giving up. This weaponized inefficiency not only costs consumers time and money but also contributes to a broader sense of powerlessness and declining trust in institutions. The piece argues that this systemic dysfunction is a calculated business strategy in an era prioritizing short-term growth over long-term customer loyalty.</p>

It outlines the two main ways to make money: buying shares at a low price and selling them higher, or receiving dividends, which are small payments from a company's profits.

If either visit occurs, it would mark the first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Trump's second term began. The potential presence of Trump alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Beijing parade could create a complex diplomatic situation for allies like Japan, amid ongoing U.S.-China trade and security tensions.</p>

The government was forced into a U-turn on its flagship bill after more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Key changes include limiting Pip cuts to new claimants and indexing the health-related component of Universal Credit to inflation.

Significant practical questions remain, such as how citizenship will be verified at birth, and legal challenges are expected to continue in lower courts.
