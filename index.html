          <h2>Inflation Rises Amid Intensified Tariffs and Fed Rate Cut Considerations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 08:46:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer prices experienced a 2.9% increase in August compared to the previous year, coinciding with President Trump's intensified tariff policies, matching economists' projections. This uptick in inflation, up from 2.7% the month before, occurs as the Federal Reserve considers cutting interest rates, a move that could further stimulate spending and potentially worsen inflation. The report arrives during an uncertain period for the economy, marked by slower hiring and rising prices, raising concerns about stagflation. The weak jobs data has fueled worries of a possible recession, placing the Fed in a difficult position regarding interest rate adjustments. (not investment advice) The article also notes the controversial dismissal of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. </p>

          <p>Newcastle United has cancelled 45 tickets purchased by a school for their Champions League home game against Barcelona, angering fans who struggled to obtain tickets. The High School of Dundee, located nearly 200 miles away, had bought the tickets in good faith after being approached with an offer. The Newcastle United Supporters Trust expressed dismay, noting the difficulty many fans faced in securing seats. It was determined that the tickets were acquired through unauthorized reselling, leading to the cancellation of the original season tickets.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer fired the U.K.’s ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, after emails revealed closer ties to Jeffrey Epstein than previously known. The emails showed Mandelson expressing support for Epstein in 2008 as he battled his first conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Mandelson told Epstein to "fight for early release" and said "I think the world of you" before Epstein began his sentence. The Foreign Office stated that the depth and extent of Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein was materially different from what was known at the time of his appointment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kashmiri artisans are facing hardship due to new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on India, threatening their livelihoods. The tariffs, coupled with a decline in tourism following an attack in Pahalgam, have led to concerns about order cancellations and reduced income for artisans. The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry has labeled the US tariffs as "catastrophic" for the handicraft sector. Experts warn that the new tariffs could halve exports and endanger between 500,000 and 700,000 artisanal jobs across India, with luxury goods being particularly vulnerable to rising prices.</p>

          <h2>ECB Holds Rates Steady Amid Lingering Tariff Uncertainties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 08:41:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to keep interest rates unchanged due to ongoing economic uncertainties related to U.S. tariffs. The ECB's key deposit facility rate remains at 2%, following a rate cut in June, and the central bank plans to adopt a data-dependent approach to future rate adjustments. Despite euro zone inflation hovering around the ECB's 2% target, concerns persist regarding the impact of tariffs on economic growth. The ECB projects headline inflation to average 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026, and 1.9% in 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative political activist and ally of President Trump, died after being shot at a rally at Utah Valley University.

He also launched Turning Point Action, an advocacy group supporting conservative candidates, including Trump. Kirk was married and had two children, and he was known for his strong faith and large social media following, making him a key figure in spreading right-wing messages.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.9% in August compared to the previous year, aligning with economists' expectations that prices would slightly increase due to President Trump's tariffs. The CPI measures changes in prices for everyday consumer goods and services, and this increase edges away from the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Economists attribute the rise to the Trump administration's tariffs, which U.S. businesses pay and pass on to consumers. The Federal Reserve has been hesitant to cut rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation, but signs of strain in the labor market may open the door for a rate cut.

          <p>An article discusses the decline of teen babysitters and the professionalization of the job, exploring the reasons for the shift and its consequences. Babysitting has changed since the 90s and what was once a rite of passage for teens and tweens has become a professionalized job with dedicated apps and a workforce of experienced adults. It argues that something is lost when babysitting becomes a grown-up job, highlighting the benefits of teen babysitters for both the sitters and the children they care for, including independence, social skills, and free play.</p>

          <p>The U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has fired the U.K.'s Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Mandelson after further details emerged about the diplomat's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Documents revealed Mandelson's close friendship with Epstein, prompting the Prime Minister to withdraw him as Ambassador. The Foreign Office stated that the depth and extent of Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment. The search for a successor begins as Britain looks to maintain its relationship with the U.S.</p>

The author proposes measures to limit AI use, including de-teching classrooms, banning smartphones and laptops, and requiring students to live on campus. They suggest that colleges committed to a tech-free environment can offer a unique alternative, fostering intellectual culture and social life, and that support for students with disabilities can be provided through low-tech strategies like peer tutoring.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has ruled that husbands can take the surname of their wives, overturning a law that barred them from doing so. The court deemed the law as gender-based discrimination, a victory for two couples who brought the case forward. Parliament will now amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the ruling. The couples argued that the law was archaic and violated equality rights enshrined in the constitution.</p>

          <p>A new study has linked hundreds of severe heat waves to human-caused climate change and the greenhouse gas pollution of major fossil fuel producers. The study found that 213 heat waves were substantially more likely and intense because of the activity of major fossil fuel producers. The scientists found as much as a quarter of the heat waves would be "virtually impossible" without the climate pollution from major fossil fuel producers. The study adds to research linking the emissions of fossil fuel companies to extreme weather events.</p>
