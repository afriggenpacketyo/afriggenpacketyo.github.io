          <p>Two 16-year-old boys have been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa in south-east London. The court heard that the teens attacked Bokassa with machetes on a public bus in January, striking him 27 times in a 14-second assault. Kelyan's mother delivered a victim impact statement describing her family's profound loss, while the judge noted that no sentence could truly reflect the tragedy of a young life lost. The defendants, who have previous convictions for carrying knives, must serve a minimum of 15 years and 10 months before being considered for parole.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar is set to secure his fourth Tour de France title after successfully defending his significant lead in the final mountain stage. While Thymen Arensman won the grueling 19th stage, Pogačar finished alongside his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard, maintaining a comfortable lead of four minutes and 24 seconds. With only two flatter stages remaining before the traditional finish in Paris, his overall victory is considered all but certain. The stage was shortened due to external factors, but still featured two extremely challenging climbs, testing the riders' endurance to the limit.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that deportation flights have commenced from the 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention facility, a site established in the Everglades to support federal immigration enforcement. DeSantis stated that hundreds of detainees have already been processed for deportation, with plans to increase the frequency of flights. The state is also seeking to expand the facility's capacity and deputize more local and state law enforcement to make immigration arrests. This initiative is part of a broader effort by Florida to assist the Trump administration's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, despite reports of poor conditions at the facility.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price fell by 9% following an announcement that the company is slashing costs in its struggling chip foundry business and may discontinue it entirely without new customers. Despite beating earnings estimates, concerns grew after the CEO stated there would be "no more blank checks" for new manufacturing processes, and the company acknowledged its failure to secure significant external clients. Intel is canceling facility projects in Germany and Poland and slowing production in Ohio as it grapples with underutilized factories and market share losses to competitors like Nvidia.

          <p>A Missouri judge has ruled there is sufficient probable cause to proceed to trial for the two men charged in the deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans found in a friend's backyard in January 2024. Jordan Willis and Ivory Carson are facing second-degree felony-murder charges after the victims were discovered with a combination of fentanyl and cocaine in their systems. During the preliminary hearing, defense attorneys argued that there is no definitive evidence proving their clients supplied the fatal drugs. The case has drawn national attention since the bodies were discovered frozen two days after a football watch party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice has reversed course on federal oversight of police departments, ending investigations and consent decrees in nearly two dozen cities, including Louisville and Minneapolis. This move dismantles a key tool for police accountability that was utilized to address patterns of misconduct and civil rights violations, such as those investigated following the death of Breonna Taylor. While some local officials have pledged to continue with reforms independently, critics express deep concern that the rollback of federal intervention will undermine progress and that cities cannot be trusted to effectively police themselves without external pressure.</p>

This could split the left-wing vote, potentially benefiting the right-wing Reform UK party in a general election. The new party's initial test will be in the upcoming local elections, with its success likely depending on its ability to mobilize young, pro-Gaza, and urban voters, as well as its strategic relationship with the Green Party.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is bracing for significant disruption as thousands of resident doctors commence a five-day strike over pay. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the period will be challenging but stated efforts are underway to minimize the impact and keep non-urgent services running. This marks the 12th strike by doctors since March 2023, with the British Medical Association (BMA) arguing that pay has not kept pace with inflation. In a rare move, the BMA has begun granting requests for some striking doctors to return to work in hospitals facing the most severe pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick suggests that while AI is not yet ready to fully replace human jobs, it will be a "huge concern" for the entry-level workforce. He argues that the immediate challenge is not job replacement but figuring out how to develop human expertise when AI can perform many foundational tasks. Mollick notes that skills like judgment and deep knowledge will become more critical, but gaining them through traditional apprenticeship models will be difficult. He advises that organizational leaders must articulate a clear vision for AI integration rather than leaving employees to figure it out individually, stressing the need to adapt training and education.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump deflected questions about his past association with Jeffrey Epstein, stating he has "nothing to do with the guy" and that he hasn't thought about a potential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell. His comments came as a top Department of Justice official met with Maxwell for a second day. Trump attempted to shift focus to other public figures who associated with Epstein, such as Bill Clinton. The president is facing mounting pressure to release government files related to the Epstein investigation after his administration previously reneged on promises to disclose the information.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel have pulled their negotiating teams from Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar, with President Trump stating that Hamas "didn't really want to make a deal." U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff announced the U.S. would now consider "alternative options" to secure the release of hostages, a sentiment echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas expressed surprise at the envoy's negative assessment, affirming its commitment to negotiations aimed at a permanent ceasefire. The breakdown in talks comes amid a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, with the UN warning of mass starvation.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for Ghislaine Maxwell described a day-long interview between his client and U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as "very productive," with a second session planned. The meeting is part of the Justice Department's response to public pressure for more information on the Jeffrey Epstein case. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, reportedly answered all questions posed to her. The development comes as President Trump faces criticism for the administration's handling of the Epstein files and has suggested the renewed focus is a political distraction by Democrats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window has been marked by massive spending, particularly from the top clubs of the previous season. Liverpool leads the way with £269 million spent so far, including a potential British record fee for Florian Wirtz, followed by Chelsea at over £212 million. This heavy investment by a few dominant teams raises questions about the league's competitiveness, especially after a season that initially seemed more open. Football finance experts note that while the spending figures are high, they are supported by increased club revenues from broadcast deals, ticket sales, and Champions League participation.</p>

This downturn contrasts sharply with soaring stock markets and overall wealth, breaking a long-standing correlation.

The move puts considerable pressure on key allies, particularly the United Kingdom, to follow suit.

However, the British government now faces intense political pressure from its own MPs and a shifting international consensus, forcing it to weigh the diplomatic risks of action versus inaction.</p>
