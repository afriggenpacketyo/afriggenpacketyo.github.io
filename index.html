          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on trading partners to finalize new tariff agreements before a potential August 1 deadline. Officials are sending letters to numerous countries, warning that higher tariffs could be imposed if deals are not reached. The administration also announced an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with the BRICS bloc, although the specific triggers for this were not detailed. This strategy of "maximum pressure" aims to secure more favorable trade terms for the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, bringing heavy rainfall to the region. While tropical storm warnings have been canceled, flood watches remain in effect for parts of North Carolina and Virginia, with significant rainfall expected to continue through Monday. The Haw River in North Carolina is forecast to crest near a record high, and over 100 roads in Chatham County are already flooded. Dangerous surf and rip currents are also expected along the Atlantic coast for several days.</p>

          <p>Campaigners and opposition figures are urging the UK government not to abolish education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children with special needs and disabilities. Critics warn that scrapping these legally binding documents could deny thousands of children access to vital support and education. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called it a "complex and sensitive area" and has not ruled out changes, while insisting the goal is to provide better support. The debate comes as new data shows a significant increase in the number of EHCPs being issued.</p>

          <p>A high-ranking police official in South Africa has accused the country's police minister and other senior figures of interfering in investigations into political assassinations. Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi alleged that the interference was intended to protect politically connected individuals and obstruct probes into organized crime. President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the matter as a "grave national security concern" that is receiving immediate attention. The allegations have prompted widespread calls from opposition parties for a parliamentary debate and an independent inquiry into corruption within the police service.</p>

Israel stated the operation, named "Operation Black Flag," was a response to repeated Houthi attacks and targeted infrastructure used to transfer Iranian weapons. One of the targets was the hijacked commercial ship Galaxy Leader, which Israel claimed was being used for surveillance. Following the strikes, the Houthis launched two missiles towards Israel, triggering sirens, while also confirming their air defenses confronted the Israeli attack.</p>

The new system is also designed to overcome the limitations of current technologies by enabling faster computation with lower energy consumption. This development mimics the human visual system's ability to adjust to varying light conditions and memorize those settings for quicker future adaptation.

          <p>In the aftermath of the devastating Texas floods that killed nearly 80 people, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate warnings to residents. Some local officials stated the severity of the flood was unexpected, with the Guadalupe River rising almost 30 feet, and noted that warning systems are expensive and not universally implemented. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued flash flood warnings with over three hours of lead time.

Experts note that creating a new national party involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are often biased toward the two major parties. The process would require immense financial resources to gather signatures and fight the inevitable legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans. While Musk's wealth could fund the effort, building a nationally recognized party is a multi-year project, making it an unlikely force by 2026.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo following a sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The decision came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53. Team owner Mark Lerner stated that while he was grateful for their past successes, the team's recent on-field performance necessitated a "fresh approach and new energy." Rizzo had been the team's general manager since 2009, overseeing the franchise's transformation into a championship-winning club before its recent decline.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has strongly criticized Elon Musk in a social media post, calling him a "TRAIN WRECK" after the billionaire announced plans for a new political party. Trump claimed he was surprised when Musk previously said he had "no problems" with the administration's plan to end electric vehicle mandates. The president also justified his decision to pull the nomination of a Musk associate to lead NASA, citing it as inappropriate due to their business connections. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also commented, suggesting Musk's corporate boards would likely encourage him to focus on business.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time away from work to grieve without fear of losing their job. The move, welcomed by campaigners and support groups, will extend the right to at least one week of leave, with the exact length still under consultation.</p>

The plan, which will begin next year in 20 designated areas, also includes proposals for more frequent Ofsted inspections of nurseries.

Dunham, who rose to fame with the New York-based series "Girls," explained her decision to step back from acting in the new show was partly due to the overwhelming scrutiny her body received in the past. She reflected on how society remains deeply fatphobic and how her own relationship with her body has evolved since her 20s. Dunham also spoke about learning from past controversies.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong overall record, the Los Angeles Dodgers are showing some worrying signs, particularly after being swept by the Houston Astros. The team has a mediocre 20-19 record against winning teams, a potential concern for the playoffs, and is battling a growing list of injuries to key players. The series loss to Houston exposed vulnerabilities, with the team being outscored 29-6 over three games. While manager Dave Roberts has expressed confidence, issues with injuries and performance against top-tier opponents could pose challenges as the season progresses.</p>

          <p>The ongoing uncertainty surrounding US trade tariffs is compelling companies to make significant changes to their global supply chains. An Illinois toymaker, facing a massive increase in import taxes on Chinese-made goods, is moving production to Vietnam and India to mitigate costs. Similarly, Canadian businesses are being hit by both US tariffs and their own country's retaliatory measures, forcing them to alter purchasing decisions and potentially raise consumer prices. This disruption is forcing a broad rethinking of manufacturing and sourcing strategies for businesses that rely on international trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis reflecting on the two decades since the 7/7 London attacks finds that while the UK has developed sophisticated counter-terrorism tools, the nature of the threat has become far more complex. The 2005 attacks prompted a major overhaul, leading to better coordination between MI5 and police and new laws to prosecute plots earlier. However, the rise of ISIS introduced the challenge of DIY, self-radicalized attackers, and the far-right has adopted similar tactics. The article concludes that today's threat is more diverse, encompassing lone actors and internet-fueled violence, posing a continued challenge.</p>
