          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 16:24:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trade loophole that allowed cheaper goods from China to enter the U.S. duty-free has expired, potentially raising prices for consumers. The de minimis exemption, which previously allowed packages worth up to $800 to avoid import levies, has been eliminated due to concerns about fentanyl and unfair competition with U.S. businesses. Retailers are expected to add tariff surcharges, leading to higher costs and potentially reduced demand for Chinese goods. This change may also cause delays in shipments as customs officials face the challenge of inspecting millions of additional packages daily, but could benefit U.S. companies facing less competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN NFL Draft analyst Matt Miller believes Shedeur Sanders' handling of the draft process negatively impacted his draft position, as Sanders was eventually drafted in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns. Miller criticized Sanders for not participating in the NFL Scouting Combine or the East-West Shrine Game, suggesting Sanders and his camp overestimated his draft stock. Miller stated that Sanders' camp approached the draft process with the perception that Sanders was a lock for a top two or three draft pick, but that this was not guaranteed and that the NFL will humble anyone. Sanders will now compete for a starting job with the Browns, giving him the chance to prove his doubters wrong.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investment guru, announced his plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the $1.1 trillion conglomerate he transformed from a failing textile manufacturer.

His company owns major stakes in businesses like BNSF railroad, American Express, and Coca-Cola, and his investment decisions are closely watched by millions. Gregory Abel is expected to succeed Buffett, though some worry Berkshire may lose its mythical status without its chief architect.</p>

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, is facing significant delays and cost overruns, raising questions about the state's ability to build large-scale infrastructure.

Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser argues that acquiring properties is not the primary cause of the delays, but rather design changes and other factors. The project has faced challenges including acquiring land, relocating utilities, and navigating environmental regulations, leading to frustration among landowners and doubts about its eventual completion.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, defied pressure from President Trump and his supporters, who falsely claimed the election was stolen. The award recognizes Pence's commitment to democratic principles and his stand against efforts to subvert the electoral process, though Pence has largely been shunned by Trump and the Republican Party since leaving office.</p>

          <p>Israel's main international airport, Ben Gurion, was briefly shut down after a Houthi missile struck nearby, highlighting the limits of U.S. efforts to weaken the group. Despite "several attempts" at interception, the missile landed in the airport's vicinity, prompting a temporary halt to flights. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis and Iran, while Defense Minister Katz threatened a "sevenfold" response. The incident raises questions about Israel's ability to defend against such attacks, even with advanced missile defense systems.</p>

          <p>The CEOs of NPR and PBS are pushing back against President Trump's order to cut federal funding, emphasizing the devastating impact it could have on local stations and programming. Paula Kerger of PBS highlighted the potential loss of educational resources for children, while Katherine Maher of NPR stressed the importance of local news coverage, especially in rural areas. Both organizations are exploring legal options to challenge the order, with Maher asserting that the move is an attempt to control editorial independence and an affront to the First Amendment.</p>

Nasirzadeh emphasized that while Iran has "no hostility toward neighbouring countries", US bases in the region would be considered targets in the event of an attack. The statement coincides with Iran's unveiling of a new solid-fuel ballistic missile with a range of 1,200 km.</p>

          <p>President Trump's expansion of executive power is being justified by a tradition of right-wing thought favoring monarchical rule, drawing from theorists like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss. These thinkers advocate for a strong executive to make decisive decisions, especially in emergencies. This approach threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office, disregarding the separation of powers and asserting a near-permanent state of emergency. The article argues for upholding constitutional limits to prevent tyranny and ensure responsible governance.</p>

Crawford, a highly skilled boxer, will be moving up two weight divisions to challenge Canelo, leading to concerns about a potential size and strength disadvantage. Experts suggest the fight may be similar to Canelo's past encounters where the size difference proved too much for his opponents.
