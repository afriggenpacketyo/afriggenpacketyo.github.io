          <p>India has established a commanding position in the second Test against England, leaving the hosts struggling at 72-3 while chasing an improbable target of 608. The situation was largely dictated by Indian captain Shubman Gill, who followed a first-innings 269 with a remarkable 161, allowing his team to declare at 427-6. Gill's total of 430 runs in the match is the second-highest in Test history. With England's top order collapsing and the highest successful Test chase being 418, India is heavily favored to level the series 1-1 on the final day of play.</p>

          <p>Israeli officials are currently reviewing a US-backed ceasefire proposal that Hamas has reportedly agreed to in principle. This consideration comes as dozens of Palestinians were killed in Gaza on Saturday, with conflicting reports on the exact number of casualties. The Palestinian news agency WAFA reported at least 50 deaths, many occurring as people were waiting for food aid. The Israeli Security Cabinet is expected to meet to discuss the Hamas response, which is being examined in detail, as the conflict's death toll continues to climb amid the dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Two American veterans working for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured after being targeted with grenades while distributing food aid. The organization stated the attack affirms previous warnings of threats from Hamas, which had allegedly placed bounties on GHF workers. According to the group's chairman, the grenades were of Iranian origin and packed with ball bearings for maximum harm. GHF criticized the international community for its silence on threats against aid workers and vowed to continue its mission despite the violence.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods have devastated the Texas Hill Country, leading to at least 27 fatalities, including nine children, in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise. Hundreds of people have been rescued, many by air, but dozens remain missing, including a group of children from the Camp Mystic summer camp. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration to provide state resources for the ongoing search and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the intensity of the flash floods that killed dozens, as the Guadalupe River rose to near-historic levels with little warning. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly admitted the area lacks a river warning system and that the ferocity of the flood was not anticipated, stating, "We didn't know this flood was coming." The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning, but the rainfall far exceeded forecasts, leaving officials to defend their response amid criticism about the lack of advance evacuations for the deadly, fast-moving disaster.</p>

He emphasized that the period was a violent and divisive civil war, not a sanitized moment of unity, and that understanding its flaws and complexities makes its achievements even more inspiring. Burns believes that embracing this complicated history, including the founders' contradictions regarding slavery, provides a lifeline to the present, reminding a divided nation that it has overcome deep fissures before by returning to its foundational, albeit imperfect, ideals.</p>

However, the legislation does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, income-limited tax deduction for seniors. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers condemned the communication as a partisan and unconscionable politicization of a previously apolitical government agency. (not investment advice)</p>

Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, particularly immigration, and felt the party had not been entirely straightforward about its plans. Recent chaos in Parliament and policy U-turns have reinforced a sense that the government lacks direction. While some voters remain patient, others are considering supporting the Reform UK party, reflecting a souring relationship between Labour and the electorate that put it in power.</p>

Experts suggest that Pyongyang will likely view the events as confirmation that nuclear weapons are the only true guarantee of regime survival against an unpredictable U.S. This could lead North Korea to further invest in mobile, dispersed, and survivable nuclear capabilities, effectively ending any remaining possibility of denuclearization. The perception of President Trump as an "emotional, unpredictable force" reinforces the belief that trust-based diplomacy is unreliable for their security.</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what is being called the "toughest group of all" for the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, alongside top-ranked teams France and the Netherlands. This means three of the four teams in Group D are ranked in the world's top 11, with an Opta supercomputer giving the group a 37% chance of producing the eventual tournament winner. While defending champions England and 2017 winners the Netherlands have strong tournament records, France is on an eight-game winning streak. Tournament debutants Wales face a significant challenge but will aim to be competitive underdogs.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Question a Viral TikTok 'Cortisol Cocktail' for Stress Reduction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:00:01 EDT</div>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend known as the "cortisol cocktail," a non-alcoholic drink with ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium, claims to lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that the beverage can directly reduce cortisol levels. Endocrinologists explain that cortisol is a necessary hormone and doctors rarely aim to lower it except in cases of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, its stress-reducing effects are more likely a placebo or related to improved hydration and sleep from magnesium.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter designed in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been discovered after being lost for decades. Believed to be a crucial artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, the machine was found in a New York basement and acquired by Stanford University. The typewriter ingeniously solved the challenge of inputting thousands of Chinese characters by breaking them down by shape, a concept that underlies modern East Asian input methods. The discovery is celebrated by scholars as finding a key link in the evolution of non-alphabetic computing technology.</p>

Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population indicates a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination, they note that securing financial support for shark research remains challenging due to the animal's fearsome reputation.</p>

This speculation continues his public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed.

While China cited a "scheduling conflict," some analysts suggest it may signal internal power struggles or friction with other member nations, particularly India. Premier Li Qiang will attend in Xi's place. The absence of a key leader highlights the strategic fragmentation within BRICS, a group of major emerging economies that, despite its economic scale, faces significant internal divisions and competing interests.</p>

          <p>A renter in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by his property management company, Denali Real Estate, for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in the lease, which is illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). This federal law protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation or financial penalties from companies. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause from future leases, highlighting an illegal practice that many renters may not be aware of.</p>

The article argues that for individuals facing homelessness, disability, language barriers, or lack of internet access, the bureaucratic burden of proving employment or exemption will be nearly insurmountable. Citing the example of Arkansas, where similar rules caused thousands of eligible people to lose coverage, the author contends the policy is engineered to cut costs by disenfranchising those entitled to care.

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for better managing emotional responses to upsetting events. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule acknowledges that the physiological rush of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline lasts about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued anger or stress is a result of mentally replaying the negative thought. Gawdat advises using this 90-second buffer to consciously decide how to move forward, rather than unconsciously renewing the emotional cycle, thereby gaining control over one's state of mind.</p>

          <p>An Emory University professor, inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies to combat her Type-A mindset. The experience fundamentally changed her, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely by connecting with new communities, and redefine self-care away from passive appointments to active engagement. She found that having hobbies forced her to set better boundaries and led to deeper conversations with others. The author concludes that actively pursuing hobbies is a secret to finding balance, rather than waiting for balance to appear.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's sex-trafficking trial demonstrates the legal system's inability to adequately address complex issues of intimate partner violence and coercive control. While Combs was convicted on lesser charges, his acquittal on the most serious counts shows that existing statutes are often ill-equipped for cases involving wealthy, powerful abusers. The author notes that prosecutors may turn to trafficking charges due to longer statutes of limitations, as domestic violence laws are often outdated.
