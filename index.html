          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders campaigned with New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in Brooklyn, advocating against oligarchic control and for progressive policies like rent freezes and increased taxes on the wealthy. The event drew a large crowd, with Mamdani condemning CUNY's dismissal of anti-war professors and criticizing capitalistic greed. Sanders highlighted Mamdani's grassroots movement as a test case for democracy, while also noting the muted support from mainstream Democrats. The campaign aims to mobilize 90,000 volunteers ahead of November's elections, despite alleged interference from Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Michigan's football team faced a 24-13 defeat against the Oklahoma Sooners, compounded by an unusual incident involving ESPN announcer Chris Fowler. Fowler praised Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada's accuracy just before Zvada missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, adding to the team's woes. Oklahoma's John Mateer delivered a strong performance with both passing and rushing touchdowns, while Michigan's freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood struggled. The Wolverines fell to a 1-1 record after a challenging night.</p>

          <p>Overnight, Russia launched a series of strikes across Ukraine, resulting in at least two deaths, including a one-year-old child, and multiple injuries, with falling debris causing fires in Kyiv residential buildings. Simultaneously, Ukrainian drones sparked a fire at an oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, which was quickly extinguished without casualties. Poland scrambled fighter jets to protect its airspace amidst the heightened activity. These exchanges underscore the ongoing intensity of the conflict, with diplomatic peace efforts remaining stalled despite earlier attempts by the US President.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance publicly defended a recent Trump administration military strike on a boat allegedly carrying Venezuelan gang members, which killed 11 people. Vance stated he "doesn't give a s***" if critics deem the action a war crime, asserting that killing cartel members is the military's "highest and best use." This stance drew sharp criticism from Senator Rand Paul and others who raised concerns about due process and the legality of using lethal force against cartel members in international waters. The Trump administration has offered few details on the strike, which it claims targeted "narcoterrorists."</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimetre-scale robots using the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then violently collapse, generating a powerful launching force. Scientists can control the light to direct the robots' movement, enabling them to launch up to 1.5 meters into the air or swim in water. This breakthrough, detailed in the journal Science, demonstrates cavitation as an efficient propulsion mechanism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated "Patriot 2.0," a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation targeting Massachusetts, particularly "sanctuary cities" like Boston. This surge aims to arrest and deport immigrants, focusing on individuals released from local custody despite ICE detainer requests. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has strongly defended her city's policies, emphasizing community policing and safety, while criticizing the federal actions as unwanted and legally questionable. The operation intensifies the ongoing conflict between the administration and sanctuary jurisdictions over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>An initial investigative report into the deadly Lisbon funicular crash confirmed that a cable linking the two cabins snapped shortly before the derailment. The report from Portugal's accident investigations bureau stated that the cable had passed a visual check hours prior to the incident, which killed 16 people and injured 21. Inspectors found the accident occurred rapidly, with the cabins losing their balancing force within seconds of traveling a short distance. Two independent investigations are underway to determine the full causes and issue safety recommendations for the 140-year-old Glória funicular.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoys, such as plywood tanks and flat-pack artillery models, to trick Russian forces into wasting valuable ammunition and resources. These full-scale imitations, some costing as little as $500, are deployed to mimic real military positions, complete with details like wheel ruts and ammunition crates. The strategy has proven effective, with decoys enduring multiple hits from expensive Russian drones. Russia also employs similar tactics, using cheap imitation drones to overload Ukrainian air defenses. This "decoy war" highlights an innovative aspect of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died at 15 from leukemia, is set to be canonized as the Catholic Church's first millennial saint. Known as "God's influencer" for creating websites documenting miracles to spread Catholic teaching, Acutis's canonization was fast-tracked by the Vatican to inspire young people. His body lies preserved in Assisi, and his baptismal church in London has become a pilgrimage site. Two miracles have been attributed to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer, fulfilling the requirements for sainthood.</p>

          <p>The US Men's National Team experienced a disappointing 2-0 loss to South Korea, raising concerns about their form ahead of the home World Cup. Despite head coach Mauricio Pochettino's focus on player evaluation, the team displayed a lack of communication in defense and failed to capitalize on scoring chances. South Korea's Son Heung-min scored the opening goal, highlighting US defensive disjointedness. Pochettino maintained confidence the team would be ready for the World Cup, but the lackluster performance suggests significant challenges remain.</p>

Her departure raises questions about the print magazine's continued influence in a fast-paced digital world, especially as it faces increasing financial pressures and criticisms regarding diversity and commercialization.

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has dropped by over 80% following the Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis exemption" for low-cost imports. This policy change, which removes the $800 customs duty cutoff, has caused "major operational disruptions" as many foreign postal operators and carriers are unable or unwilling to collect new duties. The Universal Postal Union expressed concerns, noting that 88 member countries have suspended some services to the US. The administration justifies the move by stating the exemption was exploited to evade tariffs and smuggle drugs.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, starting October 12, to track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. This system will replace manual passport stamping, requiring first-time travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at kiosks or with border officers. While designed to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns persist about potential long queues and disruptions at busy entry points like Dover and Eurostar terminals during the initial rollout phase.
