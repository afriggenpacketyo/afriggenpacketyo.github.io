            <p>The UK government swiftly enacted emergency legislation to take control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, preventing its potential closure. Officials were stationed near the plant awaiting Royal Assent to the bill, which was expedited through Parliament in a matter of hours. Concerns arose regarding potential unrest among the workforce, composed of both Chinese and British employees, due to the change in management. The government aims to secure necessary raw materials to maintain operations at the blast furnaces, though challenges remain in the complex international supply chains. Nationalization is looking increasingly likely.</p>

            <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's number one golfer, faced challenges in the third round of the Masters, struggling to keep pace with Rory McIlroy's impressive performance.

            <p>Former President Trump is advocating for Congress to pass legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent across the United States. He expressed his support on Truth Social, citing the inconvenience and cost associated with changing clocks twice a year.

While some support the change for increased daylight hours, others argue for permanent standard time due to its alignment with natural circadian rhythms.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that seeks to restrict their access to government buildings and cancel government contracts.

Susman Godfrey claims that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies, asserting that it represents an abuse of presidential power.</p>
