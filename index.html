          <h2>Americans' Alcohol Consumption Reaches Record Low, Gallup Poll Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a notable decrease since 1939. This decline is primarily driven by increasing public awareness regarding alcohol's health risks, as scientific consensus now suggests that any amount of consumption can have negative effects. Younger generations, particularly those aged 18-34, are more inclined to perceive moderate drinking as harmful, influencing this societal shift. The article also highlights a significant gender disparity in alcohol use and preferences. This trend is further supported by the growing popularity of no-drinking challenges and non-alcoholic beverage options.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This marks the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise, with Chisholm's group initially acquiring at least 51% ownership and planning to buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at a $7.3 billion valuation. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and co-founder of STG Partners, is set to assume the role of Celtics' governor. The transaction is expected to finalize shortly, ushering in a new era for the team.</p>

          <p>A Virginia Tech study reveals that pet dogs can be highly effective in detecting the hard-to-find egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly, a destructive pest threatening various plants. Utilizing their superior sense of smell, trained dogs achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and more than 60% in real-world outdoor environments, surpassing human detection rates. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to combat the rapid spread of the lanternfly, which has already infested 19 U.S. states since its 2013 detection in Pennsylvania. Researchers hope this study encourages more widespread training of dogs for environmental protection against invasive species.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a significant warning regarding popular mousse sunscreen products, including those from Supergoop!, stating they may not offer effective protection against harmful UV rays. A major concern is their packaging, which often resembles whipped cream containers, raising the risk of accidental ingestion, especially by children. The FDA sent warning letters to multiple manufacturers, citing a lack of required agency approval for these products, which are classified as over-the-counter drugs. Companies like Supergoop! are now working to address these regulatory violations, with some temporarily pulling their products to ensure full compliance with federal regulations.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu hydropower station, ranking as the world's fourth-largest mega dam, has reportedly stopped using Western industrial chips due to heightened security concerns. This significant decision is driven by growing alarm over potential vulnerabilities in industrial control systems, a risk underscored by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus. The move reflects China's strategic imperative to enhance its technological sovereignty and safeguard critical national infrastructure from external threats. This action further illustrates the ongoing geopolitical competition and technological decoupling between China and Western countries in sensitive industrial sectors.</p>

          <p>The family of David Barnes, an American held in Russia since 2022 and serving a 21.5-year sentence, is hopeful for his release through a prisoner exchange during the upcoming Trump-Putin summit. Barnes was convicted in Moscow of child sexual abuse, despite Texas prosecutors finding no evidence to support his Russian ex-wife's claims. His family maintains his innocence, stating he traveled to Russia to fight for custody of his sons after his ex-wife took them there. They are urging U.S. officials to designate him as wrongfully detained to facilitate his return home.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy media tycoon with British citizenship, is undergoing the final stages of his national security trial in Hong Kong, accused of colluding with foreign forces. His closing arguments were postponed due to a typhoon. Detained since 2020, the 77-year-old faces a potential life sentence, with critics arguing the case weaponizes Hong Kong's legal system to suppress dissent. International figures, including the UK Prime Minister, have called for his release. Lai's son fears his father may die in prison, highlighting the grave implications of the trial.</p>

          <p>A tourist was confronted by a bystander for illegally operating a drone over Yellowstone National Park's iconic Grand Prismatic Spring, a direct violation of federal law since 2014. The National Park Service prohibits drones in all national parks to ensure visitor safety, minimize noise disruption, and protect wildlife. Violators face substantial penalties, including fines up to $5,000 or six months in jail. Such unauthorized flights pose significant risks, potentially harming endangered species, disrupting natural environments, and even causing physical damage to delicate geological features.

Nearly 90 B-29 bombers dropped napalm, resulting in at least 260 deaths and the destruction of an estimated 75% of the city. Survivors and local historians reflect on the "utterly foolish" timing of the raid and its enduring impact on their community.

In a recent interview, Biden alleged that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim the Trumps have consistently denied, stating they were introduced by a modeling agent in 1998. Her legal team asserts that Biden's false and defamatory remarks, widely disseminated on social media, have caused significant financial and reputational harm.

While alarming in appearance, the condition does not usually harm wild bunnies unless it obstructs eating or vision.

          <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has declared a state of emergency in Española and surrounding areas, including Rio Arriba County, in response to a "significant surge" in violent crime and drug trafficking. The order allocates $750,000 in emergency funding to provide resources to these communities. Police calls in Española have more than doubled in two years, and Rio Arriba County, known for its lowrider culture, struggles with the state's highest overdose death rate, largely driven by fentanyl. This marks the second such declaration this year, underscoring the severity of the ongoing public safety crisis.</p>

          <p>Low-income Americans are increasingly struggling with rising energy costs, making it difficult to afford essential cooling like air conditioning, as exemplified by Angela Harmon in Dallas. President Trump's proposed 2026 budget seeks to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federal utility aid program, shifting responsibility to states. Experts from Texas A&M University warn that climate change is exacerbating these costs, increasing wholesale electricity prices significantly. Critics argue that cutting renewable energy projects in favor of fossil fuels under the current administration will further burden consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK cities face a new and growing threat called "firewaves," defined by scientists as multiple urban wildfires triggered by prolonged hot, dry weather conditions intensified by climate change. Recent heath fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this increasing vulnerability, as vegetation becomes highly flammable after extended dry spells. Researchers at Imperial College London, working with the London Fire Brigade, advocate for the Met Office to adopt the term "firewave" to better signal periods of extreme urban fire danger. This concept aims to inform more proactive public safety strategies and enhance climate resilience planning in urban environments, which historically lack wildfire experience.</p>

One firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion while responding to the incident amid the summer heat. Fortunately, there was no immediate threat to nearby homes, and no evacuations were necessary. Hand crews remained on the scene to extinguish any lingering hotspots, with the cause of the fire still under investigation. This incident underscores the fire risks during dry periods.</p>
