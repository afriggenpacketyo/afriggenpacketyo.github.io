          <p>A man was arrested after a train collided with a tractor and trailer at a level crossing in Herefordshire, resulting in injuries to two people and significant disruption to rail services. One passenger was airlifted to the hospital, while another was transported by ambulance, with neither sustaining life-threatening injuries. The incident occurred near Leominster, prompting an investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch to determine the circumstances leading up to the crash. The level crossing, used by agricultural vehicles, requires users to coordinate with a signaller to open and close the gates, and the article mentions a previous fatal crash involving a TfW train where safety system faults were a contributing factor.</p>

          <p>The White House's Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., released a report criticizing the state of chronic disease in America. The report attributes many chronic illnesses to ultra-processed foods, sedentary behavior, overuse of digital devices among children, and environmental chemicals. It also suggests further studies on childhood vaccines are needed, despite existing research indicating their safety and effectiveness. While the report lacks specific budget details, Kennedy maintains that addressing these health issues would save money in the long term, focusing on improving Americans' diets and reducing exposure to toxic chemicals.</p>

          <p>Jim Irsay, the longtime owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts and a notable collector of music memorabilia, has died at the age of 65. Irsay took over ownership of the Colts in 1997 and oversaw the team's success, including a Super Bowl victory in 2007. Beyond football, Irsay was known for his extensive collection of rock-and-roll artifacts and his philanthropy, particularly his efforts to raise awareness and funding for mental health through the Kicking the Stigma initiative. He was open about his own struggles with substance abuse and addiction, and his legacy extends beyond the NFL to encompass his contributions to music and mental health advocacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Make America Healthy Again Commission released a report assessing chronic diseases affecting U.S. youths, attributing the increase in childhood issues to factors like foods with added chemicals and increased pharmaceutical prescriptions. The report reveals findings such as a doubling of teenage depression from 2009 to 2019, high rates of childhood obesity, autism diagnoses, and a spike in childhood cancer. Commission members emphasized the chilling effect of chronic diseases on national security, noting that a significant percentage of American youth are unfit for military service due to health issues. The report calls for a shift from a reactionary system to a proactive one, stressing the importance of addressing diet, environmental factors, and over-medicalization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. The judge deemed the administration's actions unlawful, stating they would effectively make it impossible for the Department to carry out its mandated functions. The ruling halts the administration's efforts to implement the president's executive order to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education, with the judge unconvinced that the changes were aimed at improving efficiency rather than abolishing the department outright.</p>

While education unions welcomed the decision, they warned of potential cuts to school budgets without additional funding. Health unions reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, with the British Medical Association planning a strike ballot for resident doctors due to the "woefully inadequate" rise.

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant plunge after House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits. The bill ends tax credits for installers like Sunrun that lease equipment to customers, which is a common practice in the rooftop solar industry. Analysts described the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario, potentially impacting sales of inverters from companies like Enphase and SolarEdge. While the bill leaves the manufacturing tax credit relatively unscathed, benefiting companies like First Solar, the overall impact is expected to be negative for the solar industry. The Senate is expected to make changes to the legislation.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move that challenges the state's ability to set stricter environmental standards than the federal government. The revoked waivers include one related to phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California leaders have vowed to challenge the Senate vote, which is expected to impact cities and states that have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government. The decrease was also influenced by large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving the country. The Home Office reported a decrease in asylum seekers being housed in hotels, though the numbers are still higher than when Labour came to power. The government highlighted increased returns of failed asylum seekers and foreign national offenders, with the Home Secretary promising further reductions in net migration.</p>

This shift has undermined Netanyahu's reputation as a geopolitical genius, revealing him to be a bit player rather than an elite operator on the international stage.
