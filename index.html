          <p>The Trump Organization's merchandise website has begun selling 'TRUMP 2028' hats, fueling speculation about a potential third presidential run by Donald Trump. This follows Trump's earlier remarks teasing the possibility, despite constitutional limitations preventing a president from serving more than two terms. Experts note that any attempt to circumvent the 22nd Amendment would be unprecedented and legally dubious. Democrats have criticized the merchandise, viewing it as confirmation of Trump's intention to seek a fourth term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Ricardo Prada Vásquez, was deported to El Salvador after mistakenly crossing into Canada at the Ambassador Bridge while delivering food. U.S. authorities detained him when he attempted to re-enter, later claiming he was a member of a criminal organization, a claim disputed by immigration rights experts. Advocates are concerned about the lack of due process in this and similar cases, where individuals are being deported without proper oversight. The incident has sparked criticism from organizations like the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and political figures like Rep.

          <p>Warnings of retail shortages are circulating as CEOs express concerns about the impact of a prolonged trade war with China. Apparel and footwear are key consumer product areas to watch, with significant portions of U.S. imports originating from China. High tariff rates are expected to translate into product shortages as orders are canceled or goods are held in warehouses. Lower-end stores and products like toys, games, and budget home goods are likely to be affected first. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to fire or reassign employees who are experts in children's health. The reason given is that their job descriptions include work on environmental justice or diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Critics argue this is an unprecedented attack on children's health, eliminating expertise on issues ranging from wildfire smoke to lead abatement.</p>

The judge allowed the administration to enforce pre-existing laws related to voter database accessibility and action against states that do not require mail-in ballots to be received by election day.</p>
