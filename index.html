          <p>Lee Jae-myung, leader of South Korea's opposition party, has been elected president following the impeachment and removal of former leader Yoon Suk Yeol due to his controversial martial law imposition. Lee secured 49.42% of the vote, surpassing conservative candidate Kim Moon Soo's 41.15%. He will be immediately sworn in, foregoing the typical transition period, and will serve a five-year term, influencing trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies toward China and North Korea, while the Kospi index saw a surge and the South Korean won strengthened modestly. The article contextualizes Lee's victory within the political turmoil caused by Yoon's impeachment and highlights the challenges Lee faces in reviving South Korea's economy and negotiating trade agreements with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been warned by senior government watchdogs that he will fail to meet his target of halving violence against women and girls without significant investment in services. The Domestic Abuse Commissioner and Victims Commissioner jointly wrote to the Prime Minister, highlighting that victim support services are being pushed to the brink by funding cuts and rising costs. The intervention comes ahead of the chancellor's spending review, which is expected to feature cuts to some areas of public spending. Police chiefs have also cautioned Starmer that they will face stark choices about which crimes to investigate if their budgets are cut as expected.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025, with a year-on-year increase of 1.3%, unchanged from the previous quarter and below Reuters' estimated 1.5%. Quarter-on-quarter growth was 0.2%, also missing expectations of 0.4%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to reduced public spending, weakened consumer demand, and decreased exports, further exacerbated by extreme weather events impacting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia had previously cut rates to a two-year low in May, anticipating a gradual pickup in GDP growth driven by consumption recovery and public demand.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's easing of EPA regulations is raising concerns about air quality in Houston, Texas, particularly in low-income, minority communities near industrial plants. The administration has granted exemptions to plants from complying with federal regulations intended to lower mercury emissions, a potent neurotoxin. Studies indicate that pollution from these plants contributes to premature deaths and health risks such as lung disease, asthma, and heart attacks. Environmental advocacy groups argue that these regulatory rollbacks disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and prioritize energy production over public health.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Budget Bill Sparks Debate Over Healthcare Coverage</h2>

          <p>President Trump's budget bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is facing criticism for potentially causing millions of Americans to lose Medicaid coverage and health insurance. Critics argue that the bill represents a rollback of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), despite Republicans framing it as a measure to reduce waste and fraud in government health programs. The bill includes provisions that would make it harder for people to enroll in and maintain ACA coverage, leading to concerns about increased numbers of uninsured individuals. The proposed changes are intended to offset the cost of extending tax cuts, raising questions about the impact on healthcare access and affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

The BBC investigation revealed that the two boys who committed the August assault appeared in youth court in December charged with racially or religiously aggravated common assault.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits, potentially upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy. The proposed changes would suspend the issuance of new work permits to asylum-seekers until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeframe that would be difficult to meet given existing backlogs. Advocates argue that the rule could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, and drive them to work illegally in the underground economy. The administration argues the change would eliminate a magnet for migrants using the asylum system simply to work in the U.S.</p>
