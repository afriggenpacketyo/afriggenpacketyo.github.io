          <p>Professor Li Hongge's team at Beihang University in Beijing has achieved a breakthrough in computing by initiating mass production of a non-binary AI chip. This innovation merges binary and stochastic logic, leading to enhanced fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications such as touch displays and flight systems. This development also circumvents US chip restrictions, presenting a significant advancement in China's technological capabilities. The team's Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers, addressing challenges related to power consumption and communication with traditional systems. The implications of this technology could be far-reaching, influencing various sectors reliant on AI and computing power.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles experienced widespread protests sparked by rumors of immigration raids at a hardware store in Paramount, a predominantly Hispanic suburb. The unrest, fueled by misinformation, led to clashes between protesters and authorities, including the National Guard, who were deployed by President Trump. While the Department of Homeland Security denied the rumors of raids at the specific store, they confirmed that numerous migrants had been detained in the Los Angeles area. The events ignited a political dispute over immigration enforcement and the use of federal troops, with California's governor objecting to the deployment. The protests highlight the tensions surrounding immigration policies and their impact on communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Newsom are at odds over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, citing conflicting interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. This 1878 law generally prohibits the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, but it includes exceptions. Trump deployed the National Guard in response to reported attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, claiming that Newsom and the Los Angeles Mayor were not acting aggressively enough. Newsom, however, has requested the troops be returned to state command, arguing that the deployment is unlawful and inflames tensions.</p>

This balancing act has cost the country over £500 million this year alone, potentially reaching £8 billion a year by 2030.
