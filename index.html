          <p>The United States has expressed disappointment with Hamas' response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire agreement, stating that the response "only takes us backward." US officials indicated that Hamas is seeking alterations to the guarantees for a permanent end to the war, which has been a long-standing point of contention with Israel. Steve Witkoff, the US envoy to the Middle East, deemed Hamas' response unacceptable, urging them to accept the original framework for negotiations to proceed. The US maintains that Israel has already agreed to the terms of the proposed deal, which aims to establish a 60-day ceasefire. </p>

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to time delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers to compromise the satellite's quantum communication network. Quantum communication uses cryptography to encode data in single light particles, making it theoretically unhackable, but flaws in experimental implementation can create vulnerabilities. The researcher, Alexander Miller, analyzed data from Micius and found that the distribution of quantum keys was insecure due to these time delays.</p>

          <p>Eric Spofford, the former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers in New Hampshire, has been arrested for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to stalk journalists.

Spofford allegedly hired individuals to vandalize and threaten the journalists' homes. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Boston and faces charges related to the harassment campaign. </p>
