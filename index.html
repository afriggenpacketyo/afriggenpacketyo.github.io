          <p>A Senate Committee on Homeland Security report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or left unfulfilled at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. These requests included enhanced counter-drone systems and additional counter-sniper personnel. The report accuses the former Secret Service director of providing false testimony to Congress and highlights systemic communication failures that contributed to the preventable tragedy.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) announced that it has tracked down and "liquidated" two agents allegedly working for Russia's FSB after they resisted arrest. The operation followed the broad daylight assassination of a senior Ukrainian intelligence officer, Col Ivan Voronych, in a Kyiv car park. This event is part of an ongoing shadow war of targeted killings between the two nations since Russia's full-scale invasion, with both sides engaging in sabotage and assassination missions deep within enemy territory.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have successfully docked in geostationary orbit, potentially marking a historic first for autonomous satellite refueling. According to space-tracking firm COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged close-proximity operations, suggesting a docking maneuver for refueling, a feat the United States has not yet achieved. This development highlights China's growing capabilities in advanced space operations, which are being closely monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites.</p>

          <p>The seventh season of 'Love Island USA' is being analyzed for its notable shift in casting, which has de-emphasized whiteness and featured a more diverse group of contestants. The article explores how Black participants, particularly dark-skinned women, have navigated the show's dynamics and how producers have quietly handled off-screen controversies, such as the removal of castmates for past use of racial slurs. This season offers a complex look at race in reality TV, even as the show avoids directly addressing these issues on-air.</p>

          <p>German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil stated that while Germany and the EU are prepared to negotiate a fair trade deal with the U.S., they will not accept all terms and are readying "decisive countermeasures."

This highlights Germany's position of seeking a diplomatic solution while preparing for potential economic conflict. (not investment advice)</p>
