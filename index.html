          <p>The Russian government is preparing to increase taxes on both businesses and consumers to sustain its military spending amid a slowing economy. The Kremlin's 2026 draft budget proposes raising the VAT from 20% to 22% and includes other measures to fund the ongoing war in Ukraine without significantly increasing borrowing. This strategy effectively passes the war's financial burden onto the Russian public, as official forecasts predict economic growth will stutter to just 1.3% in 2026, a sharp decline from previous projections.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown enters its second day, former President Donald Trump has signaled an intent to reduce the federal workforce, instructing his OMB director to identify agencies for potential cuts. Referencing the controversial 'Project 2025' policy agenda, Trump described the shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to eliminate what he termed "dead wood, waste, and fraud." This move has been met with alarm by federal employee unions, as the administration suggests that furloughed employees could face permanent termination, a significant escalation from typical shutdown procedures.</p>

          <p>Deonte' Nash, a former stylist for Sean "Diddy" Combs, has filed a lawsuit alleging he endured a decade of physical and sexual abuse while employed by the music mogul. In his first television interview, Nash described living in constant fear for his life, stating he even prepared a bag with cash and clothes in case he needed to flee and hide. Combs' legal team has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "tabloid-style accusations" and expressing confidence that the truth will prevail in court, as it did in his recent criminal trial.</p>

          <p>Attendance at Walt Disney World has reportedly fallen to its lowest levels of the year, with crowd-tracking data from September showing the quietest period since 2021. Visitors on social media have described the parks as "ghost towns," with minimal to no wait times for major attractions like Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean. While Disney's financial reports indicate stable attendance, the on-the-ground reality has prompted the company to roll out aggressive deals to attract visitors during the traditionally slow post-Labor Day season.</p>

          <p>A terror attack at a synagogue in Manchester has left two people dead and three others in serious condition on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The assailant used a car to ram into people before launching a stabbing attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation. Armed police responded quickly, shooting the suspect, who is also believed to be dead but could not be immediately confirmed due to suspicious items on his person, prompting the deployment of a bomb disposal unit.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the ongoing government shutdown could harm the nation's economic growth.

His comments highlight the economic risks of a prolonged shutdown, particularly as the labor market shows signs of slowing and layoff announcements reach their highest level since 2020.

          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the groundbreaking primatologist whose research on wild chimpanzees transformed our understanding of the natural world, has died at the age of 91. Tributes have poured in from figures like Sir David Attenborough and Prince William, celebrating her pioneering spirit and tireless advocacy. Her discoveries in the 1960s, including that chimpanzees use tools, challenged conventional scientific thinking and she later dedicated her life to conservation and environmental activism, inspiring millions worldwide.</p>

          <p>The announcement that Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show is being analyzed as a significant cultural and business milestone. The choice reflects his immense global popularity, making him a logical pick for one of America's last shared cultural events. However, the selection of the politically outspoken, Spanish-language artist has also ignited a culture war, drawing praise for its representation and sharp criticism from conservative commentators who have called for a boycott.</p>

          <p>An article highlights Waymo's deliberate and slow-paced development of its robotaxi service as a successful counter-model to Silicon Valley's typical "move fast and break things" ethos. In contrast to competitors, Waymo has spent over a decade cautiously testing and gathering data, resulting in a strong safety record with significantly fewer accidents than human-driven vehicles. This methodical approach demonstrates an alternative path for developing high-stakes AI technologies where safety, rather than speed, is the primary goal.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has introduced a suite of parental controls for ChatGPT, but some child safety experts argue the measures fall short of addressing a key danger: children forming unhealthy emotional dependencies on AI companions. The new features, which allow parents to connect to their children's accounts and filter sensitive content, place the burden of safety on parents rather than building it into the platform by default. This development comes as OpenAI launches a new AI-powered video app, raising further questions about the tech industry's commitment to protecting young users.</p>

This move is part of a broader crackdown on dissent, as other senior figures in the anti-war Yabloko party have also recently faced charges and been designated as "foreign agents" by the authorities.</p>

          <p>Relations between Chelsea's ownership and its fanbase have soured due to significant increases in ticket prices and a perceived failure to tackle ticket touting. The Chelsea Supporters' Trust has condemned a 77.5% price hike for Champions League tickets compared to last season's European games, accusing the club of exploiting fan loyalty. The issue reflects a broader trend across the Premier League, where rising costs and difficulty in accessing tickets are alienating core supporters and harming the matchday atmosphere.</p>

          <p>For the first time, Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, has declared a race a 'heat hazard' ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix. This new designation, triggered by predictions of extreme heat and humidity, means teams may be required to fit their cars with a driver cooling system. While use of the cooling vests is not mandatory for drivers, the rule aims to ensure safety in one of the most physically demanding races on the calendar, though drivers have offered mixed feedback on the system's comfort and effectiveness.</p>

Data shows multiple electrical faults occurred in the hard-hit Altadena neighborhood throughout the day, and fire departments were dispatched at least 35 times for electrical problems. Despite these warning signs, the utility, Southern California Edison, did not implement a power shutoff for most of the circuits serving the community.</p>

          <p>The director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Todd Arrington, has resigned following a reported dispute with the Trump administration over a gift for King Charles III. Sources indicate Arrington resisted a request to remove an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection to be presented to the monarch during a state visit. Although a replica was ultimately sourced from West Point, the disagreement over giving away a historical artifact owned by the American people is said to have led to Arrington's departure.</p>

          <p>A new study in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that the alarming rise in cancer diagnoses among adults under 50 may be partly a "diagnostic mirage." Researchers found that while the incidence rate for eight common cancers has nearly doubled since 1990, the death rate has remained flat. This suggests that increased and more sensitive screening methods are detecting many early-stage cancers that might never have become clinically significant or life-threatening, leading to a phenomenon of overdiagnosis.</p>

This stance from the military leadership on the ground presents a major obstacle, even as some political leaders in Qatar were reportedly open to the proposal with adjustments.</p>
