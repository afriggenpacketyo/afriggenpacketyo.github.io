          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 00:07:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) dropped by 3.6% in June year-over-year, its most significant decline in almost two years, indicating deepening deflationary pressures. This drop was steeper than economists' forecasts and continues a long-term deflationary trend since September 2022. While the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight rebound, concerns remain about persistent overcapacity and intense price wars among manufacturers, which are eroding business profitability despite government efforts to regulate aggressive price-cutting. The economic challenges persist as weak consumer demand and a struggling property sector continue to weigh on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a massive 1,856-kilometer green belt, effectively containing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts in Inner Mongolia. This significant environmental project aims to combat desertification across a vast area of nearly 95,000 square kilometers. Engineers utilized a method involving straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by the planting of drought-resistant trees like sacsaoul. This achievement is part of China's broader 'green great wall' initiative to build a robust ecological barrier and control sand-related environmental issues.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Donald Trump has approved the provision of defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move he had previously resisted. During a cabinet meeting, the president expressed his displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a potential strain in their relationship. This decision comes after weeks of rejecting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's requests for defense support. The article questions the motivations behind this sudden change in strategy, while also noting other concurrent events, such as another meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and announcements of further tariffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to continue its plan for extensive layoffs across the federal government. The court lifted a lower court's injunction, which had temporarily halted the job cuts while legal challenges proceeded. This ruling means that terminations can occur even as the underlying legal cases are still being adjudicated in lower courts. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole public dissenter, warning of mass terminations and the potential dismantling of federal government services as established by Congress.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has handed down lengthy prison sentences to 21 individuals, including prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi, in a mass trial. The charges included inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government, though defense lawyers claim the accusations are based on false testimony. Ghannouchi, leader of the Ennahda party, received a 14-year term, adding to previous sentences. This event is part of a broader crackdown on dissent by President Kais Saied, who has been accused by activists of undermining the country's democracy since dissolving parliament in 2021.</p>

          <p>The city and county of Los Angeles, along with several other local governments, are attempting to join a lawsuit aimed at halting what they describe as unconstitutional federal immigration raids. The lawsuit, initiated by the ACLU, claims that ongoing sweeps by federal agents are creating fear and disrupting communities. Officials argue that the raids obstruct local law enforcement and harm the economy. This legal action comes as the Department of Homeland Security's operation in the region has led to thousands of arrests, escalating tensions between local authorities and the Trump administration over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court alleges they have committed the crime against humanity of persecution based on gender, specifically targeting girls and women in Afghanistan. The charges detail the severe deprivation of fundamental rights, including education, movement, and expression, since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. A Taliban spokesman dismissed the warrants as 'nonsense,' but the move represents a significant international legal condemnation of the regime's policies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced that its aggressive immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles has resulted in nearly 2,800 arrests since it began in June. The new figures show a significant increase in detentions, with almost 1,200 arrests occurring in just over two weeks. The operation, which has involved federal agents, the National Guard, and U.S. Marines, has been heavily criticized by local and state officials.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on imported copper, a move that follows a national security investigation into the metal's imports. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, construction, and electric vehicles. The decision is part of a broader strategy to use tariffs to protect and promote American industries, with similar investigations underway for other sectors. The announcement caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high, and the new tax is expected to take effect by the end of the month. (not investment advice)</p>
