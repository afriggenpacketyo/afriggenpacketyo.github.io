        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has publicly demanded the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following allegations of mortgage fraud. The call to action came after Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, urged the Department of Justice to launch a criminal investigation into Cook. Pulte alleges that Cook falsified documents to secure more favorable loan terms on properties in Michigan and Georgia. This event is part of a broader context of Trump's escalating pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve and its officials, aiming to influence interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>A decision on whether Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, will face trial on a terror charge has been delayed until late September. Ó hAnnaidh is accused of displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London concert, a charge he denies, claiming the case is politically motivated to silence the group. His defense team is seeking to have the case dismissed due to a procedural error regarding the timing of the charge. The rapper, who remains on unconditional bail, addressed supporters outside the court, framing the case as a distraction from the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that executives from voting machine company Smartmatic transferred funds from a Los Angeles County contract into slush funds previously used for bribing election officials in Venezuela and the Philippines. While the filing does not claim LA officials were bribed, it aims to establish a pattern of corrupt behavior in an ongoing case against the executives. Smartmatic, which is separately suing Fox News for defamation, denies the allegations, stating it operates ethically. The revelations add to long-standing concerns among election integrity activists about the company's history and its contracts in the U.S.</p>

In an interview with a state-affiliated broadcaster, he commented on the advantage of his field, theoretical mathematics, which allows for academic pursuits without being tied to a specific geographic location.

This strategic move addresses the decline in cable subscribers, which has impacted a key revenue source for the company. The new service, priced at $29.99 per month, aims to capture the growing market of consumers who have shifted to streaming platforms for their entertainment.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the University of Florida and University College London indicates that daily reading for pleasure among U.S. adults has dropped by over 40% since 2003. Researchers attribute this steady decline to the rise of digital media and an overall decrease in leisure time. The study, analyzing data from the American Time Use Survey, highlights a concerning trend given that leisure reading is linked to improved well-being and mental health. While the percentage of people reading has fallen, those who do read are reportedly doing so for longer durations.</p>

The ruling was based on the local council's argument that the hotel's change of use breached planning controls and negatively impacted the community's character, citing fears of crime and protests. While the judge clarified that lawful protests cannot veto planning rules, he acknowledged that the council provided evidence of harm to the local "amenity."

The investment aims to prevent production bottlenecks for generators, which are critical components that work alongside the turbines.

The changes reportedly include aggressive reversals of previous policies, the initiation of investigations into Trump's political adversaries, and the dismissal of staff members.

          <p>Homeowners with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the coming months. Because HELOC rates are typically tied to the prime rate, which follows the federal funds rate, a cut by the Fed usually translates to lower interest charges. However, mortgage experts note that the timing of this relief can vary based on the lender's adjustment schedule and the borrower's billing cycle. Homeowners are advised to review their loan terms to understand their specific rate index, margin, and any potential rate floors that could limit savings.</p>

          <p>A year after the brutal sexual assault and murder of a trainee doctor in a Kolkata hospital sparked nationwide protests, many question whether meaningful change has occurred. The incident led to a women's social justice movement and government initiatives aimed at protecting female night-shift workers, though activists report that implementation has been partial. The sole suspect was convicted and sentenced to life, but the victim's family alleges police harassment and flaws in the investigation. Despite new safety measures, recent incidents of sexual violence have raised ongoing concerns about the safety of women in public and professional spaces.</p>

          <p>BBC Verify has analyzed President Donald Trump's recent claims of having ended six or seven wars during his second term, a statement made while he attempts to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The report examines several conflicts where the Trump administration was involved in peace or ceasefire negotiations, including between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and Armenia and Azerbaijan. While Trump played a role in de-escalating some tensions, the analysis notes that some of the deals are fragile, some conflicts were short-lived, and his level of direct influence is debated by the parties involved.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has downplayed the possibility of an imminent meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, despite a renewed diplomatic push by U.S. President Donald Trump. After meeting with Putin and European leaders, Trump suggested it might be better for the two leaders to meet directly first, but conceded that Putin may not be interested in a deal. Russian officials have reiterated that any such summit would require extensive preparation and should not be just for show, signaling little interest in direct talks while their military holds an advantage on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a directive for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officials to investigate applicants for immigration benefits for any "anti-American" views or activities. This new policy expands the criteria for denying discretionary benefits like green cards and work permits, instructing officials to consider any espoused anti-American or terrorist-linked views as a significant negative factor. The guidance defines these views based on a law that bars advocates of communism or totalitarianism from becoming citizens. This move represents a further tightening of the legal immigration system under the current administration.</p>

          <p>French authorities have arrested a man on suspicion of murder after four bodies were discovered in the River Seine near Choisy-le-Roi, a suburb southeast of Paris. The investigation began when a passer-by spotted the first victim on August 13, leading police to find three more bodies nearby. Prosecutors have revealed that one victim was strangled and another showed signs of violent injuries, though the other two bodies were in an advanced state of decomposition. Police have not released details about the suspect or confirmed a link between the victims at this stage of the investigation.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has proposed a radical restructuring of professional rugby in Wales, suggesting that cutting the number of elite clubs from four to two is the best option for the sport's future. This controversial plan, presented as the "optimal choice" among four models, would put the existing clubs—Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys, and Scarlets—at risk. The WRU argues that this change is necessary to create a financially sustainable and competitive model, with the two remaining teams receiving significantly higher budgets. The proposal is now entering a consultation period and is expected to face strong opposition from the current regional teams.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates this fall will be shaped by four primary factors: Federal Reserve policy, inflation and labor data, investment activity, and broader geopolitical events. While the Fed's decisions on the federal funds rate are influential, it is their future projections and commentary that most directly move the market. Key economic indicators like the Consumer Price Index and jobs reports will guide the Fed's stance. Additionally, investor demand for mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds, along with global events affecting economic stability, will play a crucial role in determining the direction of rates for homebuyers.</p>

          <p>Some farmers in Florida are significantly reducing their crop production due to a severe labor shortage driven by President Trump's aggressive immigration policies. Mass detentions and deportations have caused many migrant workers, who form a crucial part of the agricultural workforce, to leave the state or go into hiding. Farmers report being unable to hire enough workers through the H2A visa program due to rising costs, leaving them with no choice but to scale back operations. Agricultural economists warn that this trend could negatively impact the U.S. economy and raise concerns about the nation's food supply chain.</p>

          <p>Food and non-alcoholic drink prices in the UK rose by 4.9% in the year to July, driven by a combination of climate-related issues and global instability. Drought in the UK has led to lower crop yields, while extreme weather abroad has increased the wholesale cost of imports like coffee and cocoa. The ongoing war in Ukraine continues to disrupt supply chains, and rising domestic costs, such as the minimum wage, are also contributing factors. Economists note that these price hikes disproportionately affect low-income families, who spend a larger portion of their budget on essential food items.</p>
