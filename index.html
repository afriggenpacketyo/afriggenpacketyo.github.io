          <p>Judge Hannah Dugan of Milwaukee County was arrested by the FBI for allegedly obstructing an ICE operation by misdirecting federal agents and allowing an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, to evade arrest. Dugan faces criminal charges of obstructing a proceeding and concealing an individual, sparking protests and criticism from Wisconsin officials who view the arrest as an overreach. The complaint alleges Dugan escorted Flores-Ruiz out of the courtroom through a nonpublic area after learning ICE officers were present to arrest him for pending domestic abuse charges. Flores-Ruiz, previously deported in 2013, was later apprehended after a brief chase. Optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Amid turmoil and scrutiny surrounding Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the White House is looking to "right the ship" at the Pentagon by appointing new senior staff. This follows the resignation or firing of five senior advisers due to in-fighting and alleged leaks. The new appointments include Col. Ricky Buria, Justin Fulcher, Patrick Weaver, and Sean Parnell, who have limited experience in government. The absence of a chief of staff could hinder progress at the Pentagon, which manages a vast workforce and handles critical decisions. Optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>Amazon sellers have raised prices on nearly 1,000 products since early April, with an average increase of nearly 30%, due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports.
