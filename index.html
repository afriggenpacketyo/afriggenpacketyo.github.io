          <h2>Global Central Banks Navigate Currency Values Amidst Weaker Dollar</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 22:29:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is causing both relief and concern for central banks worldwide, as uncertainty in U.S. policymaking prompts a shift away from the dollar and Treasuries. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens for emerging markets and reduce inflation by making imports cheaper, it also poses challenges to export competitiveness, especially with renewed U.S. tariffs. Some central banks may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, but this carries risks like capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. administration, leading most to avoid a currency war.

          <p>The stock market experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all fell significantly as investors grappled with tariff uncertainty and awaited tech companies' earnings reports. The dollar index weakened, while gold reached a record high, signaling investor concerns about the safety of U.S. assets. Analysts attribute the market's decline to weakening confidence among global investors due to assaults on the Fed's independence and increasing concerns about the global order.
