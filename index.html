          <p>Moody's Ratings lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, highlighting the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and the rising costs of debt rollover due to high interest rates. The rating agency pointed out the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address large annual fiscal deficits. This downgrade could potentially lead to higher yields on U.S. Treasury debt and dampen sentiment towards U.S. assets, though major credit rating agencies still give the U.S. their second-highest rating. The article notes Moody's expectation that federal deficits will widen significantly by 2035 if the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended.</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court extended a temporary injunction against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants, remanding the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court found that the government had not provided the migrants with sufficient time or information to contest their removals.

The woman, Adriana Smith, was declared brain-dead in February but is 21 weeks pregnant, and doctors say they are not allowed to remove life support because the state law bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. The family is upset that they cannot make medical decisions for their daughter, while legal experts debate whether the law requires life support in this case.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article details how Republican efforts in Washington are challenging Democratic-led states' immigrant programs, which provide benefits such as health care and in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants. President Trump and congressional Republicans are using various levers to penalize states that offer these benefits, driven by the belief that such programs incentivize illegal immigration. This has created a split among Democrats, with some advocating for continued support for undocumented immigrants while others propose scaling back benefits due to budgetary concerns and political pressures.</p>

Moody's pointed to decades of gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, with both Democrats and Republicans failing to address rising debt and underfunded programs.
