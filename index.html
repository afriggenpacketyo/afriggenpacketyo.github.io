        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing significant tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, e-commerce giants Temu and Shein are expected to remain competitive in the U.S. market. These companies are implementing strategies such as onboarding American sellers, shifting manufacturing to countries like Turkey and Mexico, and utilizing local warehouses to mitigate tariff impacts. Experts believe their agility and ability to operate on thin margins will allow them to continue offering competitive prices compared to American retailers, even with increased costs. The article notes that Temu and Shein's success is also attributed to their agile supply chains and ability to adapt quickly to consumer trends. The closure of the de minimis rule, which previously exempted imports under $800 from tariffs, has led to price increases, but experts suggest these companies can still compete effectively.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 01:43:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is set to unveil a plan to eliminate all Russian gas deliveries by 2027, marking a significant shift from its previous reliance on Russia as a top gas supplier. The move comes in response to Russia's war in Ukraine, prompting the EU to seek alternative energy sources and ways to allow companies to withdraw from existing contracts. However, legal experts caution that such withdrawals could incur penalties or arbitration due to "take or pay" contracts. Currently, the EU imports approximately 19% of its gas from Russia, a substantial decrease from the 40% in 2022. The plan's success hinges on approval from the EU parliament and potentially a majority of member states, with some countries like Hungary and Slovakia hesitant to support the measure.</p>

          <p>Sean Carroll, president of American Near East Refugee Aid, reports a catastrophic humanitarian emergency in Gaza, exacerbated by Israel's ongoing blockade of aid and commercial supplies. Two million Palestinians, nearly half of them children, are surviving on minimal meals every few days, and signs of starvation are increasingly prevalent in makeshift clinics. Carroll accuses Israel of exploiting aid as a tool of war, violating international law and potentially aiming to expel Palestinians from Gaza. He calls for immediate resumption of humanitarian aid, secure corridors, and a political agreement guaranteeing Palestinian presence, security, and self-determination, emphasizing that sustainable peace requires dignity, freedom, opportunity, and mutual security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from receiving new federal grants, alleging antisemitism and criticizing its diversity policies. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Harvard has failed its "legal obligations" and will not receive new grants until it demonstrates responsible management. This action follows similar measures against other universities, including Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, amid protests related to the war in Gaza. Harvard has vowed to fight what it calls an "illegal government overreach," arguing that the administration's demands would impose unprecedented and improper control over the university, stifling research and innovation.</p>

While comparisons to Messi are premature, Yamal's stats indicate a promising start, surpassing Messi's and Cristiano Ronaldo's achievements at the same age. However, experts caution that matching Messi's incredible record will be a significant challenge, even for a player with Yamal's talent.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from GOP-led states seeking to restrict telehealth access to abortion medication mifepristone, maintaining the legal stance of the Biden administration on the issue. The lawsuit, filed by Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri, challenges the FDA's regulations on mifepristone access. Justice Department attorneys argue that the states lack the legal standing to sue, challenging actions taken by the FDA in 2016 and exceeding the statute of limitations. The case is before U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Texas, a Trump nominee who previously ruled in favor of halting approval for the drug.</p>

Bukele accused them of "sabotaging the country," despite the government's claim of covering their usual daily income. The arrests, another instance of Bukele's authoritarian tactics, drew criticism for undermining democratic institutions and due process. This action occurs amidst broader concerns over Bukele's human rights record, including the detention of Venezuelan deportees and alleged constitutional violations.

While the dismissals may be related to corruption, they also indicate a lack of trust and control within the People‚Äôs Liberation Army.

          <p>Friedrich Merz will be sworn in as Germany's next chancellor, leading a coalition government facing significant economic and political challenges, including a stagnant economy, strained U.S. relations, and the rise of the far-right AfD. Merz's cabinet choices reflect a mix of experienced politicians and private sector leaders, aiming to bring fresh perspectives to government. The new government will also have to address issues such as energy costs, infrastructure, and security. Despite potential policy differences, the coalition partners are united by a desire to prevent further gains by the AfD, increasing the likelihood of a stable government.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's next chancellor, inheriting a nation facing economic stagnation, strained relations with the United States, and a rising nationalist party. Despite his lack of executive experience, Merz is attempting to address these challenges by criticizing President Trump, engaging with foreign counterparts, and adjusting fiscal policies to increase defense spending. While supporters praise his agility and thoughtful approach, critics point to his broken promises and declining popularity. Merz's appointment reflects a conservative shift in German politics, but his ability to navigate these complex issues remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>China's largest trade fair, the Canton Fair, achieved a record high in overseas attendance, driving a surprise growth in deals signed despite the threat of a trade war with the U.S. The fair's success has boosted confidence in China's export sector and its ability to cope with prolonged trade tensions. Transaction volume rose by 3% year-on-year, with a significant portion of foreign visitors coming from countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative. The performance is seen as a positive indicator for China's foreign trade and manufacturing trends, although transaction volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a key driver of the nation's economy, faces a significant threat from potential U.S. tariffs, jeopardizing its recovery from recent economic and political instability. President Trump's proposed tariffs could disrupt Bangladesh's exports, which heavily rely on the U.S. market, and undermine the progress made in improving factory conditions and worker welfare. The potential tariffs come at a vulnerable time for Bangladesh, as the country grapples with a currency crisis and pressures from the IMF to reduce subsidies. The garment industry, which employs millions of Bangladeshis, has transformed itself to meet international standards and now faces a new challenge to its stability and growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to end a tariff loophole, known as the de minimis exemption, is expected to significantly impact delivery companies like UPS and FedEx, which have benefited from the influx of low-value shipments from China. The closure of this loophole, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to enter the U.S. without tariffs, could lead to a sharp decline in shipments and revenue for these companies. While the administration has issued a waiver to ease customs rules, analysts predict that logistics companies may struggle to compensate for the lost sales, and the move could shake airlines that heavily rely on air cargo shipments from China.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA, citing a "mess" at Newark Airport and across the East Coast due to air traffic controller shortages and equipment outages. The FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area" due to staffing shortages at a Philadelphia air traffic control center, leading to delays and cancellations. Schumer pointed to nationwide air traffic controller shortages, cuts at the FAA due to the Department of Government Efficiency, old technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors. The situation has prompted United Airlines to cut 35 roundtrip flights daily at Newark, and officials are calling for urgent action to address the systemic issues.</p>
