          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth addressed Asian military officials at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, warning of China's "imminent" threat to Taiwan and its ambition to become a "hegemonic power" in Asia. Hegseth urged Asian countries to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war, referencing President Xi Jinping's alleged 2027 deadline for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. He assured that the US does not seek conflict with China but will defend its allies and partners, emphasizing the need for a strong deterrent shield and cautioning against economic ties with Beijing that could be used as leverage. Hegseth also promoted US military hardware and a new Indo-Pacific partnership for defense industrial resilience. Optimism surrounding this news is relatively low due to the increased tensions and the potential for military conflict. </p>

          <p>Doug Schoen, a Harvard graduate, discusses the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard University, focusing on concerns about antisemitism and far-left orthodoxy on campus. Schoen acknowledges the need for reforms at Harvard, particularly regarding its Diversity, Education, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts, which led to the Supreme Court striking down its admissions criteria. He highlights recent incidents, including the Harvard Law Review awarding a grant to a student charged with assaulting an Israeli student, and the revocation of tenure for a professor accused of falsifying data. Schoen suggests targeted approaches to force necessary changes without harming America's scientific prowess, noting that Trump's demands have spurred Harvard to take some steps toward change. The tone of this article is neutral, reflecting a balanced view of the issues. </p>

          <p>US immigration authorities are collecting and uploading DNA information of migrants, including children, to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (Codis), a national criminal database. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) is creating detailed DNA profiles on migrants, regardless of accusations of felonies, leading to concerns about a "massive expansion of genetic surveillance." Since 2020, CBP has added over 1.5 million DNA profiles to Codis, a 5,000% increase, with over 133,000 profiles belonging to migrant teens and children, some as young as four. Experts argue this practice reinforces harmful narratives about immigrants and intensifies policing practices that target immigrant communities. This initiative raises significant privacy concerns and ethical questions regarding the indefinite storage and potential misuse of genetic information. </p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is scheduled for trial in August, facing a potential death sentence. The case has encountered difficulties, including the prosecution's failure to establish a motive and intense media coverage that Kohberger's attorneys argue is prejudicial. Leaks to the media, such as information about Kohberger's phone activity and internet searches, have prompted the defense to request a trial delay. The judge has ruled against the defense on several evidentiary matters, including the admissibility of Kohberger's Amazon purchase history and a master's essay on handling a crime scene. The absence of a clear motive from prosecutors raises questions about the strength of their case. </p>

          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, underwent an MRI that revealed a second chordoma on her spine. Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a novel surgical plan, approaching the spinal tumor through Flores' eye, a procedure he called the "third nostril" approach. The surgery involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor, which was then successfully removed. Flores underwent radiation and rehabilitative therapy and is now cancer-free, and Labib hopes this technique can be used for other difficult-to-reach tumors. </p>

          <p>The Mission: Impossible franchise, initially defined by its lack of continuity and diverse directorial styles, has shifted towards a stricter canon, culminating in the latest installment, *The Final Reckoning*. Early films in the series, directed by Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird, were stand-alone stories that showcased each director's unique vision. However, recent films have become more interconnected, sacrificing the unpredictability and creative freedom that characterized the earlier installments. The shift reflects a broader trend in big-budget filmmaking towards cinematic universes and interconnected narratives, potentially diminishing the franchise's original appeal. </p>

DeRomero initially claimed two masked men stole her van containing $60,000 worth of fitness merchandise, but her story unraveled after multiple interviews with investigators. Authorities located the abandoned van and a storage locker with the stolen merchandise, leading to charges of insurance fraud and filing a false police report against DeRomero and Ledezma.

          <p>At least 151 people have died after heavy rainfall caused severe flooding in Mokwa, a market town in north-central Nigeria, with over 3,000 people displaced. The flooding, affecting 500 households across three communities, left residents waist-deep in water and caused extensive damage. President Bola Tinubu has activated the national emergency response center to provide assistance. The disaster underscores the increasing vulnerability of northern Nigerian communities to climate change-related extreme weather events. </p>

          <p>Consumers are taking a more cautious approach to summer vacations this year due to economic uncertainty and recession fears. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, they are scaling back their spending plans, according to a Deloitte report. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, opting to stay with family and friends, and choosing to drive instead of fly. Despite lower travel costs, overall spending is affected by inflation, leading to a more frugal approach to summer travel. </p>

          <p>President Trump has sparked controversy by pardoning several convicted drug offenders, including Larry Hoover, despite his tough stance on drug trafficking and calls for harsher penalties. The pardons have been met with mixed reactions, with some critics questioning the logic behind releasing high-level drug dealers while advocating for stricter drug laws. Some experts suggest Trump's pardons are transactional, influenced by powerful individuals, while others view them as a step towards addressing the harms of the drug war. The pardons contrast with Trump's broader tough-on-crime rhetoric and efforts to dismantle health services. </p>
