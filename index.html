          <p>AI software company Palantir reported its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, significantly surpassing Wall Street expectations. The company's revenue grew 48% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in its U.S. government and commercial sectors. As a result of this strong performance and a 140% increase in contract value, Palantir has raised its full-year revenue guidance and lifted its outlook for operating income and free cash flow. The company's stock has more than doubled this year, reflecting investor confidence in its AI tools and government contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

This proposal targets individuals from countries with high rates of visa overstays and inadequate document security. The measure is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to tighten immigration and visa requirements. The bond requirement would not apply to citizens from the 42 countries in the Visa Waiver Program, and could be waived based on individual circumstances.</p>

          <p>Air quality alerts are active across the U.S. Northeast and Upper Midwest due to smoke from Canada's second-worst wildfire season on record. Health experts compare the risk of breathing the polluted air to smoking up to half a pack of cigarettes a day, noting a significant increase in emergency room visits for respiratory and cardiovascular issues. The article advises the public to limit outdoor exposure, use air filters, and wear N95 masks if outside, as climate change is expected to make such events more frequent. The toxic mix from burning synthetic materials in homes and cars adds to the health dangers.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled Texas House has voted to authorize law enforcement to civilly arrest Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state police to find and return the absent Democrats, though the warrants are not enforceable outside of Texas. The move is a dramatic escalation in a political showdown over a GOP-led effort, supported by former President Trump, to redraw congressional maps in a way that could create up to five new Republican seats. The absent Democrats are holding events in other states to draw national attention to their protest.</p>

          <p>Flaco Jiménez, the celebrated Tex-Mex accordionist who died at 86, is being remembered for his profound musical influence and his often-overlooked political engagement. Known for collaborations with artists like the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, Jiménez also used his music to support civil rights and social causes. The article highlights his 1976 performance of "Un Mojado Sin Licencia" ("A Wetback Without a License"), a song that uses humor to critique American xenophobia and the struggles of undocumented immigrants. This approach of finding joy and defiance in the face of hardship is presented as a powerful form of resistance.</p>

          <p>After the Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) reported weaker-than-expected job growth for July and revised previous months' data downward, former President Donald Trump fired the agency's commissioner. Trump, who had previously praised positive BLS reports, claimed without evidence that the latest figures were "rigged." The dismissal of Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, who was confirmed with bipartisan support, marks an escalation in his criticism of official government data. This action raises concerns about the politicization of independent government statistical agencies.</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health saw its stock fall significantly after its second-quarter revenue of $544.8 million failed to meet Wall Street's expectations. Although revenue grew 73% year-over-year and the company was profitable, the miss and a cautious third-quarter forecast concerned investors. The company has also faced controversy regarding its sale of compounded GLP-1 weight loss drugs, an issue that led to the collapse of a partnership with drugmaker Novo Nordisk.

          <p>A new report from the nonprofit Circulate San Diego identifies third-party permitting requirements as a significant cause for delays and budget increases in California's transit projects, including the high-speed rail. The report argues that policies originally designed to prevent disruptive highway construction are now hindering the development of public transit intended to connect communities. It highlights how disputes between transit authorities and various local jurisdictions can prolong timelines by years. A proposed state bill aims to address this by setting time limits for third-party project approvals, similar to models used in Canada.</p>

          <p>Beth Hammack, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, has warned that U.S. inflation could rise as businesses begin passing the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs on to consumers. Many companies had initially absorbed these costs or used stockpiled inventory, but are now facing squeezed profit margins. Hammack noted the existence of a "two-speed economy," where high-income individuals are thriving while lower-income households struggle with rising living costs. This potential for inflation complicates the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates, especially amid recent signs of a slowing labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

While some White House officials remain optimistic, the weak labor data has increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates.

          <p>The Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has made a public appeal for people to donate their unwanted but healthy pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs, to be used as food for its predators. The zoo states that this practice helps imitate the natural food chain for its carnivores, including lions and tigers, by providing a diet with fur and bones. According to the zoo, the donated animals are "gently euthanised" by trained staff before being fed to the predators. This practice, while unusual, is described by the zoo as common in Denmark and a way to ensure the large carnivores receive a natural diet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called for police forces to be obligated to release the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes. His comments came in response to the case of two men, reported to be Afghan nationals, charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton. Farage argued that withholding such information fuels online conspiracy theories and public unrest, similar to the aftermath of a deadly attack in Southport last year. Current national police guidance does not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after they have been charged.</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of mystery, researchers have identified the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has killed billions of the animals along the U.S. West Coast since 2013. A study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution pinpoints a specific bacterium, *Vibrio pectinocida*, as the culprit. The epidemic was particularly devastating for the sunflower sea star, a keystone species whose population collapse led to an explosion of sea urchins and the destruction of vital kelp forests. This discovery is a major breakthrough, enabling the development of diagnostic tests and targeted conservation strategies to help restore these critical marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The UK Cabinet Office has appointed business leader Moni Mannings to chair a new diversity and outreach committee for the national honours system. The move aims to make the process of awarding honours like knighthoods more inclusive and representative of the entire country. This follows a BBC analysis showing that higher awards disproportionately go to individuals in southern England and from wealthier backgrounds. The new committee will advise the government and encourage a wider range of nominations from under-represented regions and communities to ensure the system celebrates excellence from all walks of life.</p>

          <p>The recent walkout by Texas Democratic lawmakers to block a Republican redistricting plan is a high-stakes political maneuver known as "breaking quorum." This article analyzes the tactic's history and effectiveness, noting its increasing use amid rising partisanship in both state and national politics. While walkouts can successfully delay legislation and draw national attention to an issue, they rarely block it permanently, as a governor can call repeated special sessions. Past instances in Texas, Oregon, and Minnesota have had mixed results, sometimes leading to negotiations but also risking fines and other penalties for the absent lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has granted CEO Elon Musk an interim stock award worth approximately $29 billion in an effort to incentivize him to remain with the company. This "good faith" payment is intended to honor a 2018 pay package worth over $50 billion that was voided by a Delaware court last year. The new award is contingent on Musk staying in a top executive role for two more years and the original package not being reinstated on appeal. The move comes as Tesla faces declining sales and increased competition, with the board emphasizing Musk's importance for talent retention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order in a Louisiana redistricting case suggests the conservative majority may be preparing to weaken or strike down key protections against racial gerrymandering. The case, *Louisiana v. Callais*, is nearly identical to a 2023 Alabama case where the Court upheld the Voting Rights Act's power to challenge such maps. However, the Court has now asked for new briefings on whether the law's safeguards are themselves unconstitutional, signaling a potential reversal. This move could eliminate one of the last remaining legal tools to fight gerrymandering, following a 2019 decision that barred federal courts from hearing challenges to purely partisan maps.</p>
