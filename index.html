          <p>The Trump administration has officially implemented a new trade deal with Japan by signing an executive order that establishes a baseline 15% tariff on most Japanese imports, including automobiles. As part of the agreement, Japan has committed to investing $550 billion in U.S.-selected projects and increasing its purchases of American agricultural and defense products. The deal comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces growing political pressure and discontent within his own party. The new tariffs are expected to significantly impact Japan's auto sector and the global supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has reported that two Venezuelan military aircraft conducted a "highly provocative" flyover near a U.S. Navy vessel operating in international waters. This action is viewed by U.S. officials as a deliberate show of force intended to interfere with American counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean. The incident follows a recent U.S. military strike on a vessel suspected of carrying drug smugglers, escalating tensions between the two nations. The Defense Department has issued a strong warning to Venezuela against any further obstruction of its military activities in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on imported semiconductors to encourage companies to move manufacturing operations to the United States. During a White House dinner with tech industry leaders, he indicated that companies like Apple, which have already pledged significant domestic investments, would likely be exempt from these new levies. While major chip manufacturers such as TSMC and Samsung have committed to building U.S. plants, the specific details and scope of the tariff exemptions remain unclear. The move is part of a broader effort to onshore the nation's critical semiconductor supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a rare public appearance at Lincoln Center, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the pointed language she used toward Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent majority opinion. The opinion, which banned the use of universal injunctions by lower courts, saw Barrett accuse Jackson of subscribing to an "imperial judiciary." Barrett stated that Jackson's dissent was made in strong terms that warranted a direct response, clarifying that her critique was aimed at ideas, not the person. She emphasized that despite their disagreements on judicial power, the justices maintain amicable professional relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Defense is planning to detail up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges in an effort to address a backlog of over 3.4 million cases. The move, requested by the Justice Department, would require these Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps officers to undergo training in complex immigration law. Critics, including the American Immigration Lawyers Association, have expressed concern that military lawyers lack the specific expertise for such roles, potentially undermining due process.

          <p>A jury has convicted Donna Adelson of first-degree murder for orchestrating the 2014 killing of her former son-in-law, Florida State University law professor Daniel Markel. Prosecutors successfully argued that Adelson arranged the murder-for-hire plot after Markel prevented his ex-wife from moving their children from Tallahassee to South Florida. The case, which has drawn national attention for over a decade, involved a bitter custody dispute and a wealthy family's efforts to control the situation. Adelson is the fifth person to be convicted in connection with the crime, with her son already serving a life sentence.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense, reverting to its historical title, the 'Department of War.' The order will establish 'Department of War' as a secondary title, allowing officials like the Secretary of Defense to use the corresponding title of 'Secretary of War.' This change, which Trump argues projects a stronger image, returns the department to the name it held until 1949, following World War II. While a permanent name change requires congressional action, the executive order aims to implement the rebranding across the administration immediately.</p>

The name was updated from 'War Department' to 'Defense Department' in 1947 by leaders like Harry Truman, who understood that post-WWII national security required a constant state of defense, not just discrete periods of war. The author contends that the change reflects a simplistic obsession with appearing tough, disregarding the strategic thinking of past presidents who led the nation through major conflicts.

          <p>Sam Mihara, a 92-year-old survivor of the Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming, recently returned to the site to share his family's painful history. During World War II, Mihara and over 120,000 other Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from their homes and imprisoned in internment camps. He recounted how his family lost their home, his father went blind due to inadequate medical care, and his grandfather died at the camp. Mihara emphasizes the racist nature of the policy and wants all Americans to remember this chapter of history to ensure such injustices are not repeated.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has upheld an injunction preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that restricts passport gender markers to only male or female based on biological sex at birth. The court ruled against the government's appeal, agreeing with a lower court that the policy likely reflects "unconstitutional animus toward transgender Americans." This decision allows transgender, nonbinary, and intersex individuals to continue obtaining passports that align with their gender identity while the legal case proceeds. The policy was part of a broader executive order signed by President Trump to recognize only biological genders.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol is investigating an assault on a Lyft driver in Southern California that was captured on his dashcam. The video shows a female passenger verbally harassing the driver with xenophobic remarks before kicking him in the head while he was driving on a freeway. The incident began after the driver asked the woman, who appeared intoxicated, to remove her feet from the center console. The passenger continued to berate and taunt the driver after the physical assault. Authorities are now searching for the woman involved in the attack.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's Hunan province are considering using the central bank-backed digital yuan (e-CNY) to resolve persistent payment defaults and clear complex chain debts. The proposed model would leverage the digital currency's traceability to ensure funds directly reach the end of a payment chain, increasing transparency in often-opaque commercial relationships. This initiative represents a novel application for the e-CNY, expanding its scope beyond the retail and consumer use cases that have been the focus since its 2019 launch. Analysts believe it could enhance real-time visibility and control over transactions within the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The Cowboys capitalized on the advantageous field position, scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. Carter, a highly-touted rookie, was the ninth overall pick in the 2023 draft, making his ejection a notable and undisciplined start to his professional career.</p>

Mamdani framed his challenge as a way to "cut out the middle man," calling Cuomo a puppet of the president.

However, tattoo artists and museum curators observe a growing appreciation for the medium as a legitimate art form, reflecting a broader societal move toward openness and individual expression.</p>

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe had sued, arguing the center was built without proper federal environmental reviews.

          <p>Political scientist Sir John Curtice analyzes the rise of Reform UK, which has consistently led in polls for five months by capturing a significant portion of the Brexit voter base. The party's support is heavily concentrated among those who voted Leave in 2016 and hold socially conservative views on immigration, cultural issues, and climate change. This realignment has decimated the Conservative party's 2019 coalition, with half of Boris Johnson's voters now backing Nigel Farage. While Reform's success depends heavily on Farage's leadership and a fragmented political landscape, its strong niche appeal presents a credible path to becoming the UK's largest party.</p>
