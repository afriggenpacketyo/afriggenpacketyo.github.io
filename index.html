          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer significantly surpassed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, even as its overall sales experienced a decline. The company adjusted its full-year sales guidance to reflect the higher end of its previous range and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards, indicating progress on its 2025 strategic initiatives. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed the positive results to reduced inventory, lowered expenses, and better customer engagement, while the company continues to implement strategies like expanding specific departments and integrating Sephora shops. This unexpected financial performance provides a much-needed boost amidst recent leadership turmoil and a period of declining annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

This article highlights gold's long-standing appeal as both a currency and an investment, especially during times of economic or market uncertainty, serving as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge. Numerous factors impact its spot price, including the fundamental principles of supply and demand, prevailing global economic conditions, and the rate of inflation. Additionally, interest rates, geopolitical instability, and the strength of the U.S. dollar significantly influence gold's value, alongside central bank policies and broader market sentiment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With UK energy prices set to increase again in October, this article outlines four practical methods for households to manage rising bills. It advises considering fixed-rate energy deals, which could be significantly cheaper than variable rates, while also cautioning about potential exit fees. Other recommendations include paying by direct debit for better rates, checking eligibility for various financial support schemes like the Warm Home Discount, and actively reducing energy consumption through measures like turning down boiler flow rates or using energy-efficient appliances. These steps aim to mitigate the impact of the impending price cap increase and help consumers save money. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has warned 46 U.S. states and territories that they risk losing federal funding for sex education programs if they do not remove all references to transgender people and gender ideology from their curriculums within 60 days. This directive, issued by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), follows the termination of a grant to California for a similar refusal. Critics argue that this move, part of a broader effort by the administration to remove federal recognition of transgender people, will harm young people and reduce inclusive education, which is vital for LGBTQ+ youth. The administration maintains it is ensuring federal funds align with congressional intent. </p>

          <p>Argentine police raided a villa in Mar del Plata following the discovery of a 17th-century Italian portrait, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, in a real estate advertisement. The painting is believed to have been looted 80 years ago from Dutch Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker by Friedrich Kadgien, a Nazi officer who fled to Argentina after World War II. While the painting was not found during the raid, other potentially relevant items were seized, and an investigation into concealment and smuggling has begun.

          <p>SpaceX successfully completed a critical test flight of its Starship rocket, the world's largest and most powerful, marking a significant turnaround after a series of previous failures. The 60-minute flight from Texas saw all 33 booster engines ignite and the booster separate as planned, despite some fiery and erratic flap movements during descent. This achievement is a crucial step towards SpaceX's goal of a fully reusable transport system for Moon and Mars missions, and is vital for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use Starship to send humans to the Moon by 2027. The successful mission provides valuable data and restores confidence in the ambitious program. </p>

          <p>A Reddit post details a family dispute ignited by a grandmother's unusual dietary advice for her 6-month-old grandchild: feeding the baby a stick of butter to aid sleep. The new mother, who is introducing a varied diet, expressed concern over the grandmother's insistence on a meat-based, carnivore lifestyle, citing social media nutritionists. While most commenters sided with the mother, medical experts like Dr. Ken Berry suggested cooking baby foods in butter for healthy fats, alongside nutrient-rich animal products, rather than direct butter consumption. Dietitian Lauren Manaker emphasized the importance of pairing lean meats with diverse plant-based foods for optimal infant nutrition and healthy eating habits. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's renewed threat to impose steep tariffs, potentially up to 200%, on imported furniture could further complicate U.S.-China trade relations and erode Chinese exports. Analysts suggest this move, aimed at reviving the domestic furniture industry in the Carolinas, is unlikely to significantly bring manufacturing back to the U.S. but risks escalating tensions between the two economic powers. This development follows a recent trade truce and conciliatory statements, indicating a potential shift away from a more amenable posture in ongoing trade negotiations. The measures are seen as broad-based, intended to reshore manufacturing rather than exclusively target China. (not investment advice)</p>

This innovative design eliminates complex mechanical components, resulting in a more compact, lightweight, and efficient engine with higher peak pressure, making it a potentially "game-changing" technology in aerospace and defense, with both the US and China actively pursuing its development. </p>

The article expresses concern over the militarization of domestic policing, the potential manipulation of laws like the Insurrection Act, and the implications for election integrity, suggesting that such actions could create the very emergencies they purport to address. </p>

          <p>West Ham United is enduring a "very bleak" start to the football season with three defeats and 11 goals conceded, intensifying pressure on manager Graham Potter. The article attributes the struggles to long-standing issues, including a poor win percentage under Potter and a porous defense that has conceded the most shots on target this season. Recruitment failures are also highlighted, particularly the inability to replace key players like Mohammed Kudus and Declan Rice, leaving the squad unbalanced. Former players and analysts suggest the team lacks fight and direction, with survival in the Premier League being the primary ambition, as the club grapples with a history of misaligned leadership and spending. </p>

This article suggests that a key catalyst for higher prices could be a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, as lower rates typically boost demand for gold. Geopolitical uncertainty and continued central bank buying are also cited as factors that could push gold towards a "bull case" of $4,000 per ounce by year-end, with J.P. Morgan Research anticipating $3,675. Conversely, a strengthening economy, cooling inflation, or a stronger dollar could lead to a "bear case" of $3,200. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel faced significant public backlash and a nearly $100 million dip in market value after unveiling a new logo that removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" figure and the namesake barrel. Following widespread criticism, including a public appeal from President Trump, the company quickly decided to scrap the redesign and revert to its original, beloved "Old Timer" logo. Branding experts criticized the initial move for severing the company's design from its folksy, "homestyle country cooking" roots, which resonated deeply with loyal customers.

However, the company also tightened its full-year earnings outlook due to a nearly doubled estimate for net tariff costs, now at $90 million, primarily from key manufacturing regions in Asia.

          <p>Six workers, including a teenager and members of an extended family, tragically died from "gas exposure in a confined space" at a Colorado dairy farm, highlighting the extreme hazards of the agricultural industry. The incident occurred when a contractor working on an underground manure pit accidentally released hydrogen sulfide, a highly toxic gas formed by decomposing animal waste, causing instant collapse. Subsequent attempts by five other workers to rescue the first also proved fatal. The article criticizes "agricultural exceptionalism" in U.S. labor law, noting that farms are exempt from crucial OSHA confined space standards and safety training, making such preventable tragedies more likely. </p>

          <p>Prato, Italy, has been transformed into a fast fashion hub by Chinese immigrants who, since the late 1980s, have sustained the "Made in Italy" label through cheap labor and high-speed production. With over 27,000 Chinese residents, the city's landscape now reflects a blend of Italian and Chinese cultures. While the "Chinese model" brought economic success, it also sparked controversy over job displacement and the authenticity of the "Made in Italy" label for garments using imported materials. The industry faces criticism for labor abuses, with reports of long hours and low wages, and organized crime battling over garment transport, highlighting complex challenges of integration and exploitation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of UK households face a 2% increase in gas and electricity prices starting October, as energy regulator Ofgem raises the price cap. This means a typical annual household bill will rise by £35 to £1,755, leading to another winter of relatively high energy costs. The increase is partly due to higher costs for transmitting energy and funding extra government support measures for consumers, which are paid for by all billpayers through higher standing charges. Campaigners warn many families are still struggling with energy debt. Ofgem notes a "healthier market" with more fixed deals available, but advises consumers to shop around and be aware of exit fees. </p>

          <p>President Trump's effort to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, has sparked significant concern among Wall Street analysts regarding the central bank's historical independence. Cook denies the allegations and challenges Trump's legal authority to fire her, vowing to contest the decision in court. Analysts suggest that if successful, this move could grant Trump greater leverage over the Fed's seven-member board and influence its monetary policy decisions, potentially leading to the interest rate cuts he has long advocated. The situation underscores the delicate balance between political influence and central bank autonomy, with a legal battle possibly reaching the Supreme Court. </p>

Pro-union employees seek greater job security, guaranteed pay and benefits, and improved workplace safety, while the company emphasizes its commitment to "good-paying, American jobs" and direct employee relationships. The outcome is significant for Kentucky's economic future and the broader push for unionization within the rapidly expanding electric vehicle battery production sector. </p>

Rasmussen stated that any interference in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Denmark would be unacceptable, emphasizing the close and trusting cooperation between Denmark and Greenland. This development follows Trump's repeated expressions of desire to acquire Greenland, framing it as vital for American national security, a proposal consistently rejected by Danish and Greenlandic politicians. </p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has reportedly suspended over 20 employees who signed an open letter, known as the "Katrina Declaration," criticizing the Trump administration's changes to the agency. The letter, signed by 191 current and former FEMA staff, warned that cuts to funding and workforce, along with unqualified leadership appointments, could reverse post-Hurricane Katrina progress and lead to another national catastrophe. Employees who used their names in the letter received notices of paid administrative leave, without stated reasons, though FEMA defended its reforms as necessary to combat inefficiency.

Institutional investors are returning to the market with increased capital and appetite, particularly in the "living" sector (multifamily, senior living, student housing), and retail. While industrial lags, office bid dynamics are improving.
