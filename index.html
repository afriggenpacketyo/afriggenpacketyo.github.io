          <p>A 12-year-old girl, Sophia Forchas, who was shot in the head during a mass shooting at a Minneapolis church in August, has been discharged from the hospital. Her parents attribute her significant recovery, which includes walking and dribbling a basketball, to divine intervention and the power of prayer. The shooting, perpetrated by a gunman who later took his own life, resulted in the deaths of two children and injured 18 others. A GoFundMe campaign for Sophia's medical expenses has successfully raised nearly $1.2 million from community supporters.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a difficult 26-6 loss to Australia in the first Ashes match in 22 years, a performance head coach Shaun Wane described as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple mistakes and missed opportunities, allowing Australia to establish a clear lead in the second half. Standout Australian player Reece Walsh was instrumental in his team's victory, showcasing superior skill that highlighted the quality gap between the two sides. England now faces a must-win game in Liverpool to prevent Australia from retaining the Ashes.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery after ingesting between 80 and 100 small, high-powered magnets, which he reportedly purchased online. The magnets formed four chains within his digestive tract, causing pressure necrosis, a condition where tissue dies due to prolonged pressure, and necessitating the removal of part of his bowel. This case highlights the significant dangers of such magnets, which are often sold as toys but can cause severe internal injuries if swallowed. Despite a ban in New Zealand, these products remain accessible online.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying broad market index ETFs, such as those tracking the S&P 500, may be losing favor among some investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily concentrated in the technology sector, which now comprises a record 35% of the index's weight. In response, there is a growing interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently hitting an all-time high and outperforming the S&P 500 over the past six months.

          <p>A recent analysis of the Manhattan real estate market reveals that more than a third of condominium resales between mid-2024 and mid-2025 were sold for a loss. The median price per square foot for condos has remained largely stagnant over the past decade, a stark contrast to significant price increases seen in much of the U.S. Factors contributing to this trend include changes to tax laws and rent regulations. The luxury market, however, has been an exception, with properties sold for over $10 million consistently yielding profits. (not investment advice)</p>

While not a landslide, the result places Powell in a senior, directly elected role.

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist advises that setting effective boundaries with children involves more than just saying "no." Instead of simply prohibiting an action, parents should provide clear, teachable alternatives, such as saying "gentle hands" instead of "stop hitting." Explaining the reasoning behind a rule, offering choices within established limits, and maintaining consistency are crucial for building trust and cooperation. The article emphasizes that when parents react emotionally, it is important to repair the interaction by explaining their feelings and apologizing if necessary, teaching children accountability.</p>
