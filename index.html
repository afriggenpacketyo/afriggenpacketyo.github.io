          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 21:22:43 EDT</div>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 migrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon. While acknowledging that the advocacy group CASA has a plausible case, the court found insufficient evidence to block the policy's implementation during the ongoing lawsuit. This decision means thousands of individuals who fled war and instability could face deportation unless they secure another legal status. The administration argues the program was intended to be temporary and conditions have improved, a claim disputed by advocacy groups and contradicted by State Department travel advisories.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing President Trump of attempting to divert public attention away from the Jeffrey Epstein case by making a series of unrelated and provocative statements. These include demanding the Washington Commanders revert to their old name and attacking political opponents and federal judges. The accusations of distraction come as the administration faces backlash from some supporters for not releasing more files on Epstein, after promising greater transparency. Commentators and political opponents suggest these moves are a deliberate strategy to shift the narrative away from the controversy and declining approval ratings on key issues like immigration.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the military plane was on a converging course and had not been announced by air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport. The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the North Dakota State Fair. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force are both investigating the incident to determine why the commercial flight was not alerted to the bomber's presence in the flight path, a situation the pilot described as highly unusual.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's widespread tariffs are widely criticized, they may have an unintended positive consequence by forcing other nations to address their own protectionist policies. Countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing internal trade barriers that hinder their own economic growth. The pressure from U.S. tariffs is reportedly prompting some of these entities to consider or implement reforms to break down domestic barriers, such as differing standards and regulations. The piece suggests this self-reflection could lead to more efficient and liberalized economies globally, creating a silver lining to the current trade tensions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for extensive reforms to the nation's financial regulatory system, arguing that current rules are antiquated and stifle economic growth. Speaking at a Federal Reserve conference, Bessent criticized excessive capitalization requirements for imposing unnecessary burdens on banks and pushing lending towards the less-regulated non-bank sector. He specifically urged regulators to abandon a 2023 proposal for dual capital requirements, calling it a flawed attempt to reverse-engineer higher capital levels. This push for deregulation aligns with the Trump administration's broader agenda to reduce rules on financial institutions to boost the economy.</p>

The flash floods killed at least 135 people, primarily in Kerr County, a popular tourist destination. The county judge explained that most of the missing were tourists who had left the area after the disaster without checking in, leading to a significant but temporary inflation of the numbers. This pattern of sharp revisions in missing person counts is common in the chaotic aftermath of large-scale natural disasters as authorities work to verify each report.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, making days marginally shorter and prompting discussions about an unprecedented adjustment to global timekeeping. This acceleration, caused by factors like the moon's gravity and changes in the planet's core and atmosphere, could eventually necessitate a "negative leap second"—subtracting a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Such a move has never been done and raises concerns about its impact on critical technologies like computers and satellites. Interestingly, scientists note that the melting of polar ice due to climate change has slightly slowed the rotation, counteracting the trend and delaying this potential timekeeping challenge.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has asked the Department of Justice to investigate Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for what it calls "illegal DEI practices." The complaint alleges the university uses diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as a proxy for race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby violating the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. The group is calling for an end to these programs and a suspension of federal funding. This action is part of a broader conservative legal strategy targeting DEI programs in higher education and corporate settings.</p>

          <p>Former Kentucky police officer Brett Hankison has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. Hankison, the only officer convicted in connection with the incident, was found guilty of using excessive force by firing shots into Taylor's apartment. The judge's sentence was significantly harsher than the one-day term recommended by the Trump administration's Department of Justice. This article provides context on the DOJ's shifting stance on police reform and the legal aftermath of a case that fueled nationwide protests.</p>

          <p>A 2006 interview from "The Howard Stern Show" has resurfaced in which Donald Trump discussed his sexual "age limit." When asked by the host, Trump stated he had no problem with "banging 24-year-olds" and, when pressed for a lower limit, said he didn't want to be like a congressman involved with "12-year-olds." The rediscovery of these comments comes amid heightened scrutiny of Trump's past due to the controversy surrounding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The remarks are being re-examined in the context of his past association with Epstein and recent legal actions against news outlets reporting on it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece from The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump's presidency is driven by personal grievances and pettiness rather than a coherent policy vision. The author points to several examples, including renaming military bases, retaliating against former officials like James Clapper, and the recent reversal on Ukraine policy, which seemed motivated by President Putin making Trump look weak. The article contends that this focus on small-minded vengefulness permeates the executive branch, with actions often aimed at settling personal scores or creating culture-war distractions. This approach, the author suggests, substitutes for substantive governance on major national issues.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to use military facilities in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants, according to correspondence with the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the request, which also includes increasing detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The plan allows for up to 1,000 people to be held at each of the mainland bases to support ICE removal operations in the Chicago and Newark areas. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to expand detention capacity amid a nationwide campaign to arrest more undocumented immigrants.</p>

The report contrasts the administration's first-term reliance on the Federalist Society to identify conservative, originalist judges with the current nomination process. Bove's nomination is presented as a potential indicator of a new direction for the MAGA movement's influence on the judiciary. The piece explores how Trump is continuing his effort to reshape the federal courts, with Bove's potential confirmation being a significant step in that ongoing project.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration have faced off in a Boston federal court over the White House's decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal grants to the university. The administration claims the move is necessary to combat antisemitism on campus, an argument the presiding judge appeared skeptical of, calling it "mind-boggling." Harvard's lawyers argued the cuts jeopardize vital research in medicine and other fields and that there is no evidence the funding freeze will impact antisemitism.
