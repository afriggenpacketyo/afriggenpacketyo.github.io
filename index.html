          <p>Broadcom's stock price increased after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations and provided a robust forecast for the future. A significant driver of this optimism was the announcement of a new $10 billion order for its custom AI chips from an undisclosed fourth major customer. This development reinforces the company's growing position in the artificial intelligence sector and fuels investor confidence in its ability to compete with market leaders. The company's AI-related revenue saw a substantial 63% jump during the period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. engaged in a fiery Senate hearing, defending his recent overhaul of the CDC and the dismissal of its director, Susan Monarez. He clashed repeatedly with both Democratic and Republican senators over his controversial views on vaccines and changes to COVID-19 shot accessibility. The testimony was marked by combative exchanges, with Kennedy accusing some lawmakers of dishonesty while facing bipartisan criticism for undermining public health agencies and creating confusion around national vaccine policy. This hearing highlighted deep divisions and concerns regarding the direction of U.S. public health leadership.</p>

          <p>ESPN host Laura Rutledge revealed on a podcast that she created a fake social media profile to defend her husband, former MLB player Josh Rutledge, from online critics during his playing career. Under the pseudonym "BillyHalo76," she would post positive comments and use statistics to counter negative commentary, occasionally tweeting about star player Mike Trout to avoid suspicion. Rutledge acknowledged that the action was wrong and admitted that her husband was likely unaware of her secret online activities, which she undertook because she struggled with the public criticism he faced.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's stock price fell sharply after the company issued a full-year earnings and revenue forecast that was significantly below Wall Street's expectations. The disappointing guidance was largely attributed to the financial impact of tariffs, which the company projects will cost it $240 million. CEO Calvin McDonald also candidly admitted that Lululemon's product offerings have become "stale" and have not been resonating with customers, outlining plans to introduce more new styles and innovate to regain momentum in the U.S. market.

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has adopted a more focused and influential public role in her husband's second term, concentrating on the intersection of technology and children's welfare. She recently addressed a White House AI education task force and played a key part in advancing the bipartisan "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. While maintaining a relatively private profile, she has selectively engaged on substantive issues, demonstrating a business-like approach to her initiatives and even weighing in on foreign policy matters concerning child protection.</p>

          <p>With home equity at record highs, the article advises homeowners to carefully consider several key questions before borrowing against their property's value. It suggests verifying the actual amount of equity available to borrow and assessing whether the financial need is urgent enough to justify taking on new debt. Homeowners are also encouraged to weigh the timing of their decision in light of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, which could soon make borrowing cheaper and affect the choice between a fixed-rate loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC).

          <p>A federal jury has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages for violating California privacy laws by improperly tracking the online activity of nearly 98 million U.S. smartphone users. The class-action lawsuit, which covered a period from 2016 to 2024, successfully argued that the tech giant collected user data without permission, even when privacy settings were enabled, to bolster its targeted advertising business. Google has denied any wrongdoing, stating that the verdict misinterprets how its products function, and has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Germany's 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign started on a disastrous note with a 2-0 defeat to Slovakia, marking the team's first-ever loss in an away World Cup qualifier. The performance was widely criticized as lethargic and lacking in all areas, with both players and coach Julian Nagelsmann expressing frustration over the team's lack of emotion and intensity. The unexpected result immediately raises questions about the national team's form and mindset, dampening the optimism that had been building since their performance in the recent Euro 2024 tournament.</p>

It also corrected his statements on the number of recommended childhood vaccines and the context surrounding a new rural hospital funding bill, showing a pattern of his testimony conflicting with readily available government data and research.</p>

In his resignation message, Schill also alluded to criticism from Republican lawmakers over the university's handling of campus protests, stating that he believes it is the right time for new leadership to guide the university forward.</p>

          <p>This article provides an analysis of Daniel Levy's complex legacy as he steps down from his role as Tottenham Hotspur's executive chairman. It credits him with transforming the club's financial health and infrastructure, most notably by delivering a world-class stadium and training ground. However, it also highlights the persistent criticism he faced for a perceived lack of on-field success, with the club securing minimal silverware during his nearly 25-year tenure. His leadership is ultimately framed as a paradox of off-field modernization and on-field underachievement.</p>

The provision, valid through 2028, is capped at $25,000 in tipped income annually for individuals earning under $150,000. (not investment advice)</p>
