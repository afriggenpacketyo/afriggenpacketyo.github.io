          <p>U.S. officials have expressed disappointment with Hamas's response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire, stating that the suggested changes regarding guarantees for a permanent end to the war are a step backward. The core disagreement with Israel has long been the issue of ensuring a lasting cessation of hostilities. Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, described Hamas's response as "totally unacceptable" and urged the group to accept the original framework for proximity talks. The U.S. maintains that Israel has already agreed to the proposed terms. The U.S. still hopes to close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days.</p>

          <p>A British man, John Miller, has been indicted along with Cui Guanghai of China for allegedly attempting to smuggle U.S. military technology to China and organizing the stalking and harassment of a critic of Beijing. The Department of Justice stated that the defendants targeted a U.S. resident for exercising their right to free speech and conspired to traffic sensitive American military technology to the Chinese regime. The indictment alleges that Miller and Cui installed a tracking device on the victim's car, slashed its tires, and destroyed artistic statues created by the victim depicting President Xi and his wife. The two men are currently in Serbia, and the U.S. is coordinating with Serbian officials regarding extradition.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 18:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could provide opportunities for eavesdroppers to exploit the system. Quantum communication uses quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data in single light particles, theoretically making it unhackable. Miller's analysis of data from Micius found time delays between the lasers, suggesting that the distribution of quantum keys from the satellite was insecure. The vulnerability stems from flaws in the experimental implementation of quantum key distribution.</p>

          <p>The United Nations nuclear watchdog reported that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, urging Tehran to cooperate with the agency's probe. As of May 17, Iran has amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a significant increase since February. The IAEA warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, raising serious concerns. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA chief, has stated that Iran has enough enriched uranium to make "several" nuclear bombs if it chooses to do so. This report comes amid ongoing talks between Tehran and Washington over a possible nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>The UK government will invest £1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its weapons production capabilities. This initiative is part of the government's Strategic Defence Review, aimed at addressing deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons and munitions. The factories are expected to support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. Ministers emphasized that this investment will strengthen the armed forces, boost British jobs, and contribute to economic growth. The move follows warnings from senior military officials about the UK's depleted stockpiles and the need to increase weapons production.</p>

          <p>UFC Hall of Famer B.J. Penn was arrested for the third time in six days in Hawaii, stemming from claims that his family has been murdered and replaced with imposters. The latest arrest was due to Penn failing to appear in court, violating his bail agreement. Penn's mother, Lorraine Shin, filed for a temporary restraining order against him, alleging “extreme psychological abuse.” Shin believes Penn suffers from Capgras syndrome, a psychological disorder causing him to believe close family members are imposters. Penn last fought in the UFC in May 2019 and was later released after a video surfaced of him in a street fight.</p>
