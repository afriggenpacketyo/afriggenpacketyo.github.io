            <p>President Trump and Speaker Johnson are pushing for the Senate's budget resolution, crucial for extending Trump's tax cuts, despite opposition from House Republicans who deem it insufficient in spending cuts. With a slim GOP majority, Johnson faces challenges in securing the resolution's adoption, a necessary step for advancing Trump's agenda, including border security and tax priorities. The budget plan is the initial step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold. The resolution doesn't resolve disagreements over spending cuts, deferring confrontation. Johnson emphasizes the resolution is not law but enables drafting actual legislation.</p>

            <p>The Keystone Pipeline was shut down in North Dakota after an employee reported a "mechanical bang," prompting immediate shutdown and emergency response. Leak detection systems detected a pressure drop, leading to the isolation of the affected segment and mobilization of containment resources. Crude oil release was confined to an agricultural field near the pump station, with no immediate impact on people or structures. The cause of the rupture and the volume of spilled oil are under investigation, with remediation efforts underway. The pipeline, operational since 2011, transports crude oil from Canada to refineries in the U.S.</p>

Manager Aaron Boone indicated that Bellinger experienced vomiting overnight, and his availability for the game remains uncertain. Bellinger's absence marks his third missed game in the last five, following a recent stiff back. The Yankees acquired Bellinger in the offseason to fill the void left by Juan Soto's departure.

Anthony is being held on a $1 million bond, and his attorneys plan to seek a reduced bond and a review of the charges. The family has launched a fundraiser for legal expenses.</p>

The White House indicated retaliatory tariffs on numerous countries aimed to open negotiations, offering lower rates for concessions benefiting American workers.

            <p>Many U.S. small businesses fear financial hardship from President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, potentially leading to price increases or financial losses. Small businesses, lacking the resources of larger corporations, are more vulnerable to tariff costs. Some businesses are already reducing salaries and scaling back expansion plans to cope. While Trump claims tariffs will revive American manufacturing, small businesses often cannot quickly shift supply chains or afford domestic production. Economists warn tariffs could push inflation higher, impacting consumer confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The British government is considering nationalizing British Steel, which is owned by a Chinese firm. The steel industry has been affected by Donald Trump's tariffs. Prime Minister Starmer has promised to do everything possible to keep a functioning steel industry in the UK. Nigel Farage called for the government to nationalize the Scunthorpe plant within three days to avoid closure. Starmer has said he does not believe Trump's tariffs are a "temporary passing phase".</p>

            <p>The UN's secretary-general has described Gaza as a 'killing field', with aid drying up and horror re-emerging due to Israel's blockade and resumption of war against Hamas. António Guterres stated that civilians are in an endless death loop. The heads of six UN agencies have urged world leaders to act urgently to ensure food and supplies reach Palestinians. Israel insists there is enough food in Gaza, but UN agencies refute this. Because of the blockade, all UN-supported bakeries have closed, markets are empty of most fresh vegetables and hospitals are rationing painkillers and antibiotics.</p>

            <p>Investors can utilize tax-loss harvesting to mitigate portfolio risk during market volatility. This strategy involves selling losing assets to offset investment gains, thereby lowering taxes. Losses exceeding profits can offset up to $3,000 of regular income, with excess losses carried into future tax years. Tax-loss harvesting opportunities arise during stock market volatility, like the recent decline in the S&P 500 Index. Financial advisors recommend investors weigh these strategies throughout the year to maximize tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A new book argues that President Biden's family and advisors were in "denial" about his ability to serve another term. Author Chris Whipple suggests that Biden's staff shielded him from scrutiny. Whipple notes that Biden was in a "terrible state" before his debate with President Trump. The debate marked a turning point, leading to Biden dropping out and endorsing Kamala Harris. Whipple sees parallels between the campaign and a Shakespearean tragedy.</p>
