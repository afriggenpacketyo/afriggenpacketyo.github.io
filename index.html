          <h2>Myanmar Grapples with Political Instability Following Devastating Earthquake</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Myanmar is facing increased political turmoil after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake, which has resulted in thousands of deaths and significant economic losses. The ruling junta declared a state of emergency and appealed for international aid, a stark contrast to their response in 2008. Analysts, however, are skeptical about the possibility of lasting peace talks between the junta and resistance forces, expecting the junta to exploit the disaster to weaken resistance groups. The military has declared a temporary ceasefire to support humanitarian efforts but warned of retaliation against rebel attacks.</p>

          <p>Severe weather, including tornadoes and flash flooding, has caused at least 20 deaths across the Midwest and South, with more severe weather forecasted. Several states are experiencing major flooding, impacting infrastructure and leading to interstate commerce disruptions, especially in cargo hubs like Louisville and Memphis. Kentucky has been particularly hard-hit, with record-setting river levels and mandatory evacuations, while Arkansas faces widespread flooding and a washed-out railroad bridge. The increased frequency of such events has also put a strain on weather forecasting resources.</p>

The Kakuma camp, located in a remote part of Kenya, has been home to many refugees who recently protested against reductions in aid rations.

          <p>North Korea held the Pyongyang International Marathon for the first time in six years, welcoming approximately 200 foreign runners to its capital. The marathon, an annual event celebrating the birth of Kim Il Sung, was last held in 2019 before North Korea closed its borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reopening, albeit limited, signifies a gradual return to normalcy for the reclusive nation, which has been slow to ease restrictions since the pandemic began.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has strongly criticized the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man living in the U.S., to a prison in El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis reaffirmed her ruling demanding Garcia's return, stating he was seized and held without lawful authority. The Justice Department has requested an appeals court to dismiss the order, while White House officials continue to defend the deportation, claiming Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyer denies. The judge's opinion chastises U.S. officials for their handling of the situation.</p>
