        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing tensions, Israel launched a significant operation, "Operation Rising Lion," targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders, citing an uncovered Iranian plan to destroy Israel. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones at Israel, prompting interception efforts by Israeli air defenses. The exchange of fire caused international air travel disruptions and led to a shelter-in-place order for U.S. personnel in Israel. These actions have heightened concerns about a broader conflict between the two nations and cast doubt on the future of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, with Iranian media suggesting a likely withdrawal from negotiations. Optimism remains tempered given the potential for further escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Two women have tragically died in Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia, Wales, after an incident in the Nant Gwynant area. North Wales Police were called to the scene late Wednesday evening following reports of individuals in the water at the pools on the Watkin Path, a popular route to the summit of Yr Wyddfa, Wales' tallest mountain. One woman was recovered from the water and pronounced dead at the scene, while the other was recovered and taken to a nearby hospital, but later died as well. The incident is a somber reminder of the dangers that natural landscapes can pose.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies has significantly increased shipments of smartphones and tablets running its HarmonyOS operating system, reaching over 103 million devices, nearly half of which were shipped in 2024. This pivot to its in-house OS serves as an alternative to Google's Android, driven by US sanctions imposed in 2019. The company has expanded HarmonyOS beyond mobile devices, launching laptops running on the system after its license to use Microsoft Windows expired. This move represents a strategic shift towards platform autonomy and technological sovereignty for Huawei, marking a watershed moment in its goal to establish a fully self-sufficient hardware-software ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace could face significant premium increases next year if enhanced subsidies put in place during the pandemic are not extended.

          <p>This article discusses the Democratic Party's efforts to regain support from young men after President Trump won a narrow victory among men ages 18 to 29 in the 2024 election. Emerging Democratic leaders are prioritizing policies and messaging tailored to young men, addressing their concerns about mental health, economic opportunities, and feeling heard by government officials. The Speaking with American Men (SAM) project suggests Democrats invest more time in online spaces frequented by young men, offering authentic engagement rather than overly politicized messaging. The article explores how Democrats can build connections with this demographic and address their specific needs and frustrations.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to dismiss all members of the CDC's vaccine advisory panel (ACIP) and replace them with individuals who have criticized government COVID-19 policies has sparked controversy. Experts worry that the new committee may be skeptical of vaccines, potentially leading to downgraded recommendations and reduced access for families. The ACIP plays a crucial role in determining which vaccines are recommended and covered by insurance, influencing the health of all Americans. The article examines the potential consequences of these changes, including barriers to vaccine access and distrust in the immunization process.</p>

Experts suggest that with substantial reserves, India could become an important alternative to China in the REE sector, but it requires more public and private investment. The recent REE shortage has highlighted China's dominance in the sector, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply and processing almost 90%. India possesses the world's third-largest share of REE reserves, but lacks advanced separation and refining technology, contributing to less than 1% of global REE production.</p>

          <p>According to DW's Iran expert Theresa Tropper, Israeli strikes on Iran targeted wealthier areas of Tehran, raising concerns about civilian casualties. While some Iranians may not mourn the deaths of senior military commanders, attacks on residential areas killing fellow citizens could provoke a different reaction. Tropper suggests that while foreign threats have previously united Iranians, they will also be aware of their vulnerability due to Iran's limited air defenses and lack of strong allies. The expert highlights the potential for both resentment towards the regime and fear among the population.</p>

Bill C-2, or the Strong Borders Act, is said to grant law enforcement sweeping powers to access citizen data and adopt US-style refugee policies. Critics argue that the legislation infringes on privacy rights, disproportionately affects women, racialized claimants, and LGBTQ individuals, and undermines due process for refugees. The bill has sparked concerns about the construction of a surveillance state and the erosion of Canada's independent stance on immigration and civil liberties.</p>

The two nations were allies until the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with Iran recognizing Israel and receiving support in return.
