          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that the Trump administration has finalized a trade agreement, but its implementation hinges on approval from the Prime Minister and parliament of the unnamed involved country. Lutnick specified that China is not directly involved in this deal, as negotiations with China fall under Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's purview. This announcement follows President Trump's implementation of widespread tariff hikes, which have since been temporarily paused for most countries, with tariffs on China significantly increased. The administration has reportedly received numerous inquiries from countries interested in establishing trade agreements, with Japan, South Korea, and India considered potential candidates for deals.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius voiced skepticism regarding Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposed three-day ceasefire in Ukraine scheduled for May 8-10, citing past experiences where similar declarations yielded minimal results. Pistorius emphasized the importance of continued U.S. support for Ukraine's defense, highlighting the war's impact on European security.

          <p>Following the 2025 NFL Draft, where Shedeur Sanders' draft position became a major talking point, his brother Shilo Sanders signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent. Their father, Deion Sanders, expressed his gratitude to the Buccaneers' GM Jason Licht for giving Shilo a fair shot. Coach Todd Bowles emphasized that Shilo's signing was based on his football skills, particularly his tackling ability and understanding of the game, rather than as a favor to his father. Shilo Sanders played college football at South Carolina, Jackson State, and Colorado, accumulating 67 tackles in each of his two seasons at Colorado.</p>

          <p>Former Idaho State Trooper Dan Howard was found guilty of second-degree murder and domestic battery in the death of his wife, Kendy Howard. Kendy was found dead in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to her head in February 2021, initially dispatched as a suicide. Suspicion arose due to clues at the scene, including a packed duffle bag and warm towels in the dryer. The prosecution argued that Dan Howard used a carotid restraint hold, a maneuver he learned in law enforcement training, to kill Kendy, while the defense maintained it was suicide. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that refinancing a home equity loan into a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) this May could be beneficial for some homeowners due to declining rates. Nicollette Chapman, senior vice president of mortgage data solutions at housing tech and data firm Zonda, says refinancing a loan can be costly, so ensure the benefits justify the cost. Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage, says anyone who took a home equity loan over the course of the past couple of years is probably paying a rate that's somewhere in the 8 to 9% range. Nicollette Chapman, senior vice president of mortgage data solutions at housing tech and data firm Zonda, says borrowers should take care to purposefully evaluate the reasons why they are considering refinancing a home equity loan into a HELOC.

          <p>Amazon announced it would not display tariff costs on its website after facing backlash from the White House, which deemed the plan a "hostile and political act." The company clarified that it had only considered the idea for items sold on its ultra-low-cost Amazon Haul store. President Trump reportedly called Jeff Bezos to express his displeasure about the report. The decision comes as Amazon and other retailers grapple with the impact of Trump's new tariffs, with some sellers already raising prices in response to higher import costs.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to ease the impact of new tariffs on the auto industry, following warnings about higher prices and potential hits to sales and production. Carmakers with U.S. factories will be allowed to reduce import taxes on foreign parts based on a formula tied to car sales and price. This provision aims to provide relief for two years as businesses rework their supply chains. Parts made in Canada and Mexico that comply with North America free trade rules will be exempt from tariffs, a measure previously described as temporary. The announcement coincides with Trump's rally in Michigan, a state home to major automakers.</p>

The CPB argues that Trump does not have the power to take these actions, citing federal law and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The lawsuit points out that the law creating CPB does not include a clause allowing the president to remove board members at will and specifically states that CPB is not a government agency.

Carney, a technocrat from outside politics, positioned himself as the leader for a crisis, emphasizing experience and international ties.
