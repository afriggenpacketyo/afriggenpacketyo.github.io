        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the often-overlooked role of personal finance in fueling the climate crisis, highlighting how pensions, investments, and banking decisions can inadvertently support fossil fuel projects. Sustainable alternatives, such as green banks and pension providers, are presented as impactful ways to lower an individual's carbon footprint. However, the lack of standards and regulation in green finance is a key challenge, as is the difficulty in precisely quantifying personal finance's contribution to fossil fuel funding. Ultimately, the article suggests that while individual actions matter, collective action through voting and demanding regulation of the financial sector is more effective. </p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's criticism of both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Russia and Ukraine exchanged drone attacks. Ukrainian officials reported engaging targets across the country, including Kyiv, where buildings were damaged, noting Russia launched 364 "air attack vehicles." Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, stating that Russia can only be brought to justice by force. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have downed 128 Ukrainian drones. Andriy Kovalenko reported attacks on a Shahed drone production facility in Yelabuga and a chemical enterprise near Moscow, which creates components for Russian equipment and weapons. The back-and-forth strikes have become a prominent feature of the conflict, with Ukraine urging tougher sanctions. </p>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering temporarily accepting international students from Harvard University if they are barred from studying in the U.S. The university previously launched a program in 2022 to host researchers and students affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, offering research labs and accommodation free of charge. The program has accepted over 30 students and researchers as of March 2024, providing financial support, Japanese language classes, and counseling services.

          <p>LEVA, a delivery robot developed by Swiss universities, is designed to navigate tricky environments and autonomously lift and carry heavy boxes. Combining wheels and legs, LEVA can roll efficiently on smooth surfaces and walk or climb over obstacles like stairs and curbs. Using GPS, lidar sensors, and cameras, LEVA understands its surroundings and avoids obstacles. It can load and unload cargo boxes without human help, handling boxes weighing up to 187 pounds. LEVA could be used for package delivery, farming, construction, and emergency response, increasing efficiency and safety by reducing the need for manual labor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A court has temporarily halted the Trump administration's attack on Harvard University, sparked by the university's refusal to comply with demands regarding "viewpoint diversity." The administration froze research funds and made claims that Harvard was failing to report "foreign money" and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. These actions instill fear and signal young people to conform, with the rhetoric aligning with authoritarian populist leaders. This attack on universities is unpopular, with a majority of Americans disapproving of Trump's approach to higher education, as universities must stand together against these measures. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the concept of overdiagnosis in medicine, arguing that doctors are too quickly and confidently diagnosing patients with medical problems. Dr. Suzanne O’Sullivan, author of "The Age of Diagnosis," suggests that the eagerness to diagnose and preemptively screen can create new fears and constraints for patients. She advocates for “slow medicine,” emphasizing the importance of developing a doctor-patient relationship, monitoring symptoms, and carefully considering a diagnosis. While acknowledging the risk of missing aggressive diseases, O’Sullivan believes that doctors have erred too far toward overdiagnosis, causing harm to patients. </p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is facing criticism for accepting campaign contributions from the oil industry while running for governor, despite his previous environmental record. Villaraigosa defends his stance by arguing that California drivers could see gas prices soar due to policies leading to refinery closures, emphasizing the need for an "all-of-the-above" approach to energy. Environmental groups are upset, pointing to a pledge he signed in 2018 not to accept oil company contributions. Villaraigosa argues that the economy has changed, and working-class Americans are struggling with the cost of living, making it necessary to consider oil industry concerns. </p>

The author argues that building back trust in government and other institutions requires investing in local institutions and taking action at the community level.

          <p>Elon Musk has criticized the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for including Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA (TPUSA) on its "Hate Map," calling the SPLC a "scam organization." TPUSA, a conservative grassroots organization, considers itself the largest and fastest-growing in the U.S. Kirk responded angrily, calling the SPLC a "washed-up org" that's been fleecing people for decades. The SPLC describes TPUSA as a well-funded, hard-right organization with links to extremists that sows fear by claiming white Christian supremacy is under attack. </p>

Onosato clinched the title with a 14-1 record at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan arena, dedicating his championship to people in his home prefecture affected by the Jan. 1, 2024, earthquake.

Kurz was originally convicted for statements he made in 2020 regarding his role in appointing executives for the ÖBAG state holding company.

          <p>Russia has escalated its assaults on Ukrainian cities with intense aerial bombardments, coinciding with President Trump's apparent shift away from diplomatic efforts to end the war. Ukrainian officials report dozens killed and numerous injured in recent attacks. Analysts suggest Russia is capitalizing on the U.S.'s reduced involvement in the diplomatic process and refusal to supply Kyiv with military assistance. While Trump has condemned the attacks, he has not indicated a willingness to provide Ukraine with military aid. As Ukraine faces shortages of interceptor missiles, Russia continues to upgrade its arsenal, posing challenges to Ukrainian defenses. </p>

          <p>New research predicts that infection-causing fungi will spread significantly to new regions as the planet heats up. A study from Manchester University used simulations to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a fungus that causes aspergillosis, finding that certain species will expand their range into new parts of North America, Europe, China, and Russia. Aspergillosis has high mortality rates and is difficult to diagnose, and fungal pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to treatment. Extreme weather events can also spread spores over long distances, and a warming world could increase fungi’s temperature tolerance. </p>
