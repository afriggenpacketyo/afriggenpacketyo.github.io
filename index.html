          <p>Starbucks is implementing an AI-powered inventory system to enhance supply chain efficiency, a move expected to lower costs and improve margins as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy. This technological upgrade follows a recent decision to reduce U.S. production schedules, suggesting confidence in maintaining stock levels without interruption. Meanwhile, the broader market shows mixed results, with tech stocks like Apple and Alphabet gaining following a favorable court ruling. Investors remain cautious about Salesforce's upcoming earnings report due to concerns over how agentic AI might affect its software-as-a-service business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The media company Newsmax has filed a federal lawsuit against its competitor, Fox News, accusing the conservative media giant of engaging in anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly in the right-leaning news market. The suit alleges that Fox News coerces cable and satellite distributors into exclusionary agreements that marginalize or block competing channels, and has even used intimidation tactics. Newsmax is seeking a permanent injunction to halt these practices and is suing for triple the amount of damages sustained. A Fox News spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own competitive failures.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul has publicly criticized the Trump administration's recent decision to acquire a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel for $8.9 billion, labeling the move "a step towards socialism." Paul argued that government ownership in the private sector is a mistake and diminishes the free market principles of the Republican Party. This investment is part of a broader trend of the administration taking direct stakes in private companies, including Nvidia and U.S. Steel, to safeguard national security interests. In contrast, Senator Bernie Sanders has supported the deal, stating taxpayers should receive returns on government investments in corporations.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank, argues that the U.S. should reduce its inflammatory rhetoric and defense investments premised on an imminent Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The authors contend that such an invasion is "highly unlikely" due to significant strategic, political, economic, and military obstacles for Beijing. This analysis challenges the prevailing narrative of "threat inflation" in Washington, which has fueled increased military posturing and new defense measures. The report suggests that a more tempered approach would better serve U.S. interests, even as Beijing maintains its stance on eventual reunification.</p>

          <p>A historic funicular railway in Lisbon, Portugal, has derailed and crashed, resulting in the deaths of at least three people and injuring twenty others, with some passengers remaining trapped. The incident involved the iconic Gloria Funicular, a major tourist attraction, which overturned near the city's Avenida da Liberdade. Early reports from local media suggest a cable may have snapped, causing the vehicle to lose control and collide with a building.

          <p>The online prediction market platform Polymarket has received clearance to launch in the United States after a decision by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The regulatory agency issued a "no-action position," effectively stating it will not recommend enforcement action against the exchange for not reporting certain data on its event contracts. This development concludes investigations by both the CFTC and the Department of Justice, which had been examining whether the company was improperly accepting bets from U.S. individuals. The CEO, Shayne Coplan, announced the green light, crediting the commission for its efficient work.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has settled a lawsuit with the Washington State Medical Association, agreeing to restore dozens of public health web pages and datasets related to DEI, gender identity, and LGBTQ+ health. The content was removed from federal websites earlier this year following executive orders aimed at terminating DEI initiatives and what the administration terms "gender ideology extremism." The medical association sued, arguing the removals deprived doctors and patients of critical resources. A federal judge had previously issued a temporary restraining order to restore the content, leading to the eventual settlement which ensures the information will be made publicly available again.</p>

However, there are potential downsides, including limited flexibility for complex cases, the risk of scams, and a lack of regulatory oversight compared to licensed human experts.

Her public presence is significant, though experts note her gender and lack of military experience present challenges in North Korea's patriarchal society.

The administration had invoked the law, which grants broad powers during wartime or an "invasion," to target alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. In a 2-1 decision, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claim of a "predatory incursion," a ruling hailed by legal advocates as a victory for the rule of law.

          <p>For savers with $25,000, the choice between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing fixed versus variable interest rates. Currently, high-yield savings accounts may offer slightly higher initial returns, but their rates are variable and expected to fall with anticipated Fed rate cuts. In contrast, CDs lock in a guaranteed rate for a set term, providing certainty in a cooling rate environment. For example, a one-year CD at 4.25% would earn $1,062.50, while a high-yield savings account at 4.35% would earn $1,087.50, assuming the rate remains stable, which is unlikely.

          <p>Stage 11 of the Vuelta a España cycling race was abruptly ended three kilometers from the finish line in Bilbao due to security concerns related to pro-Palestinian protesters. Race organizers announced the decision with 20 kilometers remaining, stating that no stage winner would be declared, though points for other classifications would be awarded. The cancellation followed several recent incidents where protesters disrupted the race and endangered riders, including members of the Israel-Premier Tech team. Riders like Tom Pidcock, who was leading when the race was stopped, expressed deep disappointment and frustration over the situation.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on September 17, mortgage rates may begin to fall before the official decision. Mortgage rates are influenced by, but not directly set by, the Fed's policy, and lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of monetary policy shifts. Historical precedent shows that mortgage rates can drop ahead of a formal Fed announcement, as seen in the previous year. Furthermore, rates are also affected by other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield, which could decline independently and pull mortgage rates down with it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly crossed the 5% threshold before falling back after new data showed fewer job openings than economists had anticipated. The July Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report indicated a cooling labor market, which pushed Treasury yields lower. The earlier spike was attributed to market jitters over a federal court ruling against many of President Trump's tariffs and concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence. Investors are now closely watching for the upcoming August jobs report for further signals on the economy's direction. (not investment advice)</p>

He believes channeling that energy correctly and controlling their own reactions will be key to success at the boisterous Bethpage course.

Two men were arrested outside Cairo on suspicion of operating the site, which generated an estimated $6.2 million in advertising revenue.

          <p>Despite Apple CEO Tim Cook's successful efforts to mitigate the worst impacts of U.S. tariffs on the company's products, some Wall Street analysts predict a price increase for the upcoming iPhone 17 models. While Apple has managed its supply chain to minimize direct tariff costs, rising component prices and a trend toward more expensive models could lead the company to pass on costs to consumers. Analysts suggest any price hike would likely be subtle, such as eliminating lower-storage entry-level models to push customers toward more expensive options. The company has so far absorbed most tariff-related expenses, but that may change with this month's product launch.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of two decades of satellite data reveals that fresh water is disappearing at an alarming rate globally, with vast regions of the Earth experiencing "mega-drying." The study identifies expanding dry zones from the western U.S. to Central America and from Europe across the Middle East, affecting nearly 6 billion people. This desiccation is driven by rising temperatures from climate change and the chronic overpumping of groundwater from aquifers for agriculture and cities. Researchers warn that this rapid water loss, which now contributes more to sea level rise than melting glaciers, threatens food security, economic stability, and could fuel future conflicts.</p>
