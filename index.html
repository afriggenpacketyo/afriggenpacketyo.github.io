        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House stated that Israel's unilateral strike targeting Hamas leadership in Doha does not advance American or Israeli objectives, describing it as an "unfortunate incident." Press secretary Karoline Leavitt expressed that President Trump feels "very badly" about the attack's location in a key allied nation actively involved in peace negotiations. A dispute has emerged over prior notification, as the White House claims it informed Qatar just before the strike, while Qatari officials deny receiving any warning before the explosions occurred.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Key inflation reports for August are anticipated to show a 0.3% monthly increase in both producer and consumer prices, which would push the annual headline consumer price index to 2.9%. Despite this acceleration, economists believe the Federal Reserve will likely proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. This is because the price hikes are largely attributed to tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader services, and policymakers are expected to prioritize addressing the weakening jobs market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether credit card issuers will waive payments for individuals who have lost their jobs, concluding that complete waivers are uncommon. However, many companies offer hardship programs that can temporarily reduce or pause payments, though interest typically continues to accrue. To qualify, customers must proactively contact their issuer and may need to provide documentation of their job loss. The article also outlines alternative strategies for managing debt during unemployment, such as credit counseling and debt settlement programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on UAPs, investigative journalist George Knapp testified about a 1982 incident where UFOs allegedly nearly caused a nuclear war. Knapp claimed to have obtained Soviet documents indicating that unidentified objects appeared over an ICBM base, performed incredible maneuvers, and caused the missile launch control codes to activate. According to his testimony, the systems only returned to normal after the UFOs disappeared, narrowly averting a catastrophic launch. Other military personnel also shared their own UAP encounters at the hearing.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced the suspension of all restaurant remodels following intense customer criticism of its recent rebranding efforts. The company acknowledged that feedback showed customers felt the planned modern designs did not reflect the cherished "Old Country Store" atmosphere. This decision comes shortly after the restaurant chain had already reverted to its classic logo due to a similar public outcry. The chain affirmed its commitment to maintaining the vintage Americana aesthetic that defines its brand.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has confirmed it conducted a "precise strike" in Doha, Qatar, targeting the senior leadership of Hamas, whom it holds responsible for the October 7th attack. The strike, which drew immediate condemnation from Qatar as a "cowardly" act, reportedly occurred while Hamas leaders were discussing a U.S. ceasefire proposal. Hamas stated that five of its members were killed but that its senior negotiating team was not harmed, accusing Israel of trying to derail peace talks and holding the U.S. jointly responsible.</p>

          <h2>First Judge in Brazilian Supreme Court Trial Finds Jair Bolsonaro Guilty of Coup Plot</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 14:33:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Brazilian Supreme Court trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, the first of five justices, Alexandre de Moraes, has voted to find him guilty of plotting a coup. Justice Moraes asserted there was "no doubt" that Bolsonaro led a "criminal organisation" that attempted to overturn the 2022 election results. A conviction requires a majority vote from at least three of the five justices and could lead to a prison sentence of over 40 years for the former leader, who denies all charges.</p>

          <p>Dave Rowntree, the drummer for the band Blur, is set to release a photography book titled "No One You Know," which documents the band's early years. The photos, taken by Rowntree himself around the time of their 1991 debut album "Leisure," capture the unremarkable, behind-the-scenes moments before the band achieved global fame. The collection offers a rare and candid glimpse into the nascent days of the Britpop movement, preserving a period of naivety and creative energy that was not widely documented.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered the complete evacuation of Gaza City, which was home to approximately one million people before the war, in preparation for a planned full-scale invasion. Hundreds of thousands of residents remain in the city, facing severe famine conditions and with no safe place to relocate within the besieged enclave. This order follows a recent Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Doha and signals a major escalation in the nearly two-year conflict, prompting warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe from the United Nations.</p>

          <p>A grassroots movement in France known as "Bloquons Tout" or "Let's Block Everything" is organizing widespread anti-government protests, strikes, and disruptions across the country for Wednesday. The planned actions are expected to impact all French airports, block key entrances to Paris, and potentially affect major companies like Amazon and TotalEnergies. This mobilization comes as President Macron appoints a new prime minister to navigate a political crisis centered on a deeply unpopular cost-cutting budget, with authorities planning to deploy 80,000 police officers in response.</p>
