          <p>The United States is experiencing severe weather on opposite ends of the continent, with a powerful nor'easter causing flooding and travel disruptions along the East Coast while remnants of Typhoon Halong devastate western Alaska. New Jersey and parts of New York have declared states of emergency in response to heavy rain and high winds from the nor'easter. Simultaneously, Alaskan coastal communities are facing catastrophic flooding that has washed entire homes from their foundations, prompting extensive search and rescue operations for unaccounted residents. Governor Mike Dunleavy has expanded the state's disaster declaration to address the crisis.</p>

The development comes ahead of a major peace summit in Egypt, where world leaders will discuss a lasting solution to the two-year conflict and the rebuilding of Gaza.

          <p>In a move described as "highly exceptional," the Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned semiconductor manufacturer, to safeguard Europe's technological supply chain. The government invoked the "Goods Availability Act" due to "serious governance shortcomings" that posed a risk to Dutch and European economic security, particularly in the automotive sector. This action, which led to a sharp drop in the parent company's stock, suspends the firm's leadership and freezes operational changes for up to a year. The intervention highlights escalating trade tensions between China and the West over critical technologies.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region experienced significant losses, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling over 2%, following a renewed escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China. The downturn was triggered by former President Trump's threat of new retaliatory tariffs, which China's Ministry of Commerce met with accusations of American "double standards." Despite the market volatility, some analysts believe the correction could present a buying opportunity for Chinese stocks, which they consider undervalued. The renewed friction follows China's recent move to impose new export controls on rare earth minerals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is demonstrating MVP-caliber potential in his second season, seemingly ending the team's search for a successor to Tom Brady. In a recent victory over the New Orleans Saints, Maye showcased remarkable composure and skill, throwing for 261 yards and three touchdowns without any turnovers. His consistent high-level play, marked by five consecutive games with a passer rating over 100, has elevated him into an elite group of young quarterbacks. This rapid development has exceeded expectations and repositioned the Patriots as serious contenders within their division.</p>

The research suggests that foreign exporters have not significantly lowered their prices to absorb the duties, meaning U.S. importers are footing the bill.

          <p>A helicopter crash in a busy oceanfront area of Huntington Beach, California, resulted in five people being hospitalized, including two occupants of the aircraft and three pedestrians on the ground. Video footage captured the helicopter spinning out of control before striking palm trees and a pedestrian bridge stairway. The aircraft, a Bell 222, was reportedly part of a landing party event for a local car and helicopter show. The crash caused significant debris and led to the closure of the Pacific Coast Highway while authorities began their investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>Paramjit Singh, a 48-year-old U.S. green card holder with a brain tumor and a heart condition, has been in an immigration detention center for over two months and is facing deportation. Singh, who has lived in Indiana since 1994, was detained upon returning from a trip to India, with authorities citing two decades-old criminal cases. His family and lawyer argue that the cases are resolved and are being used to unjustly hold him without proper medical care. They are challenging the detention, which they describe as unethical and dangerous to his health.</p>
