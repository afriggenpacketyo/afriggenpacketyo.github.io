          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has vehemently condemned recent U.S. airstrikes targeting alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea, calling them an "act of tyranny" and demanding legal action against U.S. officials if Colombian lives were lost. Petro highlighted that these strikes, which have reportedly resulted in 17 deaths this month, violate international human rights and the principle of proportional force, asserting that arrests could be made without resorting to lethal means. He noted a long history of successful, non-lethal collaboration with U.S. agencies in maritime drug seizures. The Colombian leader also accused the Trump administration of disrespecting his nation and its sovereignty, while the White House maintained its resolve to use all available power to halt drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appears "much more willing to talk" about peace than in previous encounters, echoing a similar sentiment regarding Russian President Vladimir Putin. Lula is actively reviving a joint Brazil-China peace plan, emphasizing the need for the United Nations to lead negotiations and regain its central role in international diplomacy. This push for a ceasefire and a contact group comes after a rare alignment between China and Brazil on a U.S.-led Security Council initiative, signaling a potential turning point in diplomatic efforts. The six-point plan includes humanitarian access, prisoner exchanges, and civilian protection, despite initial dismissal from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely advanced on Thursday, diverging from Wall Street's recent declines driven by a second consecutive day of selling in major tech stocks like Nvidia and Oracle. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw a modest rise, buoyed by Chinese automaker Chery Automobile's strong debut after its $1.2 billion IPO, with Xiaomi shares also gaining on new device launches. South Korea's Kospi was near flat, but defense stocks performed well, while Taiwan's Taiex dipped due to TSMC's fall following reports of Intel seeking Apple investment. U.S. stock futures remained stable as investors awaited jobless claims data, which could influence Federal Reserve policy amid labor market concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chery Automobile, China's leading vehicle exporter, experienced an impressive 11% jump in its Hong Kong stock market debut, having raised US$1.2 billion through its initial public offering. Despite the listing ceremony being canceled due to a super typhoon, the company's shares traded significantly above their IPO price. Chery is rapidly expanding its global footprint, particularly in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Europe, with plans to launch new SUV models. Industry experts note Chery's strategic advantage in manufacturing across multiple countries, which helps mitigate the impact of rising tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles in markets like the U.S., Canada, and the European Union.

          <p>The White House has indicated it will pursue permanent layoffs, rather than temporary furloughs, for some federal workers if the government shuts down on October 1. This significant shift from past shutdowns, outlined in a memo to agency heads, aims to eliminate programs deemed inconsistent with the president's priorities. The move, championed by Budget Director Russell Vought, faces opposition from Democrats and the GAO, who dispute the president's authority to control spending in this manner. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced the memo as an "attempt at intimidation," as lawmakers remain deadlocked over a funding bill, with Democrats insisting on Affordable Care Act subsidies.</p>

          <p>Leaked documents and data reveal that England's Environment Agency (EA) is struggling to monitor serious pollution incidents, often failing to send investigators to nearly a third of potentially serious water industry cases in 2024. The EA frequently relied on water companies, who might be responsible for the pollution, for updates and even downgraded incidents without in-person inspections. An internal document stated all potentially serious incidents should be attended, yet the agency only visited 13% of all reported incidents last year. Critics argue this allows polluters to act with impunity and highlights a "hollowed out" agency, prompting calls for regulatory reform.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama articulated his view that the United States is currently embroiled in a "tug of war" between two distinct visions for its future. He criticized progressives for becoming "smug" and "complacent" in recent decades, allowing populist movements, including those led by President Trump, to push a more conservative and hierarchical worldview. Obama asserted that Trump's vision seeks to return to an America where "we, the people" excludes certain groups, challenging the nation's core values. This article highlights the deep ideological divisions within the country and Obama's perspective on the ongoing political struggle.</p>

Kimmel's return followed a week-long suspension over comments about the Charlie Kirk killing, which prompted FCC threats and affiliate preemption.

          <p>Donald Trump alleged "triple sabotage" at the United Nations after experiencing a series of technical malfunctions during his visit, including an escalator stopping, a teleprompter failing, and a microphone being off during his speech. Trump demanded an immediate investigation, suggesting a conspiracy to humiliate him and citing a newspaper report about UN staff joking about turning off escalators. The UN, however, attributed the escalator incident to a U.S. delegation videographer inadvertently triggering a safety function. This article highlights the president's strong reaction to perceived slights and the UN's factual response, creating a diplomatic incident dubbed "escalatorgate."</p>

          <p>The U.S. tech sector, particularly startups and smaller firms, is scrambling to adapt to a new $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, a program for skilled foreign workers. While the fee currently applies only to future applicants, it poses a crippling burden for many businesses, potentially forcing some to offshore operations or limit hiring. The Trump administration justified the fee by citing "abuse" of the program, aiming to prioritize higher-paid workers. Economists warn that this policy could lead to a "brain drain," shrinking the labor force and hindering productivity, rather than benefiting American workers as intended. (not investment advice)</p>
