          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Mohammed Sinwar, a key leader within Hamas, has been killed, although he provided no specific details. The announcement was made during a speech to Israel's parliament amidst ongoing efforts by the U.S. to broker a temporary ceasefire in the conflict. Mohammed Sinwar had reportedly been managing Hamas operations since the death of his brother Yahya. The report of Sinwar's death comes after nearly 20 months of conflict between Israel and Hamas, which began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in October 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>HP's shares declined by 15% after the company's second-quarter results revealed missed earnings and guidance, partly attributed to tariffs. While revenue exceeded expectations, earnings per share fell short, and the outlook for the third quarter also disappointed analysts. HP anticipates that tariffs will continue to exert pressure on its financial performance. The company is actively working to mitigate these costs by expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of China, with plans to have nearly all products sold in North America built elsewhere by the end of June (not investment advice).</p>

Abercrombie is diversifying its sourcing network and working with vendors to mitigate the impact of tariffs, having already reduced its reliance on Chinese suppliers.</p>

Petrova's case began with a customs violation after she carried frog embryo samples into the country without declaring them.
