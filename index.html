          <p>David Lammy, the UK Foreign Secretary, has strongly criticized Israeli authorities for denying entry to two Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, labeling the action as "unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning."

          <p>Kenan Malik reviews Joel Budd's book, *Underdogs*, which challenges common political perceptions of the white working class, arguing that their distinctiveness stems more from geography than ethnicity. The review highlights that white workers often reside outside major metropolitan areas with limited social mobility and opportunities, leading to disparities in education and aspirations. Budd identifies different segments within the white working class, including "heartlands," "enclaves," and "colonies," each with unique experiences and perspectives. The review also critiques the use of the working class as an alibi for elite prejudices, particularly in the immigration debate, and calls for a reclaiming of class politics to address the issues faced by this demographic.</p>

          <p>Will Hutton argues that Britain should not be cowed by Donald Trump's tariffs but instead should seize opportunities in Europe, Canada, and beyond to sustain a rules-based, open global trading and financial system. He suggests that Britain should combine with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU to create a new global trade order. Hutton proposes associating Canada as a privileged trade partner with the EU and extending the terms of that association to a newly relevant commonwealth, including African and Asian members. He emphasizes the need for Britain to introduce a defense levy to raise defense spending and turbocharge public investment to offset recession.</p>

          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier is believed to have taken an alternative route to the east of Taiwan before a drill, a move analysts say was likely training to counter American warships nearby and to explore alternative routes in the event of a conflict over the island. The Shandong appears to have bypassed the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, instead transiting via narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago. Analysts said the new route could give the People’s Liberation Army alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, seen as a strategic chokepoint.</p>

          <p>UK newspaper headlines are dominated by Donald Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the British economy, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer ordering an "economic reset." Several papers also lead with the arrest of Labour MP Dan Norris on suspicion of rape and child sex offenses. Other front-page stories include reports of Russian sensors found in British waters and the government's response to the tariff "blitz." The papers also cover the Grand National winner and Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood's comments.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's 10% tariff on imports from many countries, including the UK, has taken effect, causing significant disruption in global markets. China has responded with countermeasures, including tariffs on US goods and export curbs on rare earth minerals. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is engaging with foreign leaders to address the situation, while the UK government is consulting with businesses on potential countermeasures. Experts predict that the tariffs will lead to higher prices and significant changes in global trade patterns.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban has voiced concerns that President Donald Trump's tariff plan, combined with DOGE cuts, could lead to an economic crisis worse than the 2008 financial crisis. Cuban suggests that the combination of aggressive tariffs and workforce reductions could have long-term negative impacts. During the 2008 financial crisis, the country experienced a significant decline in GDP, high unemployment, and a housing market crash. Cuban did not expand upon why he sees the sweeping cuts to the federal workforce led by the DOGE office as related to the nation's economic health.</p>
