          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily halted the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the man accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder. Soliman, an Egyptian national, is charged with attempted murder and a federal hate crime after allegedly using Molotov cocktails at a pro-Israeli hostage march. The judge's order aims to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case, as Soliman's family, who are also Egyptian citizens, were taken into custody by ICE and were being processed for removal proceedings. The family's lawyers argued that punishing them for Soliman's alleged crimes violates democratic justice principles, asserting that they were unaware of his plans and have cooperated with investigators. The judge scheduled a hearing for June 13 to further consider the request for a temporary restraining order.</p>

          <p>Venezuela has responded to the Trump administration's travel ban by asserting that the United States is a dangerous place for travelers. Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister in Caracas, advised Venezuelan citizens against traveling to the U.S., accusing the U.S. government of fascism and unwarranted persecution of Venezuelans. Somalia, another country affected by the ban, stated its commitment to engaging in dialogue with Washington to address security concerns. The travel ban targets nationals from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, and Yemen, and imposes partial restrictions on travelers from seven additional countries, citing national security concerns and visa overstays.</p>

          <p>Nine Democratic candidates for New York City mayor participated in a debate focusing on key issues facing the city, such as housing affordability, crime, and the handling of the Trump administration. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, considered frontrunners, engaged in heated exchanges regarding their records and campaign funding. Candidates criticized Cuomo's handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations, while also targeting current Mayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent.

          <p>An illegal immigrant in Washington state was found guilty of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault in connection with the death of State Patrol Trooper Christopher Gadd. Raul Benitez-Santana, who admitted to drinking and smoking marijuana before the crash, was driving over 100 mph when he struck Gadd's vehicle, which was parked on the shoulder. ICE had issued a detainer request for Benitez-Santana, a Mexican citizen, who had previous encounters with immigration agents and a history of arrests for driving on a suspended license and domestic violence assault.

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration misused an autopen machine to sign presidential documents. The memo directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate a purported "conspiracy" to "abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline." Trump claims there are "serious doubts" regarding Biden's awareness and decision-making during his presidency, suggesting that the alleged autopen use could impact the legality of numerous executive actions. Biden has refuted these claims, calling them false and a distraction, while legal experts note that presidents have used autopens for decades, with the Justice Department affirming its legality in 2005.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran over Iran's nuclear program are facing uncertainty as both countries publicly disagree on the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal, stating it contradicts Iran's principles and vowing not to halt uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. President Trump has asserted that any agreement would require Iran to end enrichment activities, but U.S. officials have indicated that the initial proposal did not prohibit low-level enrichment. The contrasting stances and lack of formal response from Iran have cast doubt on the future of negotiations, although discussions for a potential sixth round of talks are ongoing.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years), gaining insight into how feathers evolved during this era. The study emphasizes that the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was an essential feature of the evolution of birds. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs in the ancient world did not have the same ability to fly, though there has been evidence that some species could glide or have powered flight.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has warned the accreditor of Columbia University that the institution is in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. The department alleges that Columbia leadership "acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students on its campus" following protests related to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Columbia is accused of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funding from discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The university's federal accreditor is now required to establish a plan to come into compliance or face potential action against Columbia, which could have significant implications for the university's eligibility for loans and financial aid.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may offer protection against dangerous infections. The study, which analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns, found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum halved the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers believe this early microbial encounter is crucial for immune system development. Further research is needed to understand the exact mechanisms by which these bacteria interact with the immune system, though it is known that B. longum begins by digesting breast milk.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting restart efforts on its onshore pipeline system near Santa Barbara. The Santa Ynez Unit, including offshore platforms and pipelines, was shut down after a major spill in 2015. The ruling, celebrated by environmental groups, argues that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. Sable officials said the decision would push back their restart timeline to August 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The FDA confirmed plans for the review, which aims to closely monitor the drug's safety. Experts, however, argue that concerns about mifepristone's safety are misguided and fueled by a report lacking transparency and scientific rigor. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 and has been used by millions, with medication abortions accounting for over half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023.</p>

White House officials maintain that Trump remains committed to passing the bill, despite Musk’s vocal opposition. The bill includes tax cuts, increased defense spending, and funding for deportations. The non-partisan budget office said on Wednesday that Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” would decrease federal revenues by $3.67tn while cutting spending by $1.25tn through 2034, as the national debt currently stands at $36tn (not investment advice).</p>

The country's approach includes reducing incentives for migrants, processing asylum claims outside the continent, and tightening rules on family reunions. While asylum applications have decreased, critics argue that these policies have damaged Denmark's reputation for respecting international humanitarian law.
