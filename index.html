          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney is calling for more robust anti-racism education campaigns and stricter penalties for clubs whose fans engage in racist behavior. He recounted a personal experience from his time managing DC United where a player was left in tears after being racially abused, emphasizing the profound and personal impact of such incidents. Rooney suggests that punishments like point deductions or significant financial penalties are necessary to compel clubs to effectively address the issue.</p>

The heated exchange led to Vance openly questioning Zelenskyy's gratitude for U.S. aid and Trump temporarily pausing negotiations. This historical context underscores the high stakes and past friction preceding the current summit, which now includes a broader contingent of European leaders.</p>

          <p>After a two-week walkout intended to block a Republican-led redistricting effort, Texas House Democrats have returned to the state capital. Their return provides the necessary quorum for the legislature to resume work on redrawing congressional maps, which could grant the GOP up to five new U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. This development in Texas has prompted California Democrats to advance their own redistricting plan in response, escalating a partisan battle over electoral boundaries nationwide.</p>

          <p>A school district in a low-income area of Pennsylvania is making music education more accessible by using 3D printers to create violins for its students. Superintendent Dr. Laura Jacob initiated the program, which produces the instruments for just $50 each, a small fraction of the typical annual rental cost. The innovative project has already provided over 200 free violins in five years, empowering students who might otherwise be unable to afford to play an instrument.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remaining attractive, financial experts are advising savers to carefully consider their personal financial situation before committing funds. Key factors include ensuring a sufficient emergency fund is in place and evaluating liquidity needs, as early withdrawals from CDs typically incur penalties. Savers should also compare CD rates with other low-risk options and consider a "CD ladder" strategy to maintain flexibility amid potential changes in Federal Reserve policy.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a proposed rule change to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program that would deny benefits to borrowers employed by certain types of organizations. The Department of Education aims to exclude employees of organizations that it deems to be "undermining national security and American values." Critics argue the vague language could be used to arbitrarily disqualify non-profits based on political ideology, potentially affecting groups that provide support to undocumented immigrants or transgender people.</p>

          <p>Germany's top football league, the Bundesliga, is facing concerns that it is losing its competitive edge against rivals like England's Premier League and Spain's La Liga. The recent departure of top talents such as Florian Wirtz and Kingsley Coman, coupled with a failure to attract major international stars, highlights a potential decline in the league's overall appeal. Financially, the Bundesliga lags significantly behind the Premier League in both total revenue and television rights deals, and it has also recently been surpassed in average stadium attendance.</p>
