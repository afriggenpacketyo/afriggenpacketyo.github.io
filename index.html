          <p>At least 50 people have died and over two dozen remain missing following catastrophic flash floods in central Texas. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities and a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, where many campers are unaccounted for. Rescue operations are extensive, with hundreds of people saved from trees and rooftops, but the scale of the disaster has shocked officials who admit the severity of the rainfall was not predicted. The event has prompted a federal disaster declaration, with search and rescue efforts ongoing amid the widespread destruction.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has finalized the signing of Spanish midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for a fee of nearly £60 million. The 26-year-old deep-lying midfielder has agreed to a five-year contract with the London-based club. This marks Arsenal's second major acquisition of the summer transfer window, following the arrival of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. Zubimendi, who came through Real Sociedad's youth academy, made 236 appearances for the Spanish team before making the move to the Premier League.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent cultural moments, such as Beyoncé's "Cowboy Carter," have highlighted a trend of Black artists reclaiming the American flag, prompting a discussion about its complex symbolism. For many Black Americans, the flag represents both a history of oppression and the ideals of a nation they helped build, creating a complicated relationship of pain and pride. This reclamation is seen by some as a signal of belonging and progress, particularly for younger generations further removed from the Jim Crow era. The article explores this evolving dynamic, considering the history of Black military service and the diverse perspectives within the Black community.</p>

          <p>A US federal advisory committee has recommended that flu shots for all age groups be administered using single-dose vaccines that do not contain thimerosal. This mercury-based preservative has been a subject of vaccine safety debates, despite scientific consensus finding no evidence of harm and discrediting its link to autism. Although 94% of current flu shots are already thimerosal-free, the move has raised concerns among some public health experts that it validates unfounded fears and could undermine vaccine confidence. The final decision on adopting the recommendation rests with the CDC and the Health Secretary.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Mark Rowley, has advocated for a major overhaul of the UK's policing structure, calling the current system unfit for purpose. He proposes consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12-15 larger regional "mega forces" to make better use of limited funding and improve technological capabilities. This call for reform comes as UK police struggle with the legacy of austerity, rising organized crime, and historically low public trust following high-profile scandals, including the sexual assault and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer.</p>

          <p>The UK's Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has stated that the government's recent U-turn on a package of welfare reforms has made future spending decisions more difficult. The reversal, forced by a rebellion of Labour MPs, means projected savings of £5 billion a year will be delayed or lost, impacting the Chancellor's budget. This development casts doubt on the possibility of scrapping the controversial two-child benefit cap, a policy the government was previously considering lifting to combat child poverty.

PEPFAR, initiated by President George W. Bush, is credited with saving 26 million lives but has been effectively frozen by the Trump administration, leading to a new humanitarian crisis. The author explores various reasons for the silence, including political loyalty to Trump, a lack of awareness, and a shift in focus within the evangelical community, contrasting the current inaction with the movement's "pro-life" stance on other issues.</p>

          <p>A California family who voted for Donald Trump, partly due to his promises of mass deportations, is now expressing shock after the mother, a Canadian national, was detained by ICE. Cynthia Olivera, who has lived in the U.S. without legal status since she was a child, was taken into custody during an interview for permanent residency and is now awaiting deportation. Her U.S. citizen husband stated they supported Trump's crackdown on criminal immigrants and never believed it would affect their family. The case highlights the broad scope of the administration's immigration enforcement, which affects individuals without criminal records.</p>

          <p>According to French intelligence officials, China has been conducting a coordinated campaign to undermine the reputation and sales of France's flagship Rafale fighter jet. The effort allegedly involved Chinese embassy defense attaches spreading doubts about the jet's performance, particularly after its use by India in clashes with Pakistan. This diplomatic lobbying was reportedly coupled with an online disinformation campaign to promote Chinese-made military aircraft as a superior alternative. The French government views this as an attack not just on a piece of military hardware, but on France's strategic and industrial credibility.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in central Texas, questions are being raised about the timeliness and effectiveness of the warning systems. While forecasters state that flash flood warnings were issued hours in advance, local officials and residents felt unprepared for the disaster's unprecedented speed and intensity. Kerr County's top official admitted that "nobody saw this coming," and noted that a proposal for a more robust siren-like warning system was rejected years ago due to cost. The tragedy has ignited a debate over forecasting accuracy and the responsibility of officials to act on warnings in flood-prone areas.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial. The therapy delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, correcting a mutation that prevents the transmission of sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants in the small-scale trial, including children and adults, showed significant hearing improvement within months, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing. The research, deemed safe and well-tolerated, offers hope for treating other forms of genetic hearing loss in the future.</p>

          <p>A shopkeeper in Durham, England, expressed frustration after a man who brazenly stole a crate of beer from his store faced no legal punishment. The owner, Andrew Board, personally stopped the thief and brought him back, but police dealt with the matter through a "community resolution," where the offender simply paid for the stolen goods and was banned from the shop. Board argues this sends the wrong signal and provides no deterrent, reflecting a national trend where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses go unpunished, forcing retailers to take their own costly security measures.</p>

          <p>A growing number of monasteries and convents in Germany are being closed and sold due to a dramatic decline in the number of monks and nuns. The number of convents has fallen by over 40% in a decade, a trend driven by secularization, smaller family sizes, and more professional opportunities for women. This decline has social consequences, as religious orders have long operated schools and hospitals. While the closures are often painful, some see it as a chance to repurpose the historic buildings for new community uses, such as housing or cultural centers.</p>
