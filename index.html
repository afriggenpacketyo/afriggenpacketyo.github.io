          <p>Russia launched one of its most extensive aerial attacks in recent months, targeting seven regions across Ukraine for over 12 hours with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that at least four people, including a 12-year-old girl, were killed in the capital, Kyiv, with another 40 injured. The attacks damaged civilian infrastructure, including an institute of cardiology and a bread factory, prompting Zelensky to vow retaliation and call for a strong reaction from international allies. The assault occurred as the UN General Assembly week concluded, highlighting ongoing escalations in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Vietnamese authorities are conducting mass evacuations of more than 250,000 people from coastal areas in preparation for Typhoon Bualoi, which is expected to make landfall with powerful winds and heavy rain. Four coastal airports have been closed, and thousands of troops have been mobilized for assistance. The fast-moving storm, which previously killed at least 10 people in the Philippines, poses a significant threat of flash floods, landslides, and coastal inundation. Vietnam, with its long coastline, is frequently vulnerable to destructive typhoons, which have caused hundreds of fatalities and billions in economic damage in recent years.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang characterized China as being only “nanoseconds behind” the United States in semiconductor technology, emphasizing the need for American companies to compete vigorously on a global scale. Speaking on a podcast, Huang highlighted China's vast talent pool, strong work ethic, and vibrant internal competition as key factors in its rapid technological advancement. He argued that allowing U.S. industry to compete in China helps proliferate American technology and maximize the nation's economic and geopolitical influence. Huang also expressed his belief that it is in China's best interest to remain open to foreign investment and competition.</p>

          <p>Moldovans are voting in a critical parliamentary election that will determine whether the nation deepens its ties with the European Union or pivots back toward Russia's sphere of influence. The election is tense, with pro-EU President Maia Sandu accusing Russia of “massive interference” and attempting to destabilize the country. Ahead of the vote, two pro-Russian parties were disqualified over claims of illegal financing, a move their leaders called biased. Polls suggest Sandu's ruling party may struggle to maintain its majority, setting the stage for a contentious political outcome in the strategically important Eastern European country.</p>

The wedding was confirmed through an Instagram post by Gomez, which featured photos of the couple in their wedding attire and was captioned with the date of the ceremony.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system. A similar proposal was rejected by voters in 2021 due to concerns over data protection and the involvement of private companies. The revised plan ensures the system will be entirely state-run and optional, with personal data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents maintain fears of privacy erosion and potential data misuse, though recent polls suggest voters may be more receptive this time.</p>

The crackdown comes in response to eight separate incidents, including items being thrown at cars, criminal damage, and alcohol-related disturbances. Police have increased patrols and described the dispersal order as a proactive measure to address the concerning rise in such incidents across the wider Wigan area.</p>

          <p>Four prominent Scottish crime figures have been arrested in Dubai, revealing the international reach of a violent, 25-year-long feud between the Lyons and Daniel crime families. The men are linked to a range of criminal activities, from drug importation to a recent wave of violence across Scotland's central belt. The feud, now involving a second generation of leaders, has been marked by murders, kidnappings, and brutal attacks. The arrests in the UAE, a location previously seen as a safe haven for criminals, suggest a potential shift in international law enforcement cooperation that could lead to their extradition.</p>

          <p>The breakaway region of Transnistria in eastern Moldova serves as a significant military and operational base for Russia, creating a persistent source of instability for the country. Following a post-Soviet war in 1992, the internationally unrecognized territory has been controlled by a Kremlin-aligned separatist regime and hosts approximately 1,500 Russian soldiers. The region functions as a hub for Russian intelligence services and money laundering, and it contains a large Soviet-era weapons arsenal. Russia's long-standing military presence and political influence in Transnistria have consistently undermined Moldova's sovereignty and complicated its path toward European integration.</p>

          <p>Sweeping United Nations sanctions have been reimposed on Iran after the UK, France, and Germany activated the "snapback" mechanism from the 2015 nuclear deal. The European powers cited Iran's "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation with international inspectors as the reason for the move. The sanctions were originally lifted as part of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) but are now back in effect after Iran suspended inspections following US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear sites in June. Iran has called the sanctions illegal and unjust, further straining diplomatic relations and jeopardizing future negotiations.</p>

The author contends that both leaders share a hostility towards liberal democracy, the EU, and international law, while promoting ultranationalism and supporting hard-right populist parties across the continent. This perceived pincer movement employs different methods—from Trump's economic pressure and cultural influence to Putin's military threats and hybrid warfare—but shares the core goal of undermining European unity, security, and progressive values, creating a geopolitical situation reminiscent of 1939.</p>

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team and hiring a new specialist coach, Newcastle United has struggled to score from set-pieces this season. The team has generated numerous chances from corners and free-kicks but has only found the net on one occasion from such situations. Head coach Eddie Howe has taken responsibility for the lack of success, stating that "something is not quite clicking." The article contrasts Newcastle's performance with that of their upcoming opponent, Arsenal, who have been highly effective from dead-ball situations, highlighting a key tactical area where Newcastle needs significant improvement to be more competitive.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the deal structuring U.S. control over TikTok's American operations may be a strategic victory for China. While the framework appears to place American data and algorithms under U.S. control, a closer look reveals that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, remains the single largest shareholder of the U.S. entity. The article suggests that despite the appearance of a resolution brokered by the Trump administration, this arrangement still leaves China with significant leverage over the popular social media platform. The author posits that what seems like a win for the United States could ultimately serve Beijing's long-term strategic interests.</p>

          <p>This article challenges recent negative portrayals of autism by the Trump administration, arguing that many traits associated with autism are highly valuable. The author highlights qualities such as hyperfocus, a deep adherence to facts and logic, and a profound sense of empathy and social justice as characteristics that could teach society important lessons. Citing examples from Greta Thunberg's activism to the pure joy expressed by autistic children, the piece reframes autism not as a tragedy needing a cure, but as a different way of experiencing the world that possesses unique strengths and offers a powerful counterpoint to political dishonesty and chaos.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, has unveiled a new monument to commemorate the 1885 massacre of 28 Chinese coal miners, a pivotal moment in acknowledging its violent, anti-immigrant history. The seven-foot bronze statue, titled 'Requiem,' depicts a Chinese miner and was dedicated on the 140th anniversary of the event. This public act of remembrance, supported by local officials and museums, marks a significant shift for a community that had long overlooked this dark chapter.

          <h2>Hairy Crab Prices Fall in China Amid Weak Consumer Spending</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The retail price of hairy crabs, a popular seasonal delicacy in China, has fallen significantly just before the country's eight-day "super golden week" holiday. Industry insiders attribute the price drop to a combination of higher production, reduced demand for gift-giving, and weak overall household spending. The lower prices for this luxury food item are being viewed as an indicator of broader consumption doldrums in the Chinese economy. The upcoming holiday period is considered a crucial test for domestic demand, and the sluggish market for hairy crabs suggests a cautious consumer sentiment across the country.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has confirmed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold its entire stake in the company, a position it had held since 2008. In a public statement, a BYD executive described the selling of shares as a "completely normal" part of investing and expressed gratitude for the 17 years of support from Buffett and Charlie Munger. While BYD's management projected an unfazed response, the news of the complete exit by such a prominent long-term investor led to a more than 6% drop in the company's shares in Hong Kong amid signs of cooling growth.
