            <p>ASML shares dropped 6% after the Dutch semiconductor equipment giant missed order expectations, reporting net bookings of 3.94 billion euros. CEO Christophe Fouquet cited uncertainty from potential U.S. trade restrictions as a factor affecting demand for its chipmaking machines, despite a strong demand outlook driven by artificial intelligence. The company is estimating 2025 revenue between 30 billion and 35 billion euros, but Fouquet noted that tariffs are creating uncertainty on both a macroeconomic level and regarding potential market demands.

The U.S. government will end a customs exception allowing small-value parcels from Hong Kong to enter the U.S. without tax, slapping a 120% tariff on them starting from May 2. The Hong Kong government stated that it would not collect tariffs on behalf of Washington and suspended accepting non-airmail parcels containing goods destined for the U.S.</p>

            <h2>Oakland Mayoral Special Election Too Close to Call</h2>

            <p>Former City Councilmember Loren Taylor took a very slim lead in early results in Oakland’s special mayoral election on Tuesday against former Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee in a race prompted by a series of recent scandals that culminated in the recall of the city’s mayor in November. The race to lead the Northern California city remained too close to call late Tuesday night. But Taylor’s strong early showing is the latest plot twist in a race that many expected Lee, a progressive icon who spent nearly 30 years representing the East Bay in Congress, to easily win after she declared her candidacy in January.</p>

Together, they have established a charity called 2Wish, which offers support to those who have experienced the sudden death of a child, and they continue to support each other through their shared grief.</p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence-driven demand for data centers is causing structural changes in electricity infrastructure and utility costs, potentially leading to higher utility bills for U.S. consumers. Special contracts between utilities and data center companies and excessive development of energy infrastructure are contributing factors. In the U.K., a proposed reform to the electricity market could favor data centers harnessing renewable energy, but may result in higher wholesale prices for residents. Regulation and energy grid reform are crucial to managing energy prices and meeting changing energy needs.</p>

            <p>Some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being "torched alive" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires, conservationists have warned. Endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles are particularly at risk, with their habitats being destroyed by the blazes. A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures in March are believed to have contributed to the fires. Conservationists are calling for government funding to help restore peat bogs in the uplands to prevent fires and provide habitat.</p>

            <p>President Trump's refusal to abide by court rulings, particularly in the case of Armando Abrego Garcia, has raised concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. Legal experts are divided on whether the U.S. is already in a constitutional crisis, with some arguing that Trump's actions undermine the separation of powers and an independent judiciary. The Abrego Garcia case involves the administration's defiance of court orders to facilitate the return of a man deported to El Salvador, leading to questions about the limits of presidential power and the enforcement of court rulings.</p>

Google required manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome on devices, and excluded rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model.</p>
