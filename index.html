          <p>A 38-year-old woman in Thessaloniki, Greece, died early Saturday morning when a bomb she was allegedly carrying exploded prematurely. According to police, the woman intended to plant the device outside a bank ATM, but it detonated in her hands, causing damage to nearby storefronts and vehicles. The woman had a criminal record involving drugs and prostitution, and authorities are investigating potential ties to extreme leftist groups. Greece has a history of politically motivated violence and occasional bombings attributed to organized crime, prompting warnings from officials about emerging domestic extremists.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in operating earnings for the first quarter, falling to $9.64 billion, compared to $11.22 billion in the same period last year, with Warren Buffett warning of potential profit impacts from tariffs. The decline was largely attributed to a 48.6% plunge in insurance-underwriting profit, which was significantly affected by $1.1 billion in losses from the Southern California wildfires. Additionally, the company experienced a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange, contrasting with a $597 million gain in the previous year, reflecting the dollar's weakened value in the first quarter.</p>

          <p>As the May 7 deadline approaches for REAL ID requirements, experts are divided on the benefits and potential drawbacks. Supporters like Simon Hankinson from the Heritage Foundation argue that REAL ID will bolster national security by requiring additional documentation and preventing illegal immigrants from easily moving throughout the country. Conversely, critics such as Jim Harper from the American Enterprise Institute contend that REAL ID effectively creates a national identification system that could infringe on individual liberties and treat law-abiding citizens with suspicion. Harper argues that entering citizens into a national database poses risks of government overreach and monitoring.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term as Australia's Prime Minister, becoming the first leader in 21 years to achieve this milestone. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging the historic occasion for the Labor Party. The election was heavily influenced by energy policy and inflation, with both parties acknowledging a cost-of-living crisis. Albanese's Labor Party won 70 seats, while the conservative opposition coalition secured 24 seats in the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>A valuation metric known as the 'Buffett Indicator,' favored by Warren Buffett, suggests that U.S. equities may be trading at relatively attractive levels. The ratio, which compares the total value of publicly traded U.S. companies to the country's GDP, currently sits around 180%. This level is similar to that seen after last year's rapid unwinding of the Japanese yen carry trade, which preceded a strong S&P 500 rally. Some analysts believe this signals an opportunity to deploy capital and buy stocks, but others caution about factors like elevated interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel the New Jersey state police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used to send ransom notes in the 93-year-old Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. Researchers aim to determine whether Bruno Hauptmann, who was convicted and executed for the crime, acted alone or with co-conspirators. Plaintiffs argue that advanced DNA testing could clarify lingering questions about the case and contribute to a more accurate historical account, while state police cite concerns about damaging the evidence.</p>

          <p>Warren Donaldson, 64, sought medical attention after experiencing symptoms similar to those described by NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in a public service announcement about atrial fibrillation. Doctors discovered an orange-sized mass growing inside Donaldson's heart, a rare condition known as a pericardiac cyst, which was compressing his right ventricular outflow tract. An open-heart procedure was performed to remove the cyst and rebuild his RVOT, allowing Donaldson to resume his normal activities. Donaldson credits Abdul-Jabbar's PSA for encouraging him to get checked, potentially saving his life.</p>
