          <p>Two men were arrested in Salt Lake City, Utah, following the discovery of an incendiary device under a news media vehicle, which had been lit but failed to detonate. Police and fire department bomb squads responded to the suspicious device parked near an occupied building. FBI investigations led to a search warrant at a Magna home, yielding explosives, firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction. The 58-year-old and 31-year-old suspects face potential charges including weapons possession and terrorism threats, with no motive immediately released for the incident.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that foreign workers are "welcome" in the U.S., emphasizing the need for their expertise in complex manufacturing, days after hundreds of South Korean nationals were arrested in Georgia. The arrests, related to visa overstays and work permit violations at a Hyundai-LG factory site, sparked alarm in South Korea, despite the U.S. deciding against deportation. Trump's statement aimed to reassure investors, highlighting the temporary nature of foreign experts' roles to train American workers.

          <p>A significant portion of car owners are "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicle's worth, a trend that has reached a four-year high. This situation affects 26.6% of trade-ins, compelling drivers to either pay the outstanding balance in cash or roll it into a new loan, exacerbating financial burdens. Factors contributing to this include rapid vehicle depreciation, the increasing prevalence of longer loan terms, and smaller initial down payments. Experts recommend maintaining current vehicles if feasible, or securing pre-approved, lower-interest loans and considering gap insurance for new purchases to mitigate financial risk.

          <p>Tens of thousands protested in Ankara against what the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader, Ozgur Ozel, calls a "judicial coup" by the Turkish government.

Critics view the case, alleging vote-rigging in the 2023 CHP congress, as politically motivated, aimed at undermining the party after its significant local election victories.

          <p>Researchers have developed a groundbreaking, inexpensive device, an "optical sieve," to detect nanoplastics in waterways and biological samples. Published in Nature Photonics, this method uses a standard microscope and camera to identify particles as small as 200 nanometers. Nanoplastics, smaller than microplastics, pose significant environmental and health challenges due to their ability to cross biological barriers, making them incredibly difficult to find. This innovation simplifies detection, previously complex and costly, and could lead to portable monitoring devices, aiding efforts to reduce plastic pollution globally.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has identified Charles Mwesigwa as the alleged boss of a sexual assault ring operating in Dubai, exploiting vulnerable Ugandan women. These women, often tricked into believing they were traveling for legitimate jobs, were coerced into degrading sexual acts, including extreme fetishes. The article also reports two women linked to Mwesigwa died after falling from high-rise apartments, with their families questioning the suicide rulings. Mwesigwa denies the allegations, claiming he only connects women with wealthy contacts, while victims describe severe debt and police inaction.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a popular two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Credited with bringing greater financial stability to the state in the 1990s, Edgar was known for cutting the state budget and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent for public schools. A moderate Republican, he grew uneasy with his party's shift rightward and notably supported Kamala Harris's presidential bid last year. Edgar remained a respected party statesman and adviser after leaving office, leaving a significant political legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 formation. Despite improvements in team compactness, individual errors in defensive situations, particularly from Bruno Fernandes playing in a deeper midfield role, are costing the team points. Murphy highlights instances where players like Luke Shaw appear uncomfortable in their assigned positions, affecting overall team performance. He suggests that manager Ruben Amorim must recognize and address these personnel issues to prevent continued mistakes and improve the team's balance on the pitch.</p>

The US justified cuts citing concerns about aid benefiting the Taliban, a claim the Taliban denies. The closures have overwhelmed remaining hospitals, exacerbated by Taliban restrictions on women's education and healthcare training, creating a humanitarian crisis.</p>
