          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has declared a local emergency and implemented a curfew in downtown Los Angeles, effective from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests that have led to vandalism and looting. The curfew applies to a one-square-mile area in downtown L.A., with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and the homeless. The decision follows several days of demonstrations and nearly 469 arrests, with 23 businesses looted on Monday night, prompting law enforcement to arrest individuals who violate the curfew. President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to protect federal offices has further heightened tensions, drawing criticism from Governor Newsom, who argues it is an illegal and immoral act.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom delivered a scathing critique of President Trump's immigration policies, asserting that "democracy is under assault" due to the president's actions in Los Angeles. Newsom accused Trump of deploying a "military dragnet" across the city and targeting not only criminals but also law-abiding immigrants, such as dishwashers and gardeners. He recounted instances of ICE agents detaining individuals outside a Home Depot and sending unmarked cars to schools, expressing concern over the federal government's overreach. Newsom warned that Trump's decision to deploy the California National Guard without his support as governor sets a dangerous precedent for other states.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver of New Jersey has been indicted on three counts of assaulting federal law enforcement officers during a clash outside a Newark ICE detention center last month. The charges stem from an incident on May 9, when McIver and other members of Congress attempted to conduct federal oversight of the Delaney Hall detention center, leading to a confrontation between protesters and law enforcement. According to a Homeland Security Investigations agent, McIver allegedly slammed her forearm into an agent and pushed an ICE officer during the incident. McIver has stated that she will plead not guilty, calling the indictment a politically motivated attempt to intimidate her.</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) suffered a heavy 4-0 defeat against Switzerland in a friendly match, raising concerns about their preparedness for the upcoming World Cup. All four goals were conceded in the first half, marking the first time since 1980 that the USMNT has given up four goals by the 40th minute at home. The loss extends the team's winless streak against European opponents to eight games since 2021, prompting boos from fans at Geodis Park. The team was missing several key players, including Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, contributing to their poor performance.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the restoration of several Army base names that originally honored Confederate military figures, reversing a renaming process initiated by Congress and completed under President Biden. The bases will now recognize other service members with similar names, rather than Confederates. This decision affects bases such as Fort Gordon, Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Hood, Fort Lee, Fort Pickett, Fort Polk, and Fort Rucker. Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll is tasked with implementing these changes, which unwind a process overseen by the Naming Commission established to remove Confederate symbols.</p>

Abrego Garcia faces human smuggling charges after being held in El Salvador despite a judge's ruling against his deportation. Newman accuses the Trump administration of defying court orders and disparaging Abrego Garcia, while highlighting warnings from Salvadorians about the erosion of democratic institutions.</p>
