        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chris Brown appeared in Southwark Crown Court in London and pleaded not guilty to an assault charge stemming from an alleged bottle attack at a London nightclub two years prior, where he is accused of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to music producer Abraham Diaw. Brown also faces charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and having an offensive weapon, which were added to his indictment. The judge adjourned arraignment on the additional counts, setting a further plea hearing date for July 11, 2025, with the trial scheduled for October 26, 2026. Brown was arrested last month in Manchester and released after paying a Â£5m security fee, which allows him to travel for his tour dates while surrendering his passport when not needed.</p>

          <p>A 69-year-old woman, Nancy Pexton, has been charged with the murder of Jennifer Abbott, who was found stabbed in her Camden home. Abbott, also known as Sarah Steinberg, was discovered by her niece and neighbors with tape across her mouth on June 13th. Detectives believe the murder may be linked to a missing diamond-encrusted Rolex watch from Abbott's residence, and a post-mortem examination confirmed Abbott died from sharp force trauma. Neighbors described Abbott as a popular and intelligent member of the community who enjoyed walking her dog in the area.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, a key UK airbase, and sprayed two military planes with red paint, claiming responsibility for the act. The group, Palestine Action, stated they evaded security and rendered the supply planes "out of service" in protest of Britain's continued military support for Israel. The Ministry of Defence condemned the vandalism and is working with police to investigate the incident, while cabinet minister Lisa Nandy expressed deep concern. RAF Brize Norton serves as a hub for UK strategic air transport and refuelling, including flights to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, from which reconnaissance flights over Gaza have been conducted.</p>

This capital increase, along with debt refinancing, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited at 18.7%. The company recently secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces to provide priority-access space resources on its OneWeb LEO satellite constellation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An administration official suggests that President Trump's two-week timeline for Iran presents a diplomatic opportunity amid recent escalations. While there are no immediate signs of progress, Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff has been in communication with Iranâ€™s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. European diplomats are scheduled to hold talks with Araghchi in Geneva, though some U.S. officials are skeptical of their potential success. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been wary of negotiating with Iran, but the Trump administration views this period as a chance for diplomacy to unfold.</p>

          <p>A recent United Nations report indicates that 123 million people worldwide have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to conflict, persecution, or other threats. The report tracks refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons, revealing a significant increase in displacement since 2015, with most displaced internally within their own countries. Africa and the Middle East account for a large proportion of internally displaced persons, with Sudan hosting the highest number. While many refugees seek shelter in neighboring countries, developing countries disproportionately host the largest numbers, and the gap between asylum requests and decisions continues to widen.</p>

The fragments, discarded in a pit before A.D. 200, once adorned a high-status Roman building and offer insights into ancient Londinium's artistry and daily life. The reconstruction, led by Han Li at the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA), reveals vibrant yellow panel designs with motifs of birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres. The findings include what appears to be the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain and ancient graffiti, including a complete Greek alphabet.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are being sold for a record $10 billion to an investment group led by Mark Walter, signaling a shift in sports ownership. This sale illustrates that the best sports properties have become too valuable for individuals or families to control alone, with teams increasingly owned by consortiums of investors and institutions. The Lakers' new owners are expected to benefit from the team's strong market and loyal fanbase, similar to Walter's success with the Dodgers. This trend raises questions about accountability for teams not as successful, as large investor groups may be less visible and harder to hold responsible than individual owners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology challenges the long-held acoustic transmission hypothesis, which posits that birds sing at dawn because sound travels farther and more clearly due to humid air and low wind. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little evidence to support this theory. The study suggests that dawn singing may be more related to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about food sources. While the study doesn't definitively identify the reason for the dawn chorus, it rules out environmental factors as the primary cause.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactive in securing its rare earth supply chain, reducing its reliance on China from over 90% to below 60% after a 2010 export ban by Beijing. The country has invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, particularly Australia's Lynas, and is aiming to further decrease its dependence on Chinese imports to below 50% this year. This approach, including stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies, serves as a model for Western nations seeking to diversify their critical mineral sources.

          <p>European foreign ministers are meeting with Iran's top diplomat in Geneva to explore a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing military conflict between Iran and Israel. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy hopes to find a solution within the next two weeks, after meeting with U.S. officials in Washington. The talks are the first face-to-face meeting between Western and Iranian officials since the conflict began. Despite previous failures, Germany's foreign minister believes it's worth attempting to dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, with U.S. officials reportedly in agreement with the discussions.</p>

          <p>Harry Gilbertson, who stabbed 12-year-old Ava White to death in Liverpool in 2021, can now be publicly named as he turns 18. Gilbertson was convicted of Ava's murder at age 14 and sentenced to a minimum of 13 years, but reporting restrictions prevented his identification. Ava's mother, Leeann White, expressed her desire for the public to know his identity, believing Liverpool had the right to know. Ms. White has since established the Ava White Foundation to provide bleed control kits, which have saved at least six lives.</p>

          <p>As missile attacks persist in Israel, residents express concerns about the impact of the conflict with Iran on the war in Gaza and the fate of hostages. While many support the government's actions against Iran, some question the long-term consequences and the potential for further escalation. Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to strike Iran is seen by some as an effort to recover from the security failures of October 7, but critics accuse him of prolonging the war in Gaza for political gain. Despite widespread support for the strikes, a minority of Israelis favor diplomacy over military action.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, with sales volumes falling by 2.7%, the largest monthly decline since December 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed this decline to a "dismal" month for supermarkets, particularly in alcohol and tobacco sales, as consumers cut back on spending. Government borrowing also increased, reaching the second-highest level for May since 1993. While sales volumes were up over the three months leading to May, economists suggest that the initial economic growth is slowing, with inflation prompting consumers to reduce their spending.</p>
