          <p>A New York Times article explores why Finland has consistently ranked as the happiest country in the world, according to the World Happiness Report. The report relies on the Cantril Ladder question, which asks individuals to rate their life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10. The article delves into the challenges of measuring happiness and questions whether the Nordic countries' high rankings are due to contentment rather than constant delight. The author also highlights Finland's unique cultural elements, such as saunas and a strong sense of community.</p>
