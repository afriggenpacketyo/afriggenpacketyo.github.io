          <p>General Mills announced its commitment to remove artificial coloring from all of its products by the end of 2027, following a similar announcement by Kraft Heinz. The company stated that 85% of its retail products and nearly all of its school offerings are already made without certified colors. This decision aligns with the recent request from the FDA and HHS for the food industry to reduce the use of synthetic food dyes, although no outright ban has been implemented. General Mills, headquartered in Minnesota, aims to complete the removal of artificial dyes from cereals and school products by the summer of 2026, with the remaining lineup following by the end of 2027.</p>

          <p>Amazon's autonomous vehicle startup, Zoox, is increasing its robotaxi production at a new facility in Hayward, California, as it prepares for a commercial launch in Las Vegas later this year. The facility currently produces one robotaxi per day, with plans to accelerate production to assemble 10,000 robotaxis annually, roughly three per hour. Zoox, acquired by Amazon in 2020, aims to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S. and already has a few dozen robotaxis undergoing testing on public roads in Foster City, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. The company anticipates operating between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small- to medium-sized cities.</p>

          <p>The Twin Cities home of the late Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, who were fatally shot, was reportedly broken into. Police discovered that the plywood covering a rear window had been pried off, and the window was broken to gain entry. Although crime scene investigators searched the home again and family members stated they don't believe anything was missing, the incident occurred after the home had been boarded up and items of value removed. Authorities are still searching for the suspect in the break-in, while the man accused of killing the Hortmans is in custody facing murder charges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, with a conservative majority, upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, voting 6-3 in favor of the ban. The ruling prohibits hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and gender transition surgery for patients under 18, determining that the ban does not violate the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. This decision is a setback for transgender rights, an issue at the heart of ongoing culture debates in American political life. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, stating that the court abandoned transgender children and their families to political whims, and an attorney for the ACLU said the Tennessee law has taken away the only treatment that relieved years of suffering for those concerned.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, mandates full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance for stablecoin issuers. The legislation grants significant authority to the Treasury Secretary, and it drew criticism from some senators who accused Republicans of enabling Trump's crypto corruption. The GENIUS Act now moves to the House, where it will need to be reconciled with their version of a stablecoin bill; the Senate version centralizes oversight with Treasury, while the House splits authority between the Federal Reserve and other entities (not investment advice).</p>

The lawsuit claims Perry used his influence to prevent Dixon from speaking out until now, seeking at least $260 million in damages. According to the lawsuit, Perry sent unwanted sexual text messages to Dixon and offered him an increasingly prominent role on the show as his sexual advances became more aggressive.

          <p>The Social Security retirement trust fund may be depleted by 2033, according to the Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report, unchanged from last year's projections. The combined trust funds will have enough revenue to pay scheduled benefits and administrative costs until 2034, one year earlier than projected last year. Approximately 70 million people will receive Social Security benefits this year, while 185 million individuals work and contribute to the program through payroll taxes.

Trump claimed that Iran had reached out to the U.S. and offered to send a delegation to the White House for talks, but the Iranian mission to the United Nations quickly denied this.

The White House stated that Trump will sign an executive order granting the company a 90-day extension to work on closing a deal. This marks Trump's third such delay since taking office, following a bipartisan law passed by Congress last year. Some legal experts argue that these extensions run afoul of the law banning TikTok, which allows for a single 90-day extension only if certain conditions are met.</p>

          <p>Caroline Fraser's book, *Murderland*, explores the potential connection between industrial pollution and the rise of serial killers in the Pacific Northwest during the 1970s and '80s. Fraser argues that the presence of toxic vapors, including lead and arsenic, released by industrial smelters may have contributed to the rise of serial killing. Data supports the relationship between elevated lead presence and increased crime rates, with studies showing that lead exposure can amplify aggressive and impulsive behaviors. However, the focus on figures like Ted Bundy can overshadow the broader environmental thesis and the victims of these crimes.</p>

An Iranian official warned that any U.S. intervention in the conflict with Israel would risk "all-out war," as the exchange of fire with warplanes and ballistic missiles continues. The steady exchange of fire has resulted in an escalating cost in human lives, and has sparked an exodus from Iran's capital Tehran.</p>

          <p>Following the shooting deaths of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses, state lawmakers are confronting their own vulnerability and considering personal safety more urgently. With limited budgets for personal security, state and local politicians are grappling with the reality of being potential targets. Some officials are responding by increasing security measures, while others are investing in personal security systems. The rise in political violence raises concerns about deterring people from entering politics, prompting organizations to offer safety training and resources to candidates.</p>

Experts suggest Congress could address the shortfall by raising taxes, cutting benefits, or a combination of both.

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected a challenge brought by Texas to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store nuclear waste at a facility in the state. The court reversed a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that allowed the case to move forward.

The court did not address whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to license private companies to store nuclear waste offsite (not investment advice).</p>
