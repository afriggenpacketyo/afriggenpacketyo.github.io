            <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller believes that President Donald Trump's tariffs will have a "transitory" effect on inflation, comparing his view to a football play. Waller outlined two scenarios: larger, longer-lasting tariffs leading to a 4%-5% inflation spike that eventually subsides, and smaller tariffs causing a 3% inflation increase that also falls off. In both scenarios, he anticipates the Fed will cut interest rates, with the timing depending on the severity of the tariffs. Waller's comments reflect the ongoing debate about the potential economic consequences of tariffs. Optimism score: 50</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is accused of defying a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from a prison in El Salvador, while pretending to comply. Despite acknowledging the erroneous deportation, the administration, along with El Salvador's President Bukele, is shifting responsibility. Critics argue that the administration's actions demonstrate contempt for the Supreme Court and the rule of law, raising concerns about the potential for abuse of power.

These securities allow investors to make quick profits or hedge against market moves, but large volumes can amplify price swings.
