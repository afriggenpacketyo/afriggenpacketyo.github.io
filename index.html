          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire to de-escalate rising tensions following an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to statements from both nations' officials. President Trump initially announced the ceasefire on Truth Social, later confirmed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who stated that the U.S. Vice President and himself conversed with Indian and Pakistani officials to broker the agreement. While Pakistani leaders thanked Trump for his proactive role, Indian officials stated the deal was worked out directly between the two countries. Despite the ceasefire agreement, explosions were reported in Indian-controlled Kashmir, raising concerns about its durability.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and its allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, are prepared for a full unconditional ceasefire with Russia for at least 30 days, starting on Monday, according to the Ukrainian foreign minister. The European Union supports the proposal, emphasizing that it must be implemented without preconditions to pave the way for meaningful peace negotiations. These nations, with U.S. backing, are demanding that Russia's Vladimir Putin accept the ceasefire, or they will collectively increase sanctions on Moscow and bolster military support to Ukraine.

          <p>Climate change is significantly altering bird migration patterns, impacting their ability to feed, rest, and reproduce successfully. Migratory birds, crucial for maintaining ecosystem health through pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control, are facing challenges due to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and changes in food availability. Warmer temperatures are causing some birds to shorten their routes or abandon traditional habitats, leading to conflicts with resident animals. Conservation efforts, including expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments, are essential to minimize risks for migrating birds and preserve their vital role in the food chain.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, who began preparing the victim's taxes in 2013, gained her trust and offered fraudulent investment opportunities promising high returns with no risk. The scheme, which ran from 2013 to 2019, involved Cohen-Roth using new investors' money to pay off earlier ones and fund her lavish lifestyle. The Ponzi scheme unraveled in 2020 when the victim requested her money back, leaving her financially destitute.</p>

          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, on Saturday morning, shaking residents in Tennessee, Georgia, and western North Carolina. The earthquake, which originated about 30 miles southwest of Knoxville, prompted reports of shaking from as far away as Nashville and Charlotte, N.C. While there were a few instances of light damage reported near the epicenter, the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone is known for minor earthquakes, with the last strong tremor occurring in 2018.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has modified its policy on benefit overpayments, now withholding up to 50% of monthly Title II benefits instead of the previously announced 100%. This change follows backlash against the initial plan, which critics deemed draconian and financially devastating for retirees and beneficiaries relying on these funds for essential expenses. While the reduced rate is seen as progress, experts caution that losing half of one's income can still lead to financial distress and homelessness. Overpayments occur due to various reasons, including agency errors or delays in processing information, and beneficiaries must take action to request a waiver or lower repayment rate to avoid automatic withholding.</p>

          <p>With Bitcoin surpassing $100,000, financial planning expert Ric Edelman discusses the implications of the new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hitting the market. He believes that the rollout gives investors more access to upside. He finds buffer ETFs and yield ETFs particularly exciting. Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, emphasizes that crypto should be viewed as a long-term investment for portfolio diversification. However, he cautions against leverage and inverse bitcoin ETFs, warning that not all crypto ETFs are appropriate for retail investors.</p>

The Motown legend, 85, was touring to support a new album when he was sued and accused of sexually assaulting four women. His lawyer said the accusations were “false” and “vile.” He proceeded with the concert just days after four women who worked as housekeepers for Mr. Robinson claimed in a lawsuit that he had repeatedly sexually abused them for years at his homes in California and Nevada.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered military leaders and commanders to review and remove books related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and "gender ideology" from their libraries. The memo, sent to leaders, instructs them to "promptly identify" materials that promote "divisive concepts and gender ideology" deemed incompatible with the department's mission, with a deadline of May 21 for removal. This follows a similar order given to military academies, including the U.S. Naval Academy, which removed nearly 400 books. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has vowed to purge DEI from the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>As negotiations intensify for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, key issues are emerging, with Republican lawmakers aiming to pass the package without Democratic support through a process known as "reconciliation." The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill, but the final version could undergo significant changes. Experts highlight the challenges of fitting the proposals within a limited budget framework, given competing priorities and concerns for fiscal responsibility among some lawmakers. The narrow Republican majority in the House adds complexity to the process, as a handful of votes could potentially block the bill.</p>

The proposals, outlined in a 69-page White Paper titled "Restoring Control Over the Immigration System," include time-limited work visas for jobs not requiring graduate-level skills and stricter English language requirements for overseas workers. Companies failing to demonstrate efforts to recruit UK-based staff may face restrictions on sponsoring foreign workers. The plans emphasize linking the immigration system to the labor market, aiming to prioritize British workers and reduce reliance on overseas labor.</p>
