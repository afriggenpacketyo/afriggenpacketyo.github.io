            <p>Japan's export growth in March was a modest 3.9%, missing expectations due to the impact of tariffs, particularly from the U.S. While exports to the Middle East saw the largest increase, those to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, only rose slightly. The data comes as Japan engages in trade negotiations with the U.S., with President Trump indicating "big progress" in talks covering tariffs, military support costs, and trade fairness. Japan's trade deficit narrowed, but remained wider than anticipated, highlighting ongoing economic challenges amid global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state will sue the Trump administration over its authority to impose sweeping tariffs, arguing that such actions require Congressional approval. The lawsuit will challenge the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, or a 10% tariff on all imports. Newsom stated that California, with the largest economy among the states, stands to lose the most from the inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage caused by the tariffs. This marks the 14th lawsuit filed by California against the Trump administration in less than 14 weeks.</p>

            <p>The UK government is expanding a scheme to support GPs in providing care and advice to patients, aiming to prevent them from joining long NHS hospital waiting lists. Backed by £80m of funding, the initiative aims to help two million people receive faster and more convenient care in their local community by the end of 2025/26. The scheme, called 'Advice and Guidance', links GPs with hospital specialists before patients are referred onto waiting lists, enabling tests and treatments to be offered in the most convenient place. The expansion is part of the government's plan to cut long NHS waiting lists and create extra appointments for patients.</p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying an order to return migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison. Boasberg said the government "deliberately flouted" his orders, warning that he could recommend criminal charges and appoint a private attorney if the DOJ refuses to prosecute. The case stems from the deportation of alleged gang members to El Salvador, where they are being held in a maximum-security prison, despite a court order to return them to the U.S.</p>

            <p>China is encouraging domestic consumption, particularly among retirees, to offset the economic impact of U.S. tariffs. The "silver train" initiative provides older travelers with opportunities to visit remote parts of the country and boost local economies. These special trains offer comfortable travel, medical support, and access to regions that need financial assistance. The initiative aims to turn an economic problem into an economic solution by encouraging retirees to spend their savings on travel and local goods.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that one in 31 children, or over 3%, have been identified with autism, prompting discussions about the causes and implications of the rising rate. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited the figures as evidence of a growing "epidemic" of autism, a claim criticized by experts. Experts suggest the rise is due to improved screening and broader diagnostic criteria, while Kennedy insists on an "environmental toxin" as the cause. The report also notes higher autism prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children, potentially due to disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning.</p>

Some comedians argue that exaggeration is necessary for comedy, while others believe that sensitivity and reading the room are crucial to avoid causing offense.</p>

China has delayed approvals for production facilities in Brazil and Mexico, cautioning about trade and investment risks. This intervention reflects Beijing's desire for a more strategic approach to global expansion, favoring countries with more favorable geopolitical relations with China. The latest tariff war was unlikely to discourage their global expansion, Beijing wants carmakers to adopt a more cautious approach and be selective in choosing their destinations, analysts said.
