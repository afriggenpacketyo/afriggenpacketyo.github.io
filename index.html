          <p>French soldiers have boarded the Benin-flagged oil tanker Boracay, suspected of being part of Russia's "shadow fleet" used to circumvent sanctions over the war in Ukraine. The vessel, which left Russia last month, was anchored off western France following drone disruptions in Denmark. President Macron cited "serious offenses" by the crew, though Russia denies knowledge of the ship. Prosecutors are investigating the refusal to stop and failure to justify the ship's flag, as EU leaders push for stronger defense against Russian incursions.</p>

          <p>Major automakers like GM, Ford, and Hyundai reported robust third-quarter U.S. auto sales, with overall increases of around 8% year-over-year, largely propelled by record electric vehicle (EV) sales. Consumers accelerated EV purchases to take advantage of expiring $7,500 federal incentives, leading to EV sales more than doubling for GM and increasing 30% for Ford. Industry experts predict a temporary dip in EV sales post-incentive, but automakers are already adjusting pricing and financing to maintain momentum in the evolving market.

          <p>A 20-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump seeks to conclude the nearly two-year war in the Gaza Strip and facilitate the return of 46 hostages held by Hamas. The initiative, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly accepted, aims to disarm Hamas and rebuild Gaza under a Palestinian governing body with international oversight. While the plan offers a potential pathway to peace, its implementation could also threaten Netanyahu's political standing. Hamas's agreement is still pending for the plan to move forward.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, stock markets closed at record highs, indicating investors are largely unfazed. Historical data suggests that shutdowns typically have a modest, temporary impact on financial markets and the broader economy, with economic activity often recovering quickly afterward. The S&P 500 has, on average, gained 0.3% during past shutdowns and 13% in the subsequent 12 months. However, concerns remain that a prolonged shutdown could increase market uncertainty and halt the release of critical economic data, making it harder for investors to assess the economic landscape.

In response to the announcement, Sanders silently moved his mouth during a media availability, leading to an abrupt end to interviews.

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $20 billion loan to Argentina to stabilize its currency and support President Javier Milei's free-market reforms. This controversial bailout, despite contradicting "America First" rhetoric, aims to prevent Milei's economic agenda from failing, which could discredit market-oriented policies across Latin America. Milei has significantly reduced inflation and revived the housing market, but his managed peso devaluation created a currency crisis. The loan, from an existing Federal Reserve credit line, is contingent on Argentina eliminating capital controls and the U.S. dropping export tax demands. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights the roles of Black and Afro-descendant women in preserving these sung dances and features San Jacinto as an epicenter for gaita music.

Experts warn that while the government touts savings, these cancellations destabilize the commercial lending market, as property loans are often packaged into investment securities.

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, federal student loan payments are still required, as the Department of Education's contingency plan ensures essential functions continue. While 87% of the department's staff are furloughed, loan servicers, which handle payments and account issues, remain operational. New grantmaking and civil rights investigations are paused, but FAFSA processing and aid disbursements are expected to proceed. Borrowers needing assistance should contact their loan servicers or school financial aid offices, as direct Department of Education customer service may be limited. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A YouTuber purchased two refurbished iPhone 14 Pros from Temu, a Chinese e-commerce platform, to assess their quality.

However, he noted third-party chargers and outdated operating systems, easily fixable with updates. Despite the positive product quality from his specific seller, the YouTuber cautioned against buying phones from Temu due to high pricing compared to the used market and the prevalence of fake iPhone listings on the platform, highlighting the inherent risks.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts a "stagflation-lite" scenario for the U.S. economy, characterized by modestly elevated inflation and unemployment, driven by Trump administration tariffs and interest rate cuts. The report warns that increased presidential control over the Federal Reserve could escalate this to "full-blown stagflation." It forecasts a slowing GDP growth and a peak unemployment rate of 4.6% early next year, exacerbated by a tightening labor supply and restrictive immigration policies. While AI investments offer some economic prop, consumer spending is expected to weaken post-EV tax credit expiration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin have suspended abortion services, grappling with a new federal law that blocks Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers receiving over $800,000 from the program. This provision, narrowly tailored to target Planned Parenthood, forces affiliates to choose between abortion provision and other essential health services like cancer screenings and contraception. While two independent providers remain, the measure threatens the closure of up to 200 clinics nationwide, predominantly in medically underserved areas. Some states are allocating funds to cover shortfalls, but the long-term sustainability for many clinics is uncertain.</p>
