          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to maintain U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 federal actions, such as expediting the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, and updating the nation's power grid to meet AI's energy demands. It also aims to create rules for government contractors to eliminate perceived ideological bias in chatbots and will establish a program to export AI packages to U.S. allies. Officials stated the goal is for the United States to win the global AI race, particularly against competitors like China.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has been sentenced to four consecutive life sentences for the murders of four University of Idaho students, with an additional 10 years for burglary. During the sentencing, the judge called Kohberger a "coward" and acknowledged that the motive for the "unfathomable and senseless act of evil" may never be known. Prosecutors stated they did not believe Kohberger would be truthful even if compelled to speak, and thus did not make it a condition of his plea deal. The White House press secretary expressed condolences to the families, reiterating the nation's grief over the horrific crime.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury materials related to the 2005 and 2007 investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Robin Rosenberg stated that her decision was bound by precedent from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which strictly limits the unsealing of such records. This ruling does not affect separate requests in New York, which operates under a different circuit court precedent that might allow for disclosure. The Justice Department had argued for the release based on strong public interest, especially since Epstein's death in 2019.</p>

          <p>The first day of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford was tightly contested, ending with India at 264-4. A key moment occurred when Indian batsman Rishabh Pant retired hurt with a foot injury after scoring 37, disrupting a crucial partnership. Earlier, Sai Sudharsan scored a resilient 61, while England captain Ben Stokes made vital breakthroughs by taking two important wickets. The day was characterized by disciplined bowling from England and determined batting from India, leaving the match finely poised ahead of the second day's play.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing significant domestic and international criticism after signing legislation that restricts the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The new law places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAP) under the control of the Prosecutor General's Office. This move sparked the largest anti-government protests in Ukraine since the war began, with critics and EU officials expressing concern that it undermines reforms crucial for Ukraine's EU membership bid. In response, Zelenskyy has pledged to submit a new bill to address these concerns.</p>

          <p>Researchers at UC Berkeley have developed a groundbreaking at-home medical test that uses the "coffee ring effect" to detect diseases like COVID-19, sepsis, and prostate cancer. The phenomenon, where particles in an evaporating liquid gather at the edge, is used to concentrate disease markers from a sample onto a special membrane. This makes them easier to identify, resulting in a test that is reportedly up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests and can deliver results in about twelve minutes. This innovation could revolutionize personal health monitoring by making highly accurate diagnostic screening accessible for home use.</p>

This decision comes in response to court injunctions that have halted other income-driven repayment plans, such as the SAVE plan. Because forgiveness calculations for IBR were linked to rules from the now-blocked plans, the department must recalculate payment counts before resuming discharges. While the pause creates uncertainty for millions of borrowers, the department has assured that legally mandated IBR discharges will resume once the correct counts are established, and any overpayments will be refunded.</p>

Torres, who grew up in public housing, emphasized the need for a practical governing agenda focused on issues like the affordability crisis, rather than just sloganeering.

With average interest rates on home equity loans around 8.4%, compared to over 12.6% for personal loans, the potential savings are substantial. A comparison shows that over a 15-year term, a borrower could save approximately $265 per month, totaling nearly $48,000 in interest over the life of the loan. The fixed rates on home equity loans also provide stability against future rate hikes, making them an attractive financing tool in the current economic climate.</p>

          <h2>Republicans Push for Mid-Decade Redistricting, Forcing a Political Battle with Democrats</h2>

          <p>A new political conflict is brewing as Republicans in states like Texas, Ohio, and Missouri consider redrawing congressional maps mid-decade to secure an advantage in the 2026 midterm elections. This unusual move, encouraged by President Trump, aims to create more GOP-friendly districts and is forcing Democrats to contemplate retaliatory measures in states they control. However, Democrats face significant hurdles, including independent redistricting commissions and state laws in places like California and New York that were established to prevent such political gerrymandering. This sets the stage for a contentious fight over electoral norms and the composition of Congress.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has determined that the Trump administration violated federal law by illegally withholding funds appropriated by Congress for the Head Start program. According to the GAO report, the Department of Health and Human Services significantly reduced the disbursement rate for the early childhood development program between January and April 2025. The GAO, an independent congressional watchdog, stated that this action violated the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which prevents the executive branch from unilaterally withholding funds. The health department, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., reportedly did not provide requested information for the investigation.</p>

          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its gaming division. Revenue from Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming, driven by popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, grew by 16% year over year. This success helped to offset a 16% decline in the company's traditional consumer products segment, which has been negatively impacted by tariffs and retailer order timing. Despite a significant net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment, the company raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its gaming-centric strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences. This potential policy change follows the introduction of a bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene aimed at the same goal. Under current law, profits from home sales are taxed once they exceed $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for joint filers, a threshold that an increasing number of homeowners are surpassing, particularly in high-value markets. Proponents argue the move would unlock equity and help the housing market, though experts note it could be a costly proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, the festival is also presenting a critically acclaimed revival of George Enescu’s rarely performed 20th-century masterpiece, “Oedipe,” inside its main theater.

          <p>The United States and the European Union are reportedly close to finalizing a trade agreement that would impose a 15% tariff on most goods imported from the bloc. This rate would mirror a similar deal recently struck between the U.S. and Japan, though it would be higher than the 10% baseline tariff agreed upon with the UK. While some products like aircraft and spirits may receive exemptions or further reductions, the deal would represent a significant increase over pre-Trump era duties for many sectors, including the German auto industry. The EU is simultaneously preparing nearly €100 billion in retaliatory tariffs should the deal not be finalized.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street expecting a second consecutive quarterly decline in revenue.

In response, Musk has shifted focus to future projects like the Optimus humanoid robot and a robotaxi service, which recently began limited testing in Austin. Investors will be watching for updates on these projects, as well as the company's automotive gross margins and strategy for navigating tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley, who was a vocal Republican critic of cutting Medicaid, ultimately voted in favor of President Trump's legislative package that included nearly $1 trillion in reductions to the program. Despite arguing that the cuts were "morally wrong," Hawley supported the bill, citing other benefits like tax cut extensions. Shortly after, he introduced new legislation to reverse some of the very cuts he had just helped enact, a move that has drawn mockery from Democrats and been characterized as a cynical political maneuver. This highlights the internal conflicts within the GOP as it navigates the political consequences of its policies.</p>

          <p>A massive and dangerous heat dome, a high-pressure system trapping hot air, is currently affecting over 160 million people across the United States. This weather phenomenon works by causing air to sink and compress, which heats it up, while also preventing cloud formation and thus allowing for more direct sun exposure. The system also pulls in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, leading to extremely high humidity that makes the heat feel even more intense and dangerous. Climate scientists note that climate change has made such prolonged and intense heat waves at least five times more likely.</p>
