          <p>The European Union is in a state of uncertainty after a deadline passed for reaching a trade agreement framework with the United States. While President Trump has suggested a deal could be imminent, the EU has yet to receive a formal letter outlining potential tariffs, leaving Brussels to prepare for all scenarios. U.S. officials have indicated that the EU has made significant offers to open its markets, but European leaders remain cautious, defending their interests while working in good faith. This situation creates economic ambiguity for one of the world's largest trading partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the United Kingdom, marked by royal pomp and pageantry, has been largely overshadowed by the looming threat of U.S. trade tariffs. While Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are set to discuss migration and defense, the unpredictable nature of President Trump's tariff regime is a primary concern for European economic stability. Hopes for a U.S.-EU trade deal are rising, but the terms remain unknown, creating a tense backdrop for the high-profile diplomatic engagement between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Fortunately, none of the rescued individuals sustained any visible injuries in the incident, marking a positive outcome to a dangerous situation.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has granted Royal Mail permission to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-saving measure. This reform to the Universal Service Obligation comes as the volume of sent letters continues to decline annually. While first-class mail will still be delivered six days a week, second-class items will be limited to every other weekday. The regulator also adjusted delivery targets, slightly lowering next-day requirements for first-class mail but introducing new goals to reduce long delays for all mail.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State John Kerry stated in a BBC interview that his fellow Democrats allowed the U.S.-Mexico border to be "under siege" during the Biden presidency. He remarked that the party had mishandled the immigration issue for years, which provided a political advantage to Republicans like Donald Trump. Kerry emphasized that protecting the border is a fundamental duty of any nation and wished President Biden had more forcefully communicated his commitment to enforcing the law. His comments highlight a significant internal debate within the Democratic Party over its immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, challenging the traditional dominance of the U.S. dollar. The argument is based on China's institutional credibility, low inflation, and large foreign reserves, which provide considerable advantages. The article suggests the yuan has already shown stability and resilience during recent global stress events, such as the war in Ukraine and shocks from U.S. tariffs. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate about the internationalization of China's currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a prime example of successful housing policy, with some calling it a "renters' utopia" due to its extensive social housing stock. This sector, comprising 43% of the city's housing units, serves not only low-income residents but also the middle class, keeping rent levels significantly below the private market. Originating in the 1920s, the system's stability and resistance to privatization offer valuable lessons for other cities grappling with housing crises. However, the article notes that challenges remain regarding the complexity and accessibility of the allocation system for newcomers.</p>

In tests, the cyborg bees obeyed commands to turn, advance, and retreat with 90% accuracy. This technological breakthrough opens new possibilities for controlling insects for various applications, representing a significant advance in micro-robotics and bio-interfacing.</p>

The justification cites copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military equipment, and other essential technologies. This move aligns copper with recent tariff hikes on steel and aluminum, as the administration aims to bolster domestic production. However, experts warn that the U.S. currently lacks the capacity to offset its reliance on imports, which could lead to shortages and price increases for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is implementing new measures to combat persistent youth unemployment by offering a one-off subsidy to companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. Employers who sign formal contracts and make social insurance contributions can receive up to 1,500 yuan per new hire. This policy is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market and support household incomes amid sluggish economic growth and intense domestic competition. The initiative will be funded through the country's unemployment insurance reserves and will last until the end of the year.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens about a rising number of kidnappings targeting them, particularly in Gauteng and the Eastern Cape provinces. Analysts suggest Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they operate with large sums of cash outside the formal banking system. The embassy urged Chinese nationals, especially women, to avoid going out alone and to take extra precautions. This warning follows several recent incidents, including a fatal home invasion, that have threatened the safety of the Chinese community.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a federal lawsuit against California, alleging that the state's animal welfare regulations for egg-laying hens are causing higher egg prices across the country. The suit claims that California's rules, which mandate more space for chickens, constitute "unnecessary red tape" and unlawfully regulate farms in other states. This legal action is part of President Trump's repeated vows to lower egg prices, which have soared due to a major bird flu outbreak. The lawsuit names Governor Gavin Newsom and other state officials as defendants in the case.</p>
