            <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Mechanism for Breast Cancer Aggressiveness</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-15 00:00:12 EDT</div>

            <p>A Chinese research team has discovered that breast cancer cells utilize the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and proliferate, potentially leading to new precision therapies. The study, published in *Cancer Cell*, reveals the metabolic interplay between cancer cells and macrophages, a type of white blood cell. By understanding how arginine drives breast cancer progression, scientists may be able to develop treatments that starve tumors of this essential building block for protein. This breakthrough could significantly impact the treatment of the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women, offering a novel approach to combating its aggressiveness.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing approximately $2.3 billion in federal funds to Harvard University following the university's refusal to comply with demands to crack down on antisemitism and dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, argues that the demands represent undue governmental regulation of academic freedom. The administration insists that federal investment comes with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws. The move has sparked protests and a lawsuit from the American Association of University Professors, challenging the legality of the funding cuts and defending academic freedom.</p>

            <p>South Korea has announced a 33 trillion won ($23.25 billion) support package for its semiconductor industry amid growing uncertainty over potential U.S. tariffs. The announcement comes after President Trump indicated he would soon announce tariff rates on imported semiconductors. The funding will subsidize the construction of underground power transmission lines, increase funding for infrastructure in advanced industrial complexes, and offer low-interest loans to semiconductor companies. South Korea is home to major chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, making semiconductors a key export for the country.</p>

The administration claims Abrego Garcia is a gang member, pointing to a 2019 statement by a U.S. immigration judge. Joseph Mazzara, acting General Counsel at the Department of Homeland Security, stated DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a landmark antitrust trial, defending his company against allegations of operating a social media monopoly. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges that Meta unfairly dominated the market through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and is seeking to break up the company by forcing a spinoff. Zuckerberg argued that there's plenty of competition in social media, including from apps such as TikTok, X, and YouTube. The trial is expected to last for two months, with the FTC arguing that Meta overpaid for the acquisitions to neutralize competition.</p>

Cost was cited as the primary reason for not reshoring, followed by the challenge of finding skilled labor. The survey also found that a majority of respondents feel the Trump administration is bullying corporate America. (not investment advice)</p>
