          <p>Heavy monsoon rains have caused devastating flash floods and landslides in northwest Pakistan, leading to the deaths of over 220 people in a 48-hour period. Since late June, the national death toll from rain-related incidents has surpassed 540, with entire villages being swept away by floodwaters carrying massive boulders. Rescue operations are ongoing as first responders search for survivors amidst the widespread destruction, while survivors recount harrowing experiences of the ground shaking from the force of the water. The event highlights the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in the region, which experts attribute to climate change.</p>

          <p>The recent meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is being analyzed for its potential impact on international relations, particularly concerning China. While the summit concluded without a concrete ceasefire agreement for Ukraine, observers noted it as a symbolic victory for Moscow, signaling a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. The discussions, which reportedly did not include European or Ukrainian representatives, have created uncertainty about U.S. commitments and territorial concessions. This shift in U.S.-Russia dynamics could present a complex geopolitical dilemma for China as it navigates its own relationships with both global powers.</p>

          <p>A family-owned jewelry store in West Seattle was robbed of more than $2 million in merchandise in a brazen daylight heist that lasted only 90 seconds. Four masked suspects used hammers to smash through the front door and display cases, making off with high-value items including Rolex watches and an emerald necklace. The thieves were armed with a Taser and bear spray, which they used to threaten employees, though no physical injuries were reported. The Seattle Police Department is currently investigating the incident and searching for the suspects who fled in a getaway car.</p>

          <p>School districts across Florida are preemptively removing hundreds of book titles from libraries and classrooms in response to mounting pressure from the state's board of education. This new wave of censorship follows a warning to one district that it could face legal action for not removing books deemed inappropriate, leading to a chilling effect in neighboring counties. Critics, including PEN America, describe the movement as a "state-driven censorship" campaign targeting books by LGBTQ+ authors and authors of color, or those discussing race and sexuality. The actions have sparked frustration among some parents who feel their rights are being overridden by politically motivated special interest groups.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is providing crucial support to foster youth transitioning to college by supplying them with essential dorm room items. Many students from the foster system arrive on campus with minimal belongings, often unaware of the basic necessities required for dorm life, such as bedding, lamps, or even cleaning supplies. The initiative, which began after a program manager learned of a student arriving at UC Berkeley with only a trash bag of possessions, aims to level the playing field. By providing these items, the program helps alleviate financial burdens and reduces feelings of otherness, allowing students to focus on their education.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all of its operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with its 10,000 flight attendants, who initiated a strike early Saturday. The labor dispute, centered on issues of pay and unpaid work, has escalated, leaving thousands of travelers stranded globally during the peak summer season. The Canadian Union of Public Employees rejected the airline's proposal for government-directed arbitration, which would have prevented a strike. The shutdown is expected to affect approximately 130,000 passengers daily, with the airline warning that fully restarting operations could take up to a week once a deal is reached.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals a significant decline in young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional life milestones compared to previous generations. These milestones include moving out of their parents' home, securing a job, getting married, and having children. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, such as rising living costs and job instability, as well as changing societal attitudes toward family formation. In 1975, nearly half of young adults had met all four milestones, a figure that has dropped to less than a quarter today, indicating a redefinition of adulthood for contemporary cohorts.</p>

This shift reflects Samsung's strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points, from budget-friendly models to high-end foldables like the Z Fold 7.

She recommends three key steps: using a visual aid to understand that struggle is part of the learning process, engaging in positive and supportive self-talk to reframe difficult moments, and undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone. By practicing these techniques, individuals can learn to tolerate discomfort more effectively, which builds resilience and confidence over time, making it easier to tackle larger challenges.</p>

Critics argue this is a partisan power grab designed to dilute the influence of Democratic and Black voters, violating the spirit of Florida's Fair Districts amendments.

          <p>Former police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, are criticizing President Trump's recent decision to deploy the National Guard to address crime in Washington D.C. They highlight the irony of Trump's swift action now, contrasting it with his hours-long delay in deploying the Guard during the violent insurrection by his supporters. Officers like Aquilino Gonell and Harry Dunn expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of using troops for local law enforcement and voiced concerns that the move is a step toward a more authoritarian police state. They argue the deployment is a political maneuver rather than a genuine effort to enhance public safety.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Party Relies on Older, Established Candidates for Key 2026 Senate Races</h2>

          <p>In crucial 2026 Senate races, the Democratic Party is turning to well-known, older candidates like former Senator Sherrod Brown (72) in Ohio and former Governor Roy Cooper (68) in North Carolina. This strategy prioritizes electability and name recognition over calls from within the party to elevate a new generation of leaders. While some activists view this as a "damning indictment" of the party's failure to build a strong bench of younger talent, strategists argue that these proven winners offer the best chance to compete in challenging red-leaning states. The approach highlights a central tension for Democrats between immediate electoral needs and long-term generational change.</p>

          <p>With the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing approaching, atomic bomb survivors, known as "hibakusha," are intensifying their calls for the abolition of nuclear weapons amid a growing arms race in East Asia. Toshiyuki Mimaki, vice-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization Nihon Hidankyo, continues to share his experiences with younger generations to convey the horrors of nuclear war. However, their efforts face a challenging geopolitical climate, as nuclear-armed nations expand their arsenals and U.S. allies like Japan rely on the American "nuclear umbrella" for security, creating a difficult paradox for the anti-nuclear movement.</p>

          <p>The personal data of up to 3,700 Afghans who were relocated to the United Kingdom has been potentially compromised in a new data breach involving a Ministry of Defence sub-contractor. The breach occurred at Inflite The Jet Centre, a ground-handling service at London Stansted airport, and may have exposed names, passport details, and resettlement policy information. This incident follows a separate, major data breach in 2022 that affected nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to flee the Taliban. The government has stated there is no evidence the data has been released publicly or posed a threat to individuals' safety.</p>

These services, which allow shoppers to split purchases into smaller, interest-free payments, are heavily promoted by fashion and lifestyle brands to increase sales conversions. However, missed payments can lead to significant late fees and damage to credit scores. The article suggests that this trend normalizes debt for everyday purchases and is fueled by influencer culture and social media pressures, leading many to spend beyond their means.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without any clear agreements on a ceasefire or the political future of Ukraine. While Trump described the meeting as "extremely productive," he offered few details, and foreign policy experts suggest the primary beneficiary was Putin, who gained diplomatic legitimacy without making tangible concessions. Immediately after, Trump briefed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is now scheduled to visit the White House. The inconclusive nature of the talks leaves the path to peace uncertain, with observers questioning how much of Russia's narrative Trump may have absorbed.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing a major offensive challenge following third baseman Max Muncy's placement on the injured list with a strained oblique muscle. Muncy's absence creates a void in the lineup, removing a key left-handed power hitter who consistently gets on base and performs well against both right- and left-handed pitching. During a previous 25-game stretch without Muncy this season, the Dodgers' run production ranked last in the majors. With the team tied for first place in the NL West, other players, particularly right-handed batters like Teoscar Hernández, will need to step up to compensate for the loss.</p>

          <p>An American archaeology student from Florida discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first excavation in the United Kingdom. Yara Souza, a student at Newcastle University, found the decorative artifact just 90 minutes into a dig in Northumberland, near the route of a major Roman road. The object is believed to have been high-status, used only by elites for religious or ceremonial purposes, and may have been deliberately buried alongside a similar piece found in the same area in 2021. The exciting find provides new insight into the lives of high-status individuals in early medieval England.</p>

The company, Fold, is working to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant upgrade that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike high-value targets far behind enemy lines. While longer cables present technical challenges, such as added weight and potential snags, the ability to conduct unjammable precision strikes is a critical advantage.
