            <p>Westchester County Police responded to a call about a llama on the loose, only to discover it was an alpaca that had escaped from a trailer near Hotel MTK. Officers Mirko and Rodriguez successfully rounded up the alpaca near a Land Rover dealership, humorously suggesting it was looking for an upgrade. The alpaca was then safely returned to its owner, leading police to speculate it had escaped from a child's birthday party. Alpacas are herd animals from the Andes Mountains, commonly found in petting zoos and at children’s parties.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned nations against accommodating the U.S. in trade discussions concerning President Trump's tariffs, asserting that appeasement will not foster peace or respect. This statement follows reports that the U.S. intends to leverage tariff negotiations to pressure countries into imposing trade barriers against China. A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson emphasized that all parties should uphold fairness, international trade regulations, and the multilateral trading system. Japan and South Korea have initiated trade talks with the U.S., while India faces a significant tariff rate if it cannot reach a trade agreement.</p>

            <p>Paul Taylor argues that the challenges posed by Donald Trump's policies present a unique opportunity for European leaders to strengthen integration and assert global leadership. He suggests completing the capital markets and banking union, striking trade deals with reliable partners, developing common defense capabilities, and providing greater military assistance to Ukraine. Taylor believes Europe can expand partnerships with middle- and low-income countries and attract talent fleeing Trump's policies, ultimately turning a potential disaster into a chance for Europe to thrive.</p>

            <p>Prison officers in the UK are requesting electric stun guns to protect themselves in high-security prisons, following an attack on officers by Hashem Abedi, one of the Manchester Arena bombers. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) is advocating for the tactical use of tasers by specially trained staff. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has announced a full, independent review of the incident. The POA will also renew calls for all staff to have stab vests and for American "Supermax"-style rules for dangerous inmates.</p>

            <p>Alessandro Paredes, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant, spoke out from a detention center in Texas after his deportation was temporarily blocked by a Supreme Court order. He claimed he and others were forced to sign a paper stating they are part of a gang. Stephen Miller, Trump's homeland security adviser, responded by posting Paredes' name and photo on X, alleging he is a confirmed TdA member facing criminal charges. Paredes' mom denies the allegations and wishes for her son to be sent back to Venezuela, not El Salvador.</p>

            <p>China has warned it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests, amid escalating trade tensions. This warning comes as the U.S. administration reportedly plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure partners to limit dealings with China. China's Ministry of Commerce stated that it will firmly oppose any deals made at China's expense and will take reciprocal countermeasures. The ministry also cautioned about the risk to all countries if international trade returns to the "law of the jungle."</p>

Venezuela’s leader has described the deportation of the mostly Venezuelan migrants as a “kidnapping,” and denied they are criminals while backing calls for their return.</p>

            <p>The second season of HBO's "The Last of Us" delves into the themes of fractured bonds and cyclical violence, departing from the first season's focus on building relationships in impossible circumstances. The article critiques the show's unrelenting cheerlessness and its shift towards undiluted pain, particularly in the extended sequence depicting Joel's death. While subsequent episodes include glimmers of ingenuity, the show's limited imagination and focus on characters' anguish result in a more circular and suffocating narrative. The review suggests that the show has become blinded by misery, making it a punishing watch.</p>

The jet, meant for Xiamen Airlines, landed back in Seattle after refuelling stops in Guam and Hawaii. Trump has raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, while China imposed a 125% tariff on US goods. The tariffs could cripple a Chinese airline taking delivery of a Boeing jet, as a new 737 MAX has a market value of around $55m.</p>

A Tokyo-based marriage agency has facilitated over 300 such unions in the past decade. These marriages, often involving individuals with differing sexual orientations, offer companionship and societal acceptance without romantic or sexual expectations. Despite diverse values spreading, the lack of same-sex marriage recognition in Japan contributes to the appeal of friendship marriages.</p>

The author suggests that China is digging in for a long fight and focusing on resolving its own economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market. By fostering inner balance and core strength, China can overcome its larger opponent. The US goal is not merely trade rebalancing but the systematic strangling of China’s economic rise.</p>

Experts are concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those missing out. The rollout of the "free hours" scheme, aimed at transforming the childcare system, has not been the panacea many had hoped.
