          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to advocate for a reconsideration of higher import duties imposed by the U.S. Akazawa emphasized the need for a win-win deal during the discussions in Washington, D.C., and is preparing for further talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Japan is seeking either the elimination or a reduction of the tariffs, which include a baseline duty of 10 percent and an additional 14 percent country-specific tariff. These tariffs, implemented under President Trump's reciprocal tariff regime, also include a 25 percent tariff on automobiles and other sectors affecting national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A security guard was shot and wounded during a struggle in the emergency room of Evanston Hospital, near Chicago. The incident began when the C.A.R.E. team approached a man experiencing a mental health crisis near a Taco Bell, and he was taken to the hospital for evaluation. While in the ER, the man became agitated, leading to a struggle with hospital security where a weapon was involved and shots were fired, injuring one security officer. The man was taken into custody, and a handgun was recovered at the scene, while the emergency room was placed on lockdown to ensure safety.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a ban that would have prohibited Harvard University from admitting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, cited the "immediate and irreparable injury" that Harvard would face if the ban were to take effect. Harvard filed a lawsuit accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at stifling free speech, arguing the ban was retaliation for the university exercising its First Amendment rights. Trump has claimed the ban is necessary due to national security concerns and allegations of antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk has fractured, culminating in public criticisms exchanged on social media. Musk, who once supported Trump's reelection campaign and led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has recently criticized Trump's legislative agenda. This timeline traces their interactions from Musk's initial disapproval of Trump in 2016, through periods of collaboration and support, to the current dispute over government spending and policy. The feud involves accusations of ingratitude, threats to cancel government contracts, and even allegations related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Travis Decker, accused of murdering his three daughters, struggled with mental health issues and PTSD, according to his ex-wife's attorney, Arianna Cozart. The bodies of Paityn, Evelyn, and Olivia Decker were found near a Washington campground after they went missing during a planned visitation with their father. Cozart stated that Decker's mental health began to decline after leaving the active reserves in 2023, and that the system failed to provide him with adequate resources. Despite the tragedy, Whitney Decker, the ex-wife, expresses empathy for Travis and advocates for improved mental health support for veterans and reforms to the Amber Alert system.</p>

This conflict began after Musk criticized the Republican's budget-reconciliation package, leading to Trump suggesting Musk had "Trump derangement syndrome."

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated claims, without providing evidence, that former President Joe Biden's aides illegally used an autopen to enact policies. Trump asserted that Biden was not fully aware of the actions taken during his presidency and that aides used the autopen to implement radical policies. Biden has refuted these allegations, and the Justice Department's legal counsel has previously affirmed the legality of using autopens for signing bills.

          <p>Victims of the Los Angeles County fires have filed lawsuits against AAA and USAA, alleging that the insurers systematically underestimated the replacement cost of their homes, leaving them underinsured. The lawsuits claim fraud, negligence, and breach of contract, seeking damages and reforms to the insurers' practices. The plaintiffs argue that cost estimator software and other shortcomings led to inadequate coverage, leaving them unable to rebuild their homes. This legal action adds to the litigation spawned by the fires, which caused significant damage and loss of life.</p>

          <p>China has tested the core components of quantum-based network in space to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a rocket flight reaching 2.5km to assess their robustness against vibration and radiation. This marks a step towards constructing a quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network, which sends messages directly through a quantum channel without encryption keys. QSDC is considered complementary to quantum key distribution (QKD), offering potentially more efficient and secure communication.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in detention before adjudication, unlike adults who receive credit for time served. This practice extends the duration of confinement for juveniles, impacting their rehabilitation and straining resources. Policy experts argue that the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment has led to disparities in constitutional protections for young people. The lack of credit for time served can result in longer periods of incarceration, with negative consequences for their development and reintegration into society.</p>
