          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) is taking over an investigation into claims that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. The decision follows calls for transparency, as the force was initially investigating its own former officers, a move criticized by the author of a landmark 2014 report on the scandal. Three former officers have been arrested, and the NCA has pledged to keep the victims at the center of the investigation, aiming to restore trust and encourage other potential survivors to come forward.</p>

          <p>A deadline set by President Trump for Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine has arrived, raising questions about potential U.S. sanctions. Trump has threatened to impose "secondary sanctions" on countries purchasing Russian oil if Moscow does not halt its military actions. Despite recent talks of a potential trilateral summit, Trump has expressed disappointment with Putin's lack of progress, having previously escalated pressure by announcing the movement of nuclear submarines in response to Russian rhetoric.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned Israel's plan to take military control of Gaza City, calling the decision "wrong" and warning it "will only bring more bloodshed." He urged for an immediate ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, and the release of all hostages. Other UK political leaders, including from the Liberal Democrats and SNP, echoed the condemnation, with some calling for an arms embargo and sanctions against the Israeli government. The article also notes the UK's recent move to recognize a Palestinian state, a position at odds with the US.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that the company will prioritize growth and investment in AI model training over short-term profitability, even after the launch of its advanced GPT-5 model. Despite being on track for over $20 billion in annual recurring revenue, the company continues to operate at a loss, which Altman views as a rational strategy while AI capabilities are rapidly improving. With OpenAI reportedly in talks for a stock sale at a $500 billion valuation, the focus remains on spending heavily on compute and development, leveraging its position as a private company free from public market pressures.</p>

          <h2>Ohio Planned Parenthood Affiliate to Stop Accepting Medicaid Amid Legal Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>A Planned Parenthood affiliate in Southwest Ohio has announced it will no longer accept Medicaid insurance due to the legal uncertainty surrounding a federal law aimed at defunding the organization. Although a judge temporarily blocked the law, the affiliate fears the Trump administration could attempt to "claw back" payments if the ruling is later overturned, posing too great a financial risk. The decision highlights the precarious situation for reproductive health providers, with some affiliates closing clinics or ceasing to offer costly long-acting contraceptives to Medicaid patients.</p>

          <p>A recent Emerson College poll reveals significant voter indecision in California regarding the 2026 governor's race and a potential ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. In the gubernatorial field, former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter leads with 18%, but a large 38% of voters remain undecided. Similarly, voters are split on a Democratic-led proposal for mid-decade redistricting, with 42% unsure about the effort, which is intended to counter Republican gerrymandering in other states. The poll suggests the political landscape for these key issues is still highly fluid.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, claiming the executive is "highly conflicted" and prompting a drop in the company's stock price. The call follows a letter from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, which raised concerns about Tan's investments and alleged ties to Chinese companies, including some with connections to the Chinese military. In response, Tan penned a letter to employees affirming his commitment to Intel and refuting what he called "misinformation," stating he has always operated with the highest legal and ethical standards.</p>

An executive from Allianz warned that the world is approaching temperature levels where offering cover for financial products like mortgages will no longer be feasible, threatening the foundation of the economy. With insured losses from natural disasters already growing faster than the global economy, insurers fear that without rapid decarbonization and investment in resilience, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events will create unbearable societal risk.

          <p>Bao Fan, the prominent Chinese investment banker and founder of China Renaissance, has reportedly been released after disappearing more than two years ago. Bao, a key figure in China's tech sector, began "cooperating" with an unspecified investigation by mainland authorities in early 2023, and his prolonged absence caused significant uncertainty for his company. During his detention, he resigned as CEO and chairman but remains the controlling shareholder.

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that President Trump's overall approval rating remains negative, with 51% of the public disapproving of his job performance. The poll also reveals a significant decline in the Democratic Party's favorability, which has fallen to a net -32 points, potentially its lowest rating in decades. On specific issues, Trump receives positive marks only for border security, while facing disapproval on his handling of inflation, taxes, and federal spending. The data suggests a politically conflicted electorate, with Republicans remaining solidly behind the president despite broader public concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared with President Trump to announce a $600 billion U.S. spending plan, a move seen as a strategic effort to appease the administration's "Made in America" push without committing to final iPhone assembly in the U.S. The plan focuses on expanding partnerships with long-standing American suppliers like Corning and Texas Instruments for key components. This allows Apple to take credit for supporting U.S. jobs and manufacturing while avoiding the immense cost and logistical challenges of relocating its entire supply chain, a gambit that appeared to satisfy the president for now.</p>
