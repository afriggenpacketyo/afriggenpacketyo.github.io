          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan has claimed his second stage win in this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish on stage 17. The final kilometers were marked by heavy rain and a crash that took out several of his main rivals, including Tim Merlier and Biniam Girmay. Milan capitalized on the opportunity, powering past Jordi Meeus to win the stage and further solidify his lead in the points classification, strengthening his hold on the green jersey.</p>

          <p>A patient at a children's hospital in South Carolina has died from primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare and devastating brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Health officials believe the exposure likely occurred at Lake Murray, marking the state's first known case since 2016. Doctors emphasized the extremely high fatality rate of the infection, which exceeds 97%, and occurs when contaminated water is forced up the nose, typically during recreational water activities in warm freshwater.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer voiced his disappointment with the latest quarterly report from medical technology company Abbott Laboratories, a long-held stock in his charitable trust. While he described the earnings results as 'perfectly solid,' Cramer was discouraged by the company's forward-looking statements. He noted that management only tightened its full-year earnings guidance rather than raising it, and simultaneously lowered its forecasts for both organic sales growth and its operating margin outlook, signaling a lack of stronger optimism.

          <p>The lawyer for Erik Menendez, who is serving a life sentence for the 1989 murder of his parents, is calling for his client's release from prison on furlough due to a 'serious medical condition.' Menendez was recently hospitalized and is scheduled to appear before a parole board in August, his first such hearing after being resentenced earlier this year. His lawyer argues that releasing him is the 'only fair and equitable thing to do' so he can properly prepare for the hearing.</p>

This decision, prompted by Pacific Island nations, gives significant legal and moral authority to climate litigation and international negotiations, linking climate inaction directly to human rights violations.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Bermuda have arrested four American passengers from a Carnival cruise ship, accusing them of possessing and intending to distribute a 'significant quantity' of illegal drugs. The seized substances included cannabis, vape pens, and carfentanil, a synthetic opioid that is 100 times more potent than fentanyl. Police stated that the seizure may have prevented a potential tragedy on the island due to the extreme danger posed by carfentanil, which is powerful enough to be used as an elephant tranquilizer.</p>

The report comes as aid groups warn of a deepening famine and the Gaza Health Ministry reports rising deaths from starvation, particularly among children.</p>
