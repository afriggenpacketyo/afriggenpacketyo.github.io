          <p>President Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on China unless they offered something 'substantial' in return, such as opening up their markets to U.S. businesses and products. He expressed a desire for China to become more accessible to American companies, allowing them to sell their goods and services within the country. Trump emphasized that he wants China to agree to a deal that benefits the U.S. and would only consider dropping tariffs if significant concessions were made, highlighting the ongoing trade tensions between the two nations.

          <p>New research suggests that creatine, a common weightlifting supplement, may be effective in treating depression. Studies have shown that creatine can improve brain metabolism and ease depression symptoms, particularly when used in conjunction with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy.

While researchers emphasize the preliminary nature of these findings, the affordability and ubiquity of creatine make it a promising area for further investigation in mental health treatment.</p>

          <p>Rome is experiencing a period of reflection following the death of Pope Francis, with a 'pensive' atmosphere noted throughout the city. While mourning the Pope's passing, there is also recognition that he lived a long and peaceful life. The city is preparing for the funeral, which is expected to draw large crowds and require significant security measures. Despite the somber occasion, some see the funeral as a 'celebration of life' and an opportunity to honor Pope Francis's commitment to the poorest in society.</p>

Reeves acknowledged the strains and uncertainty affecting domestic bond and equity markets, emphasizing the need for stability to encourage investment in the UK economy.</p>

The move comes amid trade tensions with the US and a desire to capitalize on the fallout from President Trump's tariff policies.

          <p>Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, is suing President Trump over his administration's tariffs, arguing they will be catastrophic for his toy business and the U.S. economy. Woldenberg's company faces a significant increase in import duties, from $2.3 million to $100 million, and expects sales to drop by 25% due to the tariffs' economic impact. He claims the tariffs overreach the president's authority and is seeking to block their collection. Woldenberg is also trying to shift manufacturing out of China but notes the difficulty and expense of doing so, and has found it impossible to find U.S. manufacturers who can make his products at a competitive price.</p>
