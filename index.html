          <p>Gunmen killed at least 26 people, including tourists, in a major attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, coinciding with U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to India.

          <p>Official figures reveal that UK government borrowing exceeded expectations in the year leading up to March, reaching £151.9bn due to increased expenditure on public sector pay and benefits. This figure surpassed the £137.3bn forecast, coinciding with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attendance at IMF and World Bank meetings amidst concerns over US trade tariffs. The IMF has downgraded the UK's economic growth forecast from 1.6% to 1.1% for 2025, citing rising borrowing costs and inflation. Economists suggest that spending cuts and tax increases may be necessary to adhere to borrowing rules.</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that 84% of the world's coral reefs are experiencing bleaching, marking the most severe event ever recorded. This crisis is attributed to rising ocean temperatures caused by human-induced climate change, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. Scientists warn that at 1.5°C of warming, 70-90% of coral reefs could disappear, with almost all corals vanishing at 2°C. Addressing climate change through reduced emissions is crucial to protect these vital ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at four-year lows in March, with the consumer price index (CPI) climbing 0.9% year-on-year. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation costs, slowed to 0.5%. The inflation reading comes as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living pressures as a concern. Singapore recently eased its monetary policy for the second straight time, anticipating potential zero growth this year.</p>
