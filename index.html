          <p>A teenager escaped from her home in Blackwood, New Jersey, after allegedly being imprisoned and abused by her stepfather and mother for seven years. The girl reported being locked in a dog crate and chained in a bathroom, and alleged sexual assault by her stepfather. Authorities have charged Brenda Spencer and Branndon Mosely with assault, criminal restraint, kidnapping, and weapons offenses, with Mr. Mosely also facing multiple counts of sexual assault. The case has drawn parallels to another recent incident where a man escaped after years of imprisonment by his family.</p>

The dust storm prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports and caused near-zero visibility on several interstates.</p>

While Biden's inner circle concealed the extent of his deterioration, the public recognized his increasing infirmity. The author contends that the party's risk aversion and groupthink led to a collective failure and calls for honesty and self-reflection.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a setback as conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee. Republicans have yet to resolve disputes over federal spending, with conservative members demanding deeper cuts. Five Republicans voted against advancing the legislation, citing that it does not go far enough to slash federal spending and has back-loaded savings and front-loaded spending.</p>

          <p>Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewellery store in Tokyo can be sent to Japan following a landmark ruling. Japanese authorities have pursued the extradition of Kaine Wright and Joe Chappell for almost a decade. They are accused of stealing items worth Â£679,000 from a Harry Winston store in November 2015. The case now passes to the home secretary to decide whether they should be sent to Japan.</p>
