          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of former congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release from prison. Santos had served less than three months of a seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. Trump cited mistreatment of Santos in prison as a reason for the commutation, a move that drew praise from some Republican allies but sharp criticism from other politicians, including New York Republicans and Democrats. The commutation nullifies any further fines, restitution, or supervised release for Santos.</p>

          <p>A jury has awarded $19.7 million to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 shooting involving Denver police. The incident occurred when officers opened fire on a suspect in a crowded downtown area. One officer, Brandon Ramos, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and resigned from the force. Attorneys for the victims stated the verdict sends a clear message about police accountability and the need to consider public safety during operations.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump publicly called for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine, suggesting both sides should "stop where they are." This proposal implies that Russia would retain the territory it currently occupies, a shift from Trump's more recent statements suggesting Ukraine could win back all its land. The call for a ceasefire came after Trump also expressed hesitation about providing Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles.</p>

Smyth was convicted in Northern Ireland of defrauding mortgage clients of over $155,000. Walton, who was also a victim of Smyth in the U.S., chronicled her extensive history of scams, including impersonating Jennifer Aniston, in his podcast.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House did not result in a commitment from the U.S. to supply long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. President Donald Trump expressed reluctance to provide the weapons, citing concerns about escalating the conflict and depleting U.S. defense stockpiles. Zelenskyy had argued the missiles would be a crucial tool to weaken Russia's war economy and pressure Moscow into negotiations. Following the meeting, Zelenskyy stated he was "realistic" about the prospects of receiving the advanced weaponry.</p>

He also attributed the AfD's rise in popularity to the migration policies of his predecessors, Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz.

The test identifies fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, successfully detecting cancer in 62% of positive cases, over half of which were at an early stage. Crucially, three-quarters of the cancers found are types that currently lack routine screening programs. While researchers are optimistic, further data is needed from an ongoing NHS trial to confirm if the test translates to reduced mortality rates.</p>

          <p>The announcement that Prince Andrew will relinquish his titles, including the Duke of York, is the lead story across most British newspapers. Headlines describe the move as a "fall from grace" and a "royal bombshell," with Buckingham Palace reportedly sending the prince into "exile" to end distractions from the controversy over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Many papers report that the decision came after intense pressure from the King, with editorials welcoming the news as a common-sense move that was long overdue. The papers also note Andrew's continued denial of the allegations against him.</p>

          <p>Chinese car manufacturers have significantly increased their market share in South Africa, with sales volumes growing by 86 percent in the first eight months of the year compared to the previous year. Brands like Chery and Haval are driving this surge, boosting the total market share for Chinese OEMs to 15 percent in the SUV segment. This rapid growth is cutting into the dominance of traditional market leaders like Toyota and Suzuki, both of which saw their market shares decline during the same period. The trend reflects the growing global competitiveness of China's automotive industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani produced one of the greatest postseason performances in baseball history to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers back to the World Series. In the National League Championship Series-clinching game against the Milwaukee Brewers, Ohtani hit three home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out ten batters over six scoreless innings. This unprecedented display of hitting and pitching dominance earned him the series MVP award and emphatically ended a recent slump.

          <p>The damage from a severe storm that struck remote western Alaska is so extensive that many of the 2,000 displaced residents may not be able to return home for at least 18 months. The storm, remnants of Typhoon Halong, brought a massive storm surge that destroyed a high percentage of homes in several Alaska Native villages. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a major disaster declaration from the White House to secure federal aid. Evacuees are being airlifted to shelters in larger communities like Anchorage while officials assess the long-term housing crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has developed a new computing solution called Aegaeon that it claims can significantly reduce the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) required for artificial intelligence models. During a beta test, the system cut the number of H20 GPUs needed to serve dozens of large language models from 1,192 to just 213, an 82 percent reduction. The system addresses resource inefficiency by pooling GPU power, allowing a single GPU to serve multiple models concurrently. This innovation could lead to substantial cost savings for cloud service providers running AI workloads. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that prosecutors must begin a retrial for Pedro Hernandez, the man convicted in the 1979 disappearance and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, by June 1, 2026. If a new jury is not selected by that date, Hernandez will be released. This decision follows a federal appeals court overturning his 2017 conviction due to incorrect jury instructions regarding his confession. This will be the third time Hernandez faces trial for the crime, as his first trial in 2015 ended with a hung jury.</p>
