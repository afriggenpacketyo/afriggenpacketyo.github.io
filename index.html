          <h2>Report Finds Climate Change Intensified Recent Midwest and Southern Flooding</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by World Weather Attribution attributes the deadly storms and record-breaking downpours in the Midwest and South in early April to climate change, stating that human-caused global warming made the rainfall about 9% heavier. The analysis also found that unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by climate change, made the storms 14 times more likely. The report also expresses concern about the impact of staff shortages at the National Weather Service, which could hinder real-time warnings and emergency management coordination, and highlights the strain on insurance markets as climate change drives more frequent and severe weather.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady, citing economic uncertainty due to tariffs. Trump called Powell a "fool" and expressed frustration that rates were not lowered to counter a possible economic slowdown. The Fed stated it would maintain current rates until the economic outlook becomes clearer, balancing risks of higher unemployment and inflation, and Powell affirmed that the Fed's decisions would not be influenced by political pressure and would solely consider economic data and outlook.</p>

          <p>The British government has reached a trade deal with the United States, which will ease the impact of recent increases in U.S. tariffs. President Trump announced the agreement, describing it as "full and comprehensive" and cementing the relationship between the two countries. The deal is expected to support certain sectors, including Britain's auto industry, and boost consumer and business sentiment, however, economists caution that the greater threat to Britain is the uncertainty that Trump's trade policy has created globally, rather than tariffs on Britain.</p>

          <h2>The Tyranny of School Spirit Days and Their Impact on Parents</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the increasing prevalence of school spirit days and the burden they place on parents, who often find themselves scrambling to coordinate costumes and outfits with little notice. While schools intend to build community and engage students, spirit days can cause division and expose wealth disparities among families. The author suggests that schools reduce the frequency of spirit days or shift the focus to collaborative, in-school activities that involve everyone, rather than relying on parents to provide costumes from home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Office for Students (OfS) reveals that over 40% of universities in England anticipate financial deficits by this summer, driven mainly by a decline in international student numbers due to visa changes. Despite efforts to cut costs, the OfS emphasizes the need for significant reform and efficiencies, while Universities UK (UUK) describes the report as "deeply sobering." The sector faces challenges such as frozen domestic tuition fees and underfunded research grants, prompting calls for government intervention to address the financial strain.</p>
