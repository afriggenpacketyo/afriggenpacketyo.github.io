            <p>Despite a significant drop in migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, the Trump administration has deployed approximately 500 active-duty soldiers to the Big Bend sector in Texas. These soldiers will provide logistical support to Border Patrol agents, focusing on detection and monitoring rather than direct patrols or arrests. While local officials welcome the military presence, some residents express concerns about the militarization of the area, given the already strong law enforcement presence and surveillance infrastructure. The deployment includes Stryker vehicles, signaling a new phase in the government's approach to border security, although border arrest numbers in this sector remain low.</p>

Other world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, also condemned the attack, which occurred amidst ongoing diplomatic efforts to negotiate an end to the three-year war.

            <p>Aimee Lou Wood, known for her role in *The White Lotus*, publicly criticized a *Saturday Night Live* (SNL) sketch that featured comedian Sarah Sherman wearing exaggerated prosthetic teeth to impersonate her.

Wood stated that she wasn't attacking Sherman personally but the concept of the joke itself, and that SNL has since apologized to her.</p>

Immigration experts emphasize the strict regulations governing citizenship conferral, highlighting that new citizens enrolled to vote would have arrived in Australia well before the current government took office. The claim that the government can manipulate citizenship numbers for political gain is dismissed, given that permanent migrants choose to apply for citizenship.</p>

            <p>The "Made in USA" label signifies that all or virtually all of a product originates in the United States, including its parts and assembly. However, intricate trade rules and global manufacturing networks complicate this claim, allowing for some foreign components as long as they don't substantially transform the product. Determining a product's country of origin often relies on the "substantial transformation" test, which can be complex and subject to interpretation. Bilateral trade agreements, such as USMCA, can also override these rules, further complicating country-of-origin labeling requirements.</p>

            <p>Akkermansia muciniphila is a beneficial gut bacteria that plays a crucial role in maintaining the gut barrier and preventing obesity. This bacteria survives off of mucin, a mucus layer that covers the large intestine's surface, and its presence is associated with good health. Research has shown that A. muciniphila helps regulate the immune system and may prevent metabolic diseases. While the bacteria feeds off mucus, a diet rich in fiber indirectly supports its growth by providing fuel for other colon-dwelling bacteria, contributing to a balanced gut microbiome.</p>

The report acknowledged that misinformation spread online following the attack fueled the disorder. The report made recommendations for the Crown Prosecution Service to update its media protocol.</p>

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second straight time and lowered its GDP forecast to 0%-2% for 2025, citing a challenging economic environment and declining manufacturing and services sectors. The Monetary Authority of Singapore also projected GDP growth of 0%-2% for 2025. The Ministry of Trade and Industry attributed the slowdown to declines in manufacturing and some services sectors, such as finance and insurance. The ministry said that due to the sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S., as well as the U.S.-China trade war, the growth outlook for both the U.S. and China will deteriorate.</p>
