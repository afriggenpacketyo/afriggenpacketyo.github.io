          <p>Former Wales rugby international Jamie Roberts, 38, is set to begin his medical training as a junior doctor in the NHS, twelve years after graduating from Cardiff University's school of medicine. Roberts, who earned 94 caps for Wales and was a British and Irish Lion, balanced his medical studies with his rugby career, even sitting his final exams during a Six Nations tournament. He completed postgraduate degrees at Loughborough University and Cambridge University, and now aims to specialize in sports medicine or orthopaedics, inspired by his own injuries, as he follows in the footsteps of other Welsh rugby players who have become doctors. Roberts expresses excitement and respect for the NHS, ready to face the challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, with authorities suspecting assistance from within the department, according to this article. The inmates, including four charged with second-degree murder, broke through a cell wall and scaled a perimeter wall after shedding their jail uniforms. Three escapees have been apprehended, and the remaining are considered armed and dangerous as a full-scale search operation is underway. The sheriff's office is investigating security failures, including defective locks and doors, and the fact that a civilian employee monitoring security systems had left his post, leading to the suspension of three employees without pay.</p>

          <p>Automatic gunfire was heard in central Gaza early Saturday, hours after the Israeli military announced preparations for a major advance into the territory. The gunfire followed intense Israeli bombardment overnight, prompting some civilians to flee westward as mediators sought a new temporary truce. The conflict between Israel and Hamas, ongoing since October 2023, has resulted in immense casualties and a humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning of widespread hunger due to an Israeli blockade. Despite the toll, neither side has achieved a decisive victory, and Hamas has vowed not to release remaining hostages unless Israel ends the war and withdraws from Gaza.</p>

The two front-runners are left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, and national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party. The government's approval ratings have declined due to the lack of progress on key reforms, including the rule of law and LGBTQ+ rights, as President Duda has used his veto power to stymie government bills.</p>

Audio recordings from the 2023 interview revealed Biden struggling to remember key dates, including his son Beau's death and the year Donald Trump was elected. In February 2024, when questioned about Hur's description of him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," Biden retorted that he knew what he was doing and didn't need the special counsel's recommendation. The report amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, ultimately contributing to his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.</p>

          <p>President Trump's whirlwind tour of the Middle East was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and ethics concerns. In Saudi Arabia, he received a standing ovation for announcing the lifting of sanctions on Syria; in Qatar, he secured billions in investment pledges; and in the UAE, he was awarded the country's highest civilian honor. Trump touted over $2 trillion in economic investments from the three nations and was surrounded by friendly audiences, turning events into campaign-style rallies. The trip was intended to deliver economic, diplomatic, and public relations wins, with Gulf leaders echoing Trump's slogans and praising his shift away from judgment and confrontation.</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in the Bosnian city of Gorazde fear they may not survive the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on goods sent to their biggest market, the United States. The tariffs, initially announced at 35% and later revised to 10%, have disrupted expansion plans and scared off American customers, according to Demir Imamovic, Ginex's marketing manager. Gorazde's mayor, Ernest Imamovic, expressed concern that the U.S. had abandoned free trade as a path to peace, while Trade Minister Stasa Kosarac showed no interest in saving the gun companies, saying his ministry had more important things to do.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the rare but not unprecedented nature of the case involving a Wisconsin judge charged with helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities, drawing parallels to a similar case in Massachusetts. In the Massachusetts case, Judge Shelley Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape ICE, highlighting the complex intersection of state and federal authority. The article explores differing views on whether such cases represent federal overreach or necessary enforcement of immigration laws, raising questions about the balance between judicial discretion and adherence to federal regulations.</p>

          <p>As the United States and other economic powers reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is using its wealth and influence to fill the void. Since 2019, Emirati firms have announced $110 billion worth of deals in Africa, focusing on key economic and strategic spots such as ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. This expansion is part of an ambitious plan to increase the UAE‚Äôs influence over global supply chains and diversify its economy away from fossil fuels. While the US reduces its presence, the UAE's investments and efforts align with a broader trend towards business-focused approaches in Africa.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the rescue of dozens of abused and malnourished children from the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult's compound in Yamanashi Prefecture, nearly a month after the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack. Mitsuo Hosaka, a child welfare worker, describes the challenges of caring for the children, who were brainwashed, hostile, and deprived of parental affection. Over time, the children began to regain their childlike selves, engaging in team sports and expressing affection, eventually being transferred to national child guidance centers. Hosaka reflects on the cult's denial of the parent-child relationship and the long-term impact on the children's lives.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from a New Orleans jail, possibly with inside assistance, prompting a manhunt, with three inmates since being apprehended. Eight inmates remain at large, including four charged with second-degree murder. The escape occurred after inmates tampered with a cell door and exited through a wall behind a toilet, scaling the perimeter wall. Authorities are investigating the breach, citing defective locks and a civilian employee who was not at their assigned post, and have placed three employees on administrative leave. The sheriff's office is working with local, state, and federal law enforcement on the search operation.</p>

          <p>Audio recordings from a 2023 interview with former President Joe Biden, conducted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur, have emerged, highlighting Biden's memory lapses and halting tone. The recordings reveal Biden struggling to recall key dates, such as his son Beau's death and the year of President Trump's first election, with staff members correcting him. Hur's report, which declined to charge Biden with a crime, described him as an "elderly man with a poor memory," a characterization that drew strong reactions from Biden and his allies. The release of the audio has reignited scrutiny of Biden's cognitive abilities and decisions during that period.</p>

The clip captured Mr. Biden stumbling over the years his son died, when Donald J. Trump was first elected, and when he left office as vice president. Republicans have long sought the release of the recording, arguing it would offer evidence of a decline in Mr. Biden‚Äôs mental acuity.</p>
