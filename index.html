          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have resigned following a controversial plea deal offered to a sheriff's deputy convicted of using excessive force. The new U.S. attorney, Bill Essayli, appointed by President Trump, offered a misdemeanor plea to Trevor Kirk, who was found guilty of felony deprivation of rights for assaulting and pepper-spraying a woman. The prosecutors who resigned, including the chief of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section, viewed the move as highly unorthodox, particularly after a jury had already reached a guilty verdict. The plea deal is under judicial review.</p>

          <p>A police training expert testified in the trial of three former Memphis officers charged in the death of Tyre Nichols, stating that kicks and punches to Nicholsâ€™ head were unnecessary and excessive.

The telescope's construction faced protests from native Hawaiians who view the land as sacred, but researchers are optimistic about its potential to mitigate the impact of geomagnetic disturbances.</p>
