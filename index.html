          <p>Retail sales in the UK saw a third consecutive monthly increase in March, driven by warmer weather that boosted demand for clothing and DIY products. Sales volumes climbed 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics, with various sectors benefiting from the sunshine.  However, food sales remained weak, particularly in supermarkets, and analysts caution that this sales growth trend might soon end due to decreased consumer confidence in April.</p>
