            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as the new vice minister of commerce and top representative for international trade negotiation, replacing Wang Shouwen, amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States. Li's appointment signals China's effort to address trade disputes with the U.S. as there have been no signs of near-term trade talks, with both sides increasing tariff tensions. Li's prior experience includes participating in a symposium addressing concerns of private companies after President Xi Jinping expressed support for businesses. This change occurs alongside a broader reshuffle in Beijing's top echelon, indicating a strategic recalibration of China's approach to international trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The White House has introduced a new media policy that significantly limits access to President Trump for news agencies, following a courtroom loss regarding access for The Associated Press. This policy would restrict wire services like AP, Reuters, and Bloomberg, which serve numerous news outlets, by lumping them with print reporters for limited slots. The White House asserts that press secretary Karoline Leavitt will have the final say on who questions the president, raising concerns about potential viewpoint discrimination. The AP has expressed disappointment, stating that the restrictions disregard the fundamental American freedom of speech without government control or retaliation.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order against Google for unfair trade practices related to search services on Android devices. The JFTC found that Google violated Japan's anti-monopoly law by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. Google allegedly required manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome on devices, and to exclude rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model.

            <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia student and Palestinian activist, was detained by immigration agents just before his citizenship interview, expressing fears that the appointment was a setup. Mahdawi, a green card holder from the West Bank, was taken into custody under a law allowing deportation for foreign nationals posing "serious adverse foreign policy consequences." His attorneys allege he is being punished for protected speech and are seeking his release, with a judge temporarily halting his deportation. The case highlights concerns about the targeting of activists and the potential for political motivations behind immigration enforcement.</p>

            <p>An Israeli airstrike struck the northern gate of a field hospital in Gaza, resulting in casualties, as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas continue. The strike follows a previous attack on the Al-Ahli Hospital, which has been rendered "out of service," according to the UN. These incidents raise concerns about the protection of medical facilities and personnel under international humanitarian law. Efforts to reach a new ceasefire agreement have seen little progress, with both sides reiterating their demands.</p>

The city of Palo Alto believes the tampering may have occurred on Friday and is working to repair the affected crossings.</p>

            <p>European companies with a stake in China's economy are increasingly concerned about being marginalized due to Beijing's "Made in China 2025" initiative. The initiative aims to bolster China's technological independence, potentially excluding foreign firms once Chinese companies achieve comparable technology. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China warns that market access restrictions and an inability to compete could lead to a significant loss of market share for foreign companies. The chamber recommends that China focus on opening up and attracting foreign investment with clear metrics and accountability practices.</p>

            <p>Nvidia expects to incur a $5.5 billion hit as the U.S. government tightens export rules for its H20 AI chip to China, requiring licenses for sales including Hong Kong. The move comes amid an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, with both countries introducing steep trade tariffs. The rules address concerns that the chips may be used in or diverted to supercomputers in China, impacting Nvidia's revenue. The tighter export controls are expected to decouple the U.S. and China AI semiconductor supply chains.</p>
