          <p>Vice President JD Vance has demonstrated significant influence within the Trump administration by playing a pivotal role in passing a major tax and spending bill. He successfully negotiated with congressional holdouts and cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate, securing the bill's passage. This involvement in domestic policy, alongside his defense of the administration's foreign policy decisions, highlights his expanding role as a key operator and potential successor to the MAGA movement. His actions have drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who are framing him as the face of the bill's controversial cuts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hair stylists and dermatologists are advising against going to bed with wet hair, citing several potential health issues. When wet, hair is more fragile and prone to breakage from friction against a pillowcase, leading to split ends and damage. The damp, warm environment created on the scalp can also promote the growth of fungi and bacteria, potentially causing dandruff, irritation, or even folliculitis. Furthermore, moisture transferred to pillowcases can harbor bacteria that may contribute to skin breakouts like acne or eczema.</p>

          <p>A new appointee to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Vicky Pebsworth, has a decades-long history of advocating against vaccines, a position refuted by extensive scientific research. Pebsworth, a registered nurse, has publicly claimed for years that vaccines caused her son's autism and is associated with the National Vaccine Information Center, a prominent anti-vaccine organization. Her appointment is part of a broader overhaul of the committee by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., raising concerns among public health experts about the future of science-based vaccine policy in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Writing from Tehran, a social researcher describes how the recent Israeli attacks have unified a politically divided Iranian population around a renewed sense of patriotism. The article argues that the West's support for the strikes, particularly from European nations, has shattered any remaining trust among ordinary Iranians, regardless of their views on the Islamic Republic. This perceived double standard has led to widespread anger and a growing sentiment that developing nuclear weapons is the only viable deterrent. The author concludes that this deep-seated mistrust will have lasting consequences for future diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>Credit scoring company FICO will begin incorporating data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans into some of its credit score models this fall. This change addresses a blind spot for lenders, providing a more complete financial picture of borrowers who increasingly use these popular installment-based payment options. While making timely BNPL payments could help consumers build credit, missed payments could negatively impact their scores. Consumer advocates note that while this provides more data, BNPL services still lack some of the robust consumer protections associated with traditional credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

While Republicans frame the bill as a necessary move to avoid tax increases, Democrats believe the tangible impact of healthcare cuts will be a more potent political weapon.

This raises the possibility that high tariffs on dozens of countries could soon take effect, adding to inflationary pressures already felt by consumers and businesses.

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains at the site of a massive explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday, left seven people unaccounted for, and officials have not yet made a positive identification of the remains. The facility, located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, reportedly lacked local licenses for fireworks storage. The investigation, now led by Cal Fire with assistance from the ATF, is ongoing as crews work to secure the scene.</p>

          <p>Supporters' groups for the LA Galaxy, including the Angel City Brigade, staged a protest during the team's July 4th match to express their frustration with the club's silence on recent ICE raids in Southern California. The fans displayed a large banner reading "Fight Ignorance, Not Immigrants" and then walked out of the stadium at the 12th minute. The groups, whose fanbase is predominantly Latino, contrasted the Galaxy's silence with other local sports teams that have publicly supported the immigrant community. They also organized a fundraiser for immigrant rights organizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While over a million people are expected to attend Pride in London, the event and others like it across the UK are facing an uncertain financial future. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network reveals that a majority of Pride events have seen a significant drop in corporate sponsorships and funding. This financial strain is attributed to rising operational costs and a shift away from diversity and inclusion initiatives by some global corporations. Consequently, some Prides have been canceled or forced to scale back, while others are introducing ticket fees for previously free events.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. Their research, published in the journal 'Science,' identified a "genetic switch" that, when activated, allows for the complete regeneration of lost tissues, including cartilage. The key was discovering that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings offer hope that similar regenerative pathways might exist in other organs and species.</p>

          <p>The administration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is facing a historical and political dilemma regarding the commemoration of World War II. Critics accuse the government of attempting to honor the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory while simultaneously downplaying its historical roots on the mainland before the KMT's retreat to Taiwan in 1949. President Lai's approach continues his party's emphasis on a distinct Taiwanese identity, which involves distancing the island from the ROC's mainland legacy. This creates a complex challenge in how to frame Taiwan's role in the war.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that to understand Donald Trump's style of governance, one should look to the history of cold war-era dictatorships in Africa, many of which were supported by the U.S. The author draws parallels between Trump's actions—such as deploying troops against protesters, embracing theatrical economic policies, and his cult of personality—and the methods of autocrats like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The article suggests that this authoritarian model, once fostered abroad by the U.S. as a bulwark against communism, is now being mirrored within American politics itself.</p>
