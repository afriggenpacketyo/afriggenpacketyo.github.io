          <p>Disorder erupted in Ballymena, County Antrim, with houses set on fire and police officers injured following a protest related to an alleged sexual assault. Masked individuals threw masonry and other projectiles at police, damaging a patrol car. The unrest followed a peaceful march earlier in the day, hours after two teenage boys appeared in court accused of the crime, with their solicitor stating they would deny the charges. Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice, attributed the violence to demographic changes due to immigration.</p>

          <p>As Republicans consider legislation to cut billions from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a KFF poll indicates that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA marketplace plans identify as Republicans. The proposed cuts could lead to approximately 15 million people losing health insurance if tax credits are not extended. The self-employed, who tend to lean Republican, are more likely to obtain coverage through ACA exchanges, and many Republicans reside in states that did not expand Medicaid, making them more reliant on ACA subsidies. This situation means that a significant portion of Republicans could face coverage losses if the proposed legislation is enacted. (not investment advice)</p>

Katz warned that Israel's reach extends everywhere, following numerous drone and missile launches by the Houthis towards Israel and international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, actions the Houthis claim are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Thousands of protesters blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire, leading to law enforcement using tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowds. California sued the Trump administration for deploying the National Guard without consulting Governor Gavin Newsom, who deemed the move "illegal and immoral." As of Monday, 53 people have been arrested on various charges, while the military mobilized additional National Guard members and Marines to assist federal law enforcement.</p>

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of President Trump's tax bill, fearing it could prompt foreign investors to withdraw investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the provision, aimed at penalizing foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," could inadvertently impact most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI suggests the U.S. fund management industry could face "collateral damage" due to the bill's impact on foreign investment. Foreign investors hold significant assets in U.S. stock markets and bonds, and the ICI fears the bill could incentivize capital flight. (not investment advice)</p>

While history records Qin Shi Huang sending alchemist Xu Fu eastwards, this discovery implies a previously unknown western quest.

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles without Governor Newsom's consent has sparked debate over presidential powers to quell unrest. The deployment, aimed at addressing anti-immigration enforcement protests, marks the first time since 1965 that such action has occurred without a state request. Trump is relying on a statute allowing troops in cases of "rebellion or danger of rebellion," rather than the Insurrection Act. Legal experts are questioning the legality of this approach, as well as the scope of the military's authority in protecting federal functions and property.</p>

          <p>Israel says it has begun to deport 12 pro-Palestinian activists, including Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, whose Gaza-bound aid boat was seized by Israeli forces in the Mediterranean on Monday. The Israeli foreign ministry said Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning on a flight to France after she agreed to be deported. But France said five of the six French activists had refused to sign their deportation orders and would now be brought before an Israeli judicial authority. Their yacht, the Madleen, was intercepted while they tried to deliver a "symbolic" amount of aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's naval blockade to highlight the humanitarian crisis there.</p>

          <p>Japan aims to decrease the estimated death toll from a potential megaquake in the Nankai Trough by about 80% over the next decade, according to government and ruling party sources.
