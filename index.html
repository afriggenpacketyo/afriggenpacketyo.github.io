          <p>A shooting incident in a Midtown Manhattan office building on Monday evening resulted in a New York City police officer and two civilians being wounded. The lone suspect reportedly died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the attack, which involved a long rifle. Authorities quickly contained the scene at 345 Park Avenue, a high-rise housing offices for the NFL and Blackstone, placing the building on lockdown. The injured officer is expected to survive, while one of the civilian victims remains in critical condition.</p>

          <p>Cory Bowman, a Cincinnati mayoral candidate, has strongly criticized the city's current leadership after a video of a brutal street assault went viral. Bowman, who is also the half-brother of Vice President JD Vance, argued that failed policies and a lack of law enforcement support have led to rising crime. He claimed that citizens are losing faith in calling the police, a sentiment echoed by the police chief who noted only one 911 call was made during the incident despite numerous witnesses. Bowman framed the event as a wake-up call, indicative of a broader crisis in American cities.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Delta Air Lines co-pilot was arrested in the cockpit of his plane just minutes after landing a flight from Minneapolis at San Francisco International Airport. The pilot, Rustom Bhagwagar, was apprehended by sheriff's deputies and Homeland Security agents on suspicion of sexual crimes against a minor. He faces five counts of oral copulation with a child under 10, with bail set at $5 million. The arrest followed a months-long investigation, and Delta has stated it has zero tolerance for such alleged conduct and is cooperating with authorities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has rejected a lawsuit seeking to force the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The lawsuit, filed by investment fund Azoria Capital, argued that the FOMC was subject to the federal "Sunshine Act" requiring open meetings. Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the committee is not a government agency subject to the act, upholding its long-standing practice of meeting privately. The judge also questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking to reporters, Trump said, "That’s real starvation... I see it, and you can’t fake that."

In a feature for "Men's Health," Doncic showcased a slimmer, more toned physique achieved through twice-daily workouts and a new gluten-free, low-sugar diet. This renewed focus on conditioning follows narratives about his lack of discipline, which he acknowledged as a motivator after being traded to the Lakers.

The court ordered the foreign secretary to reconsider the decision not to assist the family, who are living in a tent in Deir al-Balah at "constant risk of injury or death." The family, who has a British relative, was granted permission to come to the UK but was denied help leaving Gaza, as the Foreign Office policy only assists in exceptional cases like separated spouses or children. The judge ruled the government must re-evaluate, considering the legally exceptional nature of their situation.</p>

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated the deal would "substantially damage" his country's finances, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called it "submission." Despite the criticism, many EU capitals acknowledged that the uneven deal was preferable to an all-out trade war with the U.S.</p>
