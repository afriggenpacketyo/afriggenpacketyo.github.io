          <p>A congressional hearing revealed that Beijing is more inclined to use a blockade or economic warfare against Taiwan rather than a full-scale invasion, according to witnesses and lawmakers. Mark Montgomery, a retired US rear admiral, suggested that China would likely target Taiwan's financial, energy, and telecommunications sectors through cyber warfare. While the US does not recognize Taiwan as an independent state, it opposes any forceful takeover and is committed to providing arms to the island. The article underscores growing concerns in the US regarding potential actions by mainland China against Taiwan, particularly around the year 2027, citing increased military activity as a sign of escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a 27-year-old woman from Georgia, was found alive after being missing for three weeks while hiking in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Slaton was discovered inside a rental cabin by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, who had accessed his property after snow plows cleared Kaiser Pass. She had taken refuge in the cabin after encountering a blizzard, surviving on leeks and the unlocked cabin which the owner had left open for emergencies. Despite a full-scale search operation covering nearly 600 square miles, the snowpack had prevented access to the area where she was found, and she was reported to be dehydrated but in good health.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a tattered copy of the Magna Carta, purchased in 1946 for $27.50, is actually a rare 1300 version issued by King Edward I, potentially worth millions. David Carpenter, a medieval history professor, identified the document while searching Harvard's Law School Library website, and its authenticity was confirmed through comparisons with other copies and advanced imaging techniques. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace. The article notes the Magna Carta's enduring relevance, especially during times when institutions like Harvard face challenges to their autonomy.</p>

Republican Rep. Ralph Norman cited concerns about the bill adding to the national debt as his reason for voting against it. House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to unify his divided conference and held a high-stakes meeting to address sticking points related to Medicaid and tax reform. The bill is another crucial test of Johnson's speakership as the Republican majority can only withstand three no votes from within their ranks before losing sufficient support for passage.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border. Judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants were not aware they were entering a military zone and could not be charged with trespassing. The New Mexico national defense area was established in April along 180 miles of the border, authorizing US army troops to detain immigrants entering the area from Mexico. The judge contested the charges after defense attorneys argued that warning signs were inadequate to inform immigrants they were committing a crime.</p>

Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies.

          <p>An Atlantic article discusses the Trump administration's reliance on officials holding multiple positions, raising concerns about the effectiveness and potential conflicts of interest within the government. Several officials are highlighted, including Todd Blanche, Russ Vought, Kash Patel, and Marco Rubio, who are juggling multiple key roles. The article points out that while some dual-hatted roles exist by design, the current situation reflects Trump's difficulty or unwillingness to find qualified individuals for these positions. The author suggests that this approach could lead to dysfunction, incompetence, and conflicts of interest, ultimately undermining the administration's ability to govern effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to lower tariffs on Chinese goods provided some relief to businesses, but the remaining 30% tariff continues to pose challenges, especially for small companies. While large retailers can absorb some costs, smaller businesses with minimal leverage face tight margins and struggle to negotiate with Chinese suppliers. The uncertainty surrounding the 90-day pause and potential for future tariff increases has led many businesses to halt new product development and consider layoffs. The article features several business owners discussing their strategies to cope with the tariff situation, including cutting cheaper items, considering layoffs, and splitting the cost with vendors.</p>

The hearing included discussions on the 14th Amendment, potential impacts on government benefits, and the practicality of eliminating nationwide injunctions.

          <p>Florida has become the second state, after Utah, to ban adding fluoride to drinking water, with Governor Ron DeSantis signing the bill into law. This decision goes against the advice of public health experts and medical professionals, who warn it will increase tooth decay, especially in children. The law aligns with the views of Robert F Kennedy Jr and Florida’s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, who suggest that fluoride affects children’s intellectual abilities. The bill takes effect on July 1, and was touted by DeSantis as “legislation to protect against forced medication.”</p>
