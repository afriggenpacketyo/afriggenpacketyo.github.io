          <p>Rockefeller Capital Management, a wealth manager originating from the Rockefeller family office, has announced a new round of financing from several prominent family offices, including those of the Chanel dynasty. This recapitalization raises the firm's valuation to $6.6 billion, more than double its 2023 value. With the new capital, CEO Greg Fleming plans to expand by hiring more advisors and tapping into international markets like Singapore and the Middle East. The investment underscores the growing interest of family offices in the stable, fee-based revenue of the wealth management sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) faced significant turmoil after issuing over 1,300 termination notices, only to reinstate about 700 of them over the weekend. The initial cuts eliminated entire offices, including the staff of the respected Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, who were later brought back. However, key departments like human resources and the Washington office remain eliminated, raising concerns about the agency's ability to function, communicate with Congress, and respond to public health crises like the ongoing measles outbreak. The chaotic process has been described as taking a sledgehammer to the agency.</p>

          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has announced a significant partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), committing to deploy 50,000 of AMD's Instinct MI450 AI chips starting in the second half of 2026. This move represents a substantial effort by cloud providers to offer alternatives to Nvidia, which currently dominates over 90% of the AI chip market. The deal strengthens the growing relationship between AMD and major AI players like OpenAI, which recently signed its own multi-year cloud deal with Oracle. This signals increasing competition and diversification within the critical AI hardware supply chain.</p>

The firm's profit surged 37% from the previous year, with revenue climbing 20% to $15.18 billion. Investment banking fees saw a notable 42% jump due to increased merger and debt underwriting activity. The bank's performance reflects a broader trend of Wall Street firms benefiting from market volatility and a recent uptick in corporate deal-making, a positive sign for the financial sector's health.

China's major telecom operators have received approval to begin commercial trials of eSIM functionality in smartphones, a technology that replaces physical SIM cards. This approval, which had previously delayed the iPhone Air's release in China by a month, is a significant milestone for the country's mobile industry.

          <p>Amid aid cuts from the United States and the rise of authoritarian practices, the influence of Western democracies on Africa's political landscape appears to be waning. Recent crackdowns on opposition and protests in countries like Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya are proceeding despite historical reliance on Western support for democratic norms. Some analysts argue that the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency has emboldened authoritarian leaders. However, many African activists and experts assert that the continent should look inward, fostering grassroots movements and strengthening its own institutions to hold power accountable, rather than depending on the West.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new tariffs on a range of imported goods, including kitchen cabinets, vanities, and softwood lumber. A 10% tariff now applies to softwood lumber and timber, while a 25% tariff on cabinets and vanities is set to increase to 50% in the new year. The White House states these measures are necessary to protect U.S. manufacturers and national security. However, industry groups like the National Association of Homebuilders have expressed concern that the tariffs will raise construction and renovation costs, potentially creating new challenges for an already strained housing market.</p>

          <p>A wave of "Gen Z uprisings" has swept across South and Southeast Asia, with major demonstrations taking place in Nepal, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and the Philippines. While the specific triggers vary, the underlying causes are consistent: stagnant economic prospects for young people, widening inequality, and anger over perceived elite corruption often flaunted on social media. In Nepal, the protests led to the collapse of the government, while in other nations they have forced rare concessions from authorities on issues like politician perks.

The statement, which did not mention the release of Israeli hostages, has drawn criticism from Mamdani's political opponents. Mamdani's own statement echoed the DSA's language, calling for a future without occupation, which also prompted backlash from other New York City officials.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively dismantling the Pentagon's long-standing approach to treating climate change as a national security threat, despite its growing impact on military operations. Extreme weather, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, has already damaged bases, sidelined thousands of troops, and undermined readiness. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed climate concerns and ordered the removal of climate change references from mission statements, while the department's budget request cuts $1.6 billion in related spending. Critics warn this policy shift puts troops at risk and creates strategic vulnerabilities by ignoring a key factor shaping global conflict.</p>

However, analysts believe this does not signal a withdrawal of attention from the region.

The head of the CPS stated the case failed because the government did not provide evidence officially labeling China a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses.

          <p>China's leading semiconductor association has strongly criticized the Dutch government's decision to take control of Nexperia, a Netherlands-based chipmaker fully owned by the Chinese company Wingtech. The Dutch government invoked a national security law to assume partial control, citing concerns about technology transfers and governance shortcomings. In response, the China Semiconductor Industry Association accused the Netherlands of abusing the concept of national security and imposing discriminatory restrictions. The move caused Wingtech's shares to plummet and highlights the growing geopolitical battle over the global semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>Retired England cricket star Stuart Broad has claimed that Australia's current team is their "worst" since 2010, the last time England won an Ashes series down under. Responding to predictions of a heavy England defeat, Broad argued that Australia is under significant pressure as favorites despite having question marks over their team composition and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins. He asserted that while winning in Australia is difficult, the current English squad is the best since 2010, setting the stage for what he believes will be a highly competitive and brilliant Ashes series.</p>

          <p>The Israeli gymnastics team will be unable to compete in the upcoming World Artistic Gymnastics Championships after host country Indonesia denied them entry visas. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation, cited its solidarity with Palestinians as the reason for the decision. The Israel Gymnastics Federation appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to either guarantee their participation or cancel the event, but the court rejected their requests. The International Gymnastics Federation stated it could not compel the Indonesian government to issue visas, leaving the Israeli athletes, including defending world champion Artem Dolgopyat, excluded from the competition.</p>

          <p>Israeli officials are voicing growing frustration with the slow pace at which the remains of deceased hostages are being returned by Hamas as part of the recent ceasefire agreement. Of the 28 hostages known to have died in captivity, only four coffins have been handed over so far. While sources close to Hamas claim that recovering the bodies is difficult amid the widespread destruction in Gaza, Israeli authorities suspect the group may be retaining the remains as leverage for future negotiations. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for the immediate suspension of the deal until all deceased hostages are returned.</p>

          <p>General Motors has announced it will take a $1.6 billion charge in its third-quarter results, reflecting a significant pullback from its earlier, more aggressive electric vehicle plans. The charge includes $1.2 billion in non-cash adjustments to its EV capacity and $400 million in cash for contract cancellation fees. GM cited recent U.S. government policy changes, such as the end of certain consumer tax credits and reduced emissions standards, as reasons for an expected slowdown in EV adoption. This move follows a similar write-down by Ford, highlighting the challenges automakers face in a fluctuating EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new think tank, Searchlight Institute, has been launched by veteran Democratic operative Adam Jentleson with the goal of encouraging the party's candidates to adopt more "heterodox" positions outside of traditional liberal orthodoxy. The project, backed by a $10 million budget, argues that Democrats must appeal to a wider range of voters by allowing for more ideological diversity, similar to Donald Trump's successful 2016 campaign. However, the initiative has drawn sharp criticism from progressives, who view it as an attempt to abandon core party values and sacrifice marginalized groups for political expediency, sparking a debate over the party's future direction.</p>

          <p>China has implemented sweeping new export controls on rare earth minerals, a move that directly threatens the U.S. defense industry and could reignite a trade war. The restrictions specifically deny export licenses for materials intended for foreign military use, impacting critical components in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 fighter jet and Tomahawk missiles. As China dominates over 90% of the global refining capacity for these minerals, the U.S. is highly dependent on its supply. This action provides Beijing with powerful leverage ahead of trade talks and has prompted a rally in U.S. rare earth mining stocks.</p>

          <p>This year's autumn foliage season in several regions of the United States, including the Northeast and the Rocky Mountains, has been dulled by persistent drought conditions. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 40% of the country was experiencing drought in early October, causing leaves to brown and fall prematurely rather than turning to their usual vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. While tourism in leaf-peeping hotspots remains relatively strong, forestry experts have observed that the lack of water has stressed the trees, leading to a less colorful and shorter display of nature's annual autumn spectacle.</p>

          <p>Thousands of federal workers affected by recent layoffs under the Trump administration face significant financial hurdles, including the loss of key student loan benefits. Many federal agencies offer employees up to $10,000 per year in repayment assistance, a perk that is terminated upon job loss. Furthermore, those working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) will not accrue credit during their period of unemployment.

Despite studies suggesting that nearly 40% of jobs in the country involve tasks that could be automated, the majority of workers expressed little to no concern about AI's impact on their job security. The survey also revealed a significant knowledge gap, with less than 40% of respondents having received any AI-related training.
