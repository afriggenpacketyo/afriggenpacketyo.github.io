          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has declared her country is in "profound, total chaos" under President Nicolás Maduro, calling for his removal. In an NPR interview, Machado asserted that the Venezuelan people already mandated regime change in the 2024 election, which she claims Maduro rigged. She accused Maduro of operating a criminal structure and destabilizing the region, urging international efforts to cut illicit financial flows. Machado has faced government persecution and continues her campaign from hiding.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday to sign a Gaza peace plan. The summit, led by US President Donald Trump and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, aims to finalize the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal. This initial phase requires Hamas to release Israeli hostages and Israel to free Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased aid to Gaza. Future phases, addressing governance and troop withdrawal, are expected to be challenging to negotiate.</p>

          <p>China's launch of a commercial underwater data center in Hainan marks a significant stride in its bid for AI leadership. However, an opinion article suggests that US-Gulf partnerships could thwart these plans, citing the rapid data center expansion in the UAE and US. The Trump administration has facilitated multi-billion-dollar chip supply deals with the UAE, fostering a robust, US-technology-driven data ecosystem. This dynamic highlights China's capital constraints compared to the US, which is strategically investing in semiconductor companies to accelerate data center production. The article emphasizes the competitive landscape in the global data center industry.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago, upholding a ruling that the Trump administration violated constitutional amendments. This decision came as Democratic senators were barred from visiting an ICE facility in the area, raising concerns about transparency. Concurrently, National Guard troops, under the command of the Republican governor, began patrols in Memphis to support federal crime crackdowns. The article highlights the contrasting legal and political battles over federal troop deployments, with courts asserting state sovereignty against federal overreach in Illinois and Oregon.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire after sustaining serious injuries during a runaway incident in London last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses spooked by construction noise, galloping through the streets and colliding with vehicles. The incident resulted in injuries to four people and five soldiers, with two horses photographed bleeding. Major Thomas Stewart confirmed Quaker's inability to return to duties due to ongoing veterinary care, emphasizing that his retirement was for his welfare.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has forced the closure of all 21 Smithsonian museums, its research centers, and the National Zoo, effective Sunday. These institutions, which rely heavily on federal funding, exhausted their prior-year funds after 11 days. While the animals at the National Zoo will continue to receive care, their popular animal cams will be turned off. This closure underscores the widespread impact of the funding dispute, following similar shutdowns of national parks. The Smithsonian announced it would update its operating status once the federal funding situation is resolved.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched through central London, a day after a Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect. Organized by the Palestine Coalition, the demonstration proceeded from Victoria Embankment to Whitehall for a rally. While a small group of counter-protesters also gathered, police made 14 arrests for various offenses, including breaching public order conditions. Speakers at the rally described the US-brokered ceasefire as positive but "precarious," emphasizing that protests would continue until Palestinians achieve full freedom. The article notes ongoing debates over protest laws and previous large-scale demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Verijet, a private charter carrier, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, leading to the cancellation of all its flights. This move signals liquidation rather than restructuring, following a rapid expansion since 2020 and accumulating over $38.7 million in liabilities. The Vero Beach, Florida-based airline faced multiple lawsuits and its founder's sudden death in September. Verijet, once the 13th-largest operator of charter flights, owed significant amounts to jet card customers and other creditors. This article highlights the challenges faced by some airlines despite initial optimism in the travel sector for 2025.</p>

          <p>SNP members have backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum if the party secures a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney presented this as the most realistic path, citing the precedent for the 2014 referendum. This endorsement comes despite a rejected amendment that would have treated the election as a de-facto independence vote based on pro-independence parties' list ballot share. Swinney affirmed his commitment to delivering independence for Scotland, while acknowledging the significant challenge of winning a majority and potential UK government resistance.</p>

          <h2>Gen Z Drives Pushback Against 'Fast Furniture' Towards Sustainable Choices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 12:46:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Generation Z consumers are increasingly rejecting 'fast furniture'—cheap, mass-produced decor designed for short lifespans—in favor of secondhand and durable items. This shift is driven by growing awareness of furniture's massive carbon footprint, with over 95% of consumed furniture globally being discarded. Unlike fast fashion, furniture often contains mixed materials making it difficult to recycle. Young consumers are turning to platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest for sustainable options, valuing the emotional connection and investment required to refresh older pieces. The article highlights this trend as a crucial antidote to the environmental toll of disposable home decor.</p>
