          <p>The U.S. and U.K. have reached a trade agreement, but it includes a 10% baseline tariff on most goods imported to the U.S. from the U.K., signaling that tariffs are here to stay under the Trump administration. The deal allows the U.K. to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, while steel and aluminum exports will be tariff-free. Analysts interpret the agreement as indicating that a 10% minimum tariff will likely be applied to other trading partners, with potential flexibility on sectoral tariffs. The article notes that the auto sector carve-out benefits automakers assembling vehicles in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport faced a brief air traffic control outage early Friday morning, adding to a week of disruptions attributed to outdated equipment. The FAA reported a 90-second telecommunications outage affecting radar and communications at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark's airspace. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that Newark cannot handle its scheduled flight volume due to FAA staffing issues, leading to further flight cuts. Transportation officials insist the airspace remains safe, but the incidents have raised concerns about the reliability of the aging air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Organized criminal groups are increasingly targeting the U.S. supply chain, leading to a surge in cargo theft, with reported losses nearing $455 million in 2024, though experts estimate the true toll is closer to $1 billion. Strategic theft, where criminals impersonate legitimate companies to divert cargo or payments, is on the rise, representing one-third of all cargo theft. Experts say the lack of deterrents and the ease of operating from foreign countries contribute to the problem, which ultimately increases retail prices for consumers. Companies are investing in technology and security measures to combat the issue, but the sophistication of the criminals poses a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>The recent deadly flare-up between India and Pakistan is described by analysts as the most dangerous since the Kargil War of 1999, with both countries trading artillery and drone strikes. The crisis began after a tourist massacre in Indian-administered Kashmir, which India alleges is linked to Pakistan. Despite both sides expressing a desire to avoid escalation, the conflict's scale and intensity, along with a lack of clear de-escalation paths, have raised concerns. The United States' role as a crisis broker is also uncertain due to strained relations with Pakistan.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the half-ton mass of metal could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, posing a small but non-negligible risk to populated areas. The spacecraft, designed to withstand Venus' atmosphere, may survive reentry, potentially resulting in a half-ton object falling from the sky.
