          <p>The White House has labeled individuals killed in a US strike on a Venezuelan boat as "narco-terrorists," a claim disputed by some experts. The incident has heightened tensions, with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro vowing to activate millions of militiamen in response to what he calls US "imperialist policies." While the Trump administration has deployed warships to the region as part of its "war on drugs," some analysts believe a direct military intervention in Venezuela is unlikely due to potential negative consequences, such as a new migration wave.</p>

          <p>The issue of releasing Jeffrey Epstein's files has resurfaced as a major point of contention in Congress, creating a difficult situation for House leadership. A bipartisan effort led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna is pushing for a full release, using a parliamentary maneuver to potentially force a vote. This move challenges House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is attempting to manage the situation while navigating pressure from former President Trump, who has recently dismissed the issue as a "Democrat hoax." The ongoing debate highlights deep divisions and could continue to disrupt legislative proceedings.</p>

Verstappen's performance, at an average speed of over 164 mph, surprised even himself after he had struggled for pace during practice sessions.

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, has strongly urged the president to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Adams argues that Kennedy's policies on vaccines and his chaotic overhaul of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are "dangerous" and put the nation's health at risk. This call follows recent turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director and the replacement of an advisory committee with individuals holding anti-vaccine views, which has drawn criticism from both political parties and major medical associations.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the site for his presidential library and museum. A 13-person governance board, including former senior aides and political allies, has been established to oversee the project, which aims to be a center for history, learning, and civic engagement. While Biden has deep roots in Pennsylvania, Delaware was selected as the state that launched and sustained his extensive political career.

          <h2>Nigel Farage Modifies Pledge to Stop Migrant Boats Within Two Weeks</h2>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has clarified a key promise made at his party's conference, stating that he would stop small boat migrant crossings within two weeks of new legislation being passed, not within two weeks of entering government. This new law, the "Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill," would aim to quickly detain and deport migrants who arrive illegally. When pressed on the fact that passing such legislation could take months, Farage maintained that his government would act as quickly as possible. The shift in language adds a significant condition to one of his most prominent campaign pledges.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second national test of the emergency alert system this Sunday, sending a message to millions of mobile phones. The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced several technical glitches, including some users not receiving the alert and others receiving multiple messages. Officials have stated that users can opt out of the system through their phone's settings, though they are strongly encouraged to remain opted-in for safety reasons.</p>

          <p>A recent gathering of the leaders of Russia, China, and North Korea in Beijing is being interpreted as a significant demonstration of their strengthening alliance. Analysts view the meeting as a direct challenge to the post-war international order established and led by the United States. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" noted that these foremost US adversaries are openly declaring their goal to dismantle the current global system. This development occurs as the Trump administration is perceived by some critics as accommodating enemies while creating friction with traditional allies.</p>

          <p>A large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai-affiliated construction site in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 people, mostly South Korean nationals, suspected of working in the U.S. illegally. The operation, described as the largest of its kind at a single site by Homeland Security Investigations, was part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices. The raid involved multiple federal agencies and underscores the Trump administration's intensified crackdown on illegal immigration.

          <p>The Trump administration has notified Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man at the center of a complex immigration case, that he could be deported to the southern African nation of Eswatini. This is the latest development after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and then returned to the US to face human smuggling charges, which he denies. Ábrego García has no connection to Eswatini, a country that has previously received deportees from the US under a controversial agreement.

          <p>In an opinion piece, columnist Arwa Mahdawi critiques Melania Trump's recent focus on artificial intelligence, arguing that her advocacy for responsible AI growth is undermined by her husband's administration's policies. The article points out that while the first lady champions online safety and AI education, the administration has attempted to defund early childhood programs and has been linked to censorship efforts. The columnist suggests that Melania Trump's engagement with AI is less about genuine concern for children's welfare and more about aligning with powerful tech interests.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the court's methodology, stating that its decisions are not merely an "opinion poll" of the justices' personal values. Promoting her new book, Barrett argued that the court's role is to interpret what the American people have decided through the democratic process, not to impose its own beliefs. Her comments come as the court faces criticism over recent landmark decisions, including the overturning of federal abortion rights, and as it considers a request to revisit the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has presented a detailed plan to the board of PepsiCo, aimed at reaccelerating growth and improving the company's underperforming stock. The plan calls for major strategic shifts, including refranchising the bottling network of its beverage business and divesting from underperforming brands like Quaker. Elliott, which holds a $4 billion stake, argues that these changes will free up capital for reinvestment in iconic brands and restore the company's premium valuation. The proposal emphasizes long-term growth through reinvestment rather than short-term measures like share buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book is bringing to light the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese émigré best known for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document American jazz musicians and their audiences, but it was abandoned after she came under suspicion for leftist politics during the McCarthy era. Her images capture not only the rapture of the audience but also the deep wariness and pain of the musicians, who faced racism and persecution despite their cultural importance. The collection offers a poignant look at a pivotal era in American music.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the climate crisis will lead to more frequent lightning-sparked wildfires across the western United States for decades to come. A study using machine learning found that 98% of the region will face a higher risk due to either more lightning, hotter and drier fire weather, or a combination of both. Because lightning-caused fires often occur in remote areas, they tend to grow larger and produce more smoke, worsening air quality and public health crises. This trend could further strain firefighting resources, creating a recipe for more catastrophic fire seasons.</p>
