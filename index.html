The win marks Alcaraz's 23rd consecutive victory on grass, solidifying his position as the tournament favorite. He will next face American Taylor Fritz, who reached his first Wimbledon semi-final by defeating Karen Khachanov in four sets. Norrie's defeat ends British participation in the singles draws, though he is expected to return to the world's top 50.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a plan to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States, a move he stated would happen 'very soon.' However, he also suggested that pharmaceutical companies would be given a grace period of about a year to a year and a half to move their production domestically before the high tariffs take effect. This threat follows a Section 232 national security investigation into pharmaceutical imports initiated by his administration. The pharmaceutical industry has previously warned that such levies could disrupt supply chains and increase costs for patients. (not investment advice)</p>

The article explains that a key principle of portfolio management is to sell underperforming assets, not just trim successful ones.

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle company, is now offering accounts for teenagers aged 14 to 17 to hail fully driverless rides, starting in the Phoenix area. Parents can invite their teens into the program through their own Waymo accounts, allowing the minors to book rides independently. The service will feature specially-trained support agents and allows parents to track trips in real-time and receive all receipts. This expansion aims to increase ridership as Waymo continues its rollout across major U.S. cities, following a similar move by its partner, Uber, which launched teen accounts in 2023.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine, just days after his administration confirmed a pause on some arms shipments to the country. The president stated that Ukraine must be able to defend itself from Russian aggression, citing the high death toll and attacks on civilians in Ukrainian cities. The Pentagon confirmed it was acting on the president's direction to help Ukraine secure a lasting peace. Last week, the White House had halted some shipments as part of a broader review of weapons transfers and concerns over U.S. military stockpile levels.</p>

          <p>During a dinner in Washington D.C., Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formally nominated U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Netanyahu presented Trump with the nomination letter, praising him for 'forging peace' in the Middle East, a reference to the recent joint U.S.-Israeli military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities. The two leaders expressed optimism that their actions against Iran would lead to a new era of stability in the region. The nomination was made during Netanyahu's visit to discuss the Iran operation and a potential ceasefire in the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>In The Atlantic's 'Dear James' advice column, a 19-year-old reader expresses a fear of dying alone. The columnist, James Parker, validates the fear as appropriate for the age and modern times, acknowledging the terror of human finitude. He advises that despite feelings of isolation, humans are deeply interconnected and that the flip side of isolation is autonomy. Parker encourages the reader to embrace life, make their own decisions, and revel in experiences, promising that people will show up for them if they take that leap.</p>

After a nearly six-year legal process, Abell was convicted of second-degree murder, largely based on the testimony of Araujo, who had taken a plea deal. Araujo claimed Abell led the fatal beating, while Abell's defense argued she was the sole, jealous killer.</p>

          <p>The death toll from the catastrophic flash floods in central Texas has risen to at least 107, with an unknown number of people still missing four days after the disaster. The hardest-hit area is Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River surged on the July Fourth holiday, devastating communities and a summer camp. In response to criticism, the White House defended the National Weather Service's performance, stating it provided early and consistent warnings and calling the event an 'act of God.'

Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has severely restricted women's rights, including access to education and employment. The Taliban government, which does not recognize the ICC's authority, called the warrants an 'act of hostility' and an 'insult' to Muslim beliefs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed spending bill, which includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, is expected to impact the pharmaceutical industry, though some companies are more exposed than others. According to analysts, drugmakers like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences rely more heavily on Medicaid for their U.S. revenue, particularly for treatments related to cystic fibrosis and HIV. While Medicaid reimburses at lower rates than commercial insurance, the significant reduction in the program's scope could still present a 'marginal negative' for drugmakers' future revenue streams starting around 2027.

There is no credible evidence to support the assertion of Hegseth's involvement. In reality, Air India and its parent company, Tata Group, had publicly announced their own compensation packages for the victims' families, which included support for funeral costs.</p>
