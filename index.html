        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the concerning trend of "underwater" car trade-ins reaching a four-year high, where 26.6% of drivers owe more on their auto loans than their vehicles are currently worth. This significant negative equity, averaging $6,754, complicates new car purchases by forcing consumers to either pay the balance in cash or roll it into a new loan, potentially extending loan terms to 84 months. Experts advise strategies like retaining current vehicles, thoroughly understanding credit scores, and seeking pre-approvals from various lenders to navigate this financial challenge effectively. The article also recommends considering gap insurance to protect against substantial losses if a vehicle is totaled, offering practical guidance for consumers facing these significant economic pressures in the auto market.

          <p>Tens of thousands of people protested in Ankara, Turkey, ahead of a critical court ruling that could lead to the removal of Ozgur Ozel, the head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). Ozel condemned the upcoming hearing as a "judicial coup" orchestrated by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, accusing them of actively undermining democracy and justice. The demonstrations, which saw protestors chanting for Erdogan's resignation, highlight severe political tensions and ongoing concerns about the erosion of democratic institutions in Turkey, especially after the CHP's recent electoral successes. This article emphasizes the widespread public defiance against what many perceive as politically motivated legal actions.</p>

          <p>Following the tragic shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, former President Donald Trump asserted that individuals on "the left" are currently under investigation, attributing the violence to what he described as anti-conservative vitriol. This article reports on Trump's controversial remarks, noting his refusal to advocate for national unity and his instead casting "vicious and horrible" radicals on the left as the singular source of the nation's divisions. The comments underscore the intensifying political polarization and the charged rhetoric surrounding the high-profile incident, further deepening ideological divides. The ongoing investigation into the shooting suspect's motives remains a central focus, while political figures continue to react strongly to the event.</p>

          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a disease that is a leading cause of death for the beloved marsupials. Developed over a decade by researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast, this world-first vaccine aims to significantly reduce infection rates, prevent progression to clinical disease, and in some cases, even reverse existing symptoms. This initiative is crucial as traditional antibiotic treatments are often ineffective and can lead to gastrointestinal side effects that hinder koalas' ability to digest eucalyptus leaves. The approval marks a significant and optimistic step in conservation efforts to safeguard koala populations from local extinction, particularly in areas where infection rates are alarmingly high.</p>

          <p>This article introduces "Zone Zero" workouts, a concept gaining traction for its low-intensity approach where the heart rate remains below 50% of an individual's maximum. Encompassing activities such as gentle walking, casual stretching, or light household chores, these movements are designed to be almost effortless. Fitness experts suggest that while Zone Zero alone may not build significant strength or endurance, it delivers tangible health benefits, including improved blood sugar regulation, enhanced circulation, and reduced stress. This accessible form of "active rest" encourages consistent daily movement, serving as a valuable foundation for overall well-being, especially for those seeking to incorporate more activity without strenuous effort.</p>

Medical doctor and expert Dr. Tharaka provides four actionable tips, encapsulated in a special acronym, to help individuals mitigate these symptoms. A key recommendation involves deliberately scheduling "mental buffers" – short 5-10 minute breaks between tasks – to allow the mind to reset and process information, ultimately promoting improved focus and overall mental clarity.</p>

He specifically points to players like Bruno Fernandes, whose attacking instincts are ill-suited for a deeper central midfield role, and Luke Shaw, who appears uncomfortable at center-back.

          <p>This exclusive article presents Zheng Yongnian's argument for China to develop its own distinct knowledge system, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence, independent of Western influence. He articulates concerns about "intellectual colonialism," asserting that Western social science theories, rooted in Western practices and experiences, are insufficient to explain Confucian civilization, the Islamic world, and Indian society. Zheng advocates for China to fully embrace its secular civilization to establish its proper role in the international order, implicitly calling for a unique Chinese approach to AI development that is not merely an adoption of Western models. This perspective emphasizes cultural and intellectual self-reliance in technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Two men have been arrested in Utah on suspicion of placing an incendiary device under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City. The bomb, discovered on Friday, had been lit but fortunately failed to function as designed, averting a potentially catastrophic incident. Following an FBI investigation, a search warrant at a home in Magna led to the discovery of explosives, "explosive-related components," firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction. The 58-year-old and 31-year-old suspects could face charges related to weapons possession and threats of terrorism, though their motive and relationship to each other or the news organization are not yet known.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation tragically links a surge in maternal and infant deaths in Afghanistan to the abrupt closure of over 400 medical facilities, following the Trump administration's decision to cut nearly all US aid. This article shares harrowing personal accounts, such as Abdul's wife and baby dying during childbirth after their crucial local clinic became inaccessible. The US justified the aid withdrawal citing concerns about funds benefiting the Taliban, who deny these allegations. The crisis is further exacerbated by the Taliban's severe restrictions on women's higher education and healthcare training, which has led to a critical shortage of midwives and nurses, severely endangering women's access to health and their very lives.</p>

          <p>This article examines the growing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans among consumers, which offer an attractive alternative to credit cards by splitting purchases into short-term, often interest-free installments. While consumers appreciate the flexibility, traditional banks and credit card companies regard BNPL with increasing wariness. They see it as a direct challenge that reduces their transaction activity and utilization rates, which are major revenue drivers. Furthermore, financial institutions are concerned that BNPL represents a "giant black hole" in their understanding of consumer credit quality, as its widespread adoption introduces new risks to assessing overall financial health.

The governor's comments highlight the complex and polarizing nature of the investigation into the motives behind the high-profile attack, particularly given Kirk's past criticism of LGBTQ+ rights.

Experts argue that while permitless carry might deter some offenses, it is largely inadequate against grievance- and politically-driven violence.
