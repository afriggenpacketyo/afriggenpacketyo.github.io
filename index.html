          <p>A public falling out between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump has occurred after Musk criticized Trump's budget bill. Musk claimed Trump is in the Epstein files, alleging that is why they haven't been made public, while Trump threatened to cancel Musk's government contracts and said Musk was "wearing thin." Musk responded by claiming Trump couldn't have won the election without him and denying he was ever shown the bill. The dispute highlights the breakdown of a once-close alliance and raises questions about the future of Trump's legislative agenda and Musk's business interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's relationship with Elon Musk has deteriorated into a public feud, with Musk accusing Trump of ingratitude for his financial support and Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts. The conflict stems from Musk's opposition to Trump's domestic spending bill and accusations that Trump pulled the nomination of Musk's preferred candidate to lead NASA. Both figures have traded insults and accusations on social media, signaling the end of their once-close alliance. Tesla's stock price declined following Trump's threat to terminate government subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console has been officially released, offering a larger, higher-resolution screen and more processing power.

Data transfer from the original Switch is relatively simple, and the console is largely backward compatible. However, the price of the base system is $449.99, and the price may increase.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a new travel ban targeting 12 countries, a revised version of his previous policy that faced legal challenges. Experts suggest the new ban has been designed to avoid the legal issues that plagued the original ban, including accusations of religious discrimination. The new restrictions are broader in scope, with clearly defined exemptions, and target countries based on perceived security threats rather than solely on their Muslim-majority status. The ban is already facing criticism, but legal experts believe it is more likely to withstand court challenges.</p>
