          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House, a project estimated to cost $200 million. The construction will be privately funded by President Trump and other anonymous donors, with work slated to begin in September. This new facility, to be built alongside the East Wing, is designed to host large formal functions for up to 650 guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents for state dinners. The project fulfills a long-stated desire by the president to add a grand ballroom to the executive mansion.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that surpassed analyst estimates for both earnings and revenue, with sales growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion. Despite the strong performance, which was boosted by its advertising business, the company's shares fell in after-hours trading. The decline was attributed to a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the current quarter, raising investor concerns about the significant costs of its ongoing investments in artificial intelligence. Amazon's cloud unit, AWS, also saw its growth trail competitors Microsoft and Google. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase saw its shares fall after reporting second-quarter revenue of $1.5 billion, which missed analysts' expectations. While the company's adjusted earnings per share beat estimates, this was largely due to gains from investments rather than core operations. Weaker-than-expected transaction revenue and retail trading volume pointed to a slowdown following a more exuberant first quarter. The results reflect a shift in market focus from crypto speculation to broader economic issues like tariffs during the period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter financial results that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue growing 10%, its fastest pace since December 2021. The strong performance was driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, particularly the popularity of the iPhone 16 model among upgrading users. The Mac division also saw robust growth of nearly 15%, while the company's services business continued its steady expansion. However, sales for the iPad and the wearables division, which includes the Apple Watch, both experienced declines during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

This move revives his "most favored nation" policy and aims to provide immediate relief to American consumers, who often pay significantly more for prescriptions than people in other countries.

          <p>Several Republican senators have expressed support for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s potential reform of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The senators argue that the independent body, which determines which services health insurance must cover, has become ideologically motivated, citing its 2023 Health Equity Framework as an example of a departure from evidence-based science. They contend that the task force's focus on criteria like "social justice" and "gender minorities" aligns with a progressive agenda rather than its core mission. The move is framed as part of the administration's broader effort to eliminate DEI initiatives from the federal government.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato originated from an ancient hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a wild potato-like species. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's origins, but this research suggests that a crucial gene from the tomato, combined with genetics from a non-tuber-producing Chilean species, enabled the evolution of the starchy tuber we know today. By analyzing hundreds of potato genomes, the research team solved the long-standing mystery. The findings demonstrate how interbreeding between species can spark the development of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

It argues that the constant churn of news, spectacle, and sensation created a new way of living, fostering habits of novelty-seeking and skimming that mirror modern digital behaviors. Critics of the era, like Henry David Thoreau, expressed concerns about the "invasion of journalism" and its effect on the public's intellect, anxieties that have been echoed with each new technological advancement since.

          <p>CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell is set to release a new book titled "We the Women," which uncovers the stories of forgotten female pioneers in American history. The book, a "passion project" for O'Donnell, aims to shed light on figures like Mary Katharine Goddard, the printer whose name appears on the Declaration of Independence, and Emily Warren Roebling, who was instrumental in building the Brooklyn Bridge. Scheduled for release ahead of America's 250th birthday, the book celebrates the grit and courage of women who made significant contributions at times when they had few rights.</p>

          <p>A significant staffing purge at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency distributing over $12 billion annually, is jeopardizing numerous community health initiatives across the U.S. Since February, about a quarter of HRSA's workforce has been lost, hindering the agency's ability to manage grants for health centers, addiction treatment, and rural hospitals. Former agency leaders have described the cuts as a "big threat," with some funding for programs like the Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students already being halted. The reductions are part of the Trump administration's broader plan to shrink federal agencies.</p>

          <p>A renovation of the White House Rose Garden has gone viral on social media after new photos revealed that a significant portion of the lawn has been paved over with concrete to create a patio space. While the iconic rose bushes remain, the "before and after" images have sparked widespread commentary and criticism online. Many social media users have unfavorably compared the new look to a "backyard bbq sundeck" or the deck of an apartment complex pool. The project is part of a larger series of renovations at the White House under the current administration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners increasingly tap into their home equity, financial experts are cautioning against several common and costly mistakes. With high interest rates, borrowers are advised to be wary of variable-rate HELOCs if they need predictable payments, as rates could still rise. Another key mistake is borrowing more than is necessary, which can become risky if income changes or home values decline. Finally, homeowners should carefully compare closing costs and hidden fees from multiple lenders, as these can significantly impact the overall cost of a home equity loan or line of credit.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it will impose sanctions, including visa denials, on officials from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The U.S. cited the Palestinian leadership's actions to "internationalize its conflict with Israel" through international courts and their alleged continued support for terrorism. The move is seen by many as a response to a recent UN conference and the growing number of countries, including Canada and the UK, committing to recognize a Palestinian state. Palestinian leaders called the sanctions "revenge," while Israel welcomed the U.S. action.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh addressed the increasing number of emergency appeals reaching the court, particularly from the Trump administration, defending the process as a necessary response to modern presidential power. Speaking at a judicial conference, he noted that presidents from both parties increasingly use executive orders, which inevitably leads to more legal challenges requiring the court's intervention. Kavanaugh acknowledged criticism about the lack of explanation in some emergency rulings but stated the court has made internal changes to improve its process. He emphasized the importance of collegiality among the justices despite differing views on difficult issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court intensely questioned the Trump administration's legal authority to impose widespread tariffs on U.S. trading partners using an emergency powers law. The case is a major test of the president's economic agenda, challenging his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law never before used for this purpose. Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit raised concerns that the administration was claiming "unbounded authority" and that its interpretation could disrupt the entire U.S. trade framework established by Congress. The court's ultimate decision is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>In a rare public forum, several federal judges described a frightening increase in threats and harassment they have faced, often after ruling against Trump administration policies. The judges recounted receiving credible death threats, being "pizza-doxxed" in the name of a murdered judge's son, and being "swatted" by false emergency calls. They attributed the rise in hostility to inflammatory rhetoric from political leaders who attack the judiciary's integrity. The judges called for an end to personal attacks and urged leaders to respect the rule of law, warning of the damage being done to the judicial system's reputation.</p>

          <p>Tata Steel has been fined £1.5 million after a contractor, Justin Day, was crushed to death by a steel beam at its Port Talbot plant in 2019.

The judge noted that Day entered an area that had been made "live" again without his knowledge. The victim's family expressed that their lives have been "shattered" by his death and criticized the company for a lack of support following the tragedy.</p>
