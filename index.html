          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has cautioned the United States against military intervention in the ongoing conflict with Israel, threatening "irreparable damage." This statement follows escalating tensions and exchanges of missile fire between Iran and Israel, including strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. President Trump has issued a warning to Iran, demanding "unconditional surrender," while U.S. officials consider potential military actions. The conflict has led to significant casualties and displacement, prompting concerns of a broader regional war and increased scrutiny of the U.S.'s role. </p>

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is personally building an AI team for a "superintelligence" AI lab and investing heavily in AI research.

          <p>Israel has launched an emergency operation to evacuate citizens stranded abroad due to the ongoing conflict with Iran, including special flights and maritime routes. Approximately 100,000 to 150,000 Israelis were overseas when Israel launched strikes against Iran, leading to airspace closures and desperate attempts to return home. Some Israelis have resorted to unconventional routes like tugboats and taxis to reach the country.

          <p>President Trump is weighing diplomatic and military options regarding Iran, with U.S. officials signaling that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical. Despite saber-rattling rhetoric, U.S. negotiators assess Iran is in a weak position and could be forced back to the negotiating table. The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, including additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier, for defensive purposes. A major question is whether the U.S. will deploy its B-2 stealth bombers to target Iran's underground nuclear facility. </p>

Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and adding felt to sneaker soles to classify them as slippers. (not investment advice)</p>
