          <h2>Bank of Japan Considers Slower Bond-Buying Cuts Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 06:25:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its government bond-buying at a slower pace than initially planned, starting in April 2026, amid concerns about trade and economic uncertainties. Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed worries about the Japanese economy, particularly due to potential impacts from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes, noting that downside risks now outweigh upside ones for growth and prices. The BOJ will decrease debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, aiming for a monthly purchase of about 2 trillion yen by early 2027. Ueda emphasized the need for a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy, pledging to make nimble responses to stabilize the market and review the pace of bond purchase reductions if necessary.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Droughts are increasingly impacting crops, economies, and lives globally, with varying consequences depending on the type. Meteorological droughts compare current precipitation to regional averages, while agricultural droughts affect farming due to parched grounds and water scarcity. Hydrological droughts occur when water levels in rivers and lakes drop below minimum levels, often following prolonged meteorological droughts. Socioeconomic droughts affect society and the economy, leading to increased costs or scarcity of goods and electricity, and ecological droughts destabilize ecosystems, causing crop failures and tree death, emphasizing the need for climate change mitigation and efficient water use.</p>

          <p>Robert Davis Forney of Duluth, Georgia, has been charged with making violent threats against Senators Ted Cruz and Deb Fischer, including threats of sexual violence against the senators and Cruz's family. The indictment follows growing concerns about threats targeting elected officials, highlighting the Justice Department's "Operation Take Back America" initiative to combat violent crime. U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg condemned the threats as undermining democracy, emphasizing that political disagreements never justify vile attacks against national leaders. If convicted, Forney faces federal prison time, with the FBI and United States Capitol Police investigating the case.</p>

He predicted that Israel would not slow down its attacks on Iran and emphasized his commitment to ensuring the safety of Americans in the region.

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed the world’s first 6G-powered electronic warfare system, which can deliver overwhelming advantages against modern military radars. Leveraging a next-generation signal processing mechanism, this system can intercept enemy signals and generate over 3,600 false targets to confuse enemy pilots at high frequencies. The weapon can also perform as a powerful communication device, receiving or transmitting a huge amount of battlefield data simultaneously to more than 300 cooperative platforms via optic fibers. This marks a major leap in 6G military applications, achieving simultaneous same-frequency full-duplex communication and jamming capabilities.</p>

          <p>Senior visual effects supervisor Jason Smith discusses the Balrog depiction in the season two finale of "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power." He said the show's team wanted the Balrog to have been hanging on his bedroom wall. The depiction was inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's description of the Balrog as a being of "shadow and flame.” The Balrog's design aimed to evoke emotion and maintain realism, combining milky blacks and crimson hues to create a nightmarish yet captivating image.</p>

          <p>As college graduates enter the job market, concerns about employment and salary prospects are growing, with students increasingly weighing these factors against the high costs of higher education. Surveys indicate that computer science and engineering majors tend to have the highest early-career median incomes, while education degrees often have the lowest pay. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates is at its highest since 2021, adding to the stress and discouragement of entering the workforce. Despite these challenges, many graduates emphasize the importance of a college education for critical thinking and exposure to diverse perspectives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's promise of aggressive action against illegal immigration, historical evidence suggests that mass deportations are ineffective and economically detrimental. Studies show that removing undocumented immigrants negatively impacts the economy, leading to job losses and reduced GDP. Trump's pursuit of mass deportations is primarily driven by terror, influenced by advisors like Stephen Miller, who advocate for a scorched-earth approach. Historical precedents, such as Operation Wetback, demonstrate that mass deportations fail to stop illegal immigration and foster mistrust, while also emboldening employers to exploit workers.</p>

          <p>Santa Monica community gardeners are protesting a proposed 200% fee increase for garden plots, which could force some residents to vacate their spaces. The city aims to generate $30,000 in revenue to address a $60-million budget shortfall, but gardeners argue the increase threatens accessibility for residents and could turn the gardens into a "rich person's playground." Community members are voicing opposition, emphasizing the value of the gardens for residents, especially seniors and those in subsidized housing.

          <p>While school cellphone bans aim to improve student focus, addressing the youth mental health crisis requires considering deeper factors like family disintegration, declining religious affiliation, and a bleak worldview. Family instability, marked by increasing births outside marriage, can heighten depression risks in adolescents. The decline in religious involvement deprives young people of purpose and community, while a pervasive, negative view of the world contributes to anxiety and depression. Overcoming these challenges requires fostering purpose, independence, and resilience, rather than shielding children from normal stresses and disappointments.</p>

While other advisors remain influential, the decimation of the top ranks of the Guards, which Khamenei has relied on for internal security and regional strategy, marks a dangerous moment in the Islamic Republic's history.
