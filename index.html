          <p>According to Consumers’ Research Executive Director Will Hild, companies are rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies to circumvent efforts by the Trump administration to eliminate them. Hild suggests that companies are shifting from DEI departments to "departments of belonging" or "departments of inclusivity" to avoid negative associations. He argues that these rebranded efforts are the same "toxic nonsense" under a new guise, driven by individuals desperate to maintain their positions. Hild also highlights concerns about "woke" hospitals, including net-zero pledges, DEI quotas, and transgender surgeries being forced onto children.</p>

The decision comes amid a soaring death toll and widespread outcry over near-famine conditions in the Palestinian territory. While some aid trucks have been allowed to cross the border, the UN's World Food Program emphasizes that this is insufficient to address the vast need, with thousands of trucks remaining lined up at the border.

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world’s largest electric car battery maker, saw its shares surge in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were largely excluded due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China. CATL was labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, and U.S. lawmakers urged Wall Street banks to withdraw from the listing. The company cited geopolitical tensions as a risk to its business and changed the share sale to a Reg S offering, preventing sales to onshore U.S. investors.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the retailer does not intend to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, partnerships with suppliers, and productivity improvements. He noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on China. This pricing strategy contrasts with Walmart, which has indicated it will need to raise prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot reported disappointing first-quarter earnings but beat sales estimates, maintaining its full-year sales forecast.</p>

This comes as the EU and UK announced new sanctions against Russia, and Trump indicated he would not support new sanctions. Russia has called for "compromises" from Ukraine, while Kyiv rejects any withdrawal of its forces from its territory forcibly annexed by Russia.</p>

          <p>Eric Reinhart argues that AI-generated art, while appearing innovative, disrupts the essence of art, which lies in the transmission of human experience and emotion. He posits that art fosters community and strengthens the social fabric necessary for democratic societies. AI art, lacking the human element of struggle and interiority, offers a spectral mimicry that alienates individuals from their own souls and from each other. Reinhart warns that this process of thingification, driven by tech billionaires, transforms creative participants into passive consumers, undermining genuine human connection and democratic values.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the US should revise its approach to the opioid crisis to secure China's full support in stemming the flow of fentanyl precursors. While the trade truce between the two nations provides an opportunity, fundamental economic and tech rivalries persist. A more realistic goal involves adjusting narratives to reach attainable objectives, given the US commitment to "decoupling" from China on strategic necessities. The US hopes Beijing will continue its cooperation in stemming the flow of chemicals for fentanyl production, but China may be leveraging this cooperation in broader trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Despite tech billionaires like Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg frequently citing Iain M. Banks' Culture series as inspiration, the author was a socialist and critic of the super-rich, and the series' ideals sharply contrast Silicon Valley's ethos. The Culture series presents a post-scarcity galactic society valuing empathy, pluralism, and social cooperation, with no economic inequality or laws, and with powerful AIs managing governance. The article argues that these billionaires may be drawn to the series' technological prowess, missing the point that the Culture's strength is a metaphor for its goodness, not the other way around.</p>

Wall Street is watching the bond market closely, with concerns that America’s fiscal situation could lead to higher borrowing costs and an erosion in the value of U.S. assets.
