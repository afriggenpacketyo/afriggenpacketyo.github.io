            <p>An inside look at President Trump's tariff team reveals shifting power dynamics between key advisors, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and trade advisor Pete Navarro. Bessent, who expressed reservations about tariffs, reportedly played a crucial role in swaying Trump to pause reciprocal tariffs for most countries while raising levies on China. This decision followed concerns about projected price increases for American products, highlighting the internal debates and influences shaping the administration's trade policies. Bessent's approach involved emphasizing the market's negative reaction to the initial tariff plans.</p>

            <p>American technology companies are struggling with uncertainty regarding exemptions from President Trump's trade war with China. The White House initially signaled relief for tech products, exempting them from a tariff hike, but later tempered expectations, causing market turbulence. The administration is considering national security investigations into computer chip imports, potentially leading to new tariffs. Apple CEO Tim Cook has committed to investing in U.S. manufacturing, and Nvidia announced plans to manufacture chips in the United States, signaling a shift in response to the administration's policies.</p>

            <p>Families of victims of the Manchester Arena bombing expressed "absolute disbelief" that bomber Hashem Abedi was able to attack prison officers in HMP Frankland. Abedi, serving a life sentence, attacked three officers with improvised blades and hot cooking oil. The families urged the government to ensure Abedi cannot hurt anyone else and called for him to be permanently in solitary confinement. Following the incident, inmates of separation centers have been barred from using kitchens.</p>

The lawsuit argues that Trump has illegally usurped Congress' power by claiming trade deficits constitute an emergency.

The suit seeks to declare the tariffs illegal and reaffirm the principle of no taxation without representation. (not investment advice)</p>
