        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court extended its injunction, temporarily preventing the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court found that the government did not provide adequate time or information for the migrants to contest their removals, particularly those held in Texas. The case was remanded to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the due process rights necessary in these cases. The court emphasized the importance of balancing national security interests with constitutional rights, while Justices Alito and Thomas dissented from the majority opinion.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin angler fishing in Lake Michigan discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that had been submerged for over a century. The tugboat, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes and was used for moving lumber and railway cars before being scuttled in 1923. The ship had been buried in the sand for decades before recent storms exposed it, making it visible in nine feet of water. Historians are now racing to document the shipwreck before invasive quagga mussels cause further damage, highlighting the importance of preserving these historical artifacts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to release audio recordings of President Biden's 2023 interview with the special counsel investigating his handling of classified information. Republicans have been demanding the release of the audio, believing it may reveal a decline in Biden's mental acuity, while the Biden administration previously asserted executive privilege over the recordings, arguing that their release could hinder future witness cooperation. The decision to release the audio was prompted by a court deadline in a lawsuit over the recordings, adding another layer to the ongoing scrutiny of Biden's cognitive abilities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice charged Maria Del Rosario Navarro-Sanchez, a Mexican cartel member, for providing material support to the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), marking the first use of a new terrorism designation.

She is also accused of trafficking firearms and humans, smuggling bulk cash, and trafficking drugs on behalf of the cartel. This action underscores the U.S. government's increased efforts to crack down on unlawful immigration practices and dismantle the smuggling of illicit drugs and firearms.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed tax bill touted by the White House as delivering permanent tax cuts and bigger paychecks is projected to disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering more modest gains to lower-income Americans. Households with over $1 million in annual income would see a 4.3% increase in after-tax earnings, while the lowest-earning 20% would receive a 0.6% boost, averaging $90 annually. The bill's fate is uncertain after some Republican members of the House Budget Committee voted against it, citing insufficient federal spending cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Georgia's "heartbeat law" restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, generally around six weeks into pregnancy.

Putin is expected to insist on occupying all four of the eastern provinces of the Donbas, perpetual recognition of Russian ownership of Crimea, a pro-Russian government in Kyiv, and a demilitarized Ukraine. Despite President Trump's promises of a swift end to the war, there is little sign of an end to fighting.</p>

The research was one of the last studies produced by some of the agency's injury prevention experts before they were eliminated by layoffs this year.
