          <p>As Gulf states promise substantial investments in the U.S. under President Trump, falling oil prices pose a challenge to their financial commitments. Despite diversification efforts, these nations remain heavily reliant on oil revenues, with Saudi Arabia needing oil prices around $91 a barrel to balance its budget. Analysts suggest that while the UAE and Qatar can manage, Saudi Arabia may face pressure on domestic reforms and international pledges, potentially leading to cuts in ambitious projects like Neom. The article indicates that Gulf states may need to reallocate existing investments or borrow to meet their financial obligations.</p>

          <p>Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts to broker a lasting peace in Ukraine have been unsuccessful. Despite agreements like the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, violations have been frequent, particularly by Russia. A recent proposal for ceasefire negotiations in Istanbul was met with skepticism, and European leaders set a deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day truce.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is facing increasing polarization, particularly concerning the far-right AfD party, which the domestic intelligence service has classified as "confirmed right-wing extremist." The AfD has challenged this classification in court, leading to a suspension of the statement during proceedings. The article discusses the debate over whether to ban the AfD, with some arguing it would deepen social division, while others insist enemies of democracy should not be allowed to undermine it. The media's role in reporting on the AfD is also under scrutiny, with calls for journalists to clarify that the AfD is not a normal party within the democratic spectrum.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies back into Gaza, but leading aid groups object to the idea. The plan involves a new aid distribution zone run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, but major aid organizations are refusing to cooperate. These groups cite concerns that the plan contravenes humanitarian principles by denying aid to some and reinforcing control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic. The aid groups also express concerns that the plan would disrupt the existing U.N.-led aid system and advance Israeli plans to displace Palestinians.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, mediated by the U.S., was shaken by overnight fighting in disputed Kashmir.

          <p>Prince Harry's recent plea to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, potentially undermining the monarchy's image of unity. Harry's comments, made after a legal defeat over his security arrangements in Britain, have drawn attention back to the rift that began in 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles can heal this division, it could negatively impact his reign and undermine his messages of tolerance and inclusiveness.</p>

They refute accusations of assaulting law enforcement officers and assert that ICE officers failed to de-escalate the situation. While objecting to ICE detentions, the lawmakers acknowledge seeing evidence that inmates were well-treated inside the facility.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and European officials are at odds over food safety standards, with the U.S. pushing for Europe to accept more American farm products like hormone-raised beef and acid-washed chicken. European officials, however, insist that their food, health, and safety standards are non-negotiable, citing concerns over health risks and a desire to protect local farming traditions. This disagreement highlights a fundamental difference in approach, with Europe prioritizing smaller family farms and strict regulations, while the U.S. favors larger agricultural businesses and fewer restrictions.</p>
