The incident has fueled speculation about her future and debates within the Labour party over fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to gather enough votes to pass President Trump's signature domestic policy legislation ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article from the LA Times makes the case that he is the greatest pitcher in Dodgers history, surpassing even Sandy Koufax. The author contends that while Koufax had a period of unparalleled dominance, Kershaw's longevity and sustained excellence over 18 seasons give him the edge. The piece acknowledges Kershaw's postseason struggles but argues his overall body of work, including more wins and strikeouts, establishes a legacy of enduring greatness unmatched in the franchise's lore.</p>

Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism.

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska is publicly backing President Trump's sweeping spending bill, urging fellow party members to vote for its passage. While acknowledging concerns over changes to Medicaid made by the Senate, Bacon argued that voting against the bill would effectively mean a significant tax increase for middle-class families. He defended the Medicaid provisions as primarily focused on implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults. His comments come as House leadership struggles to secure votes from both moderate and conservative factions of the party.</p>

          <p>A piece of a wing flap from a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737 was found in the driveway of a home in Raleigh, North Carolina. The part came off Delta Flight 3247 from Atlanta, which landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Tuesday night with 109 passengers and six crew members. The missing part was discovered and reported the following morning. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the part belonged to the aircraft and has launched an investigation into the incident, while Delta is cooperating fully with retrieval efforts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration executive order that suspended the ability of migrants who cross the southern border to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the White House cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The judge granted a nationwide injunction but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal. Immigrant rights advocates praised the ruling as a critical defense of established asylum law.</p>

Authorities have closed roads and issued emergency alerts, while at least four people have been hospitalized for respiratory issues due to the thick smoke.

          <p>In a significant escalation of his public criticism, President Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign immediately. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has repeatedly attacked him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate the economy. The demand was made on social media, where Trump posted "'Too Late' should resign immediately!!!". While the president's legal authority to remove the Fed chair is questionable, the call represents a direct challenge to the central bank's traditional independence.</p>

          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services has found that investigations into historical child grooming cases were significantly delayed by Manchester City Council's excessive redaction of evidence. The watchdog noted that some documents provided to police had pages with only a few words visible, making them impossible to assess. Manchester City Council defended its actions, citing complex legal rules around data sharing. A new, more efficient protocol for sharing unredacted information between the police and the council has since been established.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms could elevate breast cancer risk. The research found that for women under 55 with a uterus, combination therapy using estrogen plus progestin is associated with an increased risk. Conversely, for women without a uterus who can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce the risk. This research refines previous understandings and highlights the importance of tailoring hormone therapy based on individual health factors.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, has pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty. Kohberger admitted in court to killing Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin in their off-campus home. In exchange for his guilty plea on four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, he will receive life in prison without parole and waives his right to appeal.

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, the lead prosecutor detailed the key evidence that led to his arrest for the Idaho student murders. A crucial breakthrough came from DNA on a knife sheath left at the scene, which was matched to Kohberger through a Q-tip secretly retrieved from his family's trash. The summary also revealed that Kohberger's car was meticulously cleaned and his phone data placed him near the crime scene multiple times before the attack. This evidence provides insight into the investigation, though a motive for the killings remains unknown.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that President Donald Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from 36% in 2020. This article analyzes the dramatic rightward shift among this key demographic, which experts attribute to several factors. Political analysts suggest a growing populist sentiment, disillusionment with the Democratic Party's economic and immigration policies, and a desire by some to distance themselves from anti-immigrant rhetoric. The findings challenge long-held assumptions and signal a complex, evolving electorate that both parties have struggled to understand.</p>
