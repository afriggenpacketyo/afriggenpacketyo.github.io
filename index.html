Despite new tariffs on goods from Vietnam, where it sources 90% of its products, the company successfully raised prices without a drop in consumer demand. On also improved its gross margin guidance, signaling strong confidence in its premium market position. The brand's performance, particularly its 50% sales growth in China, highlights its continued expansion and market share gains from competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A seventh individual, Gregory Wright, has been arrested in connection with a widely publicized assault in downtown Cincinnati that injured six people in late July. Wright faces charges of aggravated riot and assault for allegedly ripping a necklace from a victim during the attack, which was captured in a viral video. This arrest follows the grand jury indictment of six other defendants on multiple assault and rioting charges. The incident has heightened local concerns about public safety and drawn national attention.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.7% in July compared to the previous year, a slightly slower pace than the 2.8% anticipated by economists. On a monthly basis, the index rose by 0.2%, driven largely by shelter costs, while energy prices declined. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, saw a 3.1% annual increase. The report indicates that President Trump's tariffs have had a mostly modest impact so far, though prices for some tariff-sensitive goods like household furnishings have risen.

          <p>The United States has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group in Pakistan, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Washington holds the group responsible for numerous deadly attacks, including a recent train hijacking that killed 31 people. Pakistan welcomed the designation, which tightens scrutiny on the group's supporters and coincides with a visit from Pakistan's army chief. The move also comes shortly after a US-Pakistan trade agreement that could involve American firms in developing oil reserves in the resource-rich Balochistan province, an area where the BLA has opposed foreign involvement.</p>

          <p>Iran is reacting with mixed signals to a new US-brokered peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which includes plans for a transit corridor named the "Trump Route." The corridor, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, grants the US development and usage rights, posing a strategic challenge to Iran's regional influence and energy trade. While a top advisor to the Supreme Leader vowed to block the corridor, Iran's president has taken a more moderate stance.

          <p>This article outlines a financial strategy that could allow a retired couple to generate $100,000 in annual income without paying federal income taxes. The key is to structure income from a mix of sources, including Social Security benefits, qualified dividends, and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates or not at all below certain income thresholds. By carefully managing withdrawals from retirement accounts and utilizing the standard deduction, a couple's taxable income can be reduced to a level where the 0% capital gains rate applies. The strategy has caveats, including state taxes and future Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kari Lake, the new head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, is actively trying to deport foreign journalists who worked for Voice of America (VOA) on J-1 visas. Since her appointment, Lake has decimated the agency, ending most broadcasts and placing staff on leave, while publicly labeling the VOA journalists as national security threats. Her actions have forced dozens of reporters, recruited by the U.S. to counter foreign propaganda, to either leave the country or seek asylum to avoid returning to nations where they may face persecution. Critics argue this dismantles a key instrument of U.S. soft power.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te is facing a significant drop in public support, with three recent polls showing his approval ratings have fallen to their lowest point since he took office. Surveys from the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation, TVBS, and My Formosa all place his administration's approval in the low 30s, with disapproval ratings in the mid-50s. This decline in popularity, even in his political stronghold of Tainan, signals potential difficulties for his ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the upcoming local elections and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace FC has strongly criticized UEFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after losing its appeal against being demoted from the Europa League to the less prestigious Conference League. The club, which qualified for the Europa League by winning the FA Cup, was penalized by UEFA for breaching multi-club ownership rules related to former stakeholder John Textor's ownership of Lyon. In a statement, Palace claimed "sporting merit is rendered meaningless" and that it was "almost impossible to receive a fair hearing," suggesting that rules are applied unevenly to benefit certain powerful clubs.</p>

          <p>Journalists, politicians, and activists protested in Tirana, Albania, after police forcibly shut down the private news broadcaster News 24. On Saturday, police evicted staff from their headquarters, which are located in a state-owned complex, citing a court ruling to return the property to the state for use as a defense industry hub. The station's owner, Focus Media Group, and journalism associations condemned the move as an arbitrary "blow to freedom of expression" carried out without proper notice. The government's State Attorney's Office defended the action, stating the broadcaster's lease had expired in 2022 and they had failed to vacate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising temperatures, animal welfare charities like the RSPCA are providing guidance on how to protect pets from the heat. The primary advice is to avoid walking dogs during the hottest parts of the day, opting for early morning or late evening instead. Owners can check if pavement is too hot by placing their hand on it for five seconds. Signs of heatstroke in dogs include excessive panting, confusion, and collapse, which require immediate cooling and veterinary attention. Other tips include providing ample shade and water, using damp towels for cooling, and never leaving pets in vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, delaying the implementation of significantly higher tariffs for another 90 days until November 10. The move keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%, avoiding a potential escalation to triple-digit rates. The White House stated the extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what it terms unfair practices. Despite the pause, trade flows between the two economic giants have already been significantly impacted this year, with U.S. imports from China showing a substantial decline.

          <p>An Israeli strike in Gaza City killed five Al Jazeera journalists, including prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, who had been extensively covering the war. The attack, which targeted a tent used by journalists, has drawn strong international condemnation. Israel alleged that Sharif was a Hamas operative but has produced little evidence, a claim rejected by Al Jazeera and media rights groups. The Committee for the Protection of Journalists stated that even if he had worked for Hamas media, it would not make him a legitimate military target. This event brings the number of journalists killed in the conflict to nearly 200.</p>
