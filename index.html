        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have finalized a $96 billion agreement with Qatar Airways for up to 210 aircraft, including 787 Dreamliners and 777X planes, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and 787 order. The White House stated that this deal is expected to support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million domestic jobs throughout the production and delivery phases. The agreement could significantly boost Boeing's financial standing, which has faced challenges in recent years due to safety concerns, manufacturing defects, and trade disruptions. This deal would nearly double Qatar Airways' existing fleet and could also bring more attention to the controversial offer from Qatar to gift the U.S. a luxury 747 jet for use as the new Air Force One.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old Venezuelan toddler, Maikelys Antonella Espinoza, has been reunited with her mother in Venezuela after being held in U.S. government custody following her parents' deportation. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores greeted the toddler upon her return, which followed accusations from Venezuelan officials that the Trump administration had kidnapped the child. The Department of Homeland Security had labeled the parents as members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua, allegations the mother denies. The mother was deported two weeks prior without her daughter, after being separated from her partner and daughter when they entered the U.S. last year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has implemented new tariffs on shipments from China and Hong Kong valued under $800, potentially increasing costs for American consumers. This action closes a loophole that previously allowed tariff-free entry for inexpensive Chinese goods, impacting companies like Shein and Temu that rely on direct-to-consumer shipping. The tariffs are disrupting global trade, leading to decreased orders in China's garment industry and prompting some manufacturers to relocate to countries with lower export duties. While the United States and China have agreed to a temporary reduction in tariffs, the long-term effects on trade and consumer prices remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed Gulf leaders, pressing Iran to halt its nuclear program and cease supporting proxy groups in the region, emphasizing the need for a deal to resolve nuclear tensions. Trump's call to end support for groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis comes as these groups face setbacks in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Energy Secretary Chris Wright anticipates a deal with Iran by the end of the year, suggesting that Iran could benefit from trade and engagement with the world if it abandons its nuclear ambitions. Trump also met with Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, urging him to normalize ties with Israel and lift sanctions on Syria.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working to remove fluoride supplements for children from the market due to potential health risks, despite existing evidence supporting fluoride's benefits in preventing cavities. This decision aligns with a growing trend of states restricting fluoride use in public water supplies. The FDA cites concerns such as alterations to the gut microbiome and potential links between high fluoride exposure and lower I.Q., though these concerns are debated within the scientific community. Dentists often prescribe fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water or those at high risk of developing cavities.</p>

          <p>The government of England and Wales is implementing a plan to release over a thousand inmates early in an effort to alleviate severe overcrowding in prisons. Offenders serving sentences between one and four years who have been recalled to prison for breaching their licenses will be released after 28 days, with exceptions for those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that while a £4.7 billion investment will fund new prisons, it is not a sufficient solution to the crisis.

          <p>A new social media trend called the “Chromebook challenge” is causing damage and disruption in schools across the United States, as students deliberately short-circuit their school-issued laptops. The challenge involves inserting objects like push pins and staples into the laptops' ports, causing them to spark and smoke, with videos of the incidents shared on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This trend has resulted in damaged property, school evacuations, and students facing suspensions, fines, and even criminal charges.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a freeze on enrollment in full-scope Medi-Cal for undocumented adult immigrants, set to take effect no sooner than January 1, 2026, and would apply to new applicants over age 19. The document also notes that the Golden State governor is proposing a $100 per month premium for Medi-Cal enrollees 19 and up with "unsatisfactory immigration status," which "refers to people whose immigration status makes them ineligible for federally funded Medicaid, including people with lawful status and the undocumented" — this would take effect Jan. 1, 2027, under the proposal. The proposed changes are attributed to economic challenges caused by Trump's tariffs and higher-than-expected healthcare utilization, aiming to ensure the fiscal stability and long-term viability of Medi-Cal.</p>

          <p>Investing $250,000 in an annuity could yield monthly payments ranging from $1,200 to over $2,600, depending on factors like age, gender, and contract structure. For example, a 60-year-old man could expect around $1,476 per month, while a 70-year-old man might receive $1,826. Joint life annuities, which continue payments as long as either spouse is alive, typically offer lower monthly income. It is important to shop around for the best rates, consider a laddering strategy, assess your health, and understand tax implications to maximize your annuity investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Virginia has ordered the immediate release of Georgetown academic Badar Khan Suri from ICE detention, stating that his continued detention would have a chilling effect on protected speech. Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, was detained for two months due to his pro-Palestinian activism and allegations that his father-in-law was an adviser to Hamas officials over a decade ago. The judge ruled that the government did not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims, prohibiting federal officials from deporting him. The Secretary of State had previously determined that Khan Suri's presence in the U.S. would have serious foreign policy consequences.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a bill that would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new tax reductions, potentially impacting millions of Americans. The bill includes measures such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, lowering taxes for senior citizens, and increasing the standard deduction for all taxpayers. A new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older, increased standard deductions, and an extension of the Child Tax Credit are among the proposed changes. Democrats have opposed the bill due to cuts to Medicaid and food stamps and the expiration dates on some tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, who is charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, has requested a judge to dismiss some of the charges against him, arguing that they violate his Second Amendment rights. Routh's lawyers claim that prohibiting him from owning a firearm due to prior felony convictions is unconstitutional. Prosecutors maintain that the statute prohibiting felons from possessing firearms is still valid. Routh also faces charges of attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate, with his trial set to begin in September.</p>
