          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, defying analyst expectations of a slight decline. Housing inventory reached its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease upward pressure on prices, although the median price still saw a minor annual increase. The market continues to see its strongest activity at the higher end, with a notable rise in transactions from investors and all-cash buyers, suggesting a potential inflection point for the housing sector.

          <p>A New York appellate court has vacated the massive financial penalty against former President Trump and his company in the civil fraud case, deeming the fine "excessive" under the Eighth Amendment. While the court was divided on the case's merits, the ruling eliminates the disgorgement of approximately $527 million. The decision can be appealed by the New York Attorney General, who originally brought the case alleging fraudulent inflation of asset values to secure better loan terms.</p>

Despite the record number of applications, the government is processing cases more quickly, reducing the overall backlog of initial decisions to 71,000 cases. The number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has seen a slight rise but remains significantly below the 2023 peak, as the Labour government aims to clear the backlog and end hotel use.</p>

          <p>The UK's third-largest steelworks, Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), has been placed under government control following a compulsory winding-up order from insolvency courts. The company, part of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire, was deemed "hopelessly insolvent," creating an uncertain future for its nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield. The government will cover wages and costs while a new buyer is sought for the nationally important steel company.</p>

          <p>New details from the recent EU-US trade agreement reveal a closer alignment on technology security, particularly concerning China. As part of the deal, the European Union has agreed to adopt U.S. security standards to prevent "technology leakage to destinations of concern," a clear reference to China. The EU will purchase $40 billion in AI chips from the U.S. and has committed to ensuring these advanced semiconductors do not end up in what Washington considers "the wrong hands."</p>

          <p>Ecuador's interior ministry has reported a staggering 40.36% rise in homicides during the first seven months of 2025 compared to the same period last year. A total of 5,268 killings were registered, marking the most violent seven-month period in the last decade, with victims predominantly young men between 25 and 34. The surge in violence persists despite President Daniel Noboa's efforts to combat gang activity, which the government blames on turf wars over drug trafficking routes.</p>

          <p>Police divers in Italy have conducted their annual cleaning of the "Christ of the Abyss," a famous underwater bronze statue located off the coast of Portofino. Using pressurized water hoses, the team carefully removed a year's worth of accumulated crustaceans and bacteria from the 2.5-meter tall monument. The statue was placed on the seabed in 1954 as a memorial for those who have died at sea and has become one of the most popular diving spots in the Mediterranean.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly purged a veteran CIA officer who was one of the agency's most senior analysts on Russia and Eurasia. With over 20 years of experience, she played a key role in overseeing the 2016 intelligence report that detailed Russian interference in the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. Her removal is seen as part of a broader pattern of targeting officials perceived as disloyal to the president, raising concerns about the politicization of intelligence agencies.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted in 1996 for murdering their parents, are scheduled for individual parole hearings this week after more than three decades in prison. Their life sentences without parole were recently reduced, making them eligible under California's youthful offender law as they were 21 and 18 at the time of the crime. The brothers have maintained they acted in self-defense after years of severe abuse, a claim bolstered by new evidence that led to their resentencing.</p>
