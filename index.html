        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany has resumed deporting convicted Afghan criminals, a move the government calls a "policy shift" to fulfill its repatriation promises. This action is highly controversial due to the dire humanitarian situation and human rights abuses under the Taliban regime, which Germany does not officially recognize. The deportations, facilitated by Qatar, have raised concerns among peace researchers about Germany's international credibility and the potential for inadvertently legitimizing the Taliban, even as officials insist diplomatic recognition is not being considered.</p>

          <p>The European Union is bracing for potential US tariffs as negotiations for a new trade agreement approach a critical deadline with no guaranteed deal. While a baseline tariff of 15% on EU imports is being discussed, which would be less severe than previously threatened rates, the final decision remains with President Trump. In response to the uncertainty, the EU is preparing retaliatory measures, including a potential €93 billion list of targeted goods and the deployment of its "Anti-Coercion Instrument" to restrict US market access.

          <p>As the Department of Justice prepares to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell to seek more information about Jeffrey Epstein's network, past government assessments cast doubt on her credibility. A 2022 sentencing memorandum from federal prosecutors described Maxwell as having engaged in a "significant pattern of dishonest conduct" and failing to accept responsibility for her "monstrous" crimes. This context is crucial as Maxwell, who is currently appealing her 20-year sentence, has vowed to testify truthfully about others involved in Epstein's sex trafficking operation.</p>

          <p>The UK's automotive industry experienced its worst first half of the year for vehicle production since 1953, excluding the COVID-19 shutdown period. Data from the SMMT shows car output fell by 7.3%, while van production plummeted by 45%, with uncertainty over US tariffs and plant closures cited as key factors. While a new US-UK tariff deal and government EV grants offer some hope, industry leaders express concern and believe new manufacturers are needed to meet long-term production targets.

          <p>Facing its steepest sales decline in a decade, Tesla has announced plans to produce a more affordable car model and seek approval for its self-driving software in Europe this year. The company's profits have shrunk as it contends with reduced US government subsidies, increased competition from Chinese automakers, and brand damage from CEO Elon Musk's political activities. In an investor call, Musk emphasized that achieving full autonomy for its vehicles is the key to unlocking the company's future value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is showcasing the work of Nigerian artist John Madu, who blends Vincent van Gogh's iconic style with modern Lagos-inspired themes. Madu, a self-taught artist like Van Gogh, created ten large paintings that reimagine the Dutch master's motifs, such as placing a Black figure in a Parisian scene Van Gogh painted. The artist identifies as a "global citizen" and sees his work as a tribute to Van Gogh, whose use of color and expressive style influenced him from a young age.</p>

          <p>In a little-known example of industrial overcapacity, China is struggling with a surplus of waste-to-energy incinerators and an insufficient supply of municipal solid waste to burn. Despite a 10% increase in waste generation since 2019, incineration capacity has more than doubled, leaving an estimated 40% of the capacity idle. Experts attribute the slowdown in waste supply growth to factors like the economic downturn and slowing urbanization, creating a significant utilization problem for the optimistically planned sector.</p>

In recent years, however, Nepal has drawn closer to Beijing due to significant Chinese investment in its infrastructure, from roads to hydropower plants.</p>

The semi-professional cyclist said the most difficult part was not the physical exertion but the logistics and the time away from his family.</p>

Of 330 individuals interviewed, over half had been in the U.S. for at least 10 years, and nearly a third had U.S.-born children. These findings challenge the notion that those arrested are recent arrivals, highlighting instead that they are often deeply integrated members of the community with strong family and economic ties.</p>
