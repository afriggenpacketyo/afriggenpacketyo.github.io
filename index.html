          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has designated the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, citing incompatibility with the country's free democratic order. The decision, based on a comprehensive review, has sparked controversy, with some US officials like Marco Rubio criticizing it as "tyranny in disguise." The German Foreign Office defended the move, emphasizing the lessons learned from history regarding right-wing extremism. The AfD, which came second in recent federal elections, denounced the classification as politically motivated, while acting Interior Minister Nancy Faeser asserted the agency's decision was unbiased and based on factual evidence, and this article goes into the circumstances surrounding the decision and the debate it has caused. Relevant context: The AfD's rise in popularity has been accompanied by scandals and controversial rhetoric, including embracing the term "remigration."</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and other Trump administration officials were reportedly using a modified version of the Signal app for communication, despite previous concerns about the app's security. A photo taken during a Cabinet meeting revealed Waltz using an app that appeared to be a "fork" of Signal from TeleMessage, a company that archives messages. While the White House maintains that Signal is an approved app, the use of a modified version raises privacy concerns, as Signal's spokesperson stated they cannot guarantee the privacy or security of unofficial versions. Relevant context: This article comes after a controversy where Waltz inadvertently included a journalist in a thread discussing military strikes.</p>

          <p>American consumers are expected to experience higher prices on small shipments from China as a key loophole on imported goods closes. The de minimis provision, which allowed shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been eliminated for goods from China and Hong Kong.

          <p>Prince Harry stated that he would love to reconcile with his family in Britain during an emotional BBC interview in which he said he was "devastated" at losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK. He also said that his father, King Charles, "won't speak to me because of this security stuff". The article follows Friday's court ruling, with the prince saying: "I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point." </p>
