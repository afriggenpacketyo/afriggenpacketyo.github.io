Chari focuses on the female body, challenging societal perceptions and treatment of women in India through various mediums, addressing the realities and experiences of women, despite facing institutional rejection, her work resonates strongly with Indian women.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing was higher than anticipated in April, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, a ¬£1 billion increase from the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics. This figure marks the fourth-highest April borrowing since 1993, despite a ¬£5 billion rise in tax receipts attributed to increased National Insurance contributions. The rise in government expenditure, driven by pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs, contributed to the higher borrowing. While the borrowing for the financial year ending in March was revised down to ¬£148.3 billion, it still surpasses the Office for Budget Responsibility's expectations.</p>

          <p>China has called on the European Union to provide a fair playing field for businesses following Brussels' proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, many of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms.

          <p>The Republican-led House has advanced the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" after Speaker Mike Johnson secured support from hard-liners following negotiations with President Trump. The bill includes provisions for Medicaid work requirements, an increased state and local tax deduction, expedited cuts to clean energy credits, and border security reimbursements. Democrats have opposed the bill, while some Republicans expressed dissatisfaction despite the changes. The bill must now pass the Senate, where further changes are expected.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how a South African lobbyist for white rights, Ernst Roets, spread misinformation about white people being killed in South Africa at a higher rate than the rest of the population. Tucker Carlson promoted this mythos to the MAGAverse, claiming South Africa is racist against white people. President Trump then signed an executive order offering refugee status to ‚Äúethnic minority Afrikaners,‚Äù most of whom are white. The article argues that there is no evidence of systematic civil rights violations against white South Africans and accuses right-wing Afrikaners of exploiting MAGA culture and spreading false claims of white genocide.</p>

          <p>A landmark review in the UK suggests releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. The Independent Sentencing Review also recommends managing more offenders in the community and expanding a chemical castration pilot program for sex offenders. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, emphasized the need for major reforms to prevent emergency releases. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is expected to respond to the review, which also calls for short custodial sentences only in exceptional circumstances and increased funding for the Probation Service.</p>

James Butterfill of CoinShares noted that broader macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments in the U.S., such as the GENIUS Act, and support from President Trump and his crypto advisor David Sacks, have also boosted the market.

Jack Watling of RUSI notes that Russia's military equipment stockpiles are dwindling, and further offensive operations will require politically and economically challenging forced mobilization. The Russian economy is slowing down, with the central bank maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation. Tighter sanctions on Russia's oil exports and declining oil prices are also negatively affecting the country's revenues.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that climate change-driven wildfires have contributed to thousands of deaths each year and billions of dollars in economic costs in the United States due to smoke exposure. The study, published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment, estimates that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 deaths from exposure to fine particulate matter from wildfires, costing around $160 billion. Researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particles, or PM2.5, the main concern related to wildfire smoke, which can lead to various chronic and deadly conditions.</p>

          <p>The Archdiocese of New Orleans has agreed to pay nearly $180 million to victims of clergy sexual assault as part of a settlement, which is the latest in a series of settlements by the Catholic Church. The archdiocese, its parishes, and several insurers will contribute to a trust to benefit survivors. However, some survivors and their lawyers have criticized the proposed settlement, calling it an insult and a secret backroom deal. The agreement also includes provisions to safeguard against future abuse and provide services to survivors.</p>

          <p>Martin Kettle argues that the UK is increasingly divided, with economic disparities threatening the stability of the state. He suggests that Labour's Council of the Nations and Regions is a crucial test of whether modern British governance can address these divisions through collaboration. The council aims to facilitate partnership between the UK government, devolved governments, and English mayors, but faces challenges due to differing powers and a history of piecemeal devolution. Kettle emphasizes that collaboration is essential for achieving government priorities and restoring public confidence in politics.</p>

The government is attempting to frame its actions as a response to the previous administration's failures, citing the handover of the Chagos Islands and the sentencing review as examples. However, the strategy of blaming the Conservatives may face diminishing returns as Labour approaches its first anniversary in office. The article also mentions the Justice Ministry's consideration of chemical castration for sex offenders and upcoming net migration figures.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are planning a vote to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, but Democrats contend such a vote is illegal. California officials have vowed to sue if Congress revokes the waivers, which are also adopted by 16 other states and D.C.</p>
