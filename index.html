          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former criminology Ph.D. student, has pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. This plea deal allows him to avoid the death penalty, resulting instead in four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. The agreement has drawn mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some supporting the deal to ensure justice while others, like the family of Kaylee Goncalves, have criticized prosecutors for not securing a full confession or the location of the murder weapon. Kohberger's parents were present in court for the first time since his arrest over two years ago.</p>

          <p>This article details the severe financial repercussions when a credit card issuer closes an account due to missed payments. Beyond losing access to a credit line, the closure significantly damages one's credit score by increasing the credit utilization ratio and adding a negative mark to the credit report. The outstanding debt does not disappear and is often sold to a collection agency, which can lead to aggressive collection tactics and potential legal action. The article advises individuals in this situation to contact their creditor, check their credit report for errors, and explore debt relief options to mitigate the long-term damage.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively engaging with House Republicans to secure passage of his administration's major tax and spending bill. He held meetings at the White House with members of the "pragmatic" Main Street Caucus to shore up support ahead of a crucial vote. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged that some hardline conservatives are hesitant due to changes made by the Senate, which increased the bill's impact on the national debt. Scalise referred to the president as their "best closer," highlighting Trump's direct involvement in persuading wavering lawmakers to vote in favor of the legislation.</p>

Goldman Sachs raised its payout by 33% to $4 per share, while Wells Fargo boosted its dividend by 12.5% to 45 cents per share, causing both companies' stock prices to rise. The article notes that such dividend hikes are generally seen as a sign of management's confidence in future cash flow and profitability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to multiple non-partisan budget analysis groups, the major tax and spending bill passed by the Senate would add between $3 trillion and $4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The legislation, which extends Trump-era tax cuts and increases spending on defense and immigration, is projected to have a minimal positive effect on economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office's analysis of a similar House version indicated that the tax cuts would primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. On average, individuals earning less than $55,000 annually would likely see a net financial loss due to cuts in government benefits outweighing any tax savings.</p>

He and his wife endured five IVF cycles before having their son, a journey that highlighted the lack of support for men, who account for at least 30% of infertility cases. Parchman shares his personal feelings of shock and inadequacy, describing himself as feeling like "the weakest link on the team." The book advocates for open communication, vulnerability, and creating a "safe space" for partners to discuss their emotions during the difficult process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is ramping up a program to combat the New World screwworm fly, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae pose a significant threat to livestock, wildlife, and pets. The strategy involves breeding billions of male flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from aircraft over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs subsequently fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This bio-friendly method was successfully used decades ago to eradicate the pest north of Panama and is being revived to counter its recent re-emergence.</p>

According to a local official and witnesses, two of the victims were burned alive, while the others were beaten or stoned to death. The attacks reportedly followed accusations from members of the Imbonerakure, a group that human rights organizations have previously accused of torture and killings. Local authorities have arrested 12 people in connection with the killings, denouncing the act as "unacceptable mob justice" fueled by deeply rooted traditional beliefs where unexplained deaths are often blamed on witchcraft.</p>

          <p>In a podcast episode, commentator David Frum warns that the Trump administration's approach to Ukraine signals a collapse of American support and threatens the post-World War II global security system. He interviews former Ambassador Bridget Brink, who describes an atmosphere of fear and an inability to provide candid policy advice under the current administration, leading to her resignation. Frum argues that Trump's hostility towards Ukraine and puzzling affinity for Russia are actively undermining a critical democratic ally. He frames the conflict not just as a border dispute but as a fight for Ukraine's very existence against Russian aggression, a cause he believes is vital to American interests.</p>

          <p>The major spending bill advanced by the Trump administration is set to significantly undermine the U.S. clean energy sector, according to this analysis. The legislation rolls back key investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, phasing out tax credits for wind and solar power and eliminating the credit for new electric vehicle purchases, while simultaneously creating new tax credits for coal. Critics argue this policy will hobble the American economy, ceding leadership in a booming global industry to countries like China and making US energy more expensive and less reliable. Despite rising energy demands, the bill throttles the cheapest and most rapidly deployable energy sources, which could lead to higher household electricity prices and significant job losses.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by high-interest credit card debt, debt settlementâ€”negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owedâ€”can be a viable solution. This article outlines seven signs that this strategy might be appropriate, such as when minimum payments consume over 20% of take-home pay or when payments only cover interest without reducing the principal. Other indicators include considering borrowing from retirement funds, having maxed-out credit cards, or accumulating debt due to unforeseen circumstances like job loss or medical emergencies. While debt settlement temporarily harms a credit score, it can offer a faster path to financial recovery than traditional methods.</p>

Pilots are trained from their earliest days to handle communication loss, with multiple layers of redundant systems in place. These include switching to backup radio frequencies, using a text-based messaging system, and activating a specific transponder code (7600) to signal a communication failure to all nearby aircraft and facilities. Additionally, all airliners are equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that autonomously directs planes to avoid mid-air collisions, ensuring passenger safety even if ATC communication is lost.</p>

          <p>Following the verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial, legal experts suggest that prosecutors overreached by pursuing complex racketeering (RICO) and sex trafficking charges. While jurors convicted Combs on two counts of transporting for prostitution, they acquitted him of the most serious charges, which could have resulted in a life sentence. Experts note that RICO cases are notoriously difficult to prove, requiring evidence of a continuous criminal enterprise, which the jury did not find. The defense successfully argued that while Combs' behavior was deplorable and involved domestic violence, it did not meet the high legal standard for a criminal conspiracy, leading to a significant but not total defeat for the prosecution.</p>

The report comes as Tesla faces intensified competition, particularly from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, and a political backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Despite the declining sales numbers and a 26% drop in stock value for the year, Tesla's shares rose about 4% following the announcement, suggesting investors may have anticipated worse results and believe the second quarter represents a low point for the company.</p>

          <p>A warehouse storing fireworks in Esparto, Northern California, exploded, sparking a significant wildfire just before the Fourth of July holiday. The blast, which occurred Tuesday evening, ignited several spot fires that merged into the 78-acre Oakdale fire, prompting temporary evacuation orders for nearby residents. Authorities have warned people to avoid the area for several days as explosive experts must secure the site before an investigation into the cause can begin. The incident highlights the dangers of fireworks, especially in a region experiencing hot, dry weather conditions that are conducive to the rapid spread of wildfires.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential benefits of investing in physical gold, such as bars and coins, as a tangible asset to diversify a portfolio amidst economic uncertainty. It highlights that gold can serve as a hedge against inflation and offers investors direct control over their assets, unlike stocks or bonds. The piece notes the accessibility of purchasing physical gold from various retailers and specialized companies. It also points out that investors can buy fractional gold bars and coins, allowing them to enter the market at a lower price point while still gaining the protective benefits of the precious metal (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The former head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Sir Ben Key, has had his service terminated following an investigation into his personal behavior. A Ministry of Defence statement declared that his conduct "fell far short of the values and standards expected of service personnel." In his response, Adm Key expressed deep regret for his actions, which reportedly involved an affair with a junior colleague, and apologized to those he had hurt. Adm Key, who was appointed First Sea Lord in 2021 and was due to retire this summer, has been succeeded by General Sir Gwyn Jenkins of the Royal Marines.</p>

However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison each. The verdict came after seven weeks of graphic testimony from former girlfriends who described coercive, drug-fueled sexual encounters. The prosecution had argued that Combs' business empire constituted a criminal enterprise used to abuse women, while the defense maintained the encounters were part of a consensual "swinger" lifestyle and that prosecutors had failed to prove a conspiracy.</p>

          <p>After narrowly passing the Senate, the Trump administration's major tax and spending bill faces an uncertain future in the House due to several key changes. The Senate version imposes deeper cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO estimates will leave nearly 12 million people uninsured, and adds about $1 trillion more to the national debt than the House bill. These modifications have angered both moderate and hardline Republicans, with some moderates concerned about the healthcare cuts and conservatives upset about the increased deficit. Other sticking points include changes to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction and the removal of provisions targeting Biden-era clean energy rules.</p>

In response to the deaths, Azerbaijan has arrested employees of a Kremlin-funded media outlet and other Russian professionals, prompting a sharp rebuke from Moscow.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of breast cancer in women under 55. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen-only therapy, typically prescribed to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk of breast cancer. This research refines previous understandings of HRT, which were based on older studies of women who began therapy long after menopause. The findings underscore the importance of personalizing treatment based on a woman's individual health profile, including whether she has a uterus, and consulting with a doctor.</p>

The Department of Defense is set to stop distributing crucial satellite data from its SSMIS sensor, which provides "cloud X-ray vision" to see a storm's structure and is vital for detecting rapid intensification. This loss is compounded by staffing shortages at the National Weather Service, leading to fewer weather balloon launches, and proposed budget cuts that would eliminate entire research offices at NOAA. Scientists warn these combined cuts are rapidly degrading state-of-the-art forecasting and research, increasing the risk of a "surprise hurricane."</p>

This measure is designed to further incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to build and expand advanced chip fabrication plants in the United States. The move expands upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act and aligns with Washington's ongoing efforts to onshore the semiconductor supply chain from Asia and bolster domestic production.

          <p>Following a man-of-the-match performance in the British and Irish Lions' victory over the Queensland Reds, Welsh flanker Jac Morgan received high praise from head coach Andy Farrell. Morgan, who scored a try and was a dominant force in both attack and defense, has significantly strengthened his case for a starting position in the upcoming Test matches. Farrell lauded Morgan's all-around game and joked that due to his versatility, he could play anywhere in the back row, not just his usual openside flanker position. Morgan himself expressed a desire to be as versatile as possible, acknowledging the fierce competition for spots within the elite touring squad.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has canceled the visa of American artist Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, after he released a song titled "Heil Hitler" that promotes Nazism. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke confirmed that while West's previous antisemitic comments had not affected his visa, the song's release prompted officials to reassess and revoke his entry permit. West, who is married to an Australian citizen, has been a regular visitor to the country. Burke defended the decision against criticism, stating that while Australian citizens have freedom of speech, the country does not need to "deliberately import bigotry."</p>
