          <p>The United States has disclosed additional information regarding its sixth-generation fighter jet, intensifying its competition with China for dominance in future aerial warfare. General David Allvin, the US Air Force chief of staff, shared an infographic revealing details of the F-47 fighter jet and its collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) drones, developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. The F-47 will have a combat radius exceeding 1,000 nautical miles, surpassing the F-22 Raptor. The accompanying CCA drones, YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A, will have a combat radius of over 700 nautical miles, and are critical for operations in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The article details the ongoing battle between the Apache Stronghold and Resolution Copper over Oak Flat, a sacred site for the Western Apache in Arizona. The Trump administration expedited the copper mine project, which would destroy much of Oak Flat, but Apache Stronghold won a temporary injunction. The prayer run from Oak Flat to Phoenix highlights the spiritual and health concerns of the Apache, who fear the destruction of their ancestral lands and traditions. Concerns raised include water pollution, high cancer rates, and the psychological distress of losing sacred lands, with the case potentially setting a legal precedent for religious freedom on ancestral lands.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, is experiencing a significant increase in overseas visitors, attributed to the country's expanded visa-free entry policies and integration of the Greater Bay Area. The city's international airport has recorded over 152,000 visa-free entries by foreign nationals in 2025, a 160.3% year-on-year surge. To meet the rising demand, a direct flight to Dubai is scheduled to start in July, with multiple international routes added to cities like Vientiane, Osaka, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Hanoi. Shenzhen is appealing to travelers due to its status as a trade and manufacturing center, its proximity to Hong Kong, and its relatively low cost of living.</p>

Coach Mascherano acknowledged his responsibility for the team's poor performances, emphasizing the need for tactical improvements and greater player commitment. While Inter Miami still has the potential to contend for the Supporters' Shield, their success will be judged on trophies won, with Messi potentially facing a similar fate to his time at PSG, where he failed to win the Champions League.</p>

          <p>A discussion about vaping on planes has ignited a debate about acceptable on-board behavior, with many claiming to be flight attendants sharing their insights on the issue. According to these users, airlines are often aware when passengers vape in the bathroom due to smoke detectors and other sensors. Travel expert Gary Leff confirmed that modern smoke detectors can detect aerosols from vaping, and the FAA prohibits vaping on planes, extending the ban on cigarettes to include e-cigarettes.</p>
