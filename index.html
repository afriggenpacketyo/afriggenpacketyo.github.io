            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen visited El Salvador to investigate the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported despite having a "withholding of removal" protection order. Van Hollen met with Salvadoran officials and sought to visit Abrego Garcia in prison, emphasizing the need for due process. ICE admitted the deportation was an "administrative error" but initially resisted his return, alleging gang ties based on flimsy evidence like wearing a Chicago Bulls hat. The Supreme Court has ruled Abrego Garcia should be returned, but El Salvador's president has resisted, complicating the situation and prompting Van Hollen's intervention.</p>

            <p>Far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, lost his appeal against an 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court, which stemmed from breaching a court order after losing a libel trial in 2021. Robinson had ignored a court order not to repeat lies about a Syrian refugee. The Court of Appeal rejected his arguments, stating the judge's approach was meticulous. Robinson's complaints about his segregation in HMP Woodhill were also considered, but deemed insufficient to warrant a reduced sentence, and he is expected to be released on license in July.</p>

            <p>A federal judge reprimanded the Department of Justice for failing to comply with her order to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis ordered expedited discovery, including depositions from Trump administration officials, and criticized the DOJ's arguments as inadequate. The judge emphasized the irreparable harm Abrego Garcia faces while detained in El Salvador's CECOT prison. The case involves conflicting claims about Abrego Garcia's gang ties and the Trump administration's efforts, or lack thereof, to return him to the U.S.</p>

            <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai's approval ratings have dipped, reflecting rising public dissatisfaction amid heightened tensions with mainland China and a contentious recall campaign against opposition lawmakers. A recent poll indicated nearly equal approval and disapproval rates for Lai, with concerns that US tariffs targeting Taiwan could further erode his support. Another poll showed similar trends, with a significant percentage of voters expressing dissatisfaction with Lai's performance. The political climate is strained as Lai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) actively supports efforts to unseat lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) party.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that doctors involved in end-of-life cases can be named, overturning previous court orders that restricted their identification. The ruling came after parents of two deceased children, Isaiah Haastrup and Zainab Abbasi, sought to share their stories and raise concerns about the care their children received. The court emphasized that restrictions on freedom of speech must be convincingly justified, and the NHS trusts in the case failed to provide sufficient justification. The decision allows the parents to publicly discuss the details of their children's treatment and care.</p>

            <p>A doctor in Berlin faces murder charges for the deaths of 15 patients under his palliative care, accused of administering anesthetics and muscle relaxants without consent, leading to respiratory arrest. Prosecutors allege the doctor acted out of a "lust for murder," and attempted to conceal the crimes by starting fires in the victims' homes. The victims ranged in age from 25 to 94, with the doctor in custody since August. The case echoes past instances of medical professionals committing serial murders in Germany and England, raising concerns about oversight in healthcare settings.</p>

            <p>Harvard University is refusing to comply with the Trump administration's demands, which include changes to governance, hiring, and teaching practices, despite the freezing of $2.2 billion in federal funding. The administration accuses Harvard of a "troubling entitlement mindset" regarding civil rights laws, while Harvard's president emphasizes the importance of academic freedom. This conflict highlights a broader tension between the federal government and higher education institutions, particularly concerning issues of antisemitism and campus protests. Despite its substantial endowment, Harvard faces financial challenges if funding and tax-exempt status are revoked.</p>

            <p>The world is close to eradicating polio, but recent increases in cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan, coupled with USAID funding cuts for vaccination programs, raise concerns about a potential resurgence. Pakistan and Afghanistan have struggled to stop transmission despite vaccination efforts, and cuts in USAID contracts may lead to a resurgence in other countries. The WHO expresses concern that these numbers could balloon, while USAID projects an additional 200,000 cases of polio causing paralysis each year if U.S. aid is not restored.</p>

            <p>California is suing the Trump administration over international tariffs, arguing that the President lacks the authority to enact them without congressional approval. Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta contend that the tariffs harm California families, businesses, and the state's economy. The lawsuit claims that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the President the power to unilaterally impose tariffs. If successful, the lawsuit could require Congress to vote on Trump's tariffs, potentially impacting Republican lawmakers.</p>

            <p>Experts are raising concerns about the Trump administration's increasing reliance on white Christian nationalists and prosperity gospel preachers in key government roles. The establishment of an "anti-Christian bias" taskforce and a White House Faith Office, dominated by right-wing Christian loyalists, is seen as a potential threat to democratic principles and free speech. Critics fear the prioritization of a specific brand of Christianity over other faiths and the erosion of government institutions. The influence of figures associated with Project 2025, a right-wing plan for Trump's second term, is also a cause for concern.</p>

California, heavily reliant on trade with Mexico, Canada, and China, stands to suffer significant economic consequences from the tariffs.

The days' supply of new vehicles has dropped significantly, while used vehicle supply remains low. Increased sales are beneficial for the automotive industry but raise concerns that the sales could halt once automakers and dealers exhaust their tariff-free inventories. Analysts expect higher costs for production and parts to lead to fewer vehicles sold annually.</p>
