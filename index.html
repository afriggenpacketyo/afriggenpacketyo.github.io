          <p>The federal government released over 60,000 pages of records related to Senator Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination, fulfilling President Trump's order with support from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long questioned Sirhan Sirhan's guilt. The documents include witness interviews, FBI memos, and transcripts of LAPD interviews with Sirhan, offering details already largely known. The release aims for maximum transparency, with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard emphasizing the importance of finding and sharing the truth. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 2012 letter urging a reopened probe is among the documents, focusing on audio analysis suggesting more shots fired than Sirhan's handgun held.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic data suggests that many companies intend to pass the costs of tariffs onto consumers, potentially leading to increased prices despite President Trump's claims that foreign exporters would bear the burden. Surveys reveal that a significant percentage of manufacturers and retailers plan to adjust their pricing to account for tariffs, with economists predicting a rise in inflation. The Center for American Progress estimates that tariffs could cost households an average of $5,200 annually, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income consumers. Several companies, including Stanley Black & Decker and Procter & Gamble, have already announced or implemented price increases in response to tariffs.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will cease tracking the financial impact of billion-dollar disasters, which could affect how insurance companies, researchers, and policymakers understand and address the economic consequences of extreme weather events. This decision comes amidst increasing frequency and severity of such disasters, with an average of 23 events per year from 2020 to 2024, compared to just over three per year in the 1980s. Researchers and lawmakers have criticized this move, citing concerns that it will hinder efforts to set budgets and make infrastructure investment decisions.

Hamilton's firing occurred after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem testified that FEMA should be eliminated, while Hamilton advocated for the agency to return to its roots, assisting state and local governments in disaster response.

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to AmeriCorps programs have drawn criticism, with approximately half of the terminated projects serving states and communities that voted for President Trump in the 2024 election. Impacted programs include child abuse prevention, rural education, and disaster relief efforts, raising concerns about the future of assistance in impoverished areas. Some organizations argue that the funding termination has caused "damage and chaos," disrupting community assistance projects and potentially decimating AmeriCorps' full-time staff. Lawsuits have been filed to halt the dismantling of AmeriCorps, with attorneys general also challenging the cuts.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan continued their armed confrontation, with both countries reporting attacks on military sites and heavy shelling along their border. The escalation followed India's strikes inside Pakistani territory in response to a terrorist attack, prompting international concern and calls for immediate de-escalation from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Despite claims from both sides that they are not seeking escalation, the situation on the ground indicates ongoing tensions, with reports of thwarted drone attacks, strikes on air defense systems, and civilian panic in border cities. The conflict, rooted in competing claims over Kashmir, poses a significant risk to regional stability.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will no longer track the costs of climate crisis-fueled weather disasters, marking the latest effort by the Trump administration to limit federal government resources on climate change.

Experts warn that this move will hinder efforts to assess the impact of weather events fueled by the planet's warming, affecting insurance premiums and community planning.

The investigation began after William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, alleged that James falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government-backed assistance and loans. James has denied the allegations, calling them "baseless," and her attorney, Abbe Lowell, has derided the investigation as political retribution. The probe follows James' successful civil case against Mr. Trump, his company, and his sons, resulting in a significant financial penalty.</p>
