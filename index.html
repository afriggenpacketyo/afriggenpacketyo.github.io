          <p>In response to a series of powerful earthquakes in Afghanistan that have caused over 2,200 fatalities, China has sent Y-20 military transport planes with humanitarian aid. The initial shipments consist mainly of essential supplies like tents and blankets to assist those displaced by the widespread destruction of homes and infrastructure. Beijing's foreign aid agency has also announced that it has allocated approximately $7 million in emergency assistance at the request of Kabul.</p>

          <p>The company Pray.com is using artificial intelligence to create cinematic videos depicting stories from the Bible, which have become popular with younger, male-skewing audiences on social media. While the company views this as an innovative way to engage people with scripture, some theologians are critical of the approach. They argue that reducing complex religious texts to action-movie-style entertainment strips them of their spiritual depth and transformative power, situating the Bible as mere content for amusement.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday will cause the full moon to take on a striking red hue, an event commonly known as a 'Blood Moon.' The spectacle will be visible across eastern Africa, the Middle East, most of Asia, and western Australia, with partial visibility in the UK depending on the moonrise time. This phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and Moon, with the red color resulting from sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Less than a year after taking office, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has reportedly decided to step down from his position. This decision follows significant political setbacks for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), including losing the majority in the lower house after snap elections and failing to secure a majority in the upper house. His resignation will trigger a new leadership race within the LDP to select the country's next prime minister.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, has been officially declared a saint by the Catholic Church, making him the first millennial to be canonized. Known as 'God's influencer,' Acutis used his technological skills to create websites documenting miracles as a way to spread Catholic teachings. The Vatican is seen as having fast-tracked his path to sainthood in an effort to provide a relatable role model and inspire faith among young people.</p>
