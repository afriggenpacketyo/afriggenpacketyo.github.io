The company is cooperating with the Air Accident Investigation Branch to determine the cause of the incident. While the number of casualties has not yet been confirmed, emergency services are at the scene and the public has been advised to avoid the area.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter of 2025, expanding by 4.3% year-over-year and beating economists' forecasts. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 5.5%. Despite these positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant downside risks from global economic uncertainty, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has recently loosened monetary policy in response to these external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods that claimed over 120 lives in central Texas, communities gathered for Sunday church services to find comfort and reflect on the tragedy. The services provided a space for residents to process their grief and begin the difficult process of moving forward. This collective mourning highlights the significant role that faith and community support play in coping with large-scale disasters. The region continues to grapple with the aftermath of the severe weather event.</p>

          <p>At least 37 people, including two children, have been killed in violent clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and the Druze community in the southern Syrian city of Sweida. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the fighting, which also left around 50 people wounded, was triggered by a series of kidnappings. This event marks a significant escalation in a long-running feud and underscores the precarious security situation in the country.

Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is now polling ahead of Orban's Fidesz party.

          <p>Drake's final headline performance at London's Wireless Festival left many fans feeling disappointed after his set concluded in just 40 minutes due to a strict local curfew. The rapper appeared on stage earlier than scheduled and raced through a medley of his hits, but the abbreviated show was a stark contrast to his longer performances on the previous two nights. The short set, combined with fewer special guests than expected, led to audible discontent from the crowd. The incident highlighted the logistical challenges and fan frustrations that can arise from festival curfews.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report has concluded that the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last summer was preceded by a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service. The report, released by the Senate Homeland Security Committee, cited a lack of structured communication as the primary issue, noting that critical information about the shooter was not effectively relayed to Trump's security detail. It also identified organizational mistakes, such as an obstructed view for a countersniper team, and alleged that the agency had denied resources to the detail. The Secret Service has stated it has implemented reforms in response.</p>

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer made the case that investors must divorce their personal politics from their financial decisions, particularly regarding the Trump administration. He argued that despite many reasons to dislike the president, the market has been resilient, driven by individual investors and policies that are surprisingly constructive for investments. Cramer pointed to deregulation, a pro-deal environment, and the deflationary impact of AI as powerful forces for stocks that exist independently of political sentiment. He concluded that market forces under the current administration are favorable for stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The backlash followed a Justice Department memo stating there was "no incriminating client list" found, a conclusion that disappointed those expecting major revelations. In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to "let Pam Bondi do her job" and not to waste energy on the Epstein case. The situation highlights a rare division between the president and figures in his base over the handling of the high-profile investigation.</p>
