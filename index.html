          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has publicly criticized his independent mayoral race opponent, Zohran Mamdani, for living in a rent-stabilized apartment despite his substantial wealth. Cuomo argued that Mamdani, who earns a six-figure income and owns international property, is occupying affordable housing that should go to a family in need. Citing New York City's housing crisis and high median rents, Cuomo called on the assemblyman to "move out immediately." The criticism is part of a broader campaign by Cuomo to highlight what he describes as Mamdani's hypocrisy on various issues.</p>

Hines played a key role in a working group that outlined the administration's stance on cryptocurrency legislation and advocated for new, specific rules for digital assets. His departure follows the recent signing of a law to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a piece of legislation he supported.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable patents derived from federally funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of breaching its legal obligations and initiated a "march-in" process under the Bayh-Dole Act, which could allow the government to seize the patents. This action follows previous administration measures to freeze federal research funds over Harvard's response to campus protests, which the university is currently challenging in court. Critics suggest the administration's actions are a pretext to assert federal control over academic institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages" that promise relaxation and health benefits is facing scrutiny from nutritionists and dietitians. While brands claim ingredients like Lion's Mane and L-theanine promote calm, experts are skeptical that the small quantities in these drinks have a significant physiological effect. The Advertising Standards Agency recently banned an ad from a leading brand for making unsubstantiated health claims. Some psychologists suggest any calming effect may be a placebo, resulting from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself, rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

President Emmanuel Macron will award him the National Order of Merit, one of the country's highest honors. The 72-year-old, who started in 1973 when there were dozens of hawkers, has become a beloved figure in the Saint-Germain neighborhood, continuing his trade despite the decline in print sales due to the digital age. Mr. Akbar says he continues for the joy and freedom the job provides.</p>

          <p>Residents of Pampa Clemesí, a small village in Peru, live without electricity despite being located next to the country's largest solar power complex. The Rubí and Clemesí plants generate enough power for over 350,000 homes, yet the 150 villagers rely on torches, candles, or small, inadequate solar panels. The plant's operator states it has fulfilled its obligation by building a power line for the village, but the final connection to homes is a government responsibility that has been delayed. This situation highlights a paradox in Peru's renewable energy boom, where infrastructure often bypasses the most impoverished local communities.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to meet with Qatar's prime minister in Spain to discuss a new joint Egyptian-Qatari proposal for ending the war in Gaza.

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a debate about identity and heritage in the modern era. Despite being born and raised in England, Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection to the country where his musical tastes were formed. The discussion touches on the complex, evolving nature of what it means to be Irish, particularly for the diaspora and in post-Good Friday Agreement Northern Ireland. Experts note that identity is increasingly seen as more fluid than citizenship, encompassing cultural affinity and personal feeling.</p>

The 24.7kg rock, the largest of its kind found on Earth, was reportedly found by a meteorite hunter and sold to an international dealer. Sotheby's maintains that all relevant documentation and international procedures were followed, but the case highlights the ambiguous legal landscape surrounding the trade of extraterrestrial objects.</p>

          <p>The release of a new "War of the Worlds" adaptation, widely panned by critics, has renewed interest in the phenomenon of "so bad they're good" films. While some movies are simply forgettable, truly atrocious films can attract a cult following precisely because of their spectacular failures in acting, directing, or writing. Enthusiasts argue that these "junk films," like "The Room" or "Samurai Cop," are often more entertaining and memorable than bland, polished blockbusters. The appeal lies in watching earnest but failed attempts at art, which can create a uniquely enjoyable and communal viewing experience.</p>

          <p>The Chief Financial Officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after town officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the full-time town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town 2,000 miles away. Dawn Norton had been working remotely for Wilton while on family medical leave before taking the Wyoming job. Wilton officials claim they were unaware she held another full-time public office, which would not have been approved. Norton insists she was transparent about seeking other employment, but the controversy arose amid a review of Wilton's troubled finance department.</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would see foreign criminals deported immediately after receiving a fixed-term custodial sentence, rather than serving time in British prisons. Under the proposal, those deported would be barred from re-entering the UK, and the decision on whether they serve their sentence abroad would be left to their destination country. The government argues this would save taxpayers money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics have warned that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly called out UEFA for a social media tribute to Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid that omitted the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid, known as the "Pele of Palestinian football," was killed in an Israeli attack while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. In response to UEFA's post, which praised al-Obeid's talent, Salah posted on X, "Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?"

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified neurologist suggests that people over 50 should consider eating more pomegranates to support healthy brain aging. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these nutrients may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein buildup associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates are beneficial, the article advises consulting a doctor before regular consumption, as they can interact with certain medications like blood thinners and statins. Other brain-healthy fruits recommended include blueberries and avocados.</p>

          <p>Police in London have arrested 474 people at a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. Protesters gathered in Parliament Square and deliberately flouted the law by displaying signs supporting the group, which the government proscribed after activists vandalized military aircraft. The mass arrests are described as the largest by the force in a decade. While the Home Secretary defended the ban, human rights groups like Amnesty International called the arrests "deeply concerning" and a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over demands to use confidential taxpayer data to locate undocumented immigrants. The IRS had informed the Department of Homeland Security that it could not legally provide most of the requested information, citing taxpayer privacy rights. This resistance appears to have conflicted with the administration's goal of using the IRS to aid its immigration crackdown. The incident highlights growing pressure on federal agencies to align with administration priorities, following similar pressures at other government bureaus.</p>
