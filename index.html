          <h2>China Considers Fentanyl Cooperation with US as Trade War Leverage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 09:25:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese officials are reportedly considering deepening cooperation with the United States on stemming the flow of fentanyl as a way to de-escalate the ongoing trade war. This strategy echoes past instances where Beijing used its willingness to cooperate on fentanyl to curry favor with the U.S., such as during Donald Trump's first term. The plan involves sending China's top security official, Wang Xiaohong, to Washington to initiate trade talks, with the hope that a pledge to address fentanyl concerns will lead to a simultaneous reduction in tariffs by both governments. While China has previously resisted pressure from the U.S. regarding fentanyl, viewing it as a reflection of America's internal issues, this potential shift indicates a willingness to use the issue as a bargaining chip to ease trade tensions.</p>

          <p>With college costs continuing to rise, a growing number of high school seniors are making their college decisions based on affordability, often opting for local and less expensive public schools over private universities. Financial concerns are governing decision-making for a significant majority of families, outweighing even academic considerations. Deep cuts in state funding for higher education have contributed to this trend, shifting more of the financial burden onto students and families. The trend is further exacerbated by concerns about the economy and dwindling federal loan forgiveness options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the death of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, conspiracy theories have emerged, suggesting foul play. Figures like Donald Trump Jr. amplified these theories, despite warnings that victims of abuse are significantly more likely to attempt suicide or suffer other long-term effects of trauma. The article suggests that the true "conspiracy" lies in society's attitudes toward women, which often protect powerful predators and their enablers, allowing them to evade justice. The author points to the lack of accountability for those involved in Epstein's sex trafficking ring as evidence of this societal problem.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is pursuing the creation of Starbase, a company town in Texas, raising concerns among local residents. The proposed municipality would function as its own city, potentially controlling access to nearby Boca Chica Beach.

Bills proposed in the Texas legislature would give Starbase the power to close beaches and roads on weekdays.</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to force the New Jersey state police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used to send ransom notes in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. The crime was pinned on Bruno Hauptmann, but his conviction relied on circumstantial evidence. Researchers want access to more than a quarter-million documents, photos and other bits of evidence in an archive at the New Jersey state police museum. The plaintiffs contend that in an era when “the very idea of historical or legal truth has come under political pressure it is incumbent on those of us who prize truthfulness in our public life to use every tool at our disposal to affirm its value”.</p>

          <p>The author argues that tech billionaires' embrace of Trump and the far right is not a rupture with Silicon Valley's political ideology, but a homecoming. The author states that the longstanding rightwing ideals of the leaders of the tech industry are most obvious in their visions of the future. Musk and Bezos are pursuing plans for space colonization that allows for visions of total corporate control free of governments, a libertarian paradise. The author suggests that AI and space colonization will lead to utopia, algorithmically guaranteed, and this is why they need to believe that AI is amazing.</p>

Cargo arrivals at the Port of Los Angeles are projected to be down 35 percent over the same time last year. The author claims that because Trump’s trade war is unpredictable and indefinite, it has shaken global confidence in American economic-policy making. Tariffs don’t just reduce the flow of goods coming into the country; they also cause an atrophying of the logistics system that moves products into, out of, and around the United States.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs follow earlier levies on imported cars, and while components from Canada and Mexico are exempt under certain conditions, the broader impact is expected to raise costs for consumers. Even cars made in the United States often rely on foreign-made engines, transmissions, or batteries, making them vulnerable to the new duties. The tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles.</p>
