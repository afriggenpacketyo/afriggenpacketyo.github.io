          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted by a grand jury in Northern Virginia on two criminal counts: making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. These charges, filed by President Trump's Justice Department, revisit controversies from nearly a decade ago regarding Comey's handling of the FBI's 2016 investigations into Russian election interference and Hillary Clinton's private email server. Prosecutors allege Comey falsely denied authorizing an FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous media source about an investigation during a 2020 Senate hearing. This unprecedented step against a prominent Trump critic raises significant questions about political motivations and the independence of the Justice Department, even as the grand jury rejected a third proposed charge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new wave of tariffs, including a 100% levy on branded drug imports unless companies build US factories, a 25% import tax on heavy-duty trucks, and 50% duties on kitchen and bathroom cabinets. These measures, effective October 1, are intended to protect US manufacturers from what Trump describes as a "FLOODING" of foreign products. The announcements come despite calls from US businesses to avoid further tariffs, which could significantly impact major pharmaceutical producers in countries like the UK and Germany. This expansion of Trump's trade policies aims to boost domestic jobs and manufacturing, though experts warn of likely price increases for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The People's Bank of China unveiled three platforms designed to accelerate the digital currency's internationalization, aiming to reshape the global financial architecture currently dominated by the US dollar. Central bank deputy governor Lu Lei emphasized the historical inevitability of evolving monetary and payment systems in the digital era.

Quarterback Sam Darnold delivered an efficient performance, throwing for 242 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks initially squandered a 14-point fourth-quarter lead, allowing Kyler Murray to lead a Cardinals rally with two late touchdown passes. However, a crucial penalty on the ensuing kickoff provided Seattle with favorable field position, enabling Myers to calmly convert the game-winning kick and seal the thrilling Thursday night football match.</p>

          <h2>James Comey Indictment Raises Concerns of Political Retribution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 23:26:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of false statements and obstruction of justice has intensified concerns that President Trump is weaponizing the Justice Department against political rivals. This article highlights that the indictment directly follows Trump's public calls for Comey's prosecution, leading critics to question the department's independence. Legal experts, including a former federal prosecutor, suggest the traditional "firewall" between the White House and Justice Department has "completely collapsed" with this case. The move is widely seen as a vindictive effort to settle scores and undermine the credibility of the past Russia investigation, further fueling political divisions.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis of the James Comey indictment highlights its unusual brevity and severe lack of specific details, raising profound concerns about it being a politically motivated prosecution. The two-page indictment offers only vague assertions of Comey lying to Congress and obstructing proceedings, without the typical context or supporting evidence found in federal indictments. Legal experts and Justice Department sources reportedly view the indictment as among the "worst abuses" in DOJ history, suggesting it's an authoritarian overreach by the president to target critics. This absence of substance makes it nearly impossible to evaluate the allegations on their merits, further eroding trust in the legal process.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated his readiness to step down from office once the war with Russia concludes, stating his primary focus is achieving peace rather than seeking another term. In an interview with Axios, he affirmed his openness to holding elections during a ceasefire, despite Ukraine currently operating under martial law, which prohibits such elections. Zelenskyy, whose five-year term would have formally ended in May 2024, emphasized that leading Ukraine in peacetime is not his personal ambition. His ultimate goal remains to successfully finish the war and continue to help his country through its ongoing difficult period.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576 aims to prevent streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video from playing commercials at excessively loud volumes, a problem notably highlighted by an 8-month-old baby being woken up. This article explains that while federal law already regulates TV ad volume, streaming services are currently exempt. Due to California's significant market influence, the bill, if signed by Governor Newsom, could effectively set a national standard for ad volume control. The legislation, which passed the state Senate unanimously, faces opposition from the Motion Picture Association, citing practical difficulties for streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, currently swirling in the central Atlantic, might interact with another developing storm system near the Caribbean, potentially leading to the rare Fujiwhara effect. This article explains that this meteorological phenomenon occurs when two tropical storms merge or spin around a common center. While forecasters predict Humberto won't make landfall, the interaction, though unlikely to be a full "dance" due to the other system's weaker state and distance, could slightly alter their paths. This event highlights the complex and sometimes unpredictable dynamics of hurricane season, requiring continuous monitoring by meteorologists.</p>

Conversely, consumer-oriented companies in sectors like autos, housing, and retail are struggling, often missing earnings estimates.
