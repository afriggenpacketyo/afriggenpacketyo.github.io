          <p>A new study reveals that Chinese Buddhist and Taoist temples have acted as unexpected sanctuaries for tens of thousands of ancient trees for at least 2,000 years.  These trees, often over 100 years old, have been protected within temple grounds, providing a stark contrast to surrounding landscapes heavily impacted by human development.  The research highlights the unintentional role of religious sites in preserving biodiversity.</p>
