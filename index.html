        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, reported its slowest earnings growth in a decade, reflecting the impact of an intensified anti-corruption campaign and a slowing economy. First-half revenue increased by 4.2% to 52.8 billion yuan, while net profit rose 2.3% to 19.5 billion yuan, marking the slowest growth since 2015. This trend mirrors that of other major baijiu producers, such as Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor, which also saw significant slowdowns or plunges in their financial results. The article attributes this to policy factors causing a sharp reduction in baijiu consumption, a traditional drink often served in government and family gatherings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentinian authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago, after it surfaced in a property advertisement. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Guiseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was originally part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection. The search was renewed when Dutch newspaper reporters spotted the artwork in a real estate listing for a home potentially owned by descendants of the Nazi fugitive, Friedrich Kadgien. Police raided a seaside villa, finding German documents from the 1940s but not the portrait, underscoring the challenges in recovering plundered Jewish property brought to Argentina after World War II.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has warned that "action will be met with a response" if President Donald Trump deploys the National Guard to Chicago to address crime. Pritzker, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, argues there is no emergency warranting federal intervention, calling the move "unconstitutional" and a "dangerous power grab." They cite declining violent crime rates in the city, although statistics show crime remains up compared to 2021. Trump, however, criticized the governor and mayor as "incompetent" after a "deadly weekend" in Chicago, suggesting they should ask him for help.</p>

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has been issued a significant fine of almost £31,500 ($42,500) for unsportsmanlike behavior during his first-round exit from the tournament. The incident involved a meltdown triggered by a photographer on court during his match against Benjamin Bonzi, leading to a $30,000 penalty. Additionally, he received a $12,500 fine for smashing his racket. This penalty means Medvedev will forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money, a consequence he had anticipated.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is replacing his principal private secretary, Nin Pandit, who has served in the role for only ten months. This marks the third senior staff change in Starmer's Downing Street office within a year, following the departures of his chief of staff and director of communications. While Number 10 disputes claims of Pandit's ineffectiveness, the BBC understands concerns existed. The principal private secretary is a crucial civil service position, acting as the Prime Minister's gatekeeper and influencing their schedule and information flow, making frequent changes notable.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage predicts the Scottish Conservatives will cease to be a political force, following the defection of a third MSP, Graham Simpson, to Reform. Opinion polls consistently show Reform ahead of the Tories in Scotland, raising questions about the future of Russell Findlay's leadership. The article explores how Reform's growing support, mirroring a UK-wide trend, could see them gain regional list seats in the 2025 Holyrood election, potentially at the expense of other parties. This shift forces the Scottish Tories to reconsider their strategy, risking alienation of moderate voters if they move too far right.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, is a bruising crime caper set in a gritty 1998 New York City. The article follows Hank Thompson (Austin Butler), a former baseball player whose life spirals into a criminal underworld after a series of unfortunate events involving a cat. Hank navigates a dangerous landscape populated by various toughs, including Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen, while being pursued by NYPD Detective Roman (Regina King). The film is praised for its intimate, grimy portrayal of the city and its exploration of squandered potential, with Butler delivering a compelling performance as a self-loathing alcoholic trying to survive.</p>

          <p>USC has offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to continue their historic football rivalry, which was facing potential termination after 100 years. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a deal soon, acknowledging the importance of the series to fans and the program. The previous reluctance from USC stemmed from College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, as USC seeks to move it to September to balance its conference schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to change the long-standing tradition.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing its worst wildfire season since 2006, with a record one million hectares burned across the EU, half of which is in Spain and Portugal alone. Over 400,000 hectares have been scorched in Spain and 270,000 in Portugal, significantly exceeding historical averages. The World Weather Attribution group directly links the worsening fire season to climate change, which increases extreme heat and dries out vegetation. These fires also release record levels of CO2, creating a feedback loop. Rural depopulation and abandoned agricultural land further exacerbate the problem by increasing flammable vegetation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is relocating detainees from "Alligator Alcatraz," a controversial state-run immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, after a federal judge ordered parts of the facility dismantled. DHS criticized the ruling from an "activist judge," but stated compliance while vowing to continue efforts to remove immigrants. The facility, part of a broader Trump administration push to increase detention capacity, has faced allegations of inhumane conditions and skirting environmental laws. Judge Kathleen Williams' order halts new construction and bars new detainee transfers, though the state has appealed the ruling.</p>
