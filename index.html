          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal formed on Saturday morning approximately 150 miles off the coast of South Carolina, leading to tropical storm warnings for coastal areas of the Carolinas. With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the storm is moving slowly and is expected to make landfall on Sunday. Forecasters anticipate some strengthening before it reaches the coast, bringing heavy rainfall of two to four inches, with localized amounts up to six inches, which could cause flash flooding through Monday.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is under fire for allocating funds for four new positions, worth up to $704,000, to a controversial Commission of Inquiry (COI) focused on the Palestinian territories. Critics, including the director of the Touro Institute, label the COI as antisemitic and designed to "destroy the Jewish state," questioning the expenditure during a severe UN cash crisis. The commission, led by Navi Pillay, has been previously condemned by U.S. lawmakers and officials for alleged bias against Israel, while other UN Human Rights Council projects are stalled due to lack of resources.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military announced it successfully struck the Borisoglebsk airbase in Russia's Voronezh region, targeting a depot with glide bombs and possibly several aircraft. This attack is part of Ukraine's strategy to diminish Russia's military capabilities on its own territory. Concurrently, Russia launched a massive aerial assault on Ukraine, firing 322 drones and decoys overnight, with Ukraine's air force reporting 157 were shot down. The renewed hostilities come after Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's recent phone call with U.S. President Trump to discuss strengthening air defenses and ending the war.</p>

          <p>Over the past five decades, the fatality rate from heart attacks in the United States has plummeted by nearly 90%, a major public health achievement. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including successful anti-smoking campaigns, the widespread use of statin drugs to manage cholesterol, and advancements in emergency medical care like CPR and portable defibrillators. While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, the focus is shifting to managing chronic conditions and leveraging new treatments like GLP-1 inhibitors to further reduce cardiovascular risks.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas have caused a "mass casualty event," with at least 24 people confirmed dead and dozens remaining unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, from which 23 to 25 campers are still missing. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration as hundreds of first responders conduct extensive search and rescue operations, including helicopter evacuations, in the wake of the unexpectedly severe rainfall.</p>

          <p>An arsonist set fire to the front doors of the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Friday night while about 20 worshippers were inside. The congregation was able to evacuate safely through a rear exit without any injuries. Victoria Police are investigating the "disgusting and abhorrent" crime, which they are treating as a serious criminal incident but have not yet declared a terrorist act. The attack comes amid a rise in antisemitic incidents in Australia and occurred on the same night protesters targeted a nearby Israeli-owned restaurant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The discovery of another man's body in Austin's Lady Bird Lake has intensified community fears of a potential serial killer, bringing the total number of bodies recovered from the lake since 2022 to 38. Despite police statements attributing most deaths to accidental drownings often involving alcohol, the high number of male victims has fueled speculation. Some forensic experts argue that the pattern cannot be dismissed, suggesting the possibility of foul play, potentially involving date-rape drugs used on victims from the nearby Rainey Street entertainment district.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, could be used to combat cancer. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug may help restore the function of dendritic cells, a key component of the immune system's anti-tumor response that often becomes depleted as cancer progresses. This discovery points to a potential new strategy in tumor immunotherapy, repurposing a well-known drug to help the body's own immune system fight the disease more effectively.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Sean "Diddy" Combs's recent trial verdict should not be viewed as an exoneration, despite his acquittal on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. The piece emphasizes that Combs was found guilty of lesser charges and, critically, his own defense team conceded he was a domestic abuser, a fact supported by video evidence. The author critiques the defense's strategy of portraying the verdict as a total victory, suggesting it obscures the undisputed violence and coercive control detailed in court, leaving his accusers to face public scrutiny while he escapes the most severe consequences.</p>

          <p>This analysis uses the recent U.S. air strikes against Iran as a case study to argue that American leaders consistently overestimate the strategic effectiveness of single displays of overwhelming air power. The author contends that President Trump's declaration of "obliteration" after one night of bombing was premature and ignored the complexities of military objectives, contrasting it with Israel's more methodical campaign. The article suggests the U.S. has a history of tactical success without strategic victory and could learn from smaller, more inventive militaries like Ukraine's about modern warfare.</p>

The piece argues that this phenomenon is not just about academic dishonesty but raises fundamental questions about the value of a college degree, the purpose of learning, and whether educational institutions can adapt to a technology that threatens their core mission.</p>

Spurred by a social media post from a community activist, hundreds of customers lined up, quickly selling out all 500 tamales and raising over $1,500 for the family. The event highlights the impact of immigration enforcement on families and the powerful response of a community coming together to support one of its own during a time of fear and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Following a 12-day military campaign against Iran, Israel and the U.S. declared a "historic victory," asserting that Iran's nuclear and missile threats were destroyed. However, this analysis suggests the conflict is merely a prelude to future confrontations, not a final resolution. Experts believe that while facilities were damaged, Iran retains the knowledge, centrifuges, and enriched uranium to reconstitute its program. Tehran's defiance and suspension of cooperation with IAEA inspectors indicate that the shadow war is likely to continue, with both sides regrouping for the next round.</p>

While economists debate the speed and scale of this transformation, the trend is clear: AI is reshaping the job market, leading to a surge in demand for AI-related skills and fueling fears that many current roles could be automated.</p>
