          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has publicly stated the club's intention to retain 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong amidst interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca dismissed suggestions of the player's frustration, emphasizing Acheampong's potential to become a top defender for the team and outlining a long-term plan for his development at Stamford Bridge. The manager expressed his personal admiration for the young player and sees his future as being integral to the club's success, suggesting a loan would only be considered if it aligns with his development.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, issued a stark warning to the U.S., demanding President Trump adopt a more respectful tone toward Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or face serious repercussions. In a post on X, Araghchi threatened that if what he termed "illusions lead to worse mistakes," Iran would not hesitate to unveil its "real capabilities," which would end any delusion about the nation's power. This statement comes in the tense aftermath of U.S. airstrikes on key Iranian nuclear sites and a recently brokered, fragile ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Japan, South Korea, and Australia were notably absent from the annual NATO summit, sending lower-level representatives instead for the first time in four years. This decision is seen by experts as a reflection of growing concerns in the Indo-Pacific region that conflicts in the Middle East are diverting U.S. attention and resources. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reportedly cancelled his trip specifically because a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump seemed unlikely, highlighting the region's focus on its own strategic priorities.</p>

The article profiles Wes Love, a Toronto-area business owner whose company was hit with a punitive tariff, highlighting how the constantly changing rules disrupt operations and investments. This sentiment is echoed by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, as businesses seek stability in a trade relationship where 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.</p>

The vote highlights the deep divisions in Congress over the president's authority and comes amid simmering anger from Democrats who claim they have been given insufficient information about the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood walls, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at a rate of nearly two inches per year. This rate of subsidence is faster than sea-level rise, which researchers warn could degrade the city's flood protection system over time. The study, which used satellite radar data, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new developments, underscoring the urgent need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to protect the low-lying city from future storm surges.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block executive branch policies. The ruling came from a case challenging President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, but the court did not rule on the constitutionality of that specific policy. Instead, the majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, focused on reining in what it described as judicial overreach, a move President Trump hailed as a "monumental victory" for the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican-led budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. Newsom stated the proposed legislation, which includes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients, would be "devastating" and could force the closure of rural hospitals and drive up insurance premiums. The governor's office based its estimates on the impacts of similar work requirements that were briefly implemented in other states, which led to significant drops in enrollment.</p>

This century-old science is being rediscovered as a promising alternative to antibiotics, offering hope against what many experts call a "silent pandemic" of untreatable infections.</p>

The article analyzes how the initial plan, intended to generate quick savings to meet self-imposed borrowing rules, backfired and created political turmoil. This reversal now raises deeper questions about the credibility of the government's overall long-term strategy for welfare reform and whether its focus on short-term fiscal targets is undermining its ability to enact meaningful, structural change.</p>
