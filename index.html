          <p>Mark Zaid, the lawyer who represented a government whistleblower in President Trump's first impeachment case, is suing the Trump administration for retaliatory actions after his security clearance was revoked. Zaid argues the revocation was due to his representation of Brian Murphy, a former Department of Homeland Security intelligence chief, who was crucial to Trump's impeachment in 2019. The lawsuit alleges violations of the Administrative Procedures Act, the First Amendment, and parts of the Fifth Amendment, claiming the decision was a political weapon used against perceived enemies. Zaid seeks reinstatement of his clearance, emphasizing the importance of protecting lawyers' ability to represent clients without fear of retribution.</p>

          <p>A driver has been arrested in Tengzhou, eastern China, after a car struck a crowd of people at a bus stop during the May Day holiday. The incident's details, including the number of casualties and whether it was a deliberate attack, remain unclear. The Tengzhou authorities confirmed the arrest but have not released an official statement, leading to criticism from former Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin, who urged transparency.

          <p>Arsenal's Champions League fate may hinge on which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma, PSG's goalkeeper, they face in their upcoming match. Donnarumma's form has been inconsistent, alternating between outstanding performances and error-prone displays, Arsenal having previously scored twice from crosses in a group-stage victory in October. While his form has improved during PSG's Champions League campaign, weaknesses have been evident in domestic games, with a recent mistake costing them an unbeaten Ligue 1 season. Despite these inconsistencies, Donnarumma has been a formidable opponent for English teams in Europe, showcasing his prowess in stopping penalties and helping Italy win Euro 2020.</p>

          <p>Ferrari is under scrutiny after a disappointing showing at the Miami Grand Prix, with questions arising about team orders and the car's overall performance. Team principal Frederic Vasseur acknowledged the car's pace matched Red Bull and Mercedes during the race but cited poor grid positions as the main issue. The team struggled with new tires, leading to suboptimal qualifying results for Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. Vasseur remains optimistic about upcoming upgrades in Imola and Monaco, hoping stricter rules on front wing deflection will provide a performance reset. Ferrari aims to improve its car's speed and performance to compete with top teams like McLaren. </p>

Both companies are adopting localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses, to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. While prices have increased, many experts remain confident that Temu and Shein will maintain competitive pricing due to their agile supply chains and ability to operate on thin margins. The success of these companies is also attributed to their ability to adapt quickly to consumer trends, making them formidable competitors to established e-commerce sites like Amazon.</p>

This hospitalization marks the first time the former emperor has been admitted since 2012 when he underwent coronary-artery bypass surgery.

          <p>A New York Times guest essay suggests that President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials casts doubt on China's readiness to invade Taiwan by 2027. The removal of two defense ministers and numerous senior officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, raises questions about the competence and reliability of military commanders. This internal turmoil may weaken Xi's appetite for war, providing Taiwan and the United States with more time to strengthen their defenses. However, the article cautions that China's military remains formidable, and the greatest risk lies in miscalculation and overreaction, urging leaders to avoid complacency and recognize Xi's reluctance to engage a scandal-plagued military in battle.</p>

However, stricter rules around officials and their families, as part of the anti-corruption drive, combined with a slowing economy, have made government jobs more appealing.

          <p>Moscow experienced drone attacks that forced airport closures, while Germany is expected to shift its policy toward Russia under incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Merz, from the conservative CDU, holds a more hawkish stance on Russia compared to his predecessor, Olaf Scholz. He supports sending German-made Taurus long-range missiles to Kyiv, and shares his views with new Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, who sees Russia as Europe's most acute threat. Germany is also set to increase military spending under Merz, aiming to enhance deterrence amid concerns about Russian expansionism.</p>

Two million Palestinians are surviving on minimal meals, with signs of starvation becoming more frequent in makeshift clinics. The author accuses Israel of exploiting aid as a tool of war, violating international law and potentially seeking to expel Palestinians. The essay calls for immediate resumption of humanitarian aid, open corridors, and a political agreement to guarantee Palestinian presence, security, and self-determination, emphasizing that sustainable peace requires dignity, freedom, opportunity, and mutual security.</p>

The nonprofit organization Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge has been working for decades to find, exhume, and rebury the remains of German soldiers across Europe. The effort aims to provide a dignified burial to every person who died in the war, regardless of their role, and is seen as a way to close this chapter of history, offering closure to families who have never been able to bury their loved ones.</p>
