          <h2>Cardiologist Identifies Five Foods to Avoid for Children's Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 15:36:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified interventional cardiologist outlines five food categories he avoids feeding his own children due to long-term health risks, particularly for heart disease. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation and train taste buds to crave unhealthy options. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt, and using an air fryer to achieve a crispy texture for foods.</p>

          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut made a triumphant return to the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, reclaiming his title on the Fourth of July after a one-year ban. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in the ten-minute period, securing his 17th career victory in the iconic Coney Island event, though he did not surpass his 2021 world record of 76. Chestnut's return was highly anticipated following a contractual dispute that kept him out of the 2024 competition, making this win particularly significant for him and his fans. The women's competition saw reigning champion Miki Sudo continue her dynasty, earning her 11th victory.</p>

          <h2>Filmmaker Ken Burns Discusses the Global Significance of the American Revolution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 15:29:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history, primarily because it introduced the concept of a 'citizen' rather than a 'subject.' He argues that the Declaration of Independence 'turned the world upside down' by establishing the principle that all people have unalienable rights, setting a precedent for subsequent revolutions globally. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, also emphasized the importance of embracing America's complicated history, including the fact that the Declaration's promises did not initially apply to women, enslaved people, or Native Americans, as this complexity makes the nation's story richer.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains at the site of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at a facility for Devastating Pyrotechnics, left seven people unaccounted for, and officials are now working to identify the remains. The explosion also sparked multiple grass fires, burning approximately 80 acres. Investigations have revealed that the business, tied to a county sheriff's lieutenant and a volunteer firefighter, lacked the necessary local permits to store fireworks on the agricultural property. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is assisting in the investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Multiple economists are voicing significant concern that a newly passed tax and spending bill will dangerously increase the national deficit, which is already at record levels. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the measure will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years, a forecast the White House disputes. Experts warn this level of debt could lead to higher interest rates for consumers on mortgages and car loans, while also limiting the government's ability to respond to future economic crises. They fear it could create a 'doom loop' of rising debt and interest rates, potentially forcing painful austerity measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A trial has begun for two brothers accused of assaulting three police officers at Manchester Airport, an incident that allegedly started with a confrontation at a Starbucks. Prosecutors claim Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, headbutted and punched another man in the coffee shop before he and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, 26, resisted arrest in the terminal's car park. The subsequent altercation resulted in injuries to the officers, including a broken nose for one. The defendants deny the charges, claiming self-defense, but the prosecution asserts that CCTV footage will clearly show their 'high level of violence' was unlawful.</p>

          <p>A new provision in a major budget package signed into law will eliminate federal income taxes on tips for many service industry workers. The measure creates a new deduction, though it does not affect state, local, or payroll taxes, and is set to expire in 2028 unless renewed by Congress. The White House projects this will increase the average take-home pay for eligible workers by over $1,600 annually. However, critics and policy experts note that the deduction will not benefit the lowest-earning tipped workers, who often have no federal income tax liability to begin with, and suggest that raising the minimum wage would be a more effective way to help low-wage employees.

This surge, driven by new brands like BYD and established ones like MG, comes as other Western nations, including the U.S. and EU, have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The UK has not followed suit, creating a major opportunity for Chinese automakers who are seen as producing innovative and competitively priced vehicles. The trend has prompted some industry leaders to warn that the UK's domestic industry may struggle to compete without new government measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton expressed optimism for a strong performance at the British Grand Prix after his Ferrari challenged the dominant McLaren team during Friday practice at Silverstone. McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time, but Hamilton was close behind in third, giving him hope that he can 'dream of a strong weekend' at his home race. The nine-time Silverstone winner noted he is feeling much more comfortable in the Ferrari car this season. His teammate Charles Leclerc also showed strong race simulation pace, suggesting Ferrari could be a significant threat to both McLaren and Red Bull.</p>

          <p>High-profile left-wing MP Zarah Sultana has quit the Labour Party, announcing her intention to help launch a new political party with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn welcomed her decision, he indicated that discussions for a new party are still in the early stages, suggesting Sultana's announcement was premature. Nevertheless, the project is underway, aiming to capture a perceived gap to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour. Polling suggests such a party could gain up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters, which could significantly impact the UK's political landscape.</p>

Critics, including former agency officials, condemned the communication as partisan and warned that it could erode public trust in official government channels.

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement to end President Trump's lawsuit over a '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris, a deal seen as crucial for the company's pending sale to Skydance Media. The settlement, which includes legal fees and a contribution to Trump's future presidential library, was the result of months of high-stakes negotiations involving company executives, prospective buyers, and powerful intermediaries. Paramount successfully resisted demands for a larger payout and a public apology but faced intense pressure to resolve the lawsuit, which was complicating regulatory approval for its sale. The agreement also prevents Trump from suing over a separate, more recent '60 Minutes' segment.</p>

          <p>Health experts are detailing the significant physiological stresses involved in competitive eating, though long-term effects remain largely unknown due to the sport's novelty. Gastroenterologists explain that eaters train their stomachs to expand massively, potentially leading to permanently stretched muscles and impaired gastric emptying. A 2007 study showed a competitive eater's stomach distending into a 'food-filled sac' after consuming 36 hot dogs. Besides the risk of choking, competitors face immediate gastrointestinal distress and potential jaw arthritis, while the massive intake of sodium and fat can spike blood pressure and stress the kidneys and other organs.</p>

The Anti-Defamation League called the term 'extremely offensive and dangerous,' emphasizing that words from leaders matter.

The goal is to introduce greater genetic diversity and thermal tolerance, helping the reef ecosystem become more resilient to the effects of climate change.
