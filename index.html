          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation to ban travel from specific countries, citing national security risks. The ban fully restricts entry from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. It partially restricts entry from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela, but exceptions are allowed for lawful permanent residents, adoptions, dual nationals, and those traveling on diplomatic, U.N., or NATO visas, among others. White House officials stated the action is due to a high level of risk to the United States, with the ban following an attack in Boulder, Colorado. The new restrictions are intended to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors who may seek to cause harm.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities are investigating the use of a generative artificial intelligence chat program in planning the bombing of a Palm Springs fertility clinic. Guy Edward Bartkus, the primary suspect, allegedly used the AI program to research explosives using ammonium nitrate and fuel. This marks the second case this year where AI has been implicated in assisting with a bombing or attempted bombing, highlighting growing concerns about the misuse of AI technology. Tech companies are increasingly taking shortcuts in safety testing of AI models before public release, spurring development around consumer-facing AI services. OpenAI and Anthropic have recently unveiled new safety measures to evaluate and limit the misuse of their AI models.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, describing it as a "disgusting abomination" and urging Americans to tell lawmakers to "kill the bill". Musk argues that the bill would increase the US budget deficit and burden citizens with unsustainable debt, marking his first public disagreement with Trump since leaving his role in the administration. The White House responded by calling assertions that the bill would lead to higher deficits a "hoax", while Republican lawmakers downplayed Musk's comments. The bill, which includes tax breaks and increased defense spending, is facing opposition from both fiscal conservatives and some Democrats.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to discontinue the Transportation Security Administration's "Quiet Skies" program, a domestic surveillance program for travelers. The program, which began in 2010, aims to identify travelers who could present an elevated risk to aviation security using various data and monitoring techniques. Critics have long condemned the program for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes, and the criteria for inclusion and removal from the Quiet Skies list have remained largely concealed from the public. The decision to end the program comes after debates about its uneven application and concerns about its impact on civil liberties.</p>

Frederiksen's party adopted hardline policies traditionally associated with the political far-right to win votes, arguing that high migration levels threatened public services.

          <p>Despite data indicating that college graduates earn more than non-graduates, skepticism about the value of a college degree persists in America. Confidence in higher education has fallen sharply, particularly among Republicans, and only a minority believe a four-year degree is essential for a well-paying job. The unemployment rate for recent graduates is at its highest since July 2021, but this is also attributed to post-pandemic economic patterns. Research suggests that the earnings gap between college and high school graduates has remained consistent since 2010, with low-income students seeing a declining relative value in a college education.</p>

          <p>Egypt's foreign minister assured Greece that Egypt will preserve the spiritual and religious value of the historic Saint Catherine's Monastery, which is part of the Greek Orthodox church. The statement came after an Egyptian court ruling raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders about the monastery's fate. The court ruled that the monastery sits on public land but affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites in the area. Saint Catherine's Monastery, established in the sixth century, holds immense religious and historical significance as the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery.</p>
