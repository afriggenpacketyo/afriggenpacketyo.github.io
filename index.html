          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer and folk festival, has officially opened in Munich, Germany. Mayor Dieter Reiter initiated the festivities by tapping the first beer keg, a long-standing tradition marking the start of the event. The festival, which runs from September 20 to October 5, is a major tourist attraction for Germany, with organizers expecting to welcome over six million visitors. Attendees can enjoy numerous beer tents, amusement rides, and traditional Bavarian food, though they may face record-high prices for a mug of beer this year.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack has disrupted operations at several major European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack targeted Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of RTX Corp., which provides essential check-in and boarding system software called MUSE. As a result of the system outage, airports were forced to revert to manual check-in and boarding processes, leading to substantial delays and flight cancellations. Collins Aerospace confirmed it is actively working to resolve the cyber-related disruption and restore full functionality to its systems as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>Advocacy groups for immigrant rights are bracing for a potential federal crackdown after the Trump administration threatened to criminally prosecute non-profits it deems to have 'leftwing' sympathies. The rhetoric, intensified after the killing of activist Charlie Kirk, includes vows from senior aide Stephen Miller to hold such organizations 'criminally liable' for what he baselessly termed 'coordinated attacks' on ICE agents. In response, organizations are advising staff on their legal rights while documenting immigration enforcement actions, asserting they will not be intimidated or abandon their First Amendment rights to observe and report.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, critics argue the Trump administration is using the tragedy as a pretext to suppress dissent and target political adversaries. The administration has escalated threats against 'radical left' groups, considering domestic terrorism classifications and vowing to dismantle non-profit networks, despite no evidence linking them to the killing. Political scientists warn this response mirrors authoritarian tactics, where a violent event is leveraged to crack down on civil liberties and delegitimize mainstream opposition. The administration maintains its focus is on preventing further political violence.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has intensified its conflict with 'sanctuary states' by threatening legal action against California, New York, and Illinois for not complying with ICE detainer requests. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding the states cooperate or face lawsuits from the Department of Justice and potential cuts to federal funding. These states have laws limiting cooperation with ICE, arguing it fosters trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. The administration contends these policies release dangerous individuals and obstruct federal immigration enforcement, forcing more aggressive street-level arrests.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is facing criticism from both Democrats and some conservatives regarding his management of the investigation into the assassination of activist Charlie Kirk. Patel's early missteps, including a premature announcement of a suspect in custody, and his performative social media presence have drawn concern. While some in the MAGA base desire a more aggressive purge of the FBI's 'deep state,' others question his competence. Despite the internal and external pressures, Patel appears to retain the support of President Trump, who values his combative style and his willingness to publicly confront political opponents.</p>

          <p>Mass protests in Nepal, largely organized by Gen Z activists, have resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli and the appointment of the country's first female prime minister, Sushila Karki. The movement was fueled by widespread anger over government corruption and high youth unemployment, which was amplified by a social media campaign highlighting the lavish lifestyles of political elites. After the government suspended social media, protests escalated, leading to violent clashes that left over 70 people dead. The upheaval reflects a broader trend of youth-led activism across South Asia demanding political accountability.</p>

While traditionally harvested from forests, local NGOs like Farms for Orphans are now commercially raising the larvae to supply orphanages and markets.

          <p>Athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, including Great Britain's Keely Hodgkinson, have raised concerns about the logistics of the warm-up facilities. The main warm-up area is located in Yoyogi Park, a 15-minute bus journey from the main stadium, which athletes describe as draining and disruptive to their pre-competition routines. World Athletics President Lord Coe acknowledged the situation is 'not perfect,' explaining that the track used during the Olympics was no longer available. He stated that organizers have done everything possible to manage the transport and traffic challenges to make the experience as smooth as possible.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first elections since the fall of the Assad dictatorship, employing a complex indirect system to form a new parliament. Due to the displacement of millions and fragile infrastructure, citizens will not vote directly; instead, appointed electoral colleges will select 121 members of the People's Assembly. An additional 70 members will be directly appointed by interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa, a point of major controversy. While the process includes some positive steps toward diversity, critics and minority groups argue it gives excessive power to the president and lacks genuine democratic legitimacy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order mandating a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas, which are used to hire skilled foreign workers. The administration cited 'abuse' of the program as the reason for the drastic fee increase, which is set to take effect on September 21. This policy aims to compel companies to prioritize hiring American workers over foreign talent. Critics, including immigration lawyers and business groups, warn that the exorbitant fee will price out small businesses and startups, potentially damaging U.S. competitiveness in the technology sector and other industries.</p>

The event, expected to draw tens of thousands, has been designated a high-security event by Homeland Security.

While Starbucks provided two free shirts, employees argue this was insufficient and that they incurred out-of-pocket expenses to comply with the new rules.

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has exposed a deep divide in how Americans interpret major news events, a gap largely fueled by social media. Immediately following the shooting, different political communities online crafted competing narratives about the killer's motivations, bending emerging facts to fit their worldviews. Experts note that social media algorithms incentivize being first over being accurate, rewarding extreme content and creating fragmented realities. This dynamic complicates a shared understanding of the event, as nuance is lost in favor of narratives that confirm pre-existing biases for different online audiences.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book explores 'limerence,' a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. While this state can be a normal part of early love, it can become a form of 'person addiction' when a healthy bond is not possible, often due to uncertainty or incompatibility. Bellamy suggests strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact with the person and actively reframing positive daydreams into negative 'daymares.' He also emphasizes finding new goals and sources of personal fulfillment to redirect the brain's reward system and move past the obsession.</p>

However, other research indicates that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as the technology can create pressure to be constantly productive and take on more work. Experts emphasize the need for balance, warning that without proper management and time for mental rest, AI could inadvertently fuel the problem it is meant to solve.</p>

          <p>Russia is hosting the final of its Intervision song contest, a revived Soviet-era competition positioned as a conservative counterpoint to the Eurovision Song Contest. Banned from Eurovision since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia aims for Intervision to promote 'traditional values' and 'national identity.' The event features artists from 23 countries, including BRICS partners like China and Brazil, but few European nations. Russian officials have framed the contest as a rejection of what they describe as the 'perversions' of Western culture, particularly Eurovision's embrace of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan since February, have been released and are returning to the United Kingdom. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, running a charitable training program. Their release was secured after negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the reason for their detention. Their son expressed his gratitude for their release, noting his parents' deep affection for Afghanistan and their hope to potentially return.</p>

          <p>Estonia has invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty to request urgent consultations with allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. This marks the second time this month a NATO member has sought such consultations due to Russian actions. NATO jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden were scrambled to intercept and escort the Russian aircraft, which were flying without transponders or flight plans. Russia has denied the violation, but NATO described it as another example of 'reckless Russian behaviour,' escalating tensions along the alliance's eastern flank.</p>

          <p>The building housing ABC10, a television station in Sacramento, was struck by at least three rounds of gunfire in what police are investigating as a drive-by shooting.

Police have not released any suspect information or a potential motive for the attack. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned the act, stating that 'any act of violence toward journalists is an attack on our democracy itself.'</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw made his final regular-season start at Dodger Stadium to standing ovations, a day after announcing his retirement at the end of the season. In a poignant moment, his teammates remained in the dugout to let him take the mound alone and soak in the applause from the sell-out crowd. The 37-year-old veteran pitched 4⅓ innings in a game the Dodgers would go on to win 6-3 against the San Francisco Giants. The victory also officially clinched the Dodgers' 13th consecutive postseason berth, capping an emotional and celebratory night in Los Angeles.</p>

          <h2>Rapid Weight Loss from Injections Leaves Some Users with Unwanted Loose Skin</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 01:01:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro have helped many people shed significant weight, some users are now dealing with an unintended consequence: large amounts of loose skin. The rapid weight loss prevents the skin from contracting, leading to sagging on the arms, stomach, and thighs, which can negatively impact self-confidence. Plastic surgeons note that surgery is often the only effective solution, but body-contouring procedures are rarely covered by the NHS and can be prohibitively expensive privately. This leaves many individuals who have successfully improved their health facing a new and costly cosmetic challenge.</p>
