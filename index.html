          <p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have initiated an investigation after fans allegedly made racially charged comments toward Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green during a playoff game. According to a statement released by the Timberwolves, one fan was ejected, and another left voluntarily before being identified, prompting further investigation. The team emphasized its commitment to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment, condemning any racist or threatening behavior. Green himself commented after the game that there seemed to be an agenda to portray him as an angry Black man, which he refuted by highlighting his success and education. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100.</p>

          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, and was felt as far away as Atlanta on Saturday morning, according to the New York Times. The tremor occurred in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, an area known for minor earthquakes, although stronger quakes are rare. Seismologists are reviewing data to potentially revise the magnitude of the earthquake. The last notable earthquake in the region occurred in 2018, registering a magnitude of 4.4 but causing minimal damage.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a portion of President Trump's tax agenda, including an increased child tax credit, a higher threshold for estate tax liability, and measures to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, according to Fox News. The legislation aims to prevent a tax increase for millions of Americans if the TCJA were to expire. Key points of contention, such as state and local tax deduction caps and a new millionaires’ tax bracket, are notably absent but could be added through amendments. Trump also seeks to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime wages, and Social Security checks for retirees.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party is preparing to unveil its comprehensive immigration plans, seeking to address public concerns and win back votes amid rising competition from Reform, according to the BBC. The proposed changes include time-limited work visas for jobs not requiring graduate-level skills, stricter English language requirements for overseas workers, and increased scrutiny of companies hiring foreign staff. The government aims to link the immigration system more closely to the labor market, encouraging employers to prioritize hiring UK-based workers. These plans follow increased public concern over both legal and illegal immigration, prompting the government to take action.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, which failed to launch to Venus in 1972, made an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere on Saturday, according to CBS News.

While the exact location of reentry is unknown, experts had anticipated that some parts of the half-ton spacecraft might survive the descent. Launched as part of the Soviet Union's Venus exploration program, Kosmos 482 became stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction.</p>

Some economists believe Powell's cautious approach, given the uncertain impact of tariffs, could lead to delayed action and potential economic consequences. Trump has been urging the Fed to cut rates, but Powell has expressed confidence in the economy and dismissed the idea of pre-emptive cuts. The Fed's historical reluctance to act swiftly has often resulted in being behind the curve, and this time may be no different.</p>

          <p>A Chicago homeowner, Marco Velazquez, discovered squatters in his property and, unable to get immediate police assistance, decided to stay in the home with them, according to Yahoo News. After finding the home he was preparing to sell occupied, Velazquez camped out in the living room with friends and his wife, while the alleged squatters took one of the bedrooms. The next morning, the squatters demanded money to leave, and Velazquez eventually negotiated a cash-for-key deal, fearing a lengthy legal battle. The incident highlights the challenges homeowners face when dealing with squatters and the legal complexities involved.</p>

          <p>Recent actions by Elon Musk's DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) are dismantling federal efforts to control silicosis, a deadly lung disease, according to The Atlantic. DOGE has fired the team responsible for the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program and most of the NIOSH scientists researching safer mining practices. These actions, combined with executive orders promoting coal mining, threaten to reverse decades of progress in protecting workers from silica exposure. The agency's ability to prevent silicosis is under threat as well.</p>

The discovery suggests that Neanderthals possessed advanced technologies beyond stone tools. The spear tip was found in Russia and analyzed by a team led by archeologist Liubov Golovanova. This find joins other recent discoveries that demonstrate Neanderthals developed techniques specific to working with bone, such as scraping and flat cutting.</p>

Critics argue that individuals seeking influence with the president can enrich him by purchasing his cryptocurrency, raising ethical and national security concerns.

          <p>Employers are increasingly hiring part-time staff in place of full-time workers to avoid paying benefits and circumvent labor laws, according to The Atlantic. This trend results in underwork, where employees are not guaranteed a set number of hours and face inconsistent schedules. The ability to schedule low and add more worker hours as needed saves employers money. Congress could address this issue by requiring large employers to set schedules in advance or by incentivizing full-time employment.</p>

This strategy, initiated in 2020, involves tightening international production chains' reliance on China to deter foreign parties from disrupting supplies. To achieve this, China has ramped up exports, deepened its position as a manufacturing base, and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls and blacklists. However, this approach has costs, including strained relations with trading partners and economic challenges for Chinese households.</p>
