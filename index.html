          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has responded to President Trump's executive order aimed at defunding NPR and PBS, asserting that Congress, not the president, controls its funding. CPB emphasized its independence from the federal government, as mandated by Congress. The executive order seeks to block federal funding to NPR and PBS and prevent indirect funding through local stations. PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger warned that the loss of federal funding would disproportionately affect rural communities, potentially impacting children's programming and emergency alerts.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest China faces significant challenges in becoming a credible mediator in the Middle East, particularly in engaging with Syria's new government. Despite Syria's desire to build a long-term strategic partnership with China, Beijing faces a "reputational crisis" and a dilemma in dealing with a government allegedly dominated by UN-identified "terrorists". China's role as a key backer of ousted Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad further complicates its position in the region.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, effective May 20, designed to bolster the country's private economy. The law aims to provide legal recourse for private firms, particularly in disputes with local governments, and to protect them from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely watching the implementation of the law to assess its effectiveness in curbing administrative powers and ensuring fair adjudication of cases against local governments. The 78-article law is the first explicitly created for this purpose.</p>

Changes in diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and better recognition of autism in women and adults are contributing factors.

          <p>The trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree has revealed key evidence, including a video of the incident, a wedge of wood allegedly taken from the tree, and cell site analysis tracking the defendants' movements. Daniel Graham, one of the accused, testified that his co-accused, Adam Carruthers, felled the tree without his knowledge. The felling of the tree sparked international outrage, and the defendants allegedly exchanged messages reveling in the attention before their friendship unraveled.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Kings have been eliminated from the playoffs in the first round by the Edmonton Oilers, continuing a trend of postseason disappointment. Despite a strong regular season, the Kings lost to the Oilers in six games, marking their 11th consecutive season without winning a playoff series. Missed opportunities and defensive struggles contributed to the loss, with the Oilers proving to be the Kings' kryptonite once again. This year's defeat is particularly painful given the team's high expectations and favorable postseason setup.</p>
