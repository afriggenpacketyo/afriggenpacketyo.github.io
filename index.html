        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A jury in Oregon has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault, unlawful sexual penetration, and sexual abuse. The charges stemmed from an incident at a 2021 party where a 21-year-old woman, incapacitated from heavy drinking, was assaulted. Prosecutors argued she was unable to consent, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual. McLemore, who played for several NBA teams including the Portland Trail Blazers, now faces sentencing for the conviction.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched a significant drone and missile attack on Kyiv, injuring at least 14 people and causing damage primarily to residential areas. The assault included at least one Kinzhal hypersonic missile and followed a US announcement of a pause in some arms shipments to Ukraine. President Trump commented on the pause, stating the US must ensure it has enough weapons for itself after the Biden administration "emptied out our whole country." Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expressed hope to discuss the situation with Trump soon.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration ramps up its deportation campaign, new data reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions constitute the fastest-growing segment of the ICE detention population. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently in ICE detention have no criminal record, a number that has nearly doubled since May. This trend appears to contradict administration claims that enforcement actions primarily target "the worst of the worst," indicating a broader scope for arrests and deportations.</p>

Chilean authorities stopped 19-year-old Ethan Guo, alleging he submitted a false flight plan and deviated from it, activating alert protocols. He has been charged with violating Chile's aeronautical code and the Antarctic Treaty. Guo, who has been documenting his journey online, was hoping to set a record and raise money for cancer research.</p>

The passage followed a tense overnight session where GOP leaders worked to secure enough votes, overcoming internal party opposition to changes made by the Senate.
