          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are collaborating on a massive artificial intelligence data campus in Abu Dhabi, which is poised to be the largest facility of its kind outside of the U.S. The project, spearheaded by Emirati firm G42 in partnership with several U.S. companies, will boast a 5-gigawatt capacity and span 10 square miles. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik emphasized that American companies will operate the data centers, providing American-managed cloud services with strong security measures to prevent technology diversion.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio voiced skepticism regarding the potential for productive outcomes from the Ukraine peace talks in Turkey, citing the absence of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Rubio stated that a breakthrough requires direct engagement between Trump and Putin, and expressed concerns about unproductive meetings. The peace talks were initially proposed by Putin, with Zelenskyy agreeing to leader-level discussions; however, both Putin and Trump did not attend the talks which were then pushed to Friday. Trump indicated that Putin's absence was due to a scheduling miscommunication and that no progress could be made until they spoke directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. The bill, if enacted, would provide a maximum refundable credit of $1,700 for 2025, with the credit value increasing with adjusted gross income (AGI) until it reaches $2,000 per child. However, critics argue that the plan excludes millions of low-income children and requires both parents to have a Social Security number, potentially disadvantaging some families. The tax break starts to phase out for married couples with AGI exceeding $400,000 and $200,000 for other taxpayers.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his administration is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key objective of his second term, during a business roundtable in Qatar. However, the details of the deal remain unclear, with both sides far from a consensus on key issues, such as uranium enrichment. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, affirmed that Iran would never give up its right to civilian nuclear energy and would not dismantle its nuclear enrichment facilities. Negotiations, mediated by Oman, have been described as constructive, with both sides signaling intent to secure a deal.</p>

          <p>This article explains credit card debt forgiveness, which involves negotiating with creditors to settle outstanding balances for less than what is owed. While there are no government-sponsored programs for credit card debt elimination, individuals can explore debt settlement programs or bankruptcy as potential solutions. Debt settlement programs involve working with a debt relief expert to negotiate with creditors, while bankruptcy may offer complete debt forgiveness. Other options include debt consolidation loans and debt management programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgium's parliament has voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a law passed in 2003.

Energy Minister Mathieu Bihet hailed the move as paving the way for a realistic and resilient energy model. Belgium currently has two nuclear power plants that generate around 40% of its power, with other European countries also considering a shift towards nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar has sparked ethical concerns and drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle. The article highlights the broader issue of Qatar's influence in American politics and institutions, including financial support for universities and public officials. While not explicitly illegal, these exchanges raise questions about soft corruption and the potential for foreign influence. The author contrasts this with the lobbying efforts of pro-Israel activists, arguing that their advocacy stems from American citizens and not a foreign state.</p>
