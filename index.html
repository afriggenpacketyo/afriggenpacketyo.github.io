          <p>A new $200 million ballroom is being constructed at the White House, funded primarily by private and corporate donors, including Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir. In exchange for contributions, the Trump administration has discussed offering permanent recognition, such as etching donor names into the building's structure. The fundraising effort is being led by a top political fundraiser for the president in conjunction with the Trust for the National Mall, which allows for tax-deductible donations. While President Trump has stated he is also paying for it, the exact amount of his personal contribution has not been disclosed.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has publicly condemned comments made by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr regarding late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, comparing Carr's threat to review ABC's broadcast license to a 'mafioso' shakedown. Cruz, while not a fan of Kimmel, expressed deep concern over the government using its regulatory power to potentially silence media voices it disagrees with, calling the precedent 'dangerous as hell.' This places Cruz at odds with President Trump, who supported the FCC's stance and the subsequent suspension of Kimmel's show. The controversy began after Kimmel's monologue about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>During a close fourth-quarter game between the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins, Amazon Prime's broadcast drew backlash for airing a report on domestic violence allegations against Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill. Sideline reporter Kaylee Hartung detailed the NFL's investigation into claims made in divorce filings, which Hill denies. While the information was relevant, viewers criticized the timing of the segment, which interrupted the flow of a crucial moment in the game. The incident has sparked a debate about the appropriate context and timing for reporting on serious off-field issues during live sports coverage.</p>

In a social media post, Eisner criticized Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for what he termed 'out-of-control intimidation' of ABC and its parent company, Disney. He defended Kimmel as 'very talented and funny' and questioned the state of leadership and free speech in the current political climate. Eisner's statement adds a significant corporate voice to the growing controversy surrounding the FCC's pressure on broadcasters over political commentary.</p>

          <h2>Experts Identify Tariffs, Climate Change, and Labor Shortages as Key Drivers of Rising Grocery Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 14:55:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are facing higher grocery bills due to a combination of three primary factors, according to food industry analysts. The Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods, such as coffee, have increased costs for companies, which are then passed on to shoppers. Additionally, climate change is disrupting traditional agricultural regions, and a shortage of farm labor is further straining the food supply chain. These pressures have led to the fastest monthly increase in food prices since 2022, forcing some households to cut back on spending to afford essential items.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate, U.S. Treasury yields have increased, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high. This counterintuitive market reaction reflects investor sentiment that weighs factors beyond short-term rates, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and government debt. Analysts suggest the rise in yields may be linked to improving GDP estimates and calming concerns about the labor market. Investors are now awaiting the upcoming personal consumption expenditures index for further insight into inflation trends. (not investment advice)</p>

Adair had been arrested for misdemeanor traffic violations a day earlier. The district attorney has not confirmed if Fatherley was the officer who knelt on Adair but stated no one else would be charged.

This number is a substantial increase from the state's decade-long average of one death per year. Officials have recorded at least 26 infections, with most cases involving wound exposure to seawater. Scientists have warned that rising sea temperatures linked to the climate crisis are creating more favorable conditions for the bacteria to thrive.

          <p>Prominent late-night television hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and Jon Stewart, have united in defense of Jimmy Kimmel after his show was suspended by ABC. The hosts used their platforms to criticize the move as an assault on free speech, which followed pressure from the FCC and President Trump over Kimmel's comments on the Charlie Kirk killing. Colbert declared 'we are all Jimmy Kimmel,' while Meyers and Stewart used satire to mock the idea of government-approved comedy. Their collective response highlights a growing concern within the media industry about political pressure and corporate censorship.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appointed George Cook, an official from the Commerce Department, as the new acting director of the U.S. Census Bureau. The leadership change follows the early departure of the previous director, Robert Santos, a Biden appointee who cut his five-year term short in January. This appointment comes as President Trump has controversially called for a 'new' census, despite preparations for the 2030 count already being in progress. The move places a Trump official at the head of the crucial agency responsible for the nation's decennial population count.</p>

The confirmation fills an eight-month vacancy in the critical diplomatic role just before world leaders convene for the UN General Assembly. Waltz's confirmation proceeded despite earlier controversy over his involvement in a security leak regarding a military strike. During his hearing, Waltz emphasized the need for major reform at the UN but stressed the importance of U.S. participation to counter the influence of China and Russia on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has led to a drop in mortgage rates, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $750,000 mortgage, the monthly payment at the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.13% is approximately $4,560. This is over $450 less per month compared to the payments at the 7.04% rates seen at the beginning of 2025, translating to over $160,000 in interest savings over the life of the loan. The rate reduction enhances affordability for new buyers and presents a compelling refinancing opportunity for existing homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, stated that he supports two additional interest rate cuts before the end of the year. He believes the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be a 'one-time effect' rather than a persistent pressure, creating room for more accommodative monetary policy. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation running above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized that while the central bank is not comfortable with 3% inflation, the current economic conditions warrant further rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>
