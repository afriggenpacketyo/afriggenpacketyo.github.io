        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced a 5% price decline to $4,588.85 on Monday, erasing gains from a weekend rally that saw it hit a new record of $4,954.81. This market shift followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hints at upcoming rate cuts, which initially boosted crypto assets but also triggered over $245 million in forced selling of long ETH positions. Bitcoin also fell over 1% to $111,501.74, reaching its lowest level since July 10. Despite this volatility, Ether has shown strong leadership in the crypto market recently, driven by regulatory tailwinds, growing interest in stablecoins, and significant corporate accumulation, with its ETFs attracting substantial inflows while Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows.

          <p>Washington D.C. students are returning to school amidst President Trump's deployment of over 2,000 National Guard troops, a move Mayor Muriel Bowser deems unnecessary for student safety. Bowser asserts the city's existing safe passage programs are sufficient, noting a prior decrease in crime rates, and believes federal agencies are not needed for school transport. While the Metropolitan Police Department Chief acknowledges some safety improvements from federal agents, the presence of military-style vehicles and troops at Metro stations raises new questions for student commutes. This article highlights the ongoing tension between local and federal authorities regarding public safety and resource allocation, with both D.C. and Philadelphia officials prioritizing community-led safety initiatives for their respective school districts.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders confirmed his visible frustration after being benched by head coach Kevin Stefanski before a game-winning drive in a preseason victory against the Rams. Despite a challenging performance with five sacks, Sanders, who took over in the second half, expressed his strong desire to lead the final two-minute drive, seeing it as an opportunity to be an "alpha." Stefanski defended his decision, citing the plan to use Tyler Huntley, who was later cut from the roster, and downplayed any suggestions of sabotaging Sanders' development. The article notes Joe Flacco has been named the Week 1 starter, with the backup quarterback situation still uncertain as the team finalizes its 53-man roster.</p>

Hamas-run Civil Defence stated that several people died in an initial strike, with more fatalities occurring during a second strike as rescuers arrived. The Israeli military and prime minister's office offered no immediate comment, while the UN's human rights office condemned the attack as a grave breach of international law. This article highlights the severe risks faced by civilians and media personnel in conflict zones, especially after a similar incident two weeks prior killed six journalists near another Gaza hospital.</p>

This article highlights the historical gendered adaptations in sports, such as softball for girls and limited-contact lacrosse, which often reflect outdated views of female physical limitations. Critics argue that while feminist progress has advanced women's sports, society has not adequately addressed the health dangers of narrow masculinity for boys, including the high risk of degenerative brain diseases like CTE. The piece suggests it is time to re-evaluate why boys play tackle football, advocating for a shift towards safer alternatives like flag football for all youth.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, initially for diabetes, are now widely used for weight loss and show promise for various conditions, from cardiovascular disease to addiction. With more than one in 10 Americans already using them and cheaper versions on the horizon, this article explores the potential societal shift into an "Ozempic era." The core unanswered question revolves around the drugs' mysterious ability to control compulsions and how modulating desire might impact fundamental human emotions, joy, and the broader human experience over decades.

This article highlights a broader challenge for child care activists in states like Montana and Connecticut, where initial funding victories can lead politicians to prematurely claim success, making it harder to advocate for necessary further investments.

Polling data indicates a vast majority of Democrats disapprove of Israel's actions and support a ceasefire, with Gaza being a top issue for many voters who supported Biden in 2020 but are now reconsidering.

The study also differentiated between "liking" and "wanting" the cleaning, suggesting dopamine's role in motivation.

          <p>France has formally summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to Paris after he sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging France was not doing enough to combat antisemitism. The French foreign ministry called Kushner's allegations "unacceptable" and a violation of international law against interfering in internal affairs, while the U.S. State Department stood by the ambassador's comments. Kushner's letter claimed French statements on Israel and Palestinian state recognition "embolden extremists" and endanger Jewish life in France, a country home to Europe's largest Jewish population. This article highlights a significant diplomatic spat, adding to existing tensions between France and the U.S. over trade, UN peacekeepers, and support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential resurgence of left-handed players at the US Open, highlighting Ben Shelton and Jack Draper as key contenders who could challenge the dominance of top-ranked right-handers. Historically, lefties enjoyed a significant advantage in tennis, particularly at the US Open from 1974-1984, but their presence in Grand Slam finals has dwindled since. The piece delves into the inherent advantages left-handers possess, such as unique ball trajectories and spins that confound right-handed opponents. With both Shelton and Draper enjoying career-best years and armed with powerful serves and all-around games, the article suggests a "lefty renaissance" could be underway, adding new dynamics to the sport.</p>

Lee expressed reluctance to easily agree to this shift, as South Korea views North Korea as its primary threat and seeks to avoid entanglement in a conflict with China. This article highlights the delicate balance Lee must strike, also grappling with the formidable challenge of finalizing a trade deal that includes a $350 billion investment pledge in the U.S., largely through loans and guarantees, to lower tariffs on South Korean exports.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has expressed concern over the U.S. labor market, hinting at potential interest rate cuts after government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and weaker payroll gains. This article identifies three red flags: fewer workers being hired, a surge in long-term job seekers, and a jump in unemployed young workers. Labor experts caution that more pain could be in store, as companies delay hiring due to headwinds like new U.S. tariffs and artificial intelligence adoption. The piece suggests that while the unemployment rate remains low, it is a backward-looking statistic, and the current job market presents a challenging outlook for job seekers.</p>

          <p>An investigation by KFF Health News reveals that the Trump administration's interference, including communication freezes, data censorship, and staff layoffs, severely hampered the CDC's response to a major measles outbreak in Texas. This article highlights how the stifling of CDC experts led to delays in local public health outreach, contributing to the worst U.S. measles outbreak in over three decades, sickening over 4,500 and killing at least 16. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. further fueled vaccine doubt and promoted unproven vitamin A treatments, exacerbating the crisis in undervaccinated communities.

While experts acknowledge some cardiovascular benefits and increased calorie burn, the research does not strongly support claims for significant bone density or muscle strength improvements. Exercise science researchers emphasize that traditional resistance training with weights is far more effective for muscle growth. The article advises caution against over-relying on weighted vests for bone and muscle health, especially for women in menopause, and suggests prioritizing proven weight-bearing exercises, though it notes their use can motivate physical activity.</p>

While researchers credit the charter model and the willingness to close underperforming schools for these gains, opinions remain mixed among parents, and challenges persist regarding equitable access and the limits of school closure as a strategy.
