          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, emphasizing the need for international collaboration on trade despite rising tariffs and barriers. Li stated that globalization is irreversible and urged countries not to politicize trade or view it as a security issue. He called for countries to stay on the "right" path and engage in the international economy to reshape global rules and order. Adam Tooze from Columbia University interpreted Li's remarks as a call for a pluralization of processes in shaping the global order, emphasizing process over centralized control. Optimism for international trade relations is somewhat tempered given the current geopolitical landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government expressed concerns that contacting victims of the Post Office scandal who haven't sought compensation might be perceived as harassment. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) reported that many wrongly accused sub-postmasters are yet to receive fair redress, despite over Â£1bn paid out. Chris Head, a former sub-postmaster and OBE recipient, criticized the compensation processes, citing under-compensation for severely affected individuals. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) agreed to consult the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board regarding follow-up letters to potential Horizon Shortfall Scheme applicants, aiming to balance outreach with sensitivity. The scandal, involving wrongful prosecutions due to the faulty Horizon IT system, is described as the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history. This event is certainly a tragedy and the tone of the article is appropriately critical of the government's handling of the situation.</p>

          <p>Jordan's men's national football team has qualified for their first World Cup, generating excitement and inspiring the women's team to strive for the 2027 Women's World Cup. The women's team narrowly missed qualifying for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments, but they aim for a top-six finish in the 2026 Asian Cup to secure a spot in Brazil 2027. Jordan launched its women's program in 2005, and it has steadily grown, with more women participating as players, coaches, referees, and administrators. The men's World Cup qualification is expected to bring financial benefits to the Jordan Football Association, which could lead to increased opportunities and investment in the women's game. This development is certainly a positive one for the sport in Jordan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission. Downing Street describes this as the most significant strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation. These jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The decision, to be announced at the NATO summit in the Netherlands, has been praised by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and is expected to support 20,000 jobs across the UK supply chain. The move reflects concerns about evolving nuclear risks and the need for a strong deterrent, although the potential reliance on the US for the use of nuclear weapons may be contentious. The increased military spending and nuclear capabilities are a reflection of current geopolitical tensions.</p>

He has a history of staging productions involving children and young people, with some videos uploaded to a YouTube account that garnered millions of views before being removed following BBC's alert to Google.

          <p>President Trump initially celebrated a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, but quickly became angered by subsequent violations from both sides. He criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the violations, using strong language. Trump also lashed out at CNN and MSNBC for questioning the extent of damage to Iranian nuclear facilities, accusing them of undermining the work of U.S. pilots. He defended the success of the U.S. military strikes, despite reports suggesting the damage may only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months.

          <p>The debate over the origins of COVID-19, whether from natural origins or a lab leak, is more about public distrust of science than a right-wing conspiracy. While some dismiss the lab leak theory as misinformation, many credible scientists believe the question is unsettled due to China's lack of transparency. The controversy reflects anxieties over virus research, especially gain-of-function studies, and a perception that scientists have not adequately addressed public concerns. The author argues that trust must be cultivated through transparency, accountability, and humility, rather than simply presenting more facts. Public trust in science is essential for addressing future health crises.</p>

          <h2>China and India Shift to Higher-Grade Coal, Reducing Indonesian Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 02:00:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China and India, major thermal coal importers, are reducing their imports from Indonesia in favor of higher-energy grades from other regions. This shift is due to a global price drop making higher-quality coal more competitive. Mongolian coal in China and South African coal in India have benefited, reaching record shares in these markets. Overall, Chinese coal imports fell nearly 10%, while Indian imports dropped more than 5%, with Indonesian exports being the most affected. This shift reflects a focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wimbledon 2025 marks the first year without line judges in its 148-year history, as electronic line calling is introduced. While traditionalists may miss the presence of line judges and their iconic uniforms, technology fans will likely welcome the change. The move has been implemented at other tournaments, and players and umpires have become accustomed to the new setup. Some argue that the absence of line judges will diminish the unique character of Wimbledon. This change is a sign of the times.</p>

          <p>State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary after a strong showing in the first round, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded earlier. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum through social media and younger voters. Cuomo, seeking a political comeback, conceded and indicated he might run as an independent in the general election. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race proceeds to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate reaching 50%, with comprehensive results expected on July 1.
