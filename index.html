          <p>Microsoft has laid off 830 employees in Washington state as part of a broader plan to eliminate 9,000 jobs globally. The cuts affected various departments, including game design, research, legal, and cloud solutions architecture. This move is part of the company's effort to increase cost efficiencies and refocus on new technologies, occurring even as its cloud services division continues to show strong revenue growth. The layoffs have been publicly acknowledged by many former employees on social media.</p>

          <p>A series of accidental fireworks explosions in California has resulted in one death and multiple critical injuries ahead of the Fourth of July. In Simi Valley, a person was found dead in a garage fire where fireworks were detonating, while a separate incident in Hayward critically injured two people in a home suspected of illegal fireworks manufacturing. These events follow a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse near Sacramento, highlighting the dangers of illegal pyrotechnics and prompting officials to urge the public to leave displays to professionals.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has criticized the Home Office for its failure to track whether foreign workers on skilled worker visas are leaving the country or remaining illegally after their visas expire. Since the visa route was introduced in 2020, 1.18 million people have used it, but the government has not analyzed exit data to monitor compliance. The report also highlighted evidence of worker exploitation and accused the department of being ineffective in tackling abuses within the system, which was expanded to address post-pandemic labor shortages.</p>

          <p>Edward Kelley, a man pardoned by former President Trump for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been sentenced to life in prison for a separate conspiracy. Prosecutors stated that Kelley planned to attack FBI agents and incite a "civil war," creating a "kill list" of 36 law enforcement personnel. Although his Jan. 6 offenses were pardoned, the pardon did not cover the subsequent charges in Tennessee. The court found him to be remorseless and a continuing threat, highlighting a case where a presidential pardon did not prevent a severe sentence for other crimes.</p>

Nonpartisan analysis predicts these changes could cause millions to lose benefits and will add over $3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade.

While there has been some progress, such as securing a U.S. tariff deal and modestly reducing hospital waiting lists, the government faces major challenges. Correspondents note that economic growth remains sluggish, net migration is high despite new restrictions, and promised reforms in social care have been delayed. The analysis suggests that while the government has managed some successes, it has also made U-turns and struggled to meet its ambitious goals amid difficult domestic and global conditions.</p>

          <p>Famed Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles and is slated for deportation. U.S. officials state that he has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for alleged involvement in organized crime and is affiliated with the Sinaloa drug cartel, claims his lawyer denies. The arrest follows a history of legal issues in the U.S., including a conviction for illegal firearm possession. Officials cited his alleged criminal ties and fraudulent statements on immigration applications as grounds for his removal from the country.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, a Member of Parliament for Coventry South, has announced her resignation from the Labour Party to establish a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was suspended from Labour last year, cited the current government's policies on Gaza, poverty, and welfare as key reasons for her departure. She stated that the new party aims to challenge a "broken" political establishment and offer a socialist alternative. The move signals a further fracturing of the UK's left-wing political landscape following recent internal divisions within the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>The Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans has filed a lawsuit against the board overseeing Stone Mountain Park, home to the nation's largest Confederate monument. The suit alleges that plans to create an exhibit detailing the site's ties to slavery, segregation, and the Ku Klux Klan violate a state law that protects the monument. The "truth-telling" exhibit was proposed in 2021 as part of a broader effort to provide historical context to the controversial carving. This legal challenge represents the latest battle over the interpretation and memory of the Confederacy in the American South.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing for the deportation of eight noncitizens who were being held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The men will be sent to South Sudan, a country with which most have no connection and where they may face perilous conditions. This decision follows a previous ruling that permits the government to deport migrants to third countries without extensive due process. The court's liberal justices dissented, arguing the ruling gives the administration special treatment and disregards the potential for torture or death faced by the deportees.</p>

          <p>This opinion article proposes a method to make popular anti-obesity drugs like GLP-1s more accessible and affordable for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons and having manufacturers charge health plans a transparent, lower price, similar to what they offer directly to consumers. Employers could then contribute to the cost, bringing the employee's out-of-pocket expense down to levels seen in other countries. This approach would simplify drug pricing, increase access to clinically important medications, and reduce the administrative burden of prior authorizations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of a major legislative package, a new provision will allow tipped workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their annual taxable income. This policy, a key campaign promise, is temporary and set to expire at the end of 2028 unless extended by Congress. The exemption is designed to benefit most tipped workers, with limitations in place for high-earners to prevent misuse. While supporters celebrate it as a tax cut for working-class Americans, some economic analysts argue it will have a limited impact and primarily benefit middle-to-upper income earners, not the lowest-paid workers.

          <p>An investigation has uncovered a widespread and organized trade in illegal cigarettes across the UK, linking high street mini marts to international crime gangs. These shops sell counterfeit and smuggled tobacco at a fraction of the legal price, costing the UK billions in lost tax revenue. The trade is reportedly connected to more serious crimes, including people trafficking and the exploitation of illegal workers, often from asylum seeker populations. Despite raids, authorities are struggling to combat the problem due to underfunding, the criminals' adaptability, and the high profits involved, fueling a sense of decline on local high streets.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's landmark tax and spending bill was achieved through intense political pressure and last-minute deal-making to win over skeptical Republicans. Trump personally intervened to sway holdouts, while legislative leaders added specific benefits, such as provisions for Alaska's whaling industry, to secure crucial votes. The process involved long, contentious debates and overcoming conservative concerns about the bill's impact on the national deficit and social programs like Medicaid. Ultimately, the party unified just enough to push the massive, transformative legislation through Congress, demonstrating the president's strong influence over the GOP.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature domestic policy bill directs approximately $170 billion towards federal immigration and border enforcement, a historic level of funding for these operations. The legislation allocates tens of billions for expanding immigration detention capacity, hiring more ICE personnel, and completing the border wall. The bill also makes immigration more expensive by increasing fees for processes like asylum applications and appeals, while restricting access to safety net programs for many lawfully present immigrants. Critics argue the funding will fuel a mass deportation campaign and create barriers to due process, while supporters see it as essential for border security.</p>
