          <p>UnitedHealth Group has officially disclosed it is cooperating with Department of Justice criminal and civil investigations regarding its Medicare billing practices. The company made the announcement in a securities filing, stating it proactively contacted the DOJ after media reports of the probes surfaced. This disclosure adds to a turbulent year for the healthcare giant, which has seen its stock price fall and its former CEO abruptly depart. UnitedHealth expressed full confidence in its practices and has initiated a third-party review of its business policies.</p>

          <p>UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated the government understands the public's frustration with the strain the asylum system places on the national housing supply. He acknowledged the issue of the Home Office competing with local councils for temporary accommodation for asylum seekers and homeless individuals. The proposed long-term solutions include building more homes, accelerating asylum claim processing, and reducing small boat crossings. Local councils report being at a breaking point, with spending on temporary housing having increased by over 200% in three years.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old father, Daniel Gunter, has been found guilty of murdering his premature two-week-old baby at Yeovil District Hospital. The infant, Brendon Staddon, suffered catastrophic injuries, including a fractured skull and a broken neck, in the special care baby unit. Gunter had denied harming the child, but a jury at Bristol Crown Court convicted him of murder. The baby's mother was acquitted of causing or allowing the child's death, and investigators described the father's actions as "evil" and noted he showed no remorse.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight committee has voted to subpoena Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, for testimony regarding his sex crimes. The subpoena comes as Maxwell is scheduled to meet with the Department of Justice, reportedly to provide new evidence of alleged government misconduct in her 2021 trial. Her brother confirmed she has new material that could have significantly impacted her trial's outcome. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking of a minor and other federal charges.</p>

President Trump recently extended the divestment deadline to September 17. The administration's plan requires American ownership of the technology and control over the algorithm to allow the app to continue operating.</p>

          <p>A new AFL-CIO report reveals that the pay gap between S&P 500 CEOs and their median workers widened in 2024, with the average CEO earning 285 times more than their typical employee. The article highlights Starbucks' CEO, who made over 6,600 times the average worker's pay. The report links this growing inequality to President Trump's recently passed reconciliation bill, which is projected to give the average S&P 500 CEO a tax cut of nearly $500,000. Critics argue the tax cuts for the wealthy are being funded by cuts to social programs. (not investment advice)</p>

Yekatom, known as "Rambo," was sentenced to a 15-year term, while Ngaissona received 12 years.

          <p>In what is being called the largest operation of its kind, Mexican authorities have dismantled a massive criminal extortion ring with ties to a major drug cartel. The group operated in the State of Mexico, extorting businesses and controlling labor unions across numerous industries. The crackdown, named "Operation Liberacion," involved nearly 3,000 security personnel conducting 52 raids, leading to the arrest of eight alleged leaders. Authorities also seized stolen animals, vehicles, and construction materials, marking a significant blow against the widespread problem of cartel extortion in the country.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has significantly scaled back its 2025 profit forecast, and its third-quarter outlook fell short of analyst expectations, causing its shares to fall. The carrier cited domestic consumer weakness, flat corporate travel demand, and operational issues from storms as key challenges. The airline now projects a 2025 adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, down from a previous forecast of $1.70 to $2.70 in earnings. The news reflects broader concerns in the U.S. domestic travel market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to rescind the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," a legal determination that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare. This finding forms the legal basis for regulating emissions from vehicles and power plants under the Clean Air Act. Its removal would dismantle the federal government's primary tool for addressing the climate crisis. A former EPA official who helped craft the original finding stated that the scientific evidence of harm from climate change has only grown stronger, making the proposed repeal an ignorance of "clear cut" science.</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has introduced a "24-hour economy" policy aimed at transforming the nation's economic landscape and fostering self-sufficiency. The plan involves key industries operating in three eight-hour shifts daily, keeping the economy productive around the clock to create jobs and move away from import dependency. While the vision is to boost GDP and reduce unemployment, experts question its feasibility, citing the need for significant funding (estimated at $4 billion) and improved infrastructure, such as a reliable power supply.

The stated goal is to remove deceased, relocated, or duplicate voters and prevent "illegal immigrants" from being on the rolls. However, critics and opposition parties argue the process disproportionately targets poor, Muslim, and Dalit communities, many of whom lack the required documentation to prove their eligibility.
