          <p>Recent WNBA games have been interrupted by individuals throwing sex toys onto the court, prompting condemnation from players and officials. Chicago Sky's Elizabeth Williams called the acts "super disrespectful," while Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve labeled them a form of sexualization. The league has vowed to ban and prosecute any fan caught engaging in this behavior, which has led to at least two arrests. A meme-coin group claimed responsibility for some incidents as a viral marketing stunt, but not all disruptions appear to be linked to them.</p>

The location of the high-stakes meeting is expected to be announced soon, as officials reportedly work on a deal to end the war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California state Senator Sabrina Cervantes formally recognized transgender high school athlete AB Hernandez for winning state titles in the girls' high jump and triple jump. The ceremony has fueled an ongoing national debate over the participation of transgender athletes in girls' sports. Hernandez's victories at the state finals were met with protests and led to rule changes by the California Interscholastic Federation to ensure female competitors also received appropriate recognition. The issue has also prompted a Title IX lawsuit from the Department of Justice against the state's policies.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Realtor.com reveals that home prices are declining in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering some relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant drops from their 2022 peaks, largely due to increased housing inventory from a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited supply, with cities like Milwaukee seeing substantial increases. This regional divergence is primarily driven by the availability of homes for sale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 90 prominent U.S. Muslim scholars, imams, and organizations have issued a joint statement calling for immediate action from Muslim-majority countries to end the conflict in Gaza. The signatories, including CAIR and the Islamic Society of North America, are urging nations to use their political and economic leverage, suggesting measures like severing ties with Israel and imposing oil embargoes. They argue that the international community has failed to act and that Muslim nations must step in to address the escalating humanitarian crisis. This call comes as Israel announces plans to expand its military operations into Gaza City.</p>

          <p>A former Los Angeles police officer, Eric Halem, has been arrested on suspicion of committing a series of home burglaries in the same San Fernando Valley neighborhoods he once patrolled. Halem, who resigned from the LAPD in 2022 to become a reserve officer, was taken into custody by the Robbery-Homicide Division. This arrest follows a separate, earlier charge of insurance fraud against him related to an elaborate scheme involving a wrecked Bentley. During his LAPD career, Halem also ran side businesses as a security consultant and luxury car renter.</p>

          <p>USC's football program has suffered a significant setback as cornerback Prophet Brown sustained a noncontact injury during practice that will sideline him for the beginning of the season. Brown had been a standout performer in preseason camp and was considered a key part of the defense, with defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn calling him one of the most trusted players. His absence creates a notable gap, particularly at the slot corner position, and will increase pressure on younger defensive backs to step up. The team remains hopeful for his return at some point during the season.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has officially reopened its Carrington training ground after a £50 million, year-long upgrade initiated by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The revamped facility, described as now being "world-class," features an open-plan design to encourage interaction, state-of-the-art medical and data analysis tools, and unique amenities like a barber's room and an F1 simulator. The goal of the investment is to create an elite environment that helps the club compete at the highest level and encourages players to spend more time on their development at the facility, addressing past criticisms that the club's infrastructure was outdated.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old boy, Enoch Palomar, was attacked by a coyote while at a park in Carson, California, to watch his sister's softball game. The boy was playing near a playground when the animal bit and scratched him, requiring 20 stitches on his leg. His mother, Melissa Palomar, ran to his aid and scared the coyote away after hearing her son's screams. The incident was reported to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is investigating. While coyotes typically avoid humans, they can become aggressive in areas where they are conditioned to find food.</p>

          <p>While many major food companies are phasing out synthetic dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5 under the "Make America Healthy Again" initiative, the whitening agent titanium dioxide is often not included in these commitments. This chemical, which makes products like ice cream and salad dressing appear whiter and more vibrant, faces a contentious debate over its safety. The European Union banned it in 2022 out of caution, but U.S. regulators allow it to be labeled simply as "artificial color." The food industry is reluctant to abandon it due to its effectiveness and the difficulty in finding a suitable replacement.</p>

The case revolved around Tonka, a chimpanzee who appeared in several 1990s films. After being ordered to transfer her chimps to a sanctuary due to poor living conditions, Haddix falsely claimed Tonka had died to avoid surrendering him. The chimp was later discovered alive in her basement, and another was found there just last month, leading to her arrest and sentencing.</p>

Starmer had called Israel's decision "wrong," stating it would only lead to more bloodshed and not help secure the release of hostages.

Meta credited its AI-driven ad system for a 22% year-over-year sales increase, while both companies continue to forecast massive capital expenditures on AI. In contrast, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, with Snap struggling after an ad platform update and Pinterest noting a pullback from some advertisers. The trend suggests that larger players with advanced AI are capturing a greater share of the ad market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alex Call, a recent trade deadline acquisition for the Dodgers, has transformed his career by becoming one of Major League Baseball's most difficult hitters to strike out. After a dismal 2019 minor-league season where he struck out in nearly 30% of his at-bats, Call dedicated himself to improving his plate discipline. Using virtual reality training and focusing on his approach, he dramatically cut his strikeout rate and developed a reputation as a "grinder." This overhaul of his offensive skills is what made the defensively versatile outfielder an attractive, low-cost addition for the title-contending Dodgers.</p>
