        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his role in the party's rise. Yusuf, a wealthy businessman, provided financial support and helped broaden the party's appeal by being a minority-ethnic figurehead. He also contributed to building the party's infrastructure. His departure highlights the challenge Reform UK faces in hiring and retaining staff to build a sustainable political organization. The party's history of internal conflicts suggests this will be a difficult task, requiring more than just Nigel Farage's leadership.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk are embroiled in a heated feud, with Trump threatening Musk's government contracts and Musk calling for Trump's impeachment and suggesting his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. The conflict began over Musk's criticism of Trump's legislative agenda. Musk possesses significant resources to retaliate, including funding political challengers. While Trump attempted to de-escalate the situation, the relationship appears damaged, potentially impacting both Trump's political standing and Musk's business interests. The situation underscores the complex dynamics between powerful figures in politics and technology.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a surge of cheap exports, causing concern among Asian economies about potential harm to local industries. However, this influx of low-cost goods could provide relief to inflation-burdened economies, potentially easing the cost-of-living crisis for consumers. Economists suggest that this could allow central banks to consider further rate cuts to stimulate growth. Despite potential trade tensions, the situation presents a silver lining for economies seeking to manage inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered 150 years after his birth as a significant voice for democracy.

After fleeing Nazi Germany, Mann used his writing and radio speeches to critique the German regime and the Holocaust.

          <p>India's central bank has implemented a larger-than-expected interest rate cut, lowering the benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This move, the third consecutive rate cut since February, aims to address softened inflation and lower-than-expected growth amid global uncertainty. The decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, but the central bank maintains its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI also shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral," signaling limited room for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

The issue stems from physical and digital evidence mismanagement, as well as unavailable witness statements.

          <p>The Democratic Party is facing internal discussions about its aging leadership, particularly after recent congressional deaths and health concerns surrounding former President Joe Biden. Some party members are calling for new blood and increased involvement from younger generations. While veteran politicians like Jim Clyburn are defending their experience and contributions, there's growing recognition of the need for a youth movement. This introspection follows electoral defeats and highlights the party's ongoing struggle to balance experience with the need for fresh perspectives.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban has been implemented amid a series of draconian immigration restrictions, raising concerns about its impact on families and refugees. The ban, which targets several countries, follows measures such as suspending the asylum system and ending temporary legal residency for various groups. While this ban was expected, it is likely to face legal challenges and further disrupt immigration processes. Experts note that the administration has normalized such actions, reducing the initial shock and outrage.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour's victory in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election is a good result for the party, but there are caveats to this result. Even after the polls closed the SNP seemed quietly confident of victory, but Labour confounded expectations somewhat. The newest MSP, Davy Russell, is off to Holyrood. Even though he'd faced criticism for avoiding some interviews during the campaign, party insiders insist that his local popularity is what allowed them to squeeze a victory.</p>

          <p>The alliance between President Trump and Elon Musk went up in flames Thursday, days after the world's richest man left the administration and tried to wield his influence to kill a massive budget bill that is central to enacting the president's top legislative priorities. Their spat played out in public and marked another remarkable turn for Musk, who spent tens of millions on Mr. Trump's reelection campaign and was given the reins to slash the size of the federal government.</p>

          <p>Travis Decker, the father accused of murdering his three young daughters near a Washington campground, lacked mental health resources and struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, his ex-wife's attorney told ABC News. Paityn Decker, 9; Evelyn Decker, 8; and Olivia Decker, 5, were killed after they left home for a "planned visitation" with Decker at approximately 5 p.m. on May 30, officials said. The attorney said that Decker -- who was a former member of the military -- struggled with mental health issues, including PTSD, and was unable to receive help through veterans' resources.</p>

          <p>North Korea has launched a warship two weeks after it was damaged during an earlier launch attempt , in an incident that drew harsh criticism from the country's leader Kim Jong Un. The 5,000-tonne destroyer, which was restored to balance earlier this week, was launched on Thursday and is now moored at a pier, state-run news agency KCNA said. It was the result of "absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism", he said. The ship is expected to be fully restored before a ruling party meeting sometime this month, KCNA added.</p>
