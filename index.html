          <p>President Trump has approved Nippon Steel's buyout of U.S. Steel, according to a White House official. This decision reverses President Biden's previous block on the acquisition, which was based on national security concerns.

Following the announcement, U.S. Steel shares surged by more than 20%, reflecting investor optimism about the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Quilcene School District in Washington has voted to maintain sports competition based on athletes' birth gender, defying a state policy that allows transgender students to participate based on their gender identity. This decision has sparked controversy, with some board members arguing that Title IX supports gender-based sports, while others claim it is "immoral" to exclude transgender females. The state's superintendent of public instruction has stated that the district's policy defies state law, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. The WIAA has proposed creating a separate open division for transgender athletes in response to growing concerns.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached an agreement in principle with the Justice Department that will allow the company to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the 737 Max jetliner before two fatal crashes. Under the deal, Boeing will pay and invest over $1.1 billion, including additional compensation for the victims' families. In return, the Justice Department will dismiss the fraud charge in the criminal case against the aircraft manufacturer. This agreement comes after a previous settlement was rejected by a judge, who cited concerns about diversity, inclusion, and equity policies influencing the selection of a monitor.</p>

The ship reportedly damaged a heating pipe in the cabin, but the homeowner considered himself lucky that the ship did not directly hit his house.

          <p>Investing in gold can be a smart move, especially now, but beginners should be aware of a few key factors. Some gold assets, like ETFs, are better bets than others due to lower premiums and easier trading. The price of gold doesn't always rise when expected, so it's important to view it as a long-term hedge. Scams and high premiums are a real risk, so thorough research and reputable dealers are essential. (not investment advice)</p>
