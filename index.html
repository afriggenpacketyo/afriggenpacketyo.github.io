          <p>Following the implementation of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, tens of thousands of Palestinians have begun returning to their homes in Gaza, only to find entire districts destroyed and reduced to rubble. The Israeli military has pulled back troops from key areas like Gaza City and Khan Younis, allowing for the grim task of assessing the damage and searching for bodies. Alongside the fragile truce, the United Nations has received approval to scale up aid deliveries to address severe malnutrition and famine conditions, though many unresolved issues regarding the long-term peace plan remain.</p>

          <p>China's central authorities have issued new guidelines for local governments on the implementation of artificial intelligence, explicitly warning them not to grant AI models access to sensitive data or state secrets. The document outlines approved uses for AI, such as answering public inquiries, monitoring infrastructure with drones, and assisting with administrative tasks like drafting documents. This move aims to improve government efficiency while establishing strict safety protocols, requiring thorough evaluations and training in AI ethics and security before any systems are deployed for official use.</p>

          <p>Doncaster electrician Josh Padley has successfully transitioned into a full-time professional boxer after a life-changing, albeit unsuccessful, fight against world champion Shakur Stevenson. Despite taking the bout on only four days' notice and suffering his first career defeat, the high-profile opportunity earned him a significant payday and a multi-fight contract with a major promoter. Padley, who previously treated boxing as a hobby, credits his readiness to seize the unexpected opportunity for his ability to quit his day job and fully dedicate himself to the sport.</p>

          <p>A surge in arrivals of Chagos Islanders to the UK, seeking to claim British citizenship, has created a financial strain for Hillingdon Council, which is legally obligated to provide temporary housing. The council reports it expects to spend £2 million this year, leading to calls for the central government to provide support. Many Chagossians state they are leaving Mauritius due to safety concerns following the UK's deal to hand over the Chagos Islands, a claim the UK government disputes. The situation highlights the complex legacy of the islanders' forced displacement in the 1960s.</p>

          <p>California is holding a special election for Proposition 50, a measure that would temporarily transfer the power to draw congressional district maps from an independent commission to the state legislature until 2030. Proponents, including Governor Gavin Newsom, argue it is a necessary response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in other states like Texas, potentially adding up to five Democratic seats. However, opponents and some analysts warn that while it may offer a short-term political victory, it could undermine the principle of independent redistricting and provoke national political backlash in the long run.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has formally rejected a proposal from the Trump administration that would have granted it preferential access to federal funding in exchange for adopting certain policies. In a letter, MIT's president stated that the agreement's terms, which included capping foreign admissions and restricting political speech, would curtail freedom of expression and were inconsistent with the university's core values. The proposal, sent to several top universities, has been criticized as an attempt to impose a conservative agenda on higher education.</p>

          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a former Taliban supporter who was radicalized as a teenager in a Pakistani refugee camp, has shared his story of escaping a life of extremism. In a new book, he details how he was lured by promises of martyrdom and glory before becoming disillusioned with the Taliban's cruelty after their initial rise to power in the 1990s. Now living in the UK, he hopes his experience can serve as a warning to young people, emphasizing the importance of questioning extremist ideologies and highlighting the gradual, difficult process of de-radicalization.</p>

          <p>In a move to end a period of political instability, French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after Lecornu had submitted his resignation. The initial resignation came after his newly formed cabinet faced significant resistance from opposition parties in a fragmented National Assembly. Lecornu stated his duty is to provide France with a stable government and a budget, but the reappointment has been met with continued criticism from both far-right and far-left opponents, who are calling for new elections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump underwent what he termed a 'semiannual physical' at Walter Reed medical center, just six months after his last annual exam. A summary from the president's physician described the visit as a scheduled follow-up, stating that Trump is in 'exceptional health' and that his cardiac age was found to be 14 years younger than his chronological age. The checkup, which the White House called routine, comes as the 79-year-old president prepares for an upcoming trip to the Middle East.</p>

The move has been condemned as 'disgraceful' and 'illegal' by union leaders, who have pledged to challenge the firings in court, arguing that federal employees are being used as political pawns.
