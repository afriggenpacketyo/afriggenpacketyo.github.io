          <h2>US Administration Files Lawsuit Against California Alleging Egg Price Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 23:49:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a federal lawsuit against California, Governor Gavin Newsom, and other state officials, claiming the state's stringent regulations on egg production have unlawfully inflated prices nationwide. The suit argues that California's animal welfare laws, which mandate specific living conditions for hens, create unnecessary red tape and violate the federal Egg Products Inspection Act's requirement for national uniformity. This legal action aligns with President Trump's efforts to address rising consumer costs, particularly for staple goods like eggs, which have been significantly impacted by a major bird flu outbreak. The administration contends that while California can regulate its own farms, it cannot impose these standards on eggs imported from other states.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Announces 50% Tariff on Copper Imports Effective August 1</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 23:42:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, following a national security assessment. He justified the move by highlighting copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military equipment, and other essential technologies, noting it is the second most used material by the Department of Defense. The announcement caused an immediate surge in U.S. copper prices, creating a significant premium compared to the global market. While the administration aims to bolster domestic copper production, experts caution that it could take years to increase capacity, potentially leading to short-term shortages and price hikes for consumers.

          <h2>Houthi Rebels Sink Second Cargo Vessel in Red Sea Within a Week, Causing Casualties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 23:39:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have sunk a second cargo ship, the Liberian-flagged Eternity C, in the Red Sea, marking a significant escalation in their attacks on maritime shipping. The vessel was struck by rocket-propelled grenades, resulting in at least three crew members killed and nineteen still missing, though six were rescued after spending over 24 hours in the water. The Iran-backed group claimed the attack was because the ship was heading to Israel and stated they took some crew members to a "safe location." This incident follows the sinking of another vessel, the Magic Seas, just days prior, bringing the total number of ships sunk by the Houthis to four since they began their campaign in November 2023.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident occurred at a summer camp at King Gillette Ranch in Calabasas when a large tree branch fell, killing one child and injuring four other people. The Los Angeles County Fire Department responded to the scene, where one individual was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition and two others sustained moderate injuries. The camp, known as Camp Wildcraft, was taking place near a group of picnic tables where the branch snapped. The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, which manages the park, expressed deep sorrow and has committed to a full investigation alongside the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department to determine the cause of the accident.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the company behind cereals like Fruit Loops and Rice Krispies, skyrocketed by over 50% following reports that it is in advanced acquisition talks with Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. The potential deal, valued at approximately $3 billion, could be finalized as soon as this week and would give Ferrero a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market. This move comes as WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles and significant debt, having been split from its former parent company, Kellanova, in 2023. The breakfast cereal industry faces challenges from shifting consumer preferences towards healthier options and rising operational costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative party, is advocating for a policy that would bar foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits. In an upcoming speech, she will characterize Britain's welfare bill as a "ticking time bomb" and criticize the Labour party for its opposition to welfare cuts. The proposal suggests limiting access to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health-related component of Universal Credit to British citizens, with some exceptions for those covered by international agreements. This move aims to create a clear policy distinction with both Labour and Reform UK, as the Conservatives seek to implement stricter controls on welfare spending amid rising costs.</p>

Despite a slight economic contraction in the first quarter, the central bank prioritized financial stability over immediate growth stimulation.

This tariff is the highest threatened against any single country and comes despite the U.S. having a trade surplus with Brazil.

          <p>A new report from the anti-poverty organization Oxfam highlights staggering wealth inequality in Africa, revealing that the continent's four wealthiest individuals possess more wealth than the bottom 50% of the population, or about 750 million people. The combined fortune of these four billionaires, including Nigeria's Aliko Dangote, stands at $57.4 billion. The report notes that Africa, which had no billionaires in 2000, now has 23, whose collective wealth has grown by 56% in the last five years. Oxfam argues that government policies biased against the poor and ineffective tax systems are exacerbating this disparity, allowing the super-rich to accumulate vast fortunes while impeding poverty reduction efforts.</p>

The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center treated the pelicans and nearly 200 other seabirds during the crisis.

In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where floods killed three people, the area was already on high alert due to recent wildfires that created "burn scars," making the land more susceptible to flooding. In contrast, the ferocity of the flood in Texas, which killed at least 119 people, seemed to catch officials by surprise. Experts note that recent experience with a specific type of disaster, like the wildfires in New Mexico, often informs a community's response and leads to better adaptation and mitigation strategies for related risks.</p>

This pattern has fueled speculation that Chinese goods are being rerouted through regional partners to avoid American duties.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six agents in connection with security failures during the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024. The disciplinary actions, which include suspensions ranging from 10 to 42 days, follow an independent Department of Homeland Security review that found the agency had become "complacent and static." The review identified a series of breakdowns that left the then-presidential candidate vulnerable. The suspended personnel range from line agents to the supervisory level. The incident, which resulted in the death of a rally attendee, led to the resignation of then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was arrested by police while covering a protest and then handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), remains in custody despite being granted bond by an immigration judge. Guevara, who founded the Spanish-language outlet MG News, was detained in June while livestreaming his reporting. Though all local charges were dropped, ICE is appealing his release. From a Georgia detention center, Guevara has issued a statement pleading for his release, stating he is being persecuted for his journalistic work and that his detention is causing hardship for his family. Press freedom organizations have called on ICE to honor the judge's original ruling.</p>

          <p>Bishop Alberto Rojas of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino has issued a decree allowing his parishioners to miss Sunday Mass due to widespread fear of federal immigration enforcement actions. The bishop stated that "fear constitutes a grave inconvenience" for the faithful, and the dispensation will remain in effect until the situation is resolved. This unusual measure comes as an extensive push by the Trump administration has led to nearly 2,800 arrests in the Los Angeles area, causing many in the community to go into hiding. Some churches have reported attendance dropping by as much as half, prompting the bishop to offer this pastoral response.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has not rebounded to its 2019 level, remaining nearly a year lower in 2024. While COVID-19 was the primary driver of the decline during the pandemic's peak, the current shortfall is now largely attributed to drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The research, published in JAMA, shows that the state has only reversed about two-thirds of its pandemic-era loss in life expectancy. Significant disparities persist, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower recovery than white and Asian residents. The findings highlight how the pandemic has exacerbated long-standing health inequities, with income also remaining a major factor in lifespan.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, over her critical investigations into Israel's actions in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused Albanese of spewing antisemitism and supporting terrorism, claims she has consistently denied. The sanctions are part of a broader U.S. campaign against international bodies scrutinizing Israel, including the International Criminal Court. Albanese, who recently called on multinational companies to stop doing business with Israel to avoid complicity in alleged war crimes, described the sanctions as "mafia style intimidation techniques" and vowed to stand firmly for justice. Human rights groups have condemned the U.S. move.</p>

          <p>On the day he was to report to prison, former Representative George Santos made a dubious claim that House Speaker Mike Johnson prevented President Donald Trump from granting him a pardon. Santos, who was sentenced to seven years for federal wire fraud and identity theft, made the allegation on social media without providing any evidence. Many observers quickly pointed out that the Speaker of the House has no authority to block a presidential pardon. Before making the claim, Santos posted a message stating he was not suicidal or depressed, asking his followers to treat any reports to the contrary as lies, citing the dangers faced by gay men in federal custody.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 jobs at NASA, targeting employees in senior-level and specialized management roles. According to documents obtained by Politico, the move is part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government through buyouts and early retirements. The majority of the targeted positions are in core mission areas like science and human space flight, raising concerns that the agency will lose decades of critical experience. This news comes amid proposed budget cuts for fiscal year 2026 that would cancel numerous science programs, a plan that has been condemned by former NASA science chiefs.</p>

          <p>As catastrophic floodwaters rose in Kerr County, Texas, some emergency alerts from the CodeRED system were delayed because dispatchers needed to get approval from a supervisor, according to emergency radio traffic recordings. A former county IT director who helped install the system noted that a firefighter requested an alert be sent to residents an hour into the flood response, but was told to stand by for approval. This delay occurred even as the National Weather Service issued 22 warnings for the area, including a "PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION" alert. Many residents, including a family that narrowly escaped their flooded home, reported never receiving any official local warnings.</p>
