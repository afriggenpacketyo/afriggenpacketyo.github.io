          <h2>Chinese Fossil Study Sheds Light on Bird Flight Evolution</h2>

          <p>A recent Chinese study examining dinosaur feathers trapped in amber provides new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, a crucial development that enabled early birds to surpass dinosaurs in aerial capabilities. The research team analyzed the structure of 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period to understand feather evolution during this time. The study highlights the development of feathers that generate thrust and lift as an essential feature in the evolution of birds, distinguishing them from most feathered dinosaurs that lacked the same flight capabilities. While some ancient dinosaur species could glide or achieve powered flight, modern birds are their direct descendants, and the detailed analysis of these fossilized feathers helps clarify the evolutionary steps that led to avian flight. The article underscores the importance of feathers in the evolution of birds, shedding light on their success in conquering the skies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed an investigation into the Biden administration's use of an autopen to sign presidential documents, alleging a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. Trump's memo instructs the Attorney General and president's counsel to examine whether Biden's aides misused the autopen for executive actions, including pardons and judicial appointments. The order questions the legitimacy of decisions made in Biden's name and suggests that the secret use of a mechanical signature pen would undermine the legality of those actions. Presidents have used autopens for decades, and the Justice Department under George W. Bush deemed it legal for signing bills into law, but Trump claims Biden's alleged use could be illegitimate, and the investigation should determine which actions involved an autopen and who authorized its use.</p>

          <p>Marissa Rothenberger, a transgender pitcher, propelled the Champlin Park Rebels to the Minnesota High School Girls' Softball State Championship with a complete game and two doubles. Rothenberger's performance included giving up two early runs but settling in to secure a 3-2 victory over White Bear Lake in the Class AAAA state semifinals. Her hitting proved crucial, as she led off the fifth inning with a double to spark a rally and again in the seventh with another double, leading to the game-winning run. The game sparked controversy, with some parents expressing frustration over the fairness of allowing a transgender athlete to compete against cisgender female athletes, leading to discussions about state-level laws and policies that determine eligibility based on gender identity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has accused Columbia University of failing to meet accreditation standards due to alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws. The department claims the Ivy League school tolerated harassment of Jewish students on campus following Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment, which is unlawful. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, has been notified and must establish a plan for the university to comply with federal law or face appropriate action, potentially affecting the school's eligibility for federal student aid.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may protect against dangerous infections, specifically reducing the risk of hospitalization for lung infections in young children. The study, conducted by University College London and the Sanger Institute, analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns to identify early microbial species and track their health outcomes for two years. The presence of Bifidobacterium longum in early infancy was found to have a protective effect, with babies harboring this species being significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. Researchers believe that these bacteria, or compounds they produce, interact with the immune system, influencing its maturation and ability to distinguish between harmful and beneficial entities.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK drugs regulator, doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant.</p>

          <p>Testimony in Karen Read's murder retrial has been unexpectedly paused due to forecasted extreme heat. The judge cited concerns over maintaining courtroom conditions for witnesses and jurors, scheduling the next session for Friday. On Wednesday, a snowplow driver testified that he did not see anything suspicious on the lawn where O'Keefe's body was found, and a woman who was out with Read and O'Keefe the night before he was found dead testified that she saw Read and O’Keefe lovingly embracing each other at the bar, kissing and hugging. Read is accused of striking her boyfriend with her SUV and leaving him to die in a blizzard, while the defense claims she is a victim of a police conspiracy.</p>

In addition to the ban, which takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday, there will be heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The list results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to compile a report on “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S. and whether entry from certain countries represented a national security risk.</p>
