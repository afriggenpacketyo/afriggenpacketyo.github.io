          <p>The Trump administration has finalized a new set of tariffs impacting dozens of countries, with duties ranging from 10% to as high as 41% for nations like Syria. The executive order also introduces a significant 40% tariff on any goods determined to be transshipped through other countries to evade duties, a move seen as targeting China's trade practices. While some Asian nations like Thailand and Malaysia received lower rates than previously proposed, Canada faces a hike to 35%. The move has created uncertainty in global markets and drawn criticism from trade experts who anticipate further instability and potential retaliation from affected partners.</p>

          <p>An office cleaner at 345 Park Avenue has shared her harrowing experience of the recent mass shooting in Midtown, Manhattan. In a statement, 65-year-old Sebije Nelovic described how the gunman, who killed four people, pointed his AR-15-style rifle at her after shooting through a glass door. She managed to escape and hide in a locked closet for several hours while the attack continued. Authorities are still investigating the motive but believe the shooter, who later took his own life, may have been attempting to target the NFL headquarters located in the same building.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has admitted that an air traffic controller failed to properly warn a commercial airliner about an approaching Army helicopter before a fatal midair collision in Washington, D.C. The crash, which occurred in January, resulted in the deaths of 67 people. During an NTSB hearing, officials revealed the controller was managing 21 aircraft simultaneously and that the high traffic volume at the airport led to risky practices. The investigation highlighted systemic issues, including controller workload and the use of nonstandard procedures to manage congestion, which ultimately contributed to the tragic incident.</p>

In an interview, her siblings emphasized that Giuffre sought transparency and justice for Epstein's victims and fought for the files' release until her death. They also expressed their distress over President Trump's recent comments describing their sister as having been "stolen" from his Mar-a-Lago club. The family urged the president not to consider a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in the abuse.</p>

          <p>Tuition fees for undergraduate degrees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535 per year, marking the first increase since they were frozen in 2017. The government also increased the maximum maintenance loan available to students to help with rising living costs. This decision comes as universities face significant financial pressures from high inflation and a decline in international student enrollment, with many institutions projecting financial deficits. The fee hike aims to provide more financial support to universities, though it adds to the debt burden for students, who are already grappling with high accommodation and living expenses.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels opted for minor additions at the MLB trade deadline, acquiring two veteran relief pitchers and an infielder rather than pursuing a major roster overhaul. General Manager Perry Minasian defended the strategy, stating that the goal is to allow the team's young core to play meaningful, competitive games in August and September. Despite having a low probability of making the playoffs and facing baseball's longest postseason drought, the team's management believes this experience is crucial for future development. The approach contrasts with other contending teams that made more aggressive moves to bolster their chances for the current season.</p>

President Trump stated the addition is his "gift to the country," with funding sourced from himself and other private "patriot donors." This marks the first major structural change to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948, reflecting the president's background in real estate development.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is drafting legislation to add $18 billion to California's wildfire fund, which is at risk of being exhausted by recent catastrophic fires. The plan proposes that the state's three largest utilities and their customers each contribute an additional $9 billion.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has resolved a long-standing mystery about the origin of the potato, revealing it evolved from an ancient tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Scientists discovered that the modern potato was created through a hybridization event between a non-tuber-producing wild potato species and an ancient tomato. The tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form starchy tubers, while the wild potato relative contributed a gene that controls their growth. This finding demonstrates how interbreeding between different species can lead to the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

These tankers conduct ship-to-ship transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, often with their identification transponders turned off to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which generates billions of dollars for Iran, undermines U.S. efforts to curb Tehran's nuclear program.

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two of southern China's most important economic engines, are showing signs of a slowdown, reporting GDP growth that has underperformed compared to their peers. This simultaneous deceleration is attributed to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and insufficient domestic consumption to compensate for the shortfall. Analysts point to Shenzhen's 10.9% drop in fixed-asset investment and a 15.1% plunge in real estate development as indicators of weakened investor confidence. The trend has prompted calls for stronger government action to revive business activity in the vital Guangdong province.</p>

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has revealed that he was battling a "relentlessly debilitating" case of Lyme disease throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. In a heartfelt social media post, the 44-year-old singer explained that the diagnosis helped him understand the severe nerve pain and fatigue he was experiencing on stage. He chose to continue the tour to demonstrate his mental tenacity and now aims to be more transparent about his health struggles.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's new Online Safety Act is causing social media companies to restrict a wide range of legitimate public interest content, according to a BBC Verify investigation. Posts about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, parliamentary debates on sexual assault, and even historical artwork have been blocked for users who have not verified their age. Experts warn that in an effort to comply with the law, which aims to protect children from harmful material, companies like X and Reddit are over-applying the rules and stifling important public debate. The law imposes heavy fines for non-compliance, creating a challenging environment for platforms.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Restrict Civil Service Internships to Students from Working-Class Backgrounds</h2>

          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship scheme will now be exclusively available to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This change is part of a broader initiative to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program. The policy aims to address the current imbalance where students from poorer backgrounds are significantly underrepresented among successful applicants to the civil service.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is considering a special election on November 4 to have voters approve new congressional maps, a move aimed at countering President Trump's efforts to redistrict Republican-led states. Newsom framed the potential gerrymandering of California as a direct response to what he calls attempts to "rig the game" for the 2026 midterm elections. The plan would ask voters to adopt new maps effective through 2030, after which the state would revert to its independent redistricting commission. Newsom acknowledged the cost of a special election but called preserving democracy "priceless."</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Edward Zakrzewski for the 1994 murders of his wife and two young children, marking the ninth execution in the state this year. This total sets a new single-year record for Florida since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976. Zakrzewski, an Air Force veteran, was convicted of the killings after his wife sought a divorce. His execution proceeded after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal. Opponents had highlighted his military service and the non-unanimous jury recommendation for his death sentence, which would not be permissible under current Florida law.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions to their bullpen and outfield rather than pursuing blockbuster deals. The team acquired veteran reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, signaling confidence in their current roster to defend its World Series title. This conservative approach contrasts sharply with other National League contenders like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets, who made significant moves to strengthen their teams. The Dodgers' front office indicated they are betting on internal improvement and the return of injured players to carry them through the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing for its FICO credit scores, pushing back against criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Lansing argued that the cost of a FICO score, which he stated is $4.95 for a mortgage, is not a barrier to homeownership when compared to the thousands of dollars in total closing costs. His comments come after the FHFA head criticized FICO's price hikes and allowed mortgage lenders to use a rival score from VantageScore. Lansing maintained that FICO's product is superior and that the new policy raises safety and soundness concerns for the mortgage market.</p>
