          <h2>American Eagle Outfitters Becomes Latest 'Meme Stock' Following Sydney Sweeney Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:42:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant stock surge, positioning it as a new meme stock. The rally is linked to high short interest and a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, which has generated buzz among retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This trend follows similar volatile trading for other brands like GoPro and Kohl's, as investors target heavily shorted stocks. The company hopes the campaign, focused on its denim line, will reverse a recent 35% decline in its stock value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines shares dropped by approximately 10% after the company significantly lowered its 2025 profit forecast and reported second-quarter earnings that missed expectations. The airline cited a challenging economic environment and weaker domestic travel demand, though CEO Bob Jordan noted a recent positive inflection in demand. To adapt, Southwest is overhauling its business model, including changes to its baggage and seating policies, and has announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. The carrier's third-quarter revenue forecast remains uncertain, ranging from a 2% drop to a 2% increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old father, Daniel Gunter, has been found guilty of murdering his premature two-week-old son at Yeovil District Hospital. The baby, Brendon Staddon, suffered extensive injuries, including a fractured skull and broken neck, which a medical expert described as consistent with being swung against a hard surface. During the trial, nurses testified about concerns over Gunter's rough handling of the infant. The baby's mother was acquitted of a related charge, and Gunter, who showed no remorse, is now awaiting sentencing for what a lead detective called an "evil" act.</p>

          <p>A new roller coaster at Cedar Point in Ohio, named "Siren's Curse," malfunctioned for the third time since its recent opening, leaving riders suspended at a 45-degree angle for about 20 minutes. A park spokesperson confirmed the incident, stating the ride's safety system worked as designed and that it reopened shortly after. This event follows two previous malfunctions in late June and early July, one of which also left passengers stuck mid-air while another required an evacuation via stairs. No injuries were reported in the latest incident at the Sandusky amusement park.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank has maintained its key interest rates, pausing a series of cuts amidst significant economic uncertainty, particularly regarding trade relations with the United States. While euro area inflation has reached the ECB's 2% target, the potential for new U.S. tariffs on EU goods has prompted a "wait and watch" approach from policymakers. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that risks to economic growth are "tilted to the downside," but a quick resolution could boost growth. The central bank is keeping all options open, with future decisions heavily dependent on the outcome of trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines the potential loss of assets when filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, a consideration for many Americans facing economic pressure from inflation and high interest rates. Under Chapter 7, or "liquidation" bankruptcy, a trustee may sell non-exempt assets like second homes or valuable collectibles to pay creditors, though many personal items are protected by exemption laws. In contrast, Chapter 13 involves a repayment plan that typically allows individuals to keep their property. The article also suggests exploring alternatives such as debt management plans or consolidation loans before resorting to bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has seen a surge in complaints about these programs. The piece argues that redeeming points has become like a job, and companies may be betting that customers won't maximize the value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has introduced a major policy initiative to create a "24-hour economy," aiming to transform the nation from an import-based to a self-sufficient model. The plan involves key industries operating in three eight-hour shifts daily, a move projected to create 1.7 million jobs and reduce unemployment. However, economists and observers raise concerns about its feasibility, citing the need for significant funding (estimated at $4 billion) and robust infrastructure, including a stable power supply. The success of the program will depend heavily on collaboration between the government, private sector, and labor unions.</p>

          <p>Researchers from China's Zhejiang University have developed a new preparation technique for creating aerogels with superior mechanical strength and high elasticity. Traditional aerogels are excellent insulators but are often fragile, limiting their use in applications like shielding aircraft. The new method, published in the journal Science, uses nanoscale graphene oxide to create a unique internal dome-like cellular structure, which the lead author compared to making a mille-feuille pastry. This innovative process allows for hundreds of different formulations, producing ultratough materials that can better withstand pressure and impact, opening new possibilities for advanced aerospace and industrial applications.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock dropped 8% following the company's announcement of a second straight quarterly decline in automotive sales and revenue that missed analyst expectations. CEO Elon Musk warned that Tesla could face a "few rough quarters" ahead, partly due to expiring EV tax credits, and the company did not provide official guidance for the year. The electric vehicle maker is facing increased competition, particularly from lower-cost Chinese brands in key markets like Europe. The disappointing results come as investors await the ramp-up of a more affordable model to refresh Tesla's aging lineup. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics note the hypocrisy from those who previously demanded the jailing of anyone on the list.

The new party is expected to position itself to the left of Labour, advocating for policies like wealth taxes, nationalization of key industries, and an end to arms sales to Israel.

Other orders aim to spur AI innovation by removing regulations and establish a program to promote U.S. AI exports.

However, opposition parties and critics have challenged the move in the Supreme Court, arguing it disproportionately targets and risks disenfranchising Muslim, Dalit, and poor migrant communities who may lack the required documentation.

While China is the largest supplier of the chemicals used by Mexican cartels to produce the opioid, its cooperation with Washington has been erratic, often fluctuating with the state of U.S.-China relations. The piece notes that Beijing has demonstrated it can control the trade when motivated, as it did in 2019 under tariff pressure. However, it now allows the precursor trade to continue, effectively using the American public health crisis as a bargaining chip.</p>
