            <p>The IRS is considering rescinding Harvard University's tax-exempt status following a request from Treasury officials, prompted by President Trump's social media posts questioning the university's public interest alignment. Harvard argues that the tax exemption supports its educational mission, benefiting students, research, and economic growth, saving the university nearly $500 million annually. This consideration follows earlier actions by the Trump administration, including reviewing billions in grants and contracts with Harvard and canceling significant funding due to disagreements over compliance with federal regulations. The IRS's decision comes amid internal changes and workforce reductions within the agency. </p>

While the cast delivers strong performances, the film's portrayal of wealth is unrealistic and the humor feels forced.
