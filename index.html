          <h2>Trump Advisor Criticizes Apple's Pace in Shifting Production from China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 12:10:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro has criticized Apple CEO Tim Cook, claiming the company is not moving its manufacturing operations out of China quickly enough. Navarro described the situation as the "longest-running soap opera in Silicon Valley," asserting that Cook has been requesting more time since the first Trump term. This criticism comes as President Trump increases pressure on Apple to relocate production to the U.S., even warning of potential tariffs on iPhones made elsewhere. Despite arguments that a U.S.-made iPhone is unfeasible, Navarro believes advanced manufacturing techniques should make it possible for Apple to shift its supply chain.</p>

          <p>Russia's former Minister of Transport, Roman Starovoy, was found dead from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound just hours after being fired by President Vladimir Putin. Russian state media, citing the Investigative Committee, reported the death, noting the main hypothesis is suicide. The incident is part of a string of sudden deaths among high-profile Russian officials, with another transport ministry official also dying of a reported cardiac arrest shortly after Starovoy. These events add to a pattern of powerful figures in Russia dying under mysterious or abrupt circumstances.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the Trump administration will make several trade-related announcements within the next 48 hours, suggesting progress with foreign partners. Bessent noted that many countries are rushing to make deals before a July 9 tariff snap-back deadline, although he also confirmed that tariff collections would not begin until August 1. This creates some confusion about the timeline, even as President Trump indicated a mix of new bilateral agreements and unilateral tariff letters are forthcoming. Bessent also reiterated his willingness to serve as the next Federal Reserve chair if asked by the President.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis, supported by multiple independent studies, explores the significant risks associated with the spiraling U.S. national deficit, which is projected to grow by trillions under President Trump's budget plan. The report highlights three main areas of potential fallout: market instability, economic strain, and weakened international relations. Prominent investors warn of a "late-stage debt cycle," while economists point to risks of inflation and a heavy burden on future generations. Experts suggest the U.S. has a limited window to correct its fiscal course before facing severe consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A specialized clinic in Libby, Montana, dedicated to treating asbestos-related illnesses, is fighting for its survival after a lawsuit forced its closure. The Center for Asbestos Related Disease (CARD) served a community where decades of mining asbestos-contaminated vermiculite left many residents with fatal lung conditions. The clinic's assets were seized by BNSF Railway to collect a $2.9 million judgment, a move the federal government is now contesting. Compounding the crisis, the clinic's primary federal grant is under review for potential cuts by the Trump administration, which would likely lead to its permanent closure.</p>

While Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva did not address the issue in his opening remarks at the summit, officials from Russia and China offered individual reactions.

          <p>Following President Trump's signing of a sweeping domestic policy package, the political fight has moved from Congress to the campaign trail. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has launched digital ads targeting 35 Republican-held districts, labeling the legislation the "Big, Ugly Bill." In response, the National Republican Congressional Committee vows to make Democratic opposition a defining issue in the 2026 midterm elections. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and funds border security, but also restructures Medicaid and food assistance programs, making it a highly contentious piece of legislation.</p>

Thibus tested positive for the anabolic substance ostarine in January 2024, but the CAS panel dismissed an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency that sought a four-year ban. The court found it scientifically plausible that her partner's use of a product containing ostarine could have been transmitted through saliva over a nine-day period.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a high and interest rates topping 21%, debt management programs offered by credit counseling agencies are presented as a viable solution. These programs can help struggling borrowers by negotiating lower interest rates and fees with creditors, consolidating payments into a single, more manageable monthly bill. While the total debt principal is not reduced, participants can see their monthly payments lowered by an average of 30% to 50%. The article details how these savings are achieved and notes that while there are program fees, the long-term financial benefits often outweigh the costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores credit card debt forgiveness as a potential relief option for Americans with overwhelming balances, clarifying that there are no government-sponsored forgiveness programs. Instead, forgiveness typically involves negotiating with creditors, often through a debt settlement company, to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed. The article cautions that this path can significantly harm one's credit score and may have tax implications. It also outlines alternatives like debt consolidation loans, home equity use, and financial hardship programs offered directly by credit card companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement comes as the administration prepares to issue new country-specific tariff rates, with a stated effective date of August 1.

Some areas in the Texas Hill Country received upwards of 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend, causing the Guadalupe River to rise an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The region, known as "Flash Flood Alley," is naturally prone to such events because its soil does not easily absorb water, leading to rapid runoff.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below $75,000 ($150,000 for couples). Policy experts clarify that this deduction can lower a senior's overall taxable income but does not change the fundamental way benefits themselves are taxed. The relief will primarily benefit higher-income seniors and will not affect low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. (not investment advice)</p>

In the deal, the Clippers will also send a 2027 second-round draft pick to the Jazz, who will receive Kyle Anderson and Kevin Love from Miami. The move provides the Clippers with needed size and youth in their frontcourt, as the 6-foot-9 Collins is a capable scorer and rebounder. Powell was one of the Clippers' top performers last season, and Collins is entering the final year of his contract.</p>

He began with a seven-day "circuit breaker," cutting out all refined and natural sugars, before reintroducing fruit. Wicks emphasizes that this was a personal health choice to improve his mood and energy, and he now advocates for others to find what works for them.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall from the storm Chantal has caused significant flooding across central North Carolina, prompting more than 50 water rescues in Chapel Hill alone and displacing over 60 residents. The storm left tens of thousands without power and caused several rivers, including the Haw and Eno, to crest at near-record or record-high levels. In Durham County, the rising Eno River forced the evacuation of dozens of homes and apartments. Authorities are continuing to assess the damage and have warned residents to exercise caution as floodwaters remain high and dangerous in many areas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 76,000 immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, putting them at risk of deportation. The Department of Homeland Security announced the humanitarian programs, first established in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch, will end in early September. Officials argued that conditions in the two Central American countries have improved enough to no longer warrant the protection. This move is part of a broader effort by the administration to curtail TPS, which has also affected immigrants from several other nations, and aligns with the president's hardline immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price dropped by approximately 7% after CEO Elon Musk announced he is forming a new political party called the "America Party." This move has made investors nervous, as Musk's deeper dive into politics is seen as a distraction during a critical period for the company, which is facing increased competition and recently reported a decline in vehicle deliveries. The announcement reignited a feud with President Donald Trump, who called the idea "ridiculous." Analysts suggest that many investors are exhausted by Musk's political activities, viewing them as a risk to the Tesla brand.</p>

However, they also caution that locking in a slightly lower rate with a 5-year CD could be advantageous if rates drop significantly.

It was later reported that the Times accelerated publication because it feared being "scooped" by Rufo, who was also investigating the story.

The situation is compounded by declining childhood vaccination rates and a less forceful pro-vaccine stance from the current administration.
