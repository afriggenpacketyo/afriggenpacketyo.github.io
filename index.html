            <p>Manchester United's goalkeeper Andre Onana was surprisingly dropped from the squad for their Premier League match against Newcastle, following criticism of his performance in the Europa League. Sources indicate that the decision was made to allow Onana to rest and disconnect, and he is expected to return for the return leg against Lyon. Former player Nemanja Matic had publicly criticized Onana, adding pressure to the situation. This move is not considered permanent, and Onana's position within the team is secure.</p>

            <p>More than 100 civilians, including children and aid workers, have been killed in a series of attacks on camps for displaced people in Sudan's Darfur region. The attacks, blamed on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), targeted the city of el Fasher and nearby camps already struggling with famine-like conditions. The UN and aid organizations have condemned the violence, with one charity reporting that several of its workers, including doctors, were killed. The ongoing conflict between the RSF and the army has created a major humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and exacerbating food insecurity.</p>

            <p>The investigation into the Long Island serial killings, which began with the disappearance of Shannan Gilbert in 2010, led to the discovery of multiple bodies and the arrest of Rex Heuermann. The Gilgo Four, four women working as online escorts, were found in December 2010, revealing a pattern and sparking a massive investigation. Heuermann was identified as a suspect through a combination of old clues, including a description of a client and his vehicle, and new technology, such as cell phone tracking and DNA analysis.

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing panic buying and paralysis among consumers, as businesses struggle to keep up with the changes. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, are expected to lead to higher prices and potential shortages. While some consumers are stocking up on goods, others are unsure how to proceed amid the uncertainty. Economists predict that the tariffs could negatively impact the US economy, leading to slower growth and increased unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

Major incident after explosion destroys house

A search has begun to account for residents after a house was destroyed in a gas explosion. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) said specialist urban search and rescue teams were deployed on Sunday morning, after a terraced property was destroyed in John Street in Worksop. Nearby homes were evacuated and a major incident was declared after the blast, which happened just before 20:00 BST on Saturday. No details of casualties have yet been confirmed by emergency services.

A fire service spokesperson said: "The building involved in this explosion has been significantly damaged. "Structural engineers will be assessing the situation later today, but people are still advised to avoid the area. "Three fire engines remain on scene at this incident, with fire crews working alongside specialist urban search and rescue teams to account for all local residents."

Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Emergency services will remain at the scene in John Street, Worksop, through the day

Ch Insp Neil Humphris, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This is a major incident and emergency services will remain at the scene throughout the night. "Multiple properties have been evacuated as we work with our partners to respond to this incident and understand how it happened." The Crown Place Community Centre was opened for residents and police remained at the scene to provide assistance. Karolina Ciolko, who lives nearby, told the BBC: "I was lying in bed when I heard an explosion. "I quickly looked out the window. I saw smoke and the car in front of me rocked and the alarm went off. We quickly ran out of the house to see what had happened."

            <p>Taiwan is bracing for political tension as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) backs a recall campaign targeting opposition lawmakers. The DPP aims to regain control of the legislature, which is currently dominated by the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People’s Party (TPP). This move follows months of legislative gridlock, with the DPP accusing the opposition of obstructing government initiatives and threatening the island's security. The campaign risks deepening partisan divisions and political instability amid external pressures from Beijing.</p>

            <p>Britain is grappling with the potential economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs, prompting calls for closer ties with the EU and a reassessment of Brexit's impact. The tariffs, which include levies on British goods exports to the US, pose a significant threat to the UK's growth policy. While Nobel laureate Paul Krugman notes that EU tariffs on US goods are relatively low, the UK's economic interests require abandoning red lines about rejoining the customs union and single market. The situation highlights the challenges of navigating international trade relations in an era of protectionism.</p>

            <h2>Masters 2025: Rory McIlroy v Bryson DeChambeau showdown</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-13 01:32:16 EDT</div>
          </div>

            <p>Aside from their love of hitting the ball prodigious distances with their drivers, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau's approach to winning the Masters could not be more different.

While McIlroy has spent this week blocking out "the noise", DeChambeau has been feeding off the rising decibels echoing through the Georgia Pines at Augusta National.

While McIlroy strolled serenely and stony faced to the scorer's hut after Saturday's second successive 66, DeChambeau bounded up the hill with a beaming smile, energised by a closing 50-foot birdie - his 69th shot - high-fiving everyone and anyone.

While McIlroy planned to spend a quiet Saturday evening away from his phone and trying to stay awake for an episode of raunchy period drama Bridgerton, DeChambeau was ready to embrace his mobile and was looking forward to a late night spent watching action of a different sort, a James Bond film.

The two look set for a final-round showdown on Sunday as they attempt to become Masters champion for the first time.

McIlroy leads on 12 under par, two ahead of DeChambeau.

There are others on the leaderboard with pedigree though. Canadian Corey Conners, something of an Augusta expert with three top 10s in his past six starts, is the next best at eight under and he is two clear of last year's runner-up Ludvig Aberg and 2018 champion Patrick Reed.

But Masters Sunday is already being billed as a rematch by many - a chance for McIlroy to exact revenge after he capitulated in the final three holes at last year's US Open and DeChambeau took full advantage.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced that phones, computers and chips would be exempt from new tariffs. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would return to the higher tariff rates announced last week if he can't reach a deal with trading partners during the 90-day pause he announced on Wednesday.

Trump defended the tariffs he imposed on other nations but acknowledged some problems with the rollout in a meeting with his Cabinet, "but in the end it's going to be a beautiful thing."

Meanwhile, the White House raised the tariffs on all Chinese exports to 125% after Beijing's latest round of retaliation -- that's in addition to the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs imposed in early February, which brings the total rate for China to 145%, according to the White House.</p>
