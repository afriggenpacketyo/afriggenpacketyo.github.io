          <p>In China, a growing number of students are choosing universities based on the job prospects of specific majors, such as computer science, rather than the institution's overall prestige. This trend reflects heightened anxiety about the competitive job market and a pragmatic focus on immediate employability and financial security. The surge in interest in artificial intelligence is further intensifying demand for technology-related fields. This shift indicates that for many young people and their families, securing a stable career path has become more critical than attending a top-ranked university, altering traditional educational aspirations in the country.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion semiconductor supply contract with Samsung Electronics, running until 2033. The deal focuses on producing Tesla's next-generation AI chips at Samsung's new Texas facility, a move Musk described as having immense strategic importance. He also noted his personal involvement in maximizing manufacturing efficiency, suggesting the deal's value could exceed the initial figure. The announcement caused Samsung's shares to rise, highlighting the critical role of advanced chip manufacturing in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new trade agreement between the US and the European Union leaves several areas unresolved and open to future changes. While a 15% tariff rate is set for many goods, the US will maintain a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, and President Trump retains the ability to alter terms if investment commitments are not met. The deal also creates economic divisions, notably on the island of Ireland, and has received a lukewarm reception from German industry, which fears the negative impact of the continued high tariffs. Despite providing some stability, the rates remain historically high, with economists noting consumers will likely bear the ultimate cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the starvation occurring in Gaza is a deliberate, man-made crisis resulting from Israel's blockade, which prevents essential aid from reaching a desperate civilian population. The author highlights the deaths of children from malnutrition and describes the international community's response—characterized by hollow statements and finger-wagging—as an inadequate performance that fails to hold Israel accountable. The piece contends that despite the feeling of screaming into a void, continued public protest is the only remaining lever to pressure political establishments into taking meaningful action, such as ceasing military and trade relations with Israel.</p>

          <p>Despite the England women's football team's historic Euro 2025 victory, the UK government is not planning to declare a national bank holiday to celebrate. A homecoming parade is scheduled, but concerns over the economic cost, estimated at over £800 million, appear to be the primary deterrent. This stance is consistent with past major sporting achievements, including the Lionesses' 2022 win and the men's 1966 World Cup victory. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously suggested he would be open to such a celebration, his government now seems to be prioritizing economic stability over a national day off.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker from the Dharmasthala pilgrimage center in Karnataka, India, has accused temple officials of a massive cover-up involving hundreds of murders and sexual assaults over nearly two decades.

Prosecutors demonstrated that Czuba targeted the family because of their Muslim faith and in response to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The brutal attack, in which the boy was stabbed 26 times, sent shockwaves through the local Palestinian-American community and renewed national fears of anti-Muslim discrimination.

This campaign has left many low-wage migrant workers, who rely on these crowded and affordable living spaces, facing eviction with nowhere else to go in a city with soaring rental costs. After a high-rise fire in June, officials intensified inspections of makeshift dormitories created with plywood and curtains. For workers earning just a few hundred dollars a month, these partitioned spaces are often their only housing option, and the crackdown highlights the precarious situation of the labor force that underpins Dubai's luxury economy.</p>

In return for accepting the 15% tariff, the EU will see zero tariffs on some American exports and has committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in US energy and arms.

The Tasers will be issued to a specialist national unit that responds to serious incidents like riots and hostage situations. While the Prison Officers' Association welcomed the measure as long overdue, others, including former officers and the Prison Governors' Association, have expressed caution about a wider rollout due to potential risks.</p>

          <h2>Economic Model Forecasts Sharp Drop in US Imports Following New EU Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>An economic forecast from The Observatory of Economic Complexity's Tariff Simulator predicts that the new US-EU trade deal will cause a significant reconfiguration of global trade. The model suggests that global exports to the U.S. could drop by over 46% by 2027 compared to recent years, as countries rewire trade relationships away from the higher-tariff American market. While the deal sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods, the simulator shows the U.S. importing less from major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico. Logistics experts warn that the increased costs will likely lead to less product diversity on U.S. shelves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have implemented new rules mandating leniency for innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy aims to protect researchers at universities, hospitals, and companies from punishment for honest mistakes, provided there was no misconduct or abuse of power. Scenarios covered include projects stalled by technical hurdles or made unviable by market shifts. The rules are designed to encourage bold exploration and risk-taking in scientific research, ensuring that failed attempts do not hinder future access to funding or negatively impact performance evaluations.</p>

          <p>The far-right Sanseito party has surged in Japanese politics, growing from one to 15 seats and challenging the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party. This rise is attributed to widespread public frustration with a sluggish economy, inflation, and stagnant wages, coupled with a growing anti-immigrant and anti-tourist sentiment. The party, using the slogan "Japan First," has capitalized on these anxieties, with some analysts drawing parallels to Trump's populist movement in the US. By blaming foreigners for social and economic problems, Sanseito has attracted a significant following among younger voters and conservatives who feel the current government is not addressing their concerns.</p>

          <p>OMB Director Russell Vought, a key author of the conservative blueprint Project 2025, stated he was unfamiliar with its chapter on overhauling the Federal Reserve. Speaking on CBS News, Vought suggested President Trump's recent criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the specific reforms outlined in the Project 2025 document. The conservative plan calls for limiting the Fed's mandate to stable money, whereas Trump's pressure has focused on rate cuts and the cost of a Fed building renovation. This disconnect highlights the complex relationship between the administration's actions and the influential conservative policy guide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sharp division has emerged within the Republican party over a push to force a vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein. House Speaker Mike Johnson labeled the discharge petition, co-sponsored by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, as "reckless," citing concerns about protecting victims' identities. However, Massie countered that the bill was carefully crafted to include redactions and accused Johnson of using a "straw man argument" to block the vote. Massie warned that failing to vote on the issue could become a political liability for the GOP, potentially costing them their majority in the midterms.</p>

Her comments signal that North Korea, currently focused on strengthening ties with Russia, sees no immediate reason to resume diplomacy with South Korea or the U.S. Analysts suggest the move is intended to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington while justifying North Korea's continued weapons development.</p>
