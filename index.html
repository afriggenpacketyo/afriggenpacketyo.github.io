        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court in New York has blocked President Trump's plan to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from almost every country, ruling that he overstepped his authority by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This decision overturns decades of U.S. trade policy and could throw the president's trade policy into turmoil, as stated by Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official. The court's ruling leaves in place other Trump tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, but the administration is expected to appeal the decision. The ruling introduces uncertainty for businesses and countries negotiating trade agreements with the U.S., potentially leading them to reassess their strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Best Buy has reduced its full-year sales and profit guidance, citing the impact of higher tariffs on consumer electronics. The company anticipates that tariffs will remain at current levels, and it doesn't foresee significant changes in consumer behavior. Other companies like Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy's have also cut their profit outlooks due to tariffs. Best Buy aims to improve customer experience, expand its third-party marketplace, and drive efficiency to offset pressures. The company reported lower net income and a slight drop in comparable sales, with weakness in home theaters, appliances, and drones partially offset by growth in computing and mobile phone categories.

Ishiba has stated that Japan will not compromise on its demand for the removal of higher import duties on various products. Despite a three-month pause, the United States still imposes a 10 percent baseline tariff on Japanese products, making the situation more difficult to bear for Japanese industries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the shift away from collective child-rearing norms in America and argues for the benefits of allowing other adults to correct children's behavior in public. The author recounts an experience in Prague where a stranger gently corrected her daughter, highlighting how this sort of intervention is less common in the United States. Historically, child-rearing was a more communal endeavor, with neighbors, teachers, and even strangers feeling empowered to correct a child's misbehavior. While acknowledging the potential drawbacks of collective discipline, the author suggests that it can reinforce lessons parents are trying to impart and help children understand the needs and boundaries of others.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering eliminating funding for the Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA) within the U.S. Geological Survey, a program that monitors environmental contaminants, invasive species, and wildlife health. This program has been crucial in understanding issues like white-nose syndrome in bats and its impact on agriculture and human health. Critics argue that eliminating biological research is detrimental, as EMA's work helps reveal declines in wildlife populations before they become severe, potentially avoiding the need for federal protections. An Interior Department spokesperson stated that USGS remains committed to its congressional mandate, but the White House has not responded to requests for comment, leaving the program's future uncertain.</p>

Under a new bill, dispensaries will only be allowed to sell cannabis to licensed shops or customers with a prescription. Activists estimate this could lead to a 90% drop in licensed cannabis shops, impacting tourism and agriculture sectors.

          <p>Kurts Adams Rozentals, a British canoeist, has been suspended from competing and removed from the UK Sport's World Class Programme due to allegations about his social media posts. Rozentals suspects the suspension is due to his OnlyFans account, where he creates adult content to fund his Olympic dream. He has posted numerous videos and photos on the website and says his personality and identity is sport, and he wants to be a professional athlete chasing his Olympic dream.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $766 million in funding for Moderna's bird flu vaccine research, even as the company announced positive early-stage trial results. The funds were awarded through BARDA to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including H5N1 bird flu. The cancelation comes as Moderna reported promising results from a trial of its mRNA-1018 vaccine. Experts have expressed concern that this move could put American lives at risk, especially if bird flu starts spreading from person to person.</p>

The nomination of Casey Means, a wellness influencer, for surgeon general represents a merger between anti-establishment forces on the left and the right. The author notes that the wellness industry and the MAHA movement operate from a place of fear, driven by concerns about health costs and access to care. It argues that wellness culture has spread due to a lack of trust in the traditional healthcare system, particularly among women and people with chronic illnesses.</p>

Google is attempting to reinvent itself with AI Overviews and AI Mode, which provide summarized search results and chatbot-based search experiences. However, these AI-powered tools can be unreliable and may lead to publishers seeing declines in traffic as users bypass traditional websites. The author explores whether Google can maintain its dominance in a future where the traditional list of blue links may no longer be the primary way people find information online.</p>
