          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has officially formed in the central Atlantic, with its projected path indicating a northwestward movement over the next several days, potentially bringing downstream impacts to the Southeast U.S. coast, from Florida up to North Carolina. This marks the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following closely on the heels of Hurricane Gabrielle. While no coastal watches or warnings are currently in effect, the National Hurricane Center forecasts steady strengthening for Humberto due to highly favorable environmental conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures. Additionally, authorities are closely monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean that is likely to become a tropical depression later this week, threatening heavy rains for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before strengthening near the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Thursday as investors continued selling tech names like Nvidia and Oracle for a second straight day, driven by skepticism about the AI industry's potentially circular nature. Japan's Nikkei 225 dipped while the broader Topix gained, and South Korea's Kospi was marginally up, with defense stocks notably rising. Taiwan's Taiex slipped, influenced by reports of Intel seeking investment from Apple, though Apple is unlikely to revert to Intel chips. U.S. stock futures remained largely unchanged as market participants awaited Thursday's release of weekly jobless claims data, which could influence Federal Reserve monetary policy amid increasing concerns about a weakening labor market and rising layoffs.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) acting director Todd Lyons stated that the deadly shooting at a Dallas processing facility "could have been worse," characterizing it as an "indiscriminate" attack that could have hit more civilians. The incident resulted in one detainee dead and two others critically wounded, though no ICE employees were harmed. Lyons identified the deceased shooter as Joshua Jahn, 29, who allegedly acted alone, firing a high-powered rifle from a nearby rooftop, with "anti-ICE" messages found on bullet casings. ICE plans to reevaluate security measures but affirmed that operations would not be slowed, asserting the attack deliberately targeted federal law enforcement officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican lawmakers from several U.S. states, including Wisconsin, filed a formal complaint with the EPA, blaming Canada's wildfire management for smoke drifting south as deadly blazes raged in Manitoba. Manitoba's premier swiftly condemned this as a "timber tantrum" and "political games," while climate and fire experts in both countries largely attribute worsening fires to human-caused climate change. A recent study estimated that 2023 Canadian wildfires caused over 87,500 acute and premature deaths worldwide, underscoring the global health impact of wildfire smoke. Experts emphasize the need for collaboration between the U.S. and Canada on wildfire management and adapting to a warmer climate, rather than trading blame.</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey discusses his new film, "The Lost Bus," which dramatizes the harrowing 2018 California wildfires and his unique experience acting alongside his 93-year-old mother and 17-year-old son. The article highlights director Paul Greengrass's dedication to realism, which involved building extensive real sets and utilizing gas lines for controlled fire effects instead of virtual environments. Based on a Washington Post article, the film portrays the heroism of a school bus driver and teacher who navigated 22 schoolchildren through a raging inferno to safety. This production speaks to universal themes of making critical decisions under pressure and the increasing global danger posed by wildfires.</p>

          <p>Orange County officials are initiating a cross-reference of voter rolls with pet registration data to identify and prevent any non-human voters, following a felony charge against a Costa Mesa woman for allegedly registering her dog and casting ballots. Supervisors Dan Wagner and Janet Nguyen introduced this measure, stressing the importance of restoring public confidence in elections. While some supervisors, like Katrina Foley, affirmed the integrity of the current voting system, others, such as Vicente Sarmiento, advocated for focusing on increasing voter participation. The Registrar of Voters has already reviewed thousands of unincorporated pet records without finding issues and is expanding this review to all incorporated cities within the county.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leaked documents and data from within England's Environment Agency (EA) reveal a watchdog struggling to monitor serious pollution incidents, failing to send investigators to nearly a third of almost 100 serious water industry incidents in 2024. The article highlights that the EA frequently relied on water companies, often the polluters themselves, for updates and downgraded over 1,000 potentially serious incidents without in-person inspection. Critics and campaigners accuse the EA of being "hollowed out" and not holding polluters accountable, with staff shortages leading to cancelled water quality tests. Plans are currently being drawn up to merge various water industry regulators into a single body to address these systemic failures.</p>

He reflected on the 1990s and 2000s, suggesting that progressive values were not truly tested until recently, leading to their current challenges in the face of populist movements.

He questioned how the U.S. would react if its own backyard was bombed, asserting that international laws and standards must be respected to prevent "massive chaos."

Petro argued that using missiles instead of simply stopping boats and arresting crews constitutes "murder" and violates the principle of proportionality of force.

The UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, suggested a U.S. delegation videographer inadvertently triggered the escalator's safety function.

U.S. District Judge William Smith sided with 20 states, arguing the policy was "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," and that withholding critical emergency funds would cause "irreparable harm" to disaster response and public safety. The Trump administration had sought to punish jurisdictions limiting cooperation with ICE, but states contend such requirements undermine trust in local police.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom sharply criticized President Trump's dismissal of climate change as a "hoax" and "an abomination," labeling it as economic self-sabotage that leads the country to "doubling down on stupid." Speaking during Climate Week in New York, Newsom argued that Trump's policies dismantle clean-energy incentives, thereby ceding leadership to China in electric vehicles and renewable technologies, while California's economy has thrived on green investments. The article also notes U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright's counter-argument that California's green focus leads to high electricity bills. Separately, Vice President JD Vance criticized Newsom's rhetoric, linking it to violence against law enforcement, which Newsom dismissed as disingenuous.</p>

          <p>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers called for "realism" following his team's Europa League opening draw away to Red Star Belgrade, signaling a pragmatic shift in the club's European expectations. After a painful Champions League play-off defeat, Celtic's return to the Europa League was initially seen as impotent until the introduction of goalscorer Kelechi Iheanacho ignited their play. The article notes fan dissatisfaction over scant summer transfer activity and the departure of key players, which has left Rodgers feeling "empty" about the squad. Despite internal and external criticism, Rodgers views the draw as a "good point" for the squad in a difficult away fixture, acknowledging the team's current state.</p>

          <p>The UK government is actively considering various financial support measures for firms within Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, as JLR's car production remains halted due to a cyber-attack in late August. Fears are escalating that smaller suppliers, particularly those solely reliant on JLR's business, could face bankruptcy without intervention. Options under exploration include the government directly purchasing component parts to sustain businesses or providing government-backed loans, though a Covid-style furlough scheme has been ruled out due to cost. The Business and Trade Select Committee is scheduled to meet to address deep concerns for these businesses, as the cyber-attack is estimated to cost JLR at least £50 million weekly in lost production.

The film emphasizes the critical need for international reporters to share the burden with Palestinian journalists, who face immense risks and have suffered significant casualties, to ensure comprehensive and factual reporting on the conflict. This initiative follows previous calls for access and condemnation of attacks on journalists, aiming to uphold press freedom.</p>

The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) launched a "Fake Toys, Real Harms" campaign after nearly three in four seized toys failed safety tests, containing harmful chemicals or choking hazards. Many consumers are driven by lower costs, often overlooking crucial safety considerations. The surge in demand for genuine Labubus led to Pop Mart pausing sales and adopting an online lottery system, while the IPO warns of broader counterfeiting issues targeting a wide range of popular toys, urging vigilance.</p>
