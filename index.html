          <p>A representative for former President Joe Biden stated that he last had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test in 2014, which aligns with medical guidelines for men over 70. Current recommendations suggest men aged 55 to 69 should discuss the benefits and harms of a PSA test with their doctor, while those 70 and older should generally not receive PSA-based screening due to the risk of false positives. The article explains that Biden's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer came after doctors discovered a nodule during a routine physical.
