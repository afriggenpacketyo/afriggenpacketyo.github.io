          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump, over potential violations of the Hatch Act. This federal law restricts the political activities of government employees. The inquiry follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's efforts to expedite a trial against Trump constituted illegal political interference aimed at harming his 2024 presidential campaign. Smith, who resigned in January after Trump's reelection, had previously maintained his actions were not politically motivated. The cases he brought were ultimately closed following the election.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the harrowing experiences of two survivors of the "Son of Sam" serial killer, David Berkowitz, who terrorized New York City in the late 1970s. Robert Violante describes being shot on his first date, an attack that left him blind and killed his companion, Stacy Moskowitz, derailing his promising modeling career. Another survivor, Carl Denaro, recalls being shot months earlier, an incident that was not initially linked to the serial killer. Both men reflect on their long roads to recovery and the profound, lifelong impact the violent attacks had on their lives, expressing relief that Berkowitz remains imprisoned.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Idaho prosecutor Bill Thompson, investigators have not ruled out the possibility that Bryan Kohberger used a second weapon in the murders of four University of Idaho students. Some injuries on victim Kaylee Goncalves appeared inconsistent with the primary knife, though this remains unconfirmed. Thompson also theorized that Kohberger spared a surviving roommate, Dylan Mortensen, because he panicked after being in the house longer and killing more people than he had planned. The prosecutor emphasized the critical role that DNA evidence found on a knife sheath played in identifying Kohberger as the suspect and securing the case against him.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested across England following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators outside hotels used to house asylum seekers. Protests occurred in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, with police intervening to manage the confrontations. In response to the ongoing situation, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to reduce the overall number of people housed in hotels. The government has reportedly decreased the number of hotels used for this purpose from over 400 to less than 210 and aims to end the practice entirely by 2029.</p>

The bar owner stated that the suspect knew the victims and believes he may have just "snapped." Law enforcement has focused the search on a mountainous area west of the town, urging residents to remain indoors as the suspect is considered armed and dangerous.</p>

Shayna, who was only four when her father died, feels a deep need to understand this part of her family's history and describes her relationship with Berkowitz as a way of connecting with her deceased father.

          <p>Following a 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening league match, Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly condemned his team's performance, stating they were "lucky to get a point." Martin criticized the players' mentality, effort, and ego, suggesting they were outfought and reverted to self-preservation when the game became difficult. He described the issue as a long-standing problem at the club, where players only perform when things are going well. The unusually harsh public critique just three games into his tenure signals significant concerns about the squad's character and commitment ahead of the new season.</p>

German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the long-term care insurance system, which is struggling to bridge the gap.

          <p>The Tea app, which promoted itself as a safe place for women to share information about men in their dating pools, has suffered a major data breach, exposing users' personal data. Hackers leaked sensitive information, including driver's licenses, direct messages, and selfies, which was then circulated on notorious online forums like 4chan. The incident has compromised the safety of the app's users and led to two class-action lawsuits. This breach highlights the significant risks associated with digital "whisper networks," which, while intended to enhance safety, can become vulnerable to leaks and misuse.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly adults under 30, are now regularly getting their news from TikTok, relying on content creators and news-adjacent memes rather than traditional media outlets. This article examines the trend through creators like Aaron Parnas, who provides rapid-fire updates on current events to millions of followers. While critics raise concerns about misinformation and the platform's Chinese ownership, users value the convenience and simplified terms. The platform's algorithm-driven, entertainment-focused format is reshaping how news is produced and consumed, forcing established outlets to adapt with skits and other non-traditional formats.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border, affirming that the government cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being returned to countries where they face persecution or torture. The ruling stems from a proclamation President Trump issued to close the asylum system, which has been used to summarily expel migrants. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying discretionary asylum, it upheld protections under the Convention Against Torture, which are mandatory. The decision marks a significant legal check on the administration's hardline immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a ruling that restricts how immigration agents can conduct "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The court agreed that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like their race, speaking Spanish, or their location, as such practices likely violate the Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures. The decision stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear and protests in Southern California. This ruling reinforces legal guardrails against what advocates have described as discriminatory and indiscriminate enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>England secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain in a World Cup warm-up match, but the win was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer. Packer was sent off for a clumsy but dangerous clearout, which could result in a suspension ahead of the World Cup. Head coach John Mitchell praised Packer's performance before the incident but acknowledged the team must accept the consequences. The match provided a platform for other players to impress, but the potential absence of the experienced captain adds a layer of uncertainty to England's preparations.</p>

Leclerc's pole was unexpected, as McLaren had appeared faster in practice, but a shift in wind conditions during the final qualifying session worked in Ferrari's favor. Leclerc expressed his own surprise at the result, calling it one of the most unexpected pole positions of his career.</p>

          <p>Health officials have issued a public warning to avoid the water near the Camp Richardson resort on Lake Tahoe's southern shore after a sewage leak led to the detection of high levels of E. coli bacteria.

The U.S. Forest Service has advised swimmers and boaters to stay out of the water in the affected area, from Jameson Beach to the Valhalla Boathouse, as a precaution.

The investigation found that over 50 people claimed their names were forged, including three who are deceased, while others said they were deceived into signing. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the integrity of the petitioning process.

          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a turbulent week, culminating in a sharp downturn on Friday after a dismal July jobs report showed far weaker growth than expected. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both snapped multi-week winning streaks, rattled by the poor economic data, President Trump's subsequent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, and ongoing trade tensions. The weak employment figures immediately shifted market expectations, with the odds of a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve soaring, adding to a week already packed with major earnings reports and geopolitical developments.

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have exposed a significant graft scheme involving the procurement of military drones and jamming systems at inflated prices. According to investigators, a sitting lawmaker, officials, and national guard personnel were caught accepting kickbacks of up to 30% from state contracts with suppliers. The announcement came just two days after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored by parliament, following major public protests against a government move to curb their powers. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy affirmed his commitment to a zero-tolerance policy on corruption and praised the agencies' work.</p>
