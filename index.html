          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, starting from their initial public alignment in July 2024 following an assassination attempt on Trump. Musk endorsed Trump and later served in his administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The timeline covers Musk's appointment to DOGE, his cost-cutting measures, and the eventual fallout over Trump's tax and spending bill, which Musk criticized, leading to a public feud and Musk's departure from the White House in June 2025. The article highlights key moments in their alliance and the reasons behind their falling out. Optimism surrounding their alliance has deteriorated as the relationship sours.</p>

          <p>Chinese manufacturers are facing overcapacity issues due to weak domestic demand and are offering steep discounts on exports, leading to concerns of a new 'China shock' in global markets. While this situation could squeeze local industries in Asia, it also presents an opportunity for inflation-hit economies to benefit from lower costs for consumers. Economists suggest that cheaper Chinese goods could ease the cost-of-living crisis and relieve inflationary pressure, potentially paving the way for more rate cuts across Asia. This article examines the complex economic implications of China's production overdrive. (not investment advice)</p>

The 5,000-ton warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a malfunction during its launch, causing it to capsize. Leader Kim Jong Un deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs. Analysts were surprised by the speed of the recovery, attributing it to innovative techniques like using aerostatic balloons. The ship's internal spaces and machinery will need to be purged of seawater during the repair process.</p>

          <p>Japanese startup ispace failed to land its unmanned Resilience spacecraft on the moon, with the mission being aborted after it was presumed that the craft had crashed. The spacecraft began its final descent, but contact was lost, and it failed to decelerate sufficiently for a soft lunar landing. This marks the second failed lunar mission by the company, which had hoped to become the first private company outside the United States to achieve a controlled lunar landing. Despite the setback, the company intends to use the outcome to inform future missions.</p>

RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited a challenging global environment and heightened uncertainty as factors influencing the decision. While the full-year GDP estimate remains at 6.5%, the central bank has revised its inflation outlook to 3.7%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact on jobs, finding that AI makes workers "more valuable, not less." The report analyzed over 800 million job ads and thousands of company financial reports, revealing that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. It also found that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI. The study suggests that AI enriches automatable jobs, freeing up employees to practice more complex skills and decision making.
