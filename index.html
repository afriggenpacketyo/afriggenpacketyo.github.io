Invited by the Superhumans organization, which provides prosthetics and rehabilitation, he participated in a panel discussion and met with veterans. The Duke of Sussex, who founded the Invictus Games for wounded service members, emphasized the importance of mental health for those leaving military service. His visit underscores ongoing support from the British Royal Family for Ukraine, following a recent donation from his Archewell foundation to aid injured children.</p>

          <p>Michele Kang, the owner of London City Lionesses, Washington Spirit, and Lyon, is reshaping women's professional soccer with her hands-on, multi-club ownership model. By investing heavily in infrastructure, female-specific research, and top-tier players, she has propelled the Lionesses into the Women's Super League. Kang argues that this model is a necessity for growth, allowing clubs to pool resources and achieve the scale needed to attract larger audiences and media deals. Her approach challenges traditional structures and aims to elevate the commercial viability and professionalism of the women's game globally.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting at Utah Valley University, students are expressing a resolve to uphold the practice of campus debate. Many students, including those who disagreed with Kirk's views, told the BBC they feel a responsibility to ensure such discussions continue, viewing the act of silencing a voice through violence as an attack on free expression itself. The event has galvanized some previously apolitical students to become more involved, with many seeing the tragedy as a catalyst for a broader movement and a moment of political awakening.</p>

          <p>U.S. health officials are growing concerned as Chagas disease, transmitted by the 'kissing bug,' is increasingly detected across the country, with cases now reported in at least eight states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is considering classifying the parasitic infection as endemic, shifting its status from an imported tropical disease to a permanent domestic health risk. The disease, which can cause serious heart and digestive problems in its chronic phase, is passed through the feces of the bug. This potential reclassification would significantly impact public health monitoring, research, and treatment strategies for the illness.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins' football season has taken a dire turn following a 35-10 defeat to New Mexico, marking their third consecutive loss and first 0-3 start since 2019. Despite being heavy favorites, the team struggled on both offense and defense at the Rose Bowl, never holding a lead in the game. This loss to a second consecutive Mountain West Conference opponent raises serious questions for coach DeShaun Foster's program, particularly regarding the team's lack of performance despite adding high-profile transfer quarterback Nico Iamaleava.

          <p>Despite a stellar performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who threw seven innings of one-run baseball, the Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the San Francisco Giants 5-1. The game ended dramatically in the 10th inning when Giants catcher Patrick Bailey hit a walk-off grand slam. The Dodgers' offense struggled throughout the night, managing only one run via a solo homer from Michael Conforto and failing to capitalize on multiple opportunities. This loss stalls the team's recent momentum and highlights ongoing inconsistencies at the plate as the playoffs approach, while the Giants continue their surprising push for a wild-card spot.</p>

          <p>Terence "Bud" Crawford and Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez are set for a legacy-defining fight in Las Vegas, with both boxers weighing in at 167.5 pounds. Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, is aiming to become the first male boxer to be an undisputed champion in three different divisions. The bout pits Álvarez's power and experience at super middleweight against Crawford's speed, technical skill, and undefeated record. While Álvarez is favored by the largely Mexican crowd, many experts believe Crawford's adaptability gives him a strong chance to win in what is being billed as a pivotal clash for modern boxing.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled Missouri legislature has passed a new congressional redistricting plan that could give the GOP an additional seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The map, which now awaits the governor's signature, redraws districts in the Kansas City area, making the seat held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver more conservative. This mid-decade redistricting effort, backed by former President Trump, would likely result in a 7-1 Republican advantage in the state's House delegation. Opponents immediately filed a lawsuit, arguing the new map is an unconstitutional gerrymander that violates state requirements for compact districts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Harvard study has found that women who have experienced stalking or have obtained a restraining order face a significantly higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The research, which analyzed data from over 66,000 nurses for two decades, revealed a 41% higher risk for stalking victims and a 70% higher risk for those who secured restraining orders. These associations remained even after accounting for other traditional risk factors like diet and exercise. Researchers suggest that these common traumatic experiences should be considered by doctors as potential risk factors when screening women for heart health.</p>

          <p>As the nights grow longer this autumn, sky-watchers can look forward to several celestial events. The season officially begins with the astronomical equinox on September 22, when day and night are of nearly equal length. A day prior, Saturn will be at its brightest and closest to Earth, appearing as a non-twinkling star visible to the naked eye. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November, peaking around October 22. Viewing conditions for the meteor shower are expected to be ideal due to the new moon.</p>

          <p>Three elderly nuns in Austria, all in their 80s, have defied church authorities by leaving their assigned care home and returning to the historic convent where they spent most of their lives. Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita say they were moved against their will after their community was officially dissolved and the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they regained access to their former apartments. While church officials call the move 'incomprehensible' due to the nuns' health, the women express joy at being 'home' again.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, artificial intelligence tools have been found to be amplifying false claims and conspiracy theories. A CBS News analysis revealed that X's AI chatbot, Grok, repeatedly misidentified the suspect before an official announcement was made and generated altered images of the person of interest. Other AI-powered services also produced inaccurate information, with one describing the shooting as a 'hypothetical scenario.' Experts warn that users tend to trust AI-generated content, which can accelerate the spread of misinformation during rapidly developing news events.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk played a significant role in helping Donald Trump improve his performance with younger voters, a key demographic in his 2024 election victory. Through his organization Turning Point USA, Kirk effectively mobilized young conservatives, particularly young men, and persuaded GOP leadership to invest in youth outreach. Exit polling data shows Trump performed better with voters under 30 than any Republican presidential candidate since 2004. Kirk's strategy involved direct engagement on college campuses and social media, helping to narrow the Democratic party's traditional advantage with this crucial voting bloc.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian businessman in Tulkarm, in the occupied West Bank, has accused the Israeli military of destroying his home and business after occupying it for over three months. Nasser Faratawi says the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took over his family's multi-story building as a base for an operation in the nearby refugee camp, vandalizing the property before setting it on fire. The IDF stated it was unaware of arson by its troops and that a complaint is under review. The incident highlights the routine military use of Palestinian homes during operations, which has intensified amid soaring tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that approximately seven million households in the UK are not claiming a total of £24 billion in available financial aid, including benefits and social tariffs. Research from Policy in Practice identifies a lack of awareness, the complexity of the application process, and social stigma as the primary barriers preventing people from accessing this support. The unclaimed funds cover a range of assistance from universal credit and pension credit to local help like free school meals. While some progress is being made, a significant amount of support remains untapped. (not investment advice)</p>
