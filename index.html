          <p>Queen Mother Sirikit of Thailand passed away at the age of 93 in a Bangkok hospital after suffering from a blood infection. She was largely absent from public life in recent years due to declining health, following the death of her husband, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in 2016. Born in Bangkok in 1932, she married King Bhumibol in 1950 and they had four children, including King Vajiralongkorn. Thailand celebrates National Mother's Day on her birthday, August 12, honoring her as the "Mother of the Thai Nation" and celebrating mothers across the country. The late Queen Mother was a respected figure in Thailand, and her passing marks the end of an era. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier to the Caribbean. The US claims the increased military presence aims to combat drug trafficking, but Maduro views it as an intimidation tactic to destabilize his government. The US has also conducted airstrikes on boats allegedly belonging to drug traffickers, drawing condemnation and raising questions about their legality. Experts suggest the military buildup is intended to pressure the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle to turn against him. The situation is tense, with potential for further escalation between the two nations. </p>

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver addressed the recent federal indictments of Portland coach Chauncey Billups, Miami guard Terry Rozier, and former player Damon Jones in a gambling-related scheme. Silver expressed deep concern, emphasizing the importance of the integrity of the competition and apologizing to fans. He noted that the NBA investigated Rozier in March 2023 but found insufficient evidence to sanction him, though Rozier has now been placed on administrative leave. The House Committee on Commerce has requested information from Silver regarding the scandal, seeking details about fraudulent betting practices and actions the NBA intends to take to limit the disclosure of nonpublic information for illegal purposes. The arrests have cast a shadow over the opening week of the NBA season. </p>

          <p>The U.S. military is deploying an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, escalating military presence in the region amid increasing strikes against boats accused of carrying drugs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford strike group to the U.S. Southern Command region to disrupt illicit activities. This deployment adds significant resources to an area already experiencing a large U.S. military buildup, raising speculation about potential actions against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The move comes as tensions rise, with the Trump administration imposing sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro and increasing strikes on alleged drug-running vessels. </p>

There have been 14 West Nile virus infections documented in L.A. County in 2025, half of which are in the San Fernando Valley. A 2025 study showed that droughts raised risk factors for West Nile virus, consolidating infected mosquitos and birds around limited water sources, which can lead to higher infection rates among humans. Residents are advised to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites, especially in areas experiencing drought conditions. </p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, a wealthy figure in the cryptocurrency industry, who pled guilty to violating anti-money-laundering laws as CEO of Binance. The pardon follows Binance's settlement with the Treasury Department, which included exiting the U.S. market and paying a $4.3 billion penalty. Binance reportedly helped create the code for a stablecoin used by World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Trump's sons. This pardon highlights Trump's pattern of using clemency for political and personal gain. </p>

          <p>A group of MPs has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. The Treasury Select Committee believes that cuts to the allowance are unlikely to promote an investment culture in the UK. The committee's report concluded that cutting the cash ISA allowance is unlikely to incentivize people to invest their cash in stocks and shares. The proposed change specifically relates to cash Isas, with the chancellor considering reducing their tax-free amount to £10,000. (not investment advice) </p>

          <h2>Manual vs. Automatic Car</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:07:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is seeing a shift towards automatic cars, with one in three cars on the road now being automatic. The trend is driven by the upcoming ban on new petrol and diesel cars in 2030, as electric cars do not have manual gearboxes. New drivers face the dilemma of learning in an automatic or manual car, with some finding automatic instructors scarce and expensive. The pass rate for the manual test is higher than the automatic, but many still feel the pressure to pass quickly. </p>
