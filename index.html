          <p>Early Friday morning, Israel launched a preemptive strike against Iran, prompting Defense Minister Israel Katz to declare a state of emergency and warn of potential missile and drone attacks. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv following the announcement, and residents were instructed to remain in protected areas. According to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the United States was not involved in the Israeli strike, but was informed of Israel's belief that the action was necessary for self-defense. Videos circulating online showed explosions in eastern Tehran, with reports of jets and anti-aircraft missiles heard in northern Tehran. The situation remains fluid as further updates develop.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard to Los Angeles, siding with California officials who challenged the president's authority to federalize the guard for immigration enforcement. Judge Charles Breyer found that the administration likely exceeded its statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment. The judge directed the administration to return control of the California National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom, but the Justice Department swiftly appealed the order. Newsom has accused Trump of escalating tensions and destabilizing the community, while the administration argues the military is needed to protect federal employees and property.</p>

          <p>Many Americans are struggling with an affordability crisis, as highlighted by a recent CBS News poll indicating that two out of three Americans are stressed about their finances. The article profiles a teacher working a second job, a police officer unable to afford a home, and a 70-year-old widow seeking employment to supplement Social Security. Rising costs and stagnant wages are making it difficult for people to achieve the American dream of homeownership and financial security. These individuals express frustration with decision-makers who may not understand the daily struggles of average Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Research by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. This indicates that the domestication process of wild boars coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides new insights into the origins of pig domestication.</p>

          <p>At the US Open, Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler faced challenges at Oakmont Country Club, with only 10 of 156 players finishing under par. McIlroy, after a promising start, faltered with a four-over 74, while Scheffler carded a three-over par round. JJ Spaun emerged as the leader, posting a bogey-free 66. The notoriously difficult Pennsylvania course is hosting its record-extending 10th US Open, and dry weather is expected to make conditions even tougher.</p>
