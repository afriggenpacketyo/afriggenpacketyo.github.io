          <p>President Trump has stated that gold will not face tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs ruling that would have applied duties to certain gold bars from Switzerland. The announcement, made via a Truth Social post, caused gold futures to drop significantly. The initial customs ruling had caused concern within the Swiss Precious Metal Association, which warned the tariffs could apply to gold imports from any country, not just Switzerland.</p>

The judge stated that the documents contain no significant new information beyond what was already presented at trial and would not identify any new co-conspirators or clients.

CEO Thomas Siebel described the sales results as "completely unacceptable," attributing the poor performance to a disruptive internal reorganization and his own health issues. The company also anticipates a much wider operating loss, though Siebel expressed confidence in a future recovery as he initiates a search for his successor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was among approximately 300 parliamentarians who were temporarily detained by police in New Delhi during a protest. The lawmakers were marching to the Election Commission headquarters to demonstrate against alleged electoral malpractice, claiming voter rolls are being manipulated to favor the ruling BJP party. The protest was sparked by a large-scale revision of the electoral roll in the state of Bihar, which critics fear could disenfranchise millions, particularly minority voters.</p>

          <p>A new wellness trend, dubbed "cowmaxxing," is gaining popularity, advocating for the use of cow-based products like beef-tallow moisturizer, raw milk, and organ-meat supplements. Proponents, including some influencers and public figures, make various health claims, often appealing to a "natural is better" philosophy and a desire to return to ancestral lifestyles. The article notes that while some products may offer benefits, others carry significant health risks, such as consuming unpasteurized milk, and many of the claims are not supported by scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>Colorado is battling two major wildfires, with over a thousand firefighters deployed to manage the blazes amid dry and windy conditions. The Lee fire has become the fifth-largest single fire in state history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment. Sparked by lightning in an area suffering from extreme drought, the fire's behavior is expected to remain volatile. Evacuations are in effect for several mountain communities, and smoke has prompted air quality warnings across the region.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are holding meetings to align their positions before the upcoming summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
