          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing concerns over violence, antisemitism, and alleged coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, requiring current international students to transfer or lose their legal status. This move comes amid an ongoing dispute between the university and the administration regarding antisemitism on campus, with the administration having previously frozen $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard after the university rejected demands to eliminate DEI programs. As of fall 2023, international students comprised over 27% of Harvard's total enrollment.</p>

          <p>A fire at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol, UK, prompted the evacuation of pregnant women and babies from the maternity unit. The fire, which broke out on the roof and destroyed several solar panels, was quickly extinguished by Avon Fire and Rescue Service. Midwives supported the evacuees, moving them outside the building and later to the Bristol University Life Sciences building, while the cause of the fire is being investigated. The hospital, including the delivery suite, has since reopened, and appointments are proceeding as planned.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from the U.S. Naval Academy's libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own terms, which identified a broader range of titles, but the new review found only about 20 books needing removal pending further evaluation by a Department of Defense panel. This reversal follows a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms for DEI-related content, aiming for compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs; the standardized search terms included terms such as 'affirmative action,' 'anti-racism,' and 'gender affirming care.' Almost all of the originally pulled books have been returned to circulation.</p>

Lischinsky and Milgrim were a young couple about to be engaged, with Lischinsky recently purchasing a ring with plans to propose in Jerusalem.

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move that allows the state to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including the 'EV mandate' requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California officials have vowed to sue the federal government if the waivers are revoked, as 16 additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>

          <p>The conflict in Thailand's deep south, involving Thai military forces and separatist groups seeking greater autonomy, has seen a resurgence of violence in 2025, with 38 violent incidents recorded between January and early May. Key escalations include a BRN attack on Narathiwat's Sungai Kolok District Office and the killing of senior BRN member Abdulroning Lateh, leading to increased targeting of civilians. While politicians like Thaksin Shinawatra have pledged to end the unrest, analysts suggest these efforts are more symbolic, and Malaysia's role as a facilitator in peace talks remains limited.</p>

          <p>In a 4-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court has rejected a plan to allow Oklahoma to use government funds to run the nationâ€™s first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself, resulting in the tie and upholding the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling against the school, which aimed to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. The deadlock sets no national precedent on the broader issue of state-sponsored religious charter schools, but the question is likely to return to the court, where the conservative majority has often favored allowing religion a greater role in public life. The court's decision did not include individual justice votes, only stating that the lower court ruling was affirmed.</p>

          <p>Teachers and doctors in England have been granted a 4% pay rise following government acceptance of salary recommendations, though health unions have reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff. Education unions have welcomed the decision but warn of potential budget cuts without additional funding, while the British Medical Association considers strike action over the 'woefully inadequate' rise for resident doctors. These rises come after ministers accepted proposals from pay review bodies, and there are concerns about how the government will fund the increases without affecting frontline services.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4-4 decision, effectively blocking public funding for a religious charter school in Oklahoma, which would have been the first of its kind in the nation. The tie vote affirms a lower court ruling that the school violates the U.S. Constitution's religious boundaries, as the 1st Amendment prohibits government establishment of religion. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, and while the ruling is not a country-wide precedent, it is seen as a test of the US Constitution's religious boundaries.</p>
