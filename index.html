            <p>The United States has escalated its trade tensions with China by introducing a new executive order aimed at curbing China's dominance in the global shipbuilding industry. The order directs the U.S. Trade Representative to consider imposing tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes and other cargo-handling equipment linked to China, potentially affecting most U.S. ports. This action follows objections from shipping executives regarding proposed steep fees for Chinese-linked ships entering U.S. ports, although the original fee proposal was softened in the final order. The administration remains focused on countering China's influence in the maritime sector. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK economy experienced a surprising growth of 0.5% in February, exceeding predictions of 0.1%, driven by a strong performance in the services sector and increased exports to the US ahead of new tariffs. Goods exports to the US reached their highest level since November 2022, with firms accelerating shipments to avoid tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US. While the government views this growth as encouraging, analysts warn that the impact of upcoming tax rises and US tariffs may lead to short-lived economic gains. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. military has fired the commander of the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, Col. Susannah Meyers, after she reportedly sent an email distancing herself from Vice-President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark. Vance had stated that Denmark had not done a good job for Greenlanders, and the alleged email from Meyers contradicted those remarks. The Pentagon stated that undermining the chain of command or subverting President Trump's agenda would not be tolerated.</p>

            <p>An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan has been identified as belonging to Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins. This finding expands the known range of Denisovans, who also interacted with Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. While DNA analysis was impossible due to the fossil's condition, protein sequences extracted from the jawbone resembled those of Denisovan fossils found in Siberia. Some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.</p>

While overall revenue is still growing, MLB faces revenue headwinds from the decline of regional sports networks and a lack of a salary cap. Despite these challenges, there's a belief that baseball is undervalued compared to other leagues, and international prospects are bright. (not investment advice)</p>

However, China has indicated that further tariff increases would be ignored, suggesting a potential stalemate. While this truce may marginally increase the likelihood of negotiations, the deep mistrust between the two nations could lead to the invocation of non-tariff measures, potentially escalating geopolitical tensions.

            <p>Efforts are underway to revive the sunflower sea star population along the Pacific Coast to restore kelp forests. The sunflower sea stars, once abundant, were decimated by a wasting disease, leading to an overpopulation of urchins that devour kelp. A successful spawning of sea stars in captivity has marked a milestone in breeding the animals for eventual release into the wild. If the starfish population is revived, it could help restore the balance in the ecosystem and combat climate change.</p>
