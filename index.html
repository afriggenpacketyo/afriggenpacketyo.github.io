          <p>A study comparing life expectancies of individuals born between 1900 and 2000 reveals minimal improvements in many Southern states, particularly for women, contrasting sharply with significant gains in the Northeast and West. West Virginia showed a mere one-year increase in life expectancy for women, while New York saw a roughly two-decade increase. The study attributes these regional discrepancies to variations in state public health policies, tobacco regulations, vaccine policies, and socioeconomic factors, emphasizing the impact of state-level decisions on longevity. The research analyzed 179 million deaths, highlighting the need for progressive public health measures to improve life expectancy across all regions. The article emphasizes the complex interplay of factors influencing health outcomes across different states.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to ease some automotive tariffs previously implemented by his administration, addressing concerns from the car industry grappling with regulatory uncertainty and increased costs. While tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will remain, the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff burden on vehicle imports resulting from additional levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers assembling vehicles in the U.S. will be eligible for partial reimbursements on parts-related tariffs for two years, with potential offsets calculated as a percentage of the car's value. The article indicates that the offer is retroactive to when the tariffs took effect on April 3, although the specific reimbursement process remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Bret Stephens of *The New York Times* interviews Dane Chapin, an entrepreneur whose business, USAopoly (the Op), faces significant challenges due to President Trump's tariffs. Chapin expresses concern that the tariffs, particularly the sudden increase to 145%, could obliterate the toy business, as roughly three-quarters of his games are made in China. He notes that while he doesn't object to taking a harder line on China, he's offended that large tech companies receive tariff exceptions while smaller American businesses do not. Chapin also mentions that he doesn't regret voting for Trump, considering the Democratic alternative, but he does regret the current trade policy, emphasizing the potential for a business-friendly Democrat to win over disaffected Trump voters.</p>
