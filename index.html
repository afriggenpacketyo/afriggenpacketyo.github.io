          <p>A demonstration in London supporting the recently banned organization Palestine Action resulted in 532 arrests, the largest number by the Metropolitan Police in a decade. The majority of arrests were for displaying placards in support of the group, which was proscribed as a terrorist organization in July. The event has sparked a debate over the application of terrorism laws to protest groups, with human rights organizations expressing concern over the broadness of the legislation, while the government defends the ban based on security advice.</p>

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accused Texas Governor Greg Abbott of undermining democracy to support Donald Trump. In response, Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return to Texas and vowed to call continuous special legislative sessions until the new congressional maps, which could favor the GOP, are passed.</p>

          <p>A toy store in La Puente, California, was burglarized, with thieves stealing approximately $7,000 worth of the highly popular Labubu dolls. The collectible toys, which originated in China, have seen a massive surge in global popularity, becoming a billion-dollar industry for parent company Pop Mart. Marketing experts attribute their appeal to a "blind box" sales model that creates rarity and a gambling-like thrill for consumers. The high demand has also led to a market for counterfeit versions.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency is experiencing a surge in acceptance within Washington and Wall Street, bolstered by the Trump administration's supportive stance. Recent legislation has opened doors for major companies to issue digital currencies, and Congress is considering a regulatory framework heavily influenced by the crypto industry's lobbying efforts. However, former SEC officials warn that crypto remains a highly speculative and volatile asset, drawing parallels to the subprime mortgages that led to the 2008 financial crisis and cautioning that consumers are vulnerable to scams.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The summit comes after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, though that deadline passed without an agreement. The meeting aims to break the stalemate after previous talks failed, but Ukraine is not currently slated to attend, prompting its president to state that any decisions made without Kyiv's involvement would be "dead decisions." The agenda will likely include potential territorial swaps, a highly contentious point for Ukraine.</p>

The mindfulness technique involves immersing oneself in nature to connect with the environment through all senses, which research shows can lower stress and enhance focus. Certified guides lead sessions that encourage quiet reflection and meditation, but experts note the benefits can be achieved even with short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard.

          <p>An environmental scientist on TikTok has refuted a common climate change myth by clarifying the distinction between natural climate cycles and human-influenced warming. In a video, she explains that while the Earth does experience natural periods of warming and cooling, the current rapid temperature increase is unequivocally driven by human emissions from burning fossil fuels. She emphasizes that this is a well-documented scientific consensus, highlighting that atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels are far higher than in any natural cycle, accelerating dangerous global warming.</p>

The summit was arranged through back-channel talks led by envoy Steve Witkoff, following Trump's growing frustration with Putin's refusal to negotiate, and represents a significant moment in their tumultuous relationship.</p>

          <p>Three cardiologists have identified licorice root as a supplement that individuals with high blood pressure should never take. The herb contains a compound called glycyrrhizin, which can dangerously elevate blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance strains the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including headaches, fluid retention, and arrhythmias. Experts advise that even consuming black licorice candy can be risky and recommend consulting a doctor before starting any new supplement.</p>
