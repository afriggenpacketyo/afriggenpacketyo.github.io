          <p>President Trump indicated he might travel to the Middle East, potentially Egypt or Gaza, this weekend to support ongoing peace talks between Hamas and Israel. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are already in Egypt for indirect negotiations centered on a 20-point proposal unveiled last month. Trump expressed optimism about the talks, which follow Hamas's partial acceptance of the U.S.-led plan, amidst a federal government shutdown. The proposal's first phase involves Hamas releasing remaining hostages within 72 hours.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline during a meeting in Washington. Carney raised the project in the context of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, finding Trump receptive to the idea. The pipeline, designed to transport 830,000 barrels of oil daily from Alberta to Nebraska, was previously blocked by the Obama and Biden administrations due to environmental concerns. Despite Trump's past support, the company behind it had abandoned the project after permits were cancelled, incurring billions in losses.</p>

Intrator asserted that these agreements, including a $6.5 billion expansion with OpenAI and a $14.2 billion deal with Meta, represent a fundamental infrastructure buildout driven by genuine demand from major tech companies. He highlighted Nvidia's significant backing and purchasing obligations, emphasizing that such partnerships are common during massive infrastructure expansions. The CEO dismissed the "circular investment" narrative as a fleeting concern, citing enormous market drivers for AI cloud infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Christina Chapman, a 50-year-old suburban woman, operated a covert cyber operations hub from her Arizona home, facilitating North Korean IT workers' infiltration into hundreds of U.S. companies. These operatives used stolen American identities to secure remote IT jobs, with Chapman receiving over 100 company laptops and phones, routing them through VPNs and voice-changing software to mask their true location. She even impersonated workers for video verification and laundered over $17 million in stolen salaries for Kim Jong Un's regime, earning $800,000 herself. Chapman was sentenced to 102 months in federal prison for this national security threat.</p>

          <p>A New York City administrative judge dismissed a civil summons against writer Alex O’Keefe, who was detained last month in a viral seating dispute on a train. O'Keefe, a Black speechwriter, had alleged he was harassed and detained for "sitting while Black" after an "old white woman" complained about his seating. Police accused him of occupying two seats and refusing to exit the train, causing delays. O'Keefe maintained his innocence, and his attorney praised the court's decision, calling the charges "facially insufficient."</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, was captured in Atlanta after a standoff. His arrest concludes a months-long multi-agency manhunt that began after the inmates fled through a hole behind a toilet. Groves, who faced life imprisonment for a second-degree murder conviction, was found in a crawl space after a SWAT team deployed gas canisters. The escape highlighted major design flaws and staffing issues at the 2015-built jail, with a former employee also facing charges for allegedly aiding Groves.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned that air traffic control shortages are contributing to flight delays across the U.S., a concern exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport experienced half-hour delays due to staffing issues, and the FAA previously slowed arrivals in Burbank and Nashville. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted a "slight uptick" in sick calls among controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association highlighted that nearly 11,000 certified controllers are working extended shifts, demonstrating dedication despite the lack of payment.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, from Florida, has been arrested on suspicion of arson in connection with the deadly Palisades Fire in Los Angeles. Officials allege Rinderknecht started the Lachman Fire on January 1, which, despite initial suppression, smoldered underground and reignited a week later due to Santa Ana winds, becoming the catastrophic Palisades Fire. This inferno burned over 23,000 acres, killed twelve people, and destroyed more than 6,800 structures.

The central bank implemented a quarter-point cut, its first since December 2024, with one official dissenting for a larger cut and others considering no change.

          <p>Elon Musk and X (formerly Twitter) have reached a settlement in a $128 million lawsuit filed by four former top executives, including ex-CEO Parag Agrawal, over unpaid severance. The executives alleged they were fired "without reason" after Musk's 2022 acquisition and denied their rightful severance and stock awards under a long-standing plan. This settlement follows a similar agreement in August with approximately 6,000 rank-and-file employees over $500 million in severance pay. The lawsuit contended Musk's actions were part of a pattern of refusing to pay former staff what they were due.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, has been arrested in Florida in connection with the deadly Pacific Palisades fire, which killed 12 and destroyed over 6,000 homes in January. Investigators found digital evidence, including a ChatGPT-generated image of a burning city and prompts about burning a Bible and asking if one is at fault for a fire from cigarettes. Officials allege Rinderknecht started the initial Lachman fire on New Year's Day, which later reignited. The use of AI-generated images and search queries as evidence marks a significant development in the investigation.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to name a new prime minister within 48 hours, aiming to resolve a political stalemate following the resignation of Sébastien Lecornu, the third PM in less than a year. Lecornu's talks with parties indicated a desire to avoid fresh elections and pass a budget by year-end. The challenge remains forming a stable government amidst a hung parliament and deeply divided ideological lines, with significant national debt and contested pension reforms complicating matters. Some factions, like Marine Le Pen's National Rally, vow to oppose any new government.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators determined the devastating Palisades Fire was a "holdover" from an intentionally set Lachman fire on New Year's Day, which smoldered underground for a week before reigniting. This raises questions about the Los Angeles Fire Department's (LAFD) actions, particularly its decision not to pre-deploy engines despite warnings of extreme winds. While an ATF agent stated blame lies solely with the arsonist, former arson unit head Ed Nordskog argues the LAFD has a duty to patrol for re-ignitions. The article details the timeline of the initial fire and the LAFD's subsequent actions, or lack thereof, in the days leading up to the catastrophic blaze.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor faces scrutiny after her team's underwhelming 1-1 draw against Twente in their Women's Champions League opener. Former England forward Lianne Sanderson criticized Bompastor's "wrong team selection" and "disjointed" performance, suggesting she took Twente lightly. Despite Chelsea's statistical dominance, they converted only one of six attempts on target. This result contrasts sharply with Barcelona's dominant 7-1 win, putting pressure on Bompastor to find her best XI as Chelsea seeks its first European trophy. The manager acknowledged the result was "not good at all."</p>

AMD's market capitalization now stands at $380 billion, with shares up 43% this week, marking its best weekly gain since April 2016. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at the deal, calling it "imaginative" and "unique" given OpenAI's previous close ties to Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering raising NHS payments to pharmaceutical firms by up to 25% to resolve a dispute over drug pricing, which has prompted companies like MSD and AstraZeneca to pause UK investments. Labour's proposals aim to increase the cost-effectiveness threshold for new medicines, potentially aligning it with inflation. This move, debated between the Department of Health and the Treasury, comes amid pressure from the Trump administration for pharma companies to lower US drug prices and increase them elsewhere.
