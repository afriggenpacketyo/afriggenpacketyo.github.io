          <p>SoftBank Group's shares surged over 10% to a record high following a first-quarter profit report that significantly exceeded market expectations. The company's profit of 421.8 billion yen was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021, thanks to strong performance from portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. While some analysts see the firm as a unique vehicle for AI investment, particularly with its stakes in Arm and OpenAI, others caution that the company's stock may be overvalued.

          <p>A potential summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly being negotiated and could occur as soon as next week, with Rome being one of the discussed locations. This meeting would be the first between the two leaders since Trump's return to office and could be a significant moment in the ongoing war, though its success is not guaranteed. The situation is complicated by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's firm stance against conceding any territory in a peace deal.</p>

          <p>The bookseller Waterstones has issued an apology following widespread complaints about its annual BookFest event at its flagship Piccadilly store. Attendees described the event as "utter chaos" and "downright dangerous" due to severe overcrowding, with long queues blocking stairs and potential fire exits. Visitors reported a lack of staff for crowd control and assistance, leading to stressful situations and safety concerns, though the company stated that attendee safety was never at risk.</p>

          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, has admitted to mistaking a charity rowing crew for undocumented migrants near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. He posted on social media about a "dinghy" arriving on the coast and alerted authorities, only to later learn it was a team raising money for motor neurone disease. In a subsequent post, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, while the rowers, one of whom is a former Royal Marine, found the situation humorous.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has cut federal funding for the National Crime Prevention Council's "Go For Real" campaign, which featured McGruff the Crime Dog educating young people about the dangers of fentanyl and counterfeit pills.

          <p>Las Vegas has experienced its sixth consecutive month of declining visitor numbers, a trend that may indicate wider economic challenges for the United States. Factors contributing to the 11.3% year-over-year drop in June include persistent inflation, the impact of trade policies on international travel, and more cautious consumer spending. Economists view the city's tourism health as a bellwether for the national economy, as it reflects consumer confidence and discretionary spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-term study by Northwestern University is shedding light on "SuperAgers," a unique group of people aged 80 and older who maintain the memory function of individuals 20 to 30 years younger. Research shows their brains shrink at a significantly slower rate than their peers, offering remarkable resistance to normal age-related cognitive decline. Scientists hope that by studying this group, they can uncover secrets to protecting the brain and potentially preventing diseases like Alzheimer's.</p>

          <p>Washington has threatened to review Kenya's status as a Major Non-NATO Ally following Kenyan President William Ruto's public praise for China's role in a "new world order." This special status, granted in 2024, provides Kenya with preferential military and economic benefits and was seen as a U.S. strategy to counter Chinese influence. A proposed amendment now calls for a detailed assessment of Kenya's deep financial and political engagements with Beijing, escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a steep 39% tariff on Swiss imports, citing a $48 billion trade deficit it claims is evidence of unfair practices. However, this deficit is significantly distorted by Switzerland's massive gold refining industry, which processes high-value gold but adds little to the country's actual economic output. Swiss officials argue that gold should be excluded from the calculation and that the tariffs will unfairly punish other key industries like pharmaceuticals and watchmaking.

          <p>In a push to bolster domestic innovation, major Chinese tech companies like Xiaomi are launching large-scale hiring initiatives for recent graduates with science and technology degrees. The recruitment drives focus on key areas such as software research, algorithms, and hardware development. This trend reflects a strategic effort by China's tech sector to cultivate local talent and reduce its dependence on foreign technology, particularly in response to ongoing U.S. export controls on advanced chips.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation to impose stricter controls on serious violent and sexual offenders after their release from prison. The new plan would confine offenders to specific, tailored geographical zones, policed by enhanced electronic tagging, rather than just excluding them from certain areas. This shift aims to provide victims with greater peace of mind, though it has raised concerns about increasing the workload of an already strained probation service.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece from The Guardian explores the complex ethical territory of using artificial intelligence to digitally recreate the deceased. The discussion was prompted by a journalist's recent interview with an AI avatar of Joaquin Oliver, a 17-year-old victim of the Parkland school shooting, created at his parents' request. The article raises critical questions about grief, consent, the rights of the dead, and the profound risks of blurring reality in an era of misinformation.</p>

          <p>Top global insurers like Allianz and Zurich are sounding the alarm that the climate crisis could soon make entire regions uninsurable. They warn that as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, the financial risks will become too great for the industry to cover, threatening the stability of financial services like mortgages. The growing "protection gap," where economic losses from disasters are uninsured, is creating a societal problem that may become unbearable. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), the UK government will almost certainly need to raise taxes to meet its own fiscal rules. The chancellor is caught in a "trilemma," unable to simultaneously balance the budget, fulfill spending commitments, and honor manifesto promises not to raise taxes on working people. This leaves the government with few palatable options ahead of the Autumn Budget, with potential hikes to VAT or income tax looking necessary. (not investment advice)</p>
