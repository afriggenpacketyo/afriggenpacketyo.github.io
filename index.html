          <p>A student opened fire at Evergreen High School near Denver, wounding two students before taking his own life. Authorities responded quickly, but one of the injured victims later died at the hospital, with another remaining in critical condition. The incident, which took place during lunchtime, prompted a large law enforcement response and a chaotic reunification process for parents and students. The event has renewed discussions among the community about school safety protocols and the increasing frequency of such tragedies in the United States.</p>

          <p>China has inaugurated the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, connecting the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou. The 10.3km structure is a multi-functional crossing, uniquely designed to carry an expressway, a regular road, and an intercity railway simultaneously. Its innovative asymmetrical design accommodates the heavier railway on one side of the lower deck, a first for a bridge of this scale. This engineering feat significantly reduces travel time between the two cities from over an hour to just 20 minutes.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index soared to a new all-time high, driven by optimism over potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts and positive inflation data. Tech investment giant SoftBank Group was a major contributor, with its stock jumping nearly 10%. While the Nikkei experienced significant gains, other Asian markets showed mixed results, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland China's CSI 300 seeing declines. The record follows a strong performance on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 also reached a new closing high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has formally appealed a federal judge's ruling that temporarily blocked him from removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. The judge had argued that Cook's reinstatement was in the public interest to maintain the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump's administration sought to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Critics suggest the move is part of a broader effort by Trump to influence the central bank's interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>In an emotional address, Utah Governor Spencer Cox condemned the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, labeling it a "political assassination." Cox emphasized that the act was an attack on American democratic values and freedom of speech, noting Kirk was a husband and father. He vowed that law enforcement would find the perpetrator and hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law, even mentioning the state's death penalty. The governor also lamented the broader trend of political violence in the nation.</p>

          <p>An investigation is ongoing after approximately 75 cargo containers fell from a vessel at the Port of Long Beach, resulting in a minor oil spill and one worker sustaining a sprained ankle. The containers, filled with consumer goods, tumbled into the water and onto a smaller emissions-collection barge while the ship was offloading. Officials have established a safety zone and are working to contain the light oil sheen, which originated from the damaged barge. While the cause of the incident remains unknown, port operations are continuing with minimal disruption.</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents in rural West Virginia, particularly in former coal-mining regions, lack access to safe and reliable drinking water, forcing many to rely on untreated sources like abandoned mines. The area's water infrastructure, once maintained by coal companies, has fallen into severe disrepair following the industry's decline, with treatment plants now crumbling. Non-profit organizations like DigDeep are stepping in to help rebuild these essential systems, bringing clean tap water to some communities for the first time in a decade. This effort provides a glimmer of hope for residents long accustomed to water insecurity.</p>

          <p>Following a successful market debut where its shares climbed significantly, financial analyst Jim Cramer has suggested that stock in the Swedish online lender Klarna remains a good buy. Klarna, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, saw its stock open at $52 and close up over 14% on its first day of trading. Cramer noted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and what he described as "impressive underwriting standards," despite it not yet returning to profitability. He expressed confidence in its valuation, citing the success of publicly traded competitors like Affirm. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State lawmakers in California have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, the Los Angeles "mansion tax," amid concerns that it has stifled housing development. The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, would reduce the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties. Measure ULA, passed in 2022, levies a tax on property sales over $5.3 million to fund homelessness prevention programs. Critics argue the tax has had a chilling effect on new construction, and this legislative overhaul aims to balance revenue generation with the need for more housing.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 19:17:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The once-popular "stand and stir" format of television cooking shows is rapidly disappearing from broadcast schedules, with commissions for food programs dropping 44% in a year. This decline is attributed to the explosive growth of food content on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, where creators can react to trends like the "cronut" almost instantly. Online influencers offer a sense of authenticity and direct community engagement that traditional, heavily regulated television production cannot match. This shift reflects a broader cultural change where audiences, particularly younger viewers, prefer the "raw and real" feel of user-generated content over polished TV productions.</p>

Whistleblowers claim senior positions at SOS Syria were appointed by the Assad palace and that the charity took in children to meet funding targets.

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," financial commentator Jim Cramer reflected on the evolution of market sentiment over the past three decades. He recalled the early days of the show in the 1990s, when there was widespread excitement about individual stocks, a feeling he believes is returning to today's market. Cramer noted that after the dot-com bubble burst, many investors shifted to index funds out of fear, but now sees a renewed awareness of the potential rewards of single-stock investing. He credited the show with helping to "democratize" market information for the average person.</p>

Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, proposed that the U.S. should export "cohesive AI tech stacks" that include not just chips but also algorithms and applications. This strategy aims to prevent China from gaining global market share and to ensure U.S. allies adopt American technology standards.

She was then allegedly lured into a vehicle by two individuals who promised to help her, but was instead taken to an apartment and sexually assaulted at knifepoint.

          <p>England's cricket captain, Harry Brook, expressed his frustration after a rain-disrupted T20 match against South Africa in Cardiff, describing the evening as a "shambles."

England ultimately fell short, losing the opening match of the three-game series. Brook stated that little could be learned from such a disjointed contest and also defended the decision to rest key bowler Jofra Archer due to the difficult conditions.</p>

MPs argue that the LISA's dual purpose—saving for a first home and for retirement—can lead to poor investment choices. The committee also questioned the product's value to taxpayers, as it is projected to cost £3 billion over five years, despite evidence that most users could have bought a home without it.

These tiny spiders are known for the males' vibrant colors and elaborate courtship dances. Researchers hypothesize that the large amount of non-gene DNA, or "dark DNA," in their genetic code may allow them to adapt and evolve into new species with exceptional rapidity. This research is part of the broader Earth BioGenome Project, which aims to decode the DNA of all life on Earth to gain deeper insights into evolution.</p>
