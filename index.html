        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Circle Internet Group's shares rose significantly after it reported a 53% increase in second-quarter revenue, reaching $658.1 million, driven by robust growth in its USDC stablecoin. Despite a net loss due to one-time charges related to its recent public offering, the company saw USDC circulation grow 90% year-over-year. The strong performance and positive market sentiment are also attributed to a more favorable U.S. regulatory environment for stablecoins. Circle also announced plans for a new proprietary blockchain, Arc, to further enhance its financial services platform.</p>

          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has suggested that the agency should suspend its monthly jobs report. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, criticized the report as flawed and argued for relying on what he considers more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data. This controversial proposal follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner and his public criticism of the agency's standard practice of revising jobs data as more information becomes available.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July showed that headline inflation held steady at 2.7% year-over-year, as falling gas and grocery prices offset other increases. However, economists point to concerning signs beneath the surface, with core inflation rising to a 3.1% annual pace. Experts suggest that the effects of the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are beginning to put upward pressure on the prices of certain goods and services, a trend that is expected to become more pronounced.

This poses an increased risk of a crash. Owners will be notified and dealers will replace the rear axle shaft assemblies free of charge.</p>

          <p>This article explores the legal framework behind President Trump's move to take control of the Washington, D.C. police force, citing the 1973 Home Rule Act. While the law permits the president to assume command of the city's police during a self-declared emergency, it imposes a strict 30-day time limit on this authority unless Congress formally approves an extension. The analysis highlights that this provision acts as a significant check on presidential power, though it raises questions about potential attempts to circumvent it.</p>

Jolie has previously expressed that the divorce proceedings were the primary reason for her remaining in L.A., a city she reportedly never intended to live in full-time, as she seeks more privacy for her family.</p>

          <p>As stock market performance remains unpredictable, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure alternative for savers seeking stable returns. This article calculates that with current interest rates, a $100,000 deposit in a CD could earn from over $1,000 on a 3-month term to more than $22,000 on a 5-year term. The primary benefit of a CD is its fixed, guaranteed interest rate, which protects the principal investment from market volatility while providing predictable growth over the chosen term.

          <p>Authorities have identified Patrick Joseph White as the gunman who fatally shot a police officer outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta before taking his own life. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, documents found at the 30-year-old's home expressed discontent with COVID-19 vaccinations and a desire to publicize his views. The attack resulted in the death of DeKalb County Officer David Rose and prompted a lockdown and massive law enforcement response at the prominent public health institution.</p>
