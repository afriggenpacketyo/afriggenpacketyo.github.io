          <p>Former President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch and his father Rupert Murdoch could be involved in a group seeking to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other potential partners in the deal. The comments were made during a Fox News interview, highlighting ongoing efforts to restructure the social media platform's ownership in the United States amid national security concerns. This development adds prominent conservative media and tech figures to the list of potential stakeholders in the platform's future.</p>

Speaking to reporters before his departure, Trump expressed his intent to offer comfort and love to Kirk's family, reflecting on the activist's significant impact and the respect he commanded among his followers. The event is framed as a moment for healing, though the circumstances of Kirk's death have intensified national conversations about political rhetoric and violence.

          <p>In a detailed interview, French President Emmanuel Macron explained his government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move he will announce at the United Nations. Macron argued that recognition is necessary to provide a political solution, isolate Hamas, and preserve the possibility of a two-state resolution, rather than being a reward for terrorism. He outlined a multi-phase peace plan beginning with a ceasefire and hostage release, while also addressing criticism from the U.S. and Israel regarding the timing and potential consequences of the decision. The French leader also discussed Russia's aggression in Europe and transatlantic relations.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition has approved an 8% cut to the budget for the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, reducing it by approximately €910 million. Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan acknowledged the reduction comes at a time of urgent need, warning it will impact global crises, though she stated German policy remains distinct from more drastic cuts seen in the U.S. Aid organizations have sounded the alarm, predicting the cuts will affect millions by reducing food aid, healthcare access, and clean water provisions in vulnerable regions worldwide.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially announced their recognition of a Palestinian state. The leaders of all three nations stated the decision is intended to build momentum for a two-state solution and is not a reward for Hamas, which they emphasized can have no future role in governance. This historic step aligns them with over 140 other countries but places them at odds with allies Israel and the United States, who argue the timing is inappropriate and undermines diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>The Southeastern Conference (SEC) has acknowledged a significant officiating mistake during Auburn's 24-17 loss to Oklahoma, stating a Sooners touchdown should have been nullified. The play involved a receiver feigning a substitution before catching an uncontested pass, a tactic the SEC confirmed was an illegal "hideout" play that should have prompted an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Auburn coach Hugh Freeze expressed deep frustration over this and another disputed call, with the seven-point margin of defeat making the officiating errors particularly impactful for the Tigers. The admission validates Auburn's complaints but does not change the game's outcome.</p>

          <p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland's athletics team concluded the World Championships in Japan without a single gold medal for the first time in 22 years, securing a total of five medals. This result matches their lowest overall count since 2005 and placed them 21st in the medal table, a significant drop from their seventh-place finish two years prior. Head coach Paula Dunn described the performance as a "mixed bag" with missed opportunities, citing challenging heat and humidity as factors. The disappointing showing, particularly the failure to medal in any relay events, has prompted calls for a thorough review ahead of future competitions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to impose a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas is forcing a major strategic shift for India's $283 billion IT industry. This sector, which heavily relies on the visa program to place skilled workers in the U.S., must now reconsider its long-standing model of rotating talent onshore. Industry experts predict that companies will reduce cross-border travel, accelerate the offshoring of work, and increase local hiring in the U.S. to mitigate the financial impact. The move is expected to disrupt project timelines and pressure profit margins for Indian IT firms that service major U.S. clients.</p>

However, other experts caution that further rate cuts into a healthy economy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" based on investor FOMO rather than solid fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction.

          <p>According to wellness expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, persistent stress hastens this decline, which is linked to various health problems. However, Epel emphasizes that this damage is reversible through lifestyle adjustments. She recommends simple, sustainable daily practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga to restore cellular health and slow the aging process.</p>

The reconsideration comes amid reports that the Labour Party plans to introduce a digital ID scheme.

Key mistakes to avoid include hoarding points, which can be devalued by issuers at any time, and failing to periodically reassess if a card still aligns with one's lifestyle.

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of check-in and baggage systems, has caused significant disruptions at several European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the company's MUSE software forced airlines to revert to manual check-in processes, leading to long delays and flight cancellations. Brussels Airport has requested airlines to cancel half of their Monday departures as the provider works to deliver a secure, updated version of the system. This incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to supply chain cyber threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent wave of countries recognizing a Palestinian state, including the UK, Canada, and Australia, has brought a critical question to the forefront: who would lead such a state? The Palestinian political landscape is deeply fractured, with the West Bank governed by the Palestinian Authority under an aging Mahmoud Abbas and Gaza's leadership uncertain after years of Hamas rule and devastating conflict. The last presidential election was held in 2006, leaving a significant leadership vacuum. This analysis explores the immense challenges of unifying the geographically and politically divided territories and establishing a functioning government, a core criterion for statehood.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law that will prohibit most on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal agents from agencies like ICE, from wearing face masks. The ban, effective January 2026, was introduced in response to federal agents wearing masks during immigration raids in Los Angeles. The legislation includes exceptions for specific situations, such as undercover operations, health protection, or the use of tactical gear. This move is part of a broader package of bills signed by Governor Gavin Newsom aimed at increasing police transparency and protecting immigrant communities from what he termed "secret police" tactics.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has firmly rejected comments from U.S. President Donald Trump about re-establishing an American presence at Bagram Air Base. Trump had stated that talks were underway with Afghanistan regarding the base, which U.S. forces vacated during their 2021 withdrawal. A Taliban spokesman dismissed the assertion, urging the U.S. to adhere to the Doha Agreement, which prohibits threats against Afghanistan's territorial integrity. The exchange highlights the tense and informal nature of relations between the U.S. and the current Afghan government four years after the American withdrawal.</p>

The race was marked by an early exit for McLaren's Oscar Piastri, the current championship leader, who crashed on the first lap after an uncharacteristic error. Piastri's main rival and teammate, Lando Norris, was unable to fully capitalize, finishing seventh after getting stuck in traffic. The result tightens the championship race slightly, while Williams' Carlos Sainz celebrated the team's first podium finish since 2021 by securing third place.</p>

          <p>A global effort called Seabed 2030 aims to create a complete map of the world's ocean floor by the end of the decade, a vast and largely unexplored domain. Currently, only about 20% of the seabed has been surveyed with modern sonar, leaving underwater mountains and canyons less charted than the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. Environmental journalist Laura Trethewey notes that a complete map could unlock scientific discoveries and insights into past climate change. However, it also raises concerns that detailed knowledge of the ocean floor could accelerate resource exploitation, such as deep-sea mining, in poorly regulated international waters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the historical and contemporary pattern of authoritarian leaders promoting traditional domestic roles for women to support state ideology. Drawing parallels between Nazi Germany's focus on "cradle and ladle" and the current American right's rhetoric, it argues that such movements politicize family life to reinforce patriarchal hierarchies and national strength. The analysis points to the rise of the digital "womanosphere," where online influencers promote homemaking and traditional femininity, which can align with political agendas that roll back women's rights. The article suggests this dynamic encourages women to absorb societal pressures and fill gaps left by a retreating social safety net.</p>

Berkshire began selling its shares in August 2022, and a recent financial filing confirmed the remaining position has been liquidated. The sale concludes one of the firm's most successful international investments, with Buffett previously citing geopolitical risk as a factor in reducing exposure in the region.
