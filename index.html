          <p>The FDA has approved Teal Health's at-home alternative to the Pap smear, the first of its kind in the U.S. The Teal Wand uses a swab to collect vaginal samples that women mail to a lab for HPV testing. A U.S.-based study found at-home screening as effective as in-office procedures, with women preferring the convenience. This aims to increase screening rates and reduce cervical cancer deaths, particularly among Black and Native American women, with the device available by prescription through telehealth services starting next month in California before expanding nationwide.</p>

          <p>After nearly 45 years, a man found dead in Oregon along Interstate 5 has been identified as Larry Eugene Parks, 30.

          <p>European leaders, including those from Poland, the UK, France, and Germany, have urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine starting on Monday. The announcement came after discussions with US President Donald Trump, with threats of "massive" sanctions if Russia does not comply. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that the ceasefire should be unconditional, while Russia insists on halting Western military aid first. The proposed truce would be monitored mainly by the US, with European support, and would lead to coordinated sanctions if violated.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a booster malfunction, re-entered the atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean.

Experts note the re-entry, while historically significant, is not uncommon, as space debris frequently falls back to Earth, and they also note that it is a reminder of the amount of material from the space race still orbiting the Earth.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in state prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth befriended the victim while preparing her taxes and offered bogus "investment opportunities" promising high returns with no risk. She ran a Ponzi scheme, using money from new investors to pay off earlier ones and funding a lavish lifestyle. The scheme collapsed when the victim requested her money back, leaving her financially destitute.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed, breed, and maintain ecosystem balance. Rising sea levels are impacting coastal stopover locations, and ocean acidification is affecting the crustaceans that migratory birds rely on for food. Extreme weather events pose direct threats, while warmer temperatures can cause birds to shorten their routes or abandon traditional habitats. The loss of migratory birds could disrupt agriculture and the food chain, highlighting the need for conservation efforts and international treaties.</p>
