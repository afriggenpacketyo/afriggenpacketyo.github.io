          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, reversing his detention by ICE. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations. The judge cited concerns over the constitutionality of the government's justification for detaining Khalil, stating that it appeared to be a punishment for his protests against Israel's actions in Gaza. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his wife expressed relief at his impending return home to their family, while the White House maintains Khalil engaged in fraud and misrepresentation.</p>

          <p>Representative Darrell Issa has suggested a constitutional amendment to facilitate the removal of a president deemed unable to fulfill their duties, prompted by concerns over transparency regarding former President Biden's health. Issa argues that the current 25th Amendment, relying on the Vice President and Cabinet, may be insufficient due to potential bias. The proposed amendment would involve Congress and the Supreme Court in the process of assessing a president's capacity to serve. The House Oversight Committee is scheduled to interview Biden administration officials regarding the former president's cognitive state, with the findings potentially informing the amendment's specifics.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, claim that prosecutors intentionally released his journal entries to prejudice the public and undermine his right to a fair trial. The defense argues that the release of the journal, which included excerpts about Mangione's plans, serves no legitimate objective and aims to bias potential jurors. Mangione's attorneys are seeking to delay or dismiss the state case to prioritize the federal prosecution, which could result in the death penalty. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is currently held in federal custody.</p>

          <p>This article satirically critiques the dress code, or lack thereof, for ICE agents, suggesting that the absence of a uniform makes it difficult for the public to distinguish them from rogue criminals. It sarcastically advises agents to avoid looking like law enforcement officials and instead opt for ambiguous attire that doesn't indicate any official capacity. The piece references Coco Chanel's collaboration with the Nazis to emphasize the importance of removing any identifying markers, such as a badge, to avoid accountability. The article implies that the goal is to instill fear and uncertainty rather than uphold the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court's decision supports civil liberties groups' arguments that the law violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans, including President Trump, have supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. The Louisiana Attorney General intends to appeal the ruling, and legal experts anticipate the case will eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Iran has stated it will consider diplomatic efforts regarding its nuclear program only after Israel ceases its attacks. This comes amid ongoing exchanges of fire between the two countries, with Israel targeting dozens of sites in Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats, who urged a revival of diplomatic efforts with the U.S., but Araghchi insisted that Iran's defense capabilities are non-negotiable. President Trump suggested Iran has a "maximum" of two weeks to avoid possible U.S. air strikes, while also dismissing the talks between Araghchi and European ministers.</p>
