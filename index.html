          <p>Despite heightened tensions with Pakistan, India remains steadfast in its commitment to economic growth, according to India's High Commissioner to Singapore, Shilpak Ambule. While acknowledging operational alertness, Ambule emphasized that the country's growth story and economic focus remain unaffected. He highlighted recent trade deals with the UK and ongoing negotiations with the U.S. and the European Union, underscoring investor confidence in India's structural reforms and strong domestic demand. The comments followed Prime Minister Modi's announcement of a new counter-terrorism policy after military strikes against Pakistan, with Ambule stating that the future of the ceasefire depends on Pakistan's actions. Optimism remains high regarding India's economic trajectory despite geopolitical concerns.</p>

          <p>Following a surprise trade agreement between the U.S. and China, investment banks are revising their China growth outlooks. The agreement involves temporarily halting the majority of tariffs, leading to a reduction from 125% to 10%. UBS raised China's GDP growth forecast for 2025 to between 3.7% and 4%, while Morgan Stanley anticipates faster exports due to lower tariffs. ANZ Bank also sees potential for China's GDP to exceed 4.2% this year. Natixis projects a GDP growth of 4.5% if there are proactive stimulus measures and further tariff reductions.

          <p>China presents a dual image: a technological and manufacturing superpower and an economy grappling with sluggish spending, rising unemployment, and a housing crisis. Despite advancements in AI and electric vehicles, experts believe China's tech progress won't resolve its economic slump, as manufacturing constitutes a small portion of its output. While tech entrepreneurs express optimism, concerns persist regarding unemployment, weak consumption, and reliance on exports. The Chinese government's focus on self-reliance and industrial capacity may exacerbate existing imbalances, necessitating broader investments in social safety nets.</p>

          <p>Following trade talks between the United States and China, tariff rates have been reduced, but the impact on exporters remains complex. The headline changes include a 90-day period where Chinese goods shipped to the US are subject to a minimum of 30% tariffs, and American exports face a minimum of 10% duties. However, these rates do not account for previous tariffs or duties on specific goods. The new effective tariff rate is estimated to be around 50%, including tariffs imposed during Trump's first term and the new duties still in force after the agreement.</p>

Some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams to reduce reliance on card fees and interest.
