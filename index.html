          <p>In China, a growing number of students are prioritizing majors with strong job prospects, such as computer science, over attending more prestigious universities. This trend reflects increasing anxiety about the domestic job market, with a focus on immediate employability and security eclipsing long-term aspirations. The surge in interest for fields like computer science has been further amplified by the rise of artificial intelligence, which is widely expected to generate new career opportunities. Consequently, some students are opting for lower-ranked institutions simply to secure a spot in a high-demand program, signaling a significant shift in educational priorities.</p>

          <p>The new trade agreement between the United States and the European Union leaves several areas of uncertainty and has created notable divisions. While a 15% tariff rate was set for many goods, key details for sectors like pharmaceuticals remained unclear initially, and a 50% tariff on European steel and aluminum will persist. The deal also establishes a tariff disparity on the island of Ireland and has drawn criticism from German industry groups for being too high. Analysts note that President Trump retains the ability to alter the terms, and the agreed-upon tariffs remain significantly higher than historical levels, suggesting a fragile compromise rather than a comprehensive resolution.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the starvation occurring in Gaza is a man-made and deliberate crisis resulting from Israel's prolonged siege, which blocks essential aid from reaching a desperate civilian population. The author highlights the deaths of numerous children from malnutrition, describing it as the latest phase in a brutal campaign that defies simple labels. The piece criticizes world leaders for issuing hollow statements and failing to take decisive action, such as sanctions or embargoes, to compel Israel to allow food and medicine into the territory. It concludes that despite feeling futile, continued public protest is the only remaining avenue to pressure political establishments into meaningful intervention.</p>

Chinese brands are making significant inroads in Southeast Asia and Australia, traditionally strong markets for Japanese manufacturers like Toyota and Honda.

          <p>The new trade framework between the U.S. and the EU is being hailed as a significant political victory for President Donald Trump, though it is not a total defeat for Brussels. The EU accepted a 15% tariff on most of its exports to the U.S., a major climbdown from its goal of zero tariffs but better than the threatened 30%. In return, the EU will reportedly increase purchases of U.S. energy and military equipment by hundreds of billions of dollars. For the EU, the deal removes the immediate threat of a wider trade war, providing a degree of economic stability despite the less-than-ideal terms.</p>

          <p>Chinese swimming prodigy Yu Zidi, aged 12, is capturing international attention at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. She is a contender in the 200m individual medley final and could become the youngest medalist at a major international swimming event in nearly 90 years. Even if she misses the podium in her first final, she has strong prospects in the 200m butterfly and her best event, the 400m medley. Yu's rapid rise over the past year has positioned her among the world's fastest in her disciplines, marking her as a significant new talent to watch in the sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's southern technology hub, have implemented new rules mandating leniency for innovators whose government-funded projects fail. The policy applies to universities, hospitals, and companies, stating that individuals should not be punished or held accountable if their projects stall due to reasonable issues like technical difficulties or market changes, provided there was no misconduct or abuse of power. The rules are designed to encourage researchers to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and take risks without fear of their careers being hindered. The initiative aims to foster a long-term mechanism that supports ambitious innovation even in the face of failure.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 20:45:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's political landscape has been disrupted by the surge of Sanseito, a far-right party that increased its parliamentary seats from one to fifteen in recent elections. Running on a "Japanese First" slogan, the party has capitalized on public frustration with a sluggish economy, inflation, and stagnant wages. The party's rise is also fueled by anti-immigrant and anti-tourist sentiment, with supporters blaming foreigners for social burdens and disorderly conduct. Analysts suggest the movement echoes populist trends seen in the U.S. and elsewhere, challenging the long-standing stability of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party by appealing to voters hungry for change.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House budget director Russell Vought, a key author of Project 2025, stated that President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve is about a desire for lower interest rates, not a direct implementation of the conservative plan's proposals for the central bank. When asked about the Project 2025 chapter on overhauling the Fed, Vought claimed, "I don't even know what that chapter says." He framed the administration's focus on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as a response to his refusal to lower rates and alleged fiscal mismanagement of a building renovation. This comes as the Trump administration intensifies its criticism of Powell's leadership ahead of the Fed's next meeting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sharp division has emerged within the Republican party over a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing federal files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the push, led by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, as "reckless," claiming it lacks adequate protections for victims. Massie fired back, calling the Speaker's concern a "straw man argument" and insisting their bill was carefully crafted to redact victims' names. He warned that blocking a vote could become a political liability for the GOP, potentially costing them their majority in the midterms if they fail to keep their promise on transparency.</p>

          <p>Tyler Boebert, the 20-year-old son of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, has received a misdemeanor citation for child abuse related to an incident with his own young son. The citation for "criminal negligence" reportedly stems from a miscommunication about supervising the child, who briefly got out of the house but was not injured. In a statement, the congresswoman said her son has been doing a great job getting his life on track and that he will take responsibility for his actions. This follows previous legal issues for Tyler Boebert, who last year pleaded guilty to a felony charge of attempted identity theft in a separate case.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department's Pacoima station was temporarily evacuated after a couple brought in a box of military-grade explosives they had found. The couple discovered the ordnance while cleaning out the home of a recently deceased family member and brought them to the station for disposal. The LAPD bomb squad was called in and used a robot to assess the devices before deeming them safe to transport to a secure storage facility for military collection. The incident prompted the evacuation of the station and nearby homes as a precaution, occurring less than two weeks after a separate explosion killed three L.A. County sheriff's detectives.</p>

          <p>European leaders have responded with a mix of cautious optimism and sharp criticism to the new trade deal with the United States, which sets a 15% tariff on most European goods. Leaders from Italy and Ireland welcomed the agreement for bringing stability and avoiding a worse-case scenario of higher tariffs. However, France's European affairs minister called the deal "unbalanced" and unsustainable, while Germany's powerful BDI industry federation labeled it an "inadequate compromise" that sends a "disastrous signal." The varied reactions highlight the internal EU tensions over the compromise, which averts a trade war but imposes higher costs than many had hoped for.</p>

The concert combined a semi-coherent political satire with powerful performances of their classic songs. The show demonstrated how the band's emotional and dramatic music has solidified a powerful identity for its large and dedicated fanbase.</p>
