          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, alleging misrepresentations on mortgage applications for a third property. This action comes as President Trump seeks to remove Cook from her position, a move she is currently challenging in court. The new referral claims Cook misrepresented a condominium as a second home to secure better mortgage terms, while later listing it as an investment property on ethics forms. These allegations add to an ongoing and contentious dispute over Cook's role at the central bank.</p>

          <p>Officials have revealed that the individual who attacked a Minneapolis church school, killing two children and injuring 18 others, was driven by a hateful obsession with killing children. The victims were identified as eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel and ten-year-old Harper Moyski, whose families have shared heartbreaking tributes. The 23-year-old attacker, who had previously attended the school, left behind notes expressing hatred towards various groups but did not appear to have a specific motive beyond a desire for notoriety. The tragic event has been described by the FBI as an act of domestic terrorism motivated by a hate-filled ideology.</p>

          <p>The White House has selected Jim O’Neill, a deputy to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to be the acting director of the CDC. This move follows the contentious firing of Dr. Susan Monarez, who is legally challenging her dismissal, arguing that only the president can remove her. The leadership change has caused significant turmoil within the agency, leading to the resignation of four other senior officials who cited political interference and the spread of misinformation. O'Neill's appointment is seen as a move to align the CDC with Kennedy's agenda, particularly concerning vaccine policy.</p>

Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, and mainland China's CSI 300 also rose slightly. Investors are closely watching for the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit China for the first time in seven years to meet with President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. The meeting occurs against a backdrop of deep-seated suspicion and a significant trade imbalance, exacerbated by deadly border clashes in 2020. Despite these tensions, both nations face economic pressure from U.S. tariffs, potentially pushing them towards cautious cooperation. Experts remain skeptical about a long-term friendship but acknowledge the meeting as a signal of willingness to find common ground on pressing economic and supply chain issues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted on federal charges related to the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The decision was based on concerns of bias after the original presiding judge allegedly made prejudicial comments suggesting gang infiltration within the Memphis Police Department. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith Jr. were previously convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of violating Nichols's civil rights. This ruling adds another complex chapter to the legal proceedings following the high-profile case that sparked nationwide protests over police brutality.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the NHS. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately. Health officials hope this move will protect children from severe complications of the virus, which are rare but can be serious, and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has overruled a board-approved plan to display the Israeli flag on all school campuses, citing heightened safety concerns for students. The school board had narrowly voted in favor of the display as part of a resolution to combat antisemitism. However, the decision was met with controversy, with critics arguing it was an inappropriate political statement for a public school and supporters viewing it as a sign of solidarity. Citing his executive authority to act in the interest of student safety, the superintendent has paused the display of all non-US and state flags.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government did not perform its own cost analysis before proceeding with the largest reorganization of English councils in decades, a BBC investigation has found. The government's claim that merging councils could save £2.9 billion over five years was based on a 2020 report commissioned by the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the reorganization could potentially cost money and deliver no savings, depending on how it is implemented. Critics are questioning the lack of independent government analysis for such a significant and costly public sector reform.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have expressed outrage after a massive Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv killed at least 23 people and damaged the EU's delegation office. The bombardment, one of the largest on the capital this month, destroyed a residential building and also affected the nearby British Council. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that two missiles struck within 50 meters of the diplomatic mission, calling it a grim reminder of Russia's willingness to terrorize Ukraine. The attack was widely seen by Western leaders as a deliberate escalation and a mockery of ongoing peace efforts.</p>

          <p>A new Texas law, set to take effect on September 1, will restrict individuals and companies from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing or renting property. While officials defend the bill as a national security measure, it has been widely condemned by opponents as discriminatory and anti-immigrant, drawing comparisons to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. Although US citizens, green card holders, and some visa-holders are exempt, critics argue the law fosters a hostile environment and could lead to unfair scrutiny of anyone perceived to be Chinese, while also harming the state's economy by deterring foreign investment.</p>

They claim their hands were bound before they were forced into the sea with life jackets and told they had reached Indonesia.

According to officials and parents, as gunfire erupted, these students immediately pushed their younger "buddies"—part of a school mentorship program—under the pews for safety. In some cases, older students shielded the younger ones with their own bodies, with one taking a shotgun blast to his back to protect another child.

Although this specific fish was sterile and unable to reproduce, the presence of even a single grass carp is a serious threat to the native ecosystem. These fish can consume up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, destroying habitats for native fish and birds. This is the third grass carp found in Canadian waters since 2013, and authorities are increasing surveillance to prevent the establishment of a breeding population in the Great Lakes.</p>
