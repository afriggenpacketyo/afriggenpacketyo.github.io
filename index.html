          <p>A devastating shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with 17 others, mostly children, injured during a morning Mass. The 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, died by self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene, using legally purchased weapons. The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, though the motive remains unclear.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming season, but with new restrictions, limiting their use to adults aged 65 and older and individuals aged 5-64 with high-risk underlying conditions. This policy shift, influenced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who replaced the CDC's vaccine advisory committee with skeptical members, could lead to out-of-pocket costs for some Americans as insurers often rely on CDC recommendations for coverage. The American Academy of Pediatrics expressed deep concern over the limited availability for children and young adults.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's order to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has ignited a debate among liberals regarding the defense of democratic institutions versus the independence of the Fed. While many see Trump's actions as an assault on democracy, some progressives argue that the Fed's independence is inherently anti-democratic, as its decisions significantly impact the economy without direct political accountability. This article explores these differing viewpoints, arguing that operational independence, as defined by Congress, can actually serve the public interest by insulating monetary policy from short-term political pressures. It emphasizes that Trump's attempt to subvert established laws is procedurally anti-democratic.</p>

          <p>Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley announced his decision not to play in next month's tournament, prioritizing his leadership role despite his personal desire to compete. The 39-year-old golfer admitted the absence "hurts" but stressed the immense honor and demands of being captain, a role he considers the "ultimate job in golf." Bradley's form had briefly made him consider a player-captain role, but the complexities of managing pairings, strategy, and team dynamics ultimately led him to focus solely on captaincy.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his pledge to protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, vowing to safeguard these programs if congressional Republicans pursue a reconciliation bill for cost-cutting. Trump highlighted the recent "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act," which provides a temporary tax deduction for seniors, as part of his commitment, though critics argue its impact on the program is limited. This article discusses Trump's consistent stance on Social Security, the program's projected trust fund depletion by 2033, and ongoing efforts by the Social Security Administration to modernize its services.

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), including the California Air Resources Board, over potentially discriminatory employment practices. The Department of Justice will examine whether CalEPA's "Racial Equity Framework" and related policies violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by using protected characteristics to "advance racial equity" in hiring and promotion. This move escalates the Trump administration's ongoing clashes with California, which has actively resisted federal efforts to roll back environmental regulations and diversity initiatives.
