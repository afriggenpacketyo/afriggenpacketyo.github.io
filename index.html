          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' estimates, indicating ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite this, industrial output grew by 6.1%, surpassing expectations, while fixed-asset investment saw a slight decrease. The real estate sector continued to struggle, with a significant drop in fixed asset investment. The urban unemployment rate decreased slightly to 5.1%, and the data emerges against the backdrop of trade tensions between China and the U.S., though recent talks have eased some of these fears.

The bill proposes extending tax cuts from Trump's first term and increasing military and border security spending, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Internal conflicts persist over Medicaid work requirements, clean energy subsidies, and raising the cap on state and local tax deductions.</p>

Senator Chuck Schumer questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency may have contributed to the accident, particularly concerning the functionality of the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating an aggressive form of the disease. The cancer has spread to his bones, placing him in the high/very high-risk management group. While a cure may not be the goal, treatment will focus on controlling the disease, slowing progression, and preserving quality of life. Hormone therapy and bone-targeted treatments are likely components of the treatment strategy, given the cancer's hormone sensitivity.</p>

Modern anti-viral drugs can now treat hepatitis C, but undetected cases can cause severe liver damage.
