        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan offers a humorous commentary on his annual gardening cycle, detailing his ambitious plans in May that consistently lead to an overwhelming cucumber surplus by August. He explains how techniques like "succession planting," intended to ensure a steady harvest, instead result in a dramatic overabundance that leaves him desperately trying to give away cucumbers. Through his self-deprecating narrative, Gaffigan touches upon the common experience of amateur gardeners whose enthusiasm often outweighs their practical planning, leading to comical and relatable summertime predicaments. The piece serves as a lighthearted reflection on the misadventures that can arise from a simple hobby.</p>

          <p>Two climate activists from the group Futuro Vegetal were arrested after smearing red and black paint on Barcelona's iconic Sagrada Familia basilica. The demonstration was a protest against the Spanish government's perceived inaction regarding devastating summer forest fires, which the group links to the livestock industry. Citing data from the European Forest Fire Information System, the article notes that recent fires have caused multiple deaths and burned nearly a million acres across Spain in 2025 alone. This act is part of a series of similar protests by the group, which has previously targeted famous artworks and property to draw attention to the climate emergency.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty reflects on his career and the emotional journey of re-recording his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival hits for a new album, "Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)." The article details the legal battles that followed the band's breakup, which left him without control over his own songs for decades, a struggle he compares to Taylor Swift's recent fight for her music rights. Encouraged by his wife Julie, Fogerty collaborated with his sons, who are part of his touring band, to create new versions of classics like "Proud Mary," finally reclaiming ownership of his musical legacy after years of feeling silenced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, a student recounts the personal decision to decline an admission offer from Yale University in favor of attending a small Bible college. The author explains that the choice was driven by a conviction that elite institutions like Yale have shifted from fostering intellectual rigor to promoting ideological conformity, citing instances of disinvited speakers and faculty disputes. The student argues that the Bible college offers a different, more profound challenge focused on character and spiritual formation rather than prestige and networking. This path, while closing doors to elite circles, has opened doors to authentic intellectual freedom and personal growth.</p>

          <p>Ten years after former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened Germany's borders to refugees in 2015, the nation is assessing the long-term impacts of its migration policy. The article highlights both the successes, such as many refugees finding employment, and the persistent challenges, including higher unemployment rates among migrants and rising social tensions that have fueled support for the far-right.

          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta delves into the complex nature of chronic pain, highlighting that its source often lies in the brain rather than the site of an old injury. The article features the story of Ed Mowery, who suffered from a rare and excruciating condition until he participated in a clinical trial for deep brain stimulation. This experimental treatment successfully mapped his brain's pain signals and used targeted electrical impulses to interrupt them before he could consciously feel them. This breakthrough illustrates a new frontier in pain management, suggesting that future treatments could target the brain's neural circuitry to provide relief for millions.</p>

Badenoch argued it is "absurd" for the UK to leave resources untapped while other nations extract them from the same seabed.

The article outlines six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and make them more receptive, such as "I believe you" to defuse shame and "Let's figure this out together" to prevent power struggles. Other phrases like "I'm on your side" and "I've got you, no matter what" shift the dynamic from adversarial to supportive.

The article highlights the case of Richard Chamblee, who died just two days after his home's air conditioning failed during a 115°F heatwave, as his family could not afford immediate repairs. This tragedy underscores a nationwide issue of energy poverty, where millions of households struggle to pay for cooling, often forgoing necessities or facing utility shutoffs. Experts warn that as climate change intensifies heatwaves, these preventable deaths could surge, exacerbated by policies that increase energy costs and reduce social safety nets.</p>

          <p>Tennessee authorities have announced that famed McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the 1973 movie "Walking Tall," killed his wife, Pauline, in 1967 and staged it to look like an ambush by his enemies. The cold case was reopened by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which found major inconsistencies between Pusser's account and the physical evidence. An autopsy of Pauline's exhumed body and a reexamination of crime scene photos suggested she was shot outside the car and that Buford's own wound was likely self-inflicted. Prosecutors stated that if Pusser were alive today, he would face a murder indictment for the crime.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent moves against the Federal Reserve, including his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-held political independence. Experts warn that if Trump successfully gains control over the Fed's board, it could politicize monetary policy, potentially leading to economic instability and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system. Beyond just interest rates, a compliant board would give the president influence over bank regulation, the discount rate, and the integrity of the Treasury system. While some on Wall Street agree the Fed needs reform, critics fear these actions could erode decades of credibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Maxwell Interview Transcripts Raise Questions About Unpursued Leads on Epstein's Powerful Associates</h2>

          <p>The recent release of interview transcripts with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has drawn criticism over the Justice Department's line of questioning, which appeared to avoid pressing for details on Jeffrey Epstein's powerful connections. In the interview, Maxwell hinted that some of Epstein's associates were serving in President Trump's cabinet, but she was not asked to name them. Critics and attorneys for Epstein's survivors argue that the interview was superficial and that victims themselves have been ignored in the broader investigation. This has fueled accusations that the disclosures are more for show than a genuine effort to achieve transparency and accountability.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes President Donald Trump's decision-making process, asserting that many of his actions are based on profound ignorance and a supreme confidence in his own "gut instinct" rather than on expert advice or factual information. The article cites several examples from his second term, including a dangerous and hydrologically impossible plan to solve California's wildfire problem by releasing water from reservoirs 200 miles away. Drawing on comments from former aides like Rex Tillerson, who reportedly called him a "moron," the author argues that Trump's tendency to believe misinformation from friends over his own government agencies poses a significant risk to the country.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, sheds light on the origins of surfing in the mainland United States, crediting three teenage Hawaiian princes with introducing the sport in 1885. The royal brothers, sent to a nearby military school to receive a modern education, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated their native sport of "surfboard swimming" to amazed locals. This historical event, documented in a local newspaper at the time, planted the seed for a culture that would eventually grow into a major coastal phenomenon. The exhibition aims to recognize the crucial role of these Hawaiian royals in the history of American surfing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts in mainland China have expressed concern that potential joint weapons production between the United States and Taiwan could threaten regional stability. The warnings came after senior U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, during a visit to Taipei, stated he expects such cooperation to move forward, a long-sought goal for Taiwan. For decades, the U.S. has sold arms to the self-governing island, but co-production would mark a significant escalation in their defense relationship. While both Washington and Taipei see strategic and industrial benefits, Beijing views it as a provocative move that further challenges its sovereignty claims over Taiwan.</p>

          <p>A trend of states imposing new taxes on the real estate of the wealthy is gaining momentum, sparking a backlash from property owners and brokers. Rhode Island's new levy, dubbed the "Taylor Swift Tax," adds a significant surcharge on second homes valued over $1 million, which could add over $136,000 to the pop star's annual tax bill. Similar measures are being implemented in states like Montana, driven by tight budgets and populist anger over rising housing costs. Critics argue these taxes unfairly penalize seasonal residents who contribute significantly to local economies while using few public services, potentially driving wealth to neighboring states.</p>

          <p>The Australian state of South Australia is banning single-use, fish-shaped soy sauce containers as part of its ongoing effort to reduce plastic pollution. The small, iconic packets, common in sushi takeaways, are made of recyclable plastic but are often too small to be processed by recycling machinery, leading them to end up in the environment for centuries. The ban is the latest step in legislation that has already phased out plastic straws, bags, and stirrers. While consumers can still get soy sauce from larger bottles or sachets, the move aims to protect marine life and cut carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>The price of the U.S. Open's signature cocktail, the Honey Deuce, has risen faster than the general rate of inflation over the last decade. Currently priced at $23, the vodka-based drink has seen its cost increase by 53% since 2015, when it was sold for $15. In comparison, the overall Consumer Price Index has risen by approximately 36% during the same period, meaning the drink would cost around $20.33 if its price had matched inflation. Despite the high cost, the cocktail remains immensely popular, with over 550,000 sold last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue for the event.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Abruzzo, the former general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) fired by President Trump, warns that the administration's actions are systematically hobbling the nation's top labor watchdog. The firing of key officials, including the NLRB chair, has left the agency without a quorum and unable to issue decisions, effectively stalling enforcement of workers' rights. This has emboldened corporations like SpaceX to challenge the NLRB's constitutionality in court. Abruzzo fears these attacks could ultimately lead to the repeal of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, returning worker protections to pre-New Deal levels and leaving working families with little recourse against corporate power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece explores the moral dilemma of feeling personal happiness while being aware of widespread suffering and political turmoil in the world. The author references ancient philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single body, where if one part suffers, all suffer. However, these same traditions also suggest that if one part is honored, all should rejoice. The essay argues against becoming fixated on either despair or forced positivity, advocating instead for embracing the full spectrum of human emotion. Acknowledging both the world's horrors and its joys is presented not as an act of ignorance, but as a form of resistance and self-preservation.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to "fix" the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a move experts warn could destabilize the vaccine market and harm individuals with rare vaccine-related injuries. The VICP was created in the 1980s to shield manufacturers from litigation, ensuring a stable vaccine supply. Critics fear that Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist, may dismantle these protections, potentially causing manufacturers to exit the market and making it harder for those with legitimate injury claims to receive compensation. This action is seen as part of a broader effort to undermine trust in vaccines and mainstream science.</p>

According to new IRS guidance, a taxpayer is eligible for the credit as long as they have a "written binding contract in place" and make a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before September 30. This provides a crucial loophole for buyers who may face delivery delays, allowing them to lock in the credit before it is eliminated by a new tax law.</p>
