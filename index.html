          <p>The 2025 Kentucky Derby features 19 horses vying for the Triple Crown, with Journalism as the morning-line favorite. Trained by Michael McCarthy, Journalism hopes to bring joy to the Altadena community, which was affected by wildfires. Sovereignty and Sandman are other strong contenders. The article also discusses past winners, scratches, and the return of trainer Bob Baffert after a suspension, noting that morning-line odds don't always predict the winner, as seen with Mystik Dan's victory last year. The race promises excitement and showcases the culmination of months of preparation and competition for these talented horses.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a significant victory for the center-left Labor Party after trailing in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The election saw a resounding defeat for conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton, impacted by campaign missteps and associations with Trump's policies. The New York Times article notes that younger voters are increasingly disillusioned with major parties, seeking bolder solutions to national challenges. Despite Albanese's win, it remains uncertain if his party will maintain its parliamentary majority, given the rise of independent and minor-party candidates.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The Encampments," offering an inside look at the student protests at Columbia University against Israel's actions in Gaza, is facing censorship and hostility. The film challenges the dominant narrative by portraying the protests as a disciplined, principled movement for human rights, leading to threats and vandalism at theaters. The distributors highlight a pattern of politically motivated efforts to silence Palestinian voices, citing instances of censorship and violence against filmmakers. Despite these challenges, the film's success at the box office demonstrates a strong public interest in these perspectives.</p>

The US has seen a dramatic rise in measles cases, with the majority concentrated in west Texas and spreading to neighboring states, resulting in fatalities. Experts attribute the outbreak to declining vaccination rates and the spread of misinformation, particularly by figures like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who promotes unproven treatments and undermines confidence in vaccines.
