          <p>The last of ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail in May has been apprehended in Atlanta following a brief standoff. The capture of Derrick Groves, a convicted murderer, was the result of a coordinated effort by multiple law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI. Authorities were led to his location by tips and arrested him in a crawl space he had created inside a home. The capture concludes a massive, months-long manhunt and brings a sense of relief to the community and victims' families.</p>

Protesters pelted the vehicles with rocks during a period of intense national unrest, though the president was unharmed. The incident occurred amid widespread demonstrations led by the national Indigenous federation, CONAIE, against the government's recent decision to cut fuel subsidies as part of an austerity drive.

          <p>Google is implementing stricter rules for its "Work from Anywhere" policy, which was introduced during the pandemic. Under the new guidelines, employees using even a single day of the four-week annual allowance will have a full week deducted from their balance. This change does not affect the company's standard hybrid schedule but is part of a broader trend in the tech industry to increase in-office presence. The move reflects a continued shift away from the flexible work arrangements that became common during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>France's outgoing interim Prime Minister, Sebastien Lecornu, has stated that President Emmanuel Macron could name a new prime minister within the next 48 hours. Lecornu resigned after just 14 hours, citing a lack of consensus among political parties to form a stable government. He indicated that his consultations revealed a majority in parliament opposes a snap election, creating a potential path forward to resolve the country's current political turmoil. The president's controversial pension reform remains a major point of contention in negotiations.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that media figure Bari Weiss, the new editor in chief of CBS News, and her publication The Free Press have maintained a focus on 2020-era culture war issues while giving insufficient attention to the authoritarian threats of the Trump administration. The author suggests this editorial direction represents a failure to adapt to the current political landscape. The piece questions whether this perspective will carry over to her leadership at CBS, especially given the circumstances surrounding her appointment after the Paramount-Skydance merger.</p>

Many advisors point out that equities have historically outperformed gold, as company earnings compound over time. They generally recommend limiting gold exposure to a small percentage of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
