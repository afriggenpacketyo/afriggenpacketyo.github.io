          <p>Fraudsters managed to pilfer £47 million from approximately 100,000 individuals by impersonating taxpayers and targeting the UK's tax authority, HMRC. The tax authority is contacting affected individuals to reassure them that their accounts have been secured, no money has been lost, and no action is required on their part. HMRC clarified that the fraudulent activity targeted the tax authority rather than individual customers. A criminal investigation has been conducted, and arrests were made in the previous year. </p>

          <p>This article explains the IRS's five-year rule for annuities, which affects how non-spouse beneficiaries must take distributions from an inherited annuity when the original owner dies. It generally applies to non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax dollars and requires the entire value of the annuity to be distributed within five years of the original owner's death. Beneficiaries should make elections early and be aware of tax implications, as withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Careful planning is essential to avoid tax headaches and ensure the money is distributed according to financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

A Department of Transportation compliance review cited budget shortfalls, missed deadlines, and misleading ridership projections. The review targets federal grants for construction in the Central Valley, with the funds potentially being pulled within 37 days following the high-speed rail authority’s response. The project's budget is significantly higher than initial estimates, and completion has been delayed indefinitely, leading to the federal government's decision.</p>
