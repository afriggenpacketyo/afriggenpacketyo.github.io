          <p>The British government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to support Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its suppliers following a prolonged production halt caused by a cyberattack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has cost the automaker an estimated £50 million per week and threatened the viability of smaller businesses in its supply chain. This financial support aims to protect thousands of jobs across the UK while JLR works to recover its systems and resume operations. The loan is intended to help JLR manage payments to its 700 suppliers as it navigates the unprecedented industrial disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new memoir by King Charles III’s former butler, Grant Harrold, recounts Prince Philip's well-known reputation for unfiltered and often profane commentary. The book describes an incident at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding where the late Duke of Edinburgh was overheard expressing relief that the ceremony was over. Harrold and other royal experts note that Philip's bluntness was a defining characteristic, often making palace staff nervous but also endearing him to others who appreciated his candid nature. The article compiles several of his most famous and controversial remarks, painting a picture of a royal who consistently spoke his mind.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University have developed the first laboratory system capable of simulating the effects of three nuclear warheads striking a single underground target in rapid succession. This research addresses the challenge of destroying deeply buried and hardened military facilities that can withstand powerful conventional weapons. The simulation technology allows the Chinese military to study the complex impact of sequential, high-yield nuclear detonations without conducting actual tests. This development signifies a notable advancement in China's strategic weapons research and its capabilities for targeting highly protected command centers or missile silos.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is evaluating unprecedented commercial leasing or development opportunities on a portion of Camp Pendleton, the largest undeveloped stretch of Southern California's coastline. This move aligns with the Trump administration's strategy to generate revenue from public lands, raising concerns among local officials and conservationists. For decades, the 125,000-acre base has balanced military training needs with environmental preservation, protecting numerous endangered species. Details about the potential development remain unclear, but any large-scale project could significantly impact the surrounding communities and the region's delicate coastal ecosystem.</p>

          <p>In Mexico, a sweet delicacy known as acitrón, made from the endangered biznaga barrel cactus, continues to be sold illegally due to high cultural demand. The cactus is a key ingredient in traditional dishes like chiles en nogada, especially for Independence Day celebrations, creating a conflict between cherished traditions and conservation. Biologists explain that the biznaga grows extremely slowly, making it impossible to farm commercially and leading to its overexploitation in the wild.

          <p>Authorities in Tamil Nadu, India, have filed a criminal case against senior leaders of the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) party after a stampede at a political rally killed at least 39 people and injured over 50. The tragedy occurred as a massive crowd waited for a speech from the party's founder, popular actor-turned-politician Vijay, who was reportedly hours late. The crush is believed to have started when people in the restless crowd of over 30,000 surged toward the politician's bus. Both Vijay and Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed their condolences as an official investigation into the incident was launched.</p>

Ukrainian officials reported that the attack involved nearly 600 drones and dozens of missiles, making it one of the heaviest assaults in recent months. In the capital, targets included an institute of cardiology, a large bakery, and residential buildings, with a 12-year-old girl among the deceased. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the "vile" attack, vowing retaliation and emphasizing that it demonstrates Moscow's desire to continue the conflict despite international pressure.</p>

          <p>Faced with home prices that have risen 56% since 2020, a growing number of Americans are co-buying homes with friends or relatives to overcome affordability challenges. This trend is particularly prevalent among younger generations and single individuals who lack the financial advantage of a dual-income household. While pooling resources unlocks more housing options, it also introduces legal and financial complexities not typically covered by marital property laws, prompting experts to advise detailed written agreements. The motivation extends beyond finances, as many co-buyers also seek the companionship and community that shared living arrangements can provide.</p>

          <p>Despite some bipartisan support for a permanent solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Congressional Republicans are deferring to President Trump to initiate negotiations. As the administration expands its mass deportation efforts, concerns are growing for the nearly half a million DACA recipients, some of whom have already been detained. While individual Republicans like Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar have introduced bills offering a pathway to legal status, the broader party sentiment is to wait for a clear directive from the White House. This political stalemate leaves the future of DACA recipients uncertain as the administration prioritizes border enforcement over legislative reform.</p>

Ahead of the vote, two pro-Russian parties were disqualified over claims of illegal foreign financing, further intensifying the political climate.

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system, after a similar proposal was rejected in 2021 over data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses previous criticisms by ensuring the system is optional, managed entirely by public entities, and stores data on users' smartphones rather than a central server. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes online, from signing contracts to age verification. However, opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements and data misuse, forcing another public vote on an issue that balances modern convenience with Switzerland's strong tradition of citizen privacy.</p>

This rule is a contingency for when a player must withdraw from the final day's singles matches due to illness or injury. At the start of the day, each team captain secretly selects one player and places their name in a sealed envelope. If an opponent withdraws, the player in the envelope is also withdrawn, and the match is declared a tie, with each team receiving half a point, ensuring the competition's balance is maintained.</p>

Since a brief war in 1992 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this unrecognized republic has hosted approximately 1,500 Russian troops and a massive Soviet-era arms depot. The region, controlled by a pro-Russian separatist regime, exerts significant influence over Moldovan politics and has been a base for Russian intelligence operations and economic pressure. As Moldova navigates its high-stakes election, the unresolved status of Transnistria remains a key source of instability and a tool for Moscow's regional leverage.</p>

While their methods differ—Trump using economic and cultural pressure and Putin employing military threats and hybrid warfare—their combined actions create a pincer movement.

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The plan involves creating development corporations with special powers to acquire land and grant planning permission, modeling the regeneration of Stratford for the 2012 Olympics. The initiative aims to address the national housing crisis, with a requirement that at least 40% of the new homes be classified as affordable.</p>

          <p>Russell M. Nelson, the 17th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has passed away at the age of 101. Before becoming the church's oldest-ever president in 2018, Nelson was an internationally renowned heart surgeon who pioneered the development of the heart-lung machine. During his presidency, he emphasized the full name of the church to center on Jesus Christ and oversaw a historic expansion, announcing the construction of over 100 new temples worldwide. His passing marks the end of a significant era for the church, defined by both his extensive leadership and his distinguished prior career in medicine.</p>

          <p>A new report warns that businesses are accumulating "AI debt"—the future costs of poorly implementing artificial intelligence systems—as they rush to adopt the technology without proper strategy or infrastructure. This debt can manifest as security risks, low-quality data, wasted resources on ineffective AI agents, and a workforce struggling with digital burnout. Research shows that poorly generated AI content, or "workslop," is already creating extra work for employees. Experts advise companies to move beyond a reactive approach and instead focus on thoughtful piloting, employee training, and developing clear use cases to avoid the significant financial and productivity costs of a flawed AI rollout.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could inadvertently benefit the Middle East, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, in the global competition for tech talent. As Gulf nations invest billions to become AI hubs, they are offering attractive compensation packages, a tax-friendly environment, and long-term "golden visas" to skilled professionals. Analysts suggest that these incentives, combined with the U.S. potentially becoming less accessible, could position the region to attract top experts from Silicon Valley and elsewhere. This shift highlights how national immigration policies are increasingly shaping the global distribution of specialized labor. (not investment advice)</p>

The storm is expected to skim the island before making landfall in Vietnam later on Sunday. Coastal areas across southern China are on high alert for intense winds and torrential downpours as the region braces for its second major storm in close succession.</p>

          <p>The "snapback" of UN sanctions on Iran is intensifying economic pressures on its citizens, who are already facing record inflation and soaring food prices. The sanctions freeze Iranian assets abroad and restrict its arms and missile programs, further crippling an economy where staples like meat and rice are becoming unaffordable for many. This economic distress is compounded by public anxiety over potential new military conflicts with Israel and the United States. Within the country, residents express a sense of hopelessness as their financial stability deteriorates, and activists fear a concurrent rise in domestic repression.</p>

          <p>Despite assembling a physically imposing squad and hiring a specialist set-piece coach, Newcastle United has struggled to convert dead-ball opportunities into goals this season. The team, featuring several players over 6-foot-6, has a low goal tally from corners and free-kicks compared to top rivals like Arsenal, who excel in this area. Manager Eddie Howe has acknowledged the issue, stating that "something is not quite clicking" and taking responsibility for improving performance. The article analyzes the team's tactical shifts, including an increased use of long throws, as they seek to capitalize on their height advantage and make set-pieces a more reliable source of goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent deal framework for TikTok's U.S. operations, brokered by the Trump administration, may represent a strategic victory for China rather than a resolution for American security concerns. While the agreement places American data under U.S. control and increases American ownership, it leaves TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, as the single largest shareholder. The author contends that this structure fails to fully sever Chinese influence over the platform's algorithms and operations. What appears to be a win for the U.S. could ultimately allow Beijing to maintain significant leverage over a highly influential media platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques recent controversial claims about autism from the Trump administration, reframing autistic traits as valuable qualities that stand in stark contrast to the current political landscape. The author highlights characteristics often associated with autism, such as intense focus, adherence to facts, a strong sense of social justice, and an honest expression of joy, as strengths. The article suggests that these traits, often misunderstood, offer valuable lessons in a world dominated by political disinformation and a lack of empathy. It serves as a rebuttal to the negative framing of autism, celebrating the unique perspectives and integrity found within the autistic community.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are finalizing their roster for the upcoming wild-card series, with key questions surrounding the health of players like Max Muncy and Will Smith. Beyond injuries, the most significant decisions involve the pitching staff, particularly the composition of the bullpen. The team must balance its abundance of left-handed relievers with a need for more right-handed options, potentially using starter Tyler Glasnow in a relief role. The order of the starting rotation, including whether to start Shohei Ohtani in Game 1, also remains a strategic decision the team is keeping private ahead of the postseason.</p>
