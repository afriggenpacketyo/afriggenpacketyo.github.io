          <p>The United States and Taiwan are discussing a potential spaceport collaboration that could revolutionize long-distance travel. The American Institute in Taiwan announced that the partnership would focus on suborbital flights, an emerging technology where a vehicle briefly enters space before landing. This innovation could slash the travel time between Houston, Texas, and Taipei, Taiwan, from approximately 14.5 hours to as little as 2.5 hours. While still in the experimental phase, these flights are being explored for tourism and high-speed cargo, with China and Russia also developing similar commercial services.</p>

          <p>Howard Phillips, a 65-year-old British man from Essex, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for what he believed were Russian intelligence agents. He offered to provide personal information about former UK defense secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he thought were Russian operatives named Sasha and Dima. In reality, the two were undercover British intelligence officers. Phillips, who was described by his ex-wife as being infatuated with espionage and dreaming of being like James Bond, was convicted under the National Security Act.</p>

          <p>A man has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 28 years for the murder of his estranged wife in Bradford, UK. Habibur Masum, 27, fatally stabbed 27-year-old Kulsuma Akter as she was pushing their infant son in a pram in April of last year. The court heard that Masum had stalked Akter, who was living in a refuge, and attacked her in public, inflicting 26 stab wounds. The judge described the attack as vicious and merciless, noting Masum's intention was to kill.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, with adjusted earnings of $2.53 per share on $47.12 billion in revenue. Despite the positive results, the company affirmed its full-year guidance, which includes a potential $4 billion to $5 billion negative impact from President Trump's auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to mitigate its tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives, aiming to offset at least 30% of the expected cost increases. The company does not anticipate specific price increases related to the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Public health officials are warning that potential funding cuts of up to $140 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) overdose prevention program could undermine recent progress. The Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) agreement, which funds critical surveillance and intervention strategies, faces uncertainty as the Trump administration has reportedly withheld funds. This move could force health departments to scale back vital services like drug supply tracking and telehealth treatment, which officials credit with contributing to the first decline in US overdose deaths in 2023. Critics call the potential cuts a significant step backward in addressing the opioid crisis.</p>

The margin narrowed to just over 175 billion yuan, the closest in years, challenging Guangdong's long-held position as the country's economic leader. Analysts attribute Jiangsu's resilience to its diversified industrial structure, lower dependence on real estate, and reduced reliance on exports compared to Guangdong.

Instead of using federal power to protect rights, as was done during the Civil Rights era, the administration is accused of misusing it to impose its own agenda, effectively transforming states from "laboratories of democracy" into instruments of repression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare display of unity, supporters of rival Los Angeles soccer teams LAFC and the Galaxy set aside their intense rivalry to protest recent federal immigration raids. Before a match, LAFC fans unveiled a large banner reading "Los Angeles Unidos Jamás Será Vencido" ("Los Angeles, united, will never be defeated"), showing solidarity with communities affected by the raids. The gesture comes as LAFC is one of the few professional sports teams to have issued a statement supporting its community, while the Galaxy's silence has led to boycotts from some of its own fans, highlighting a divide in how sports organizations are responding.</p>

          <p>Despite the availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that is 99% effective at preventing HIV through sexual contact, its uptake in the U.S. remains low. According to the CDC, only about one-third of the 1.2 million Americans who could benefit from PrEP are using it, with many unaware it is an option for them. Significant disparities exist, with Black and Hispanic individuals, as well as women, having much lower coverage rates than White individuals. Barriers to access include a lack of awareness, high costs averaging over $5,000 a year, and potential challenges to insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, an unarmed 52-year-old man in Irondale, Alabama, has been officially ruled a homicide by the county coroner. The autopsy report states Reeder died of heart failure associated with cocaine use and restraint during an altercation with police last August. Family lawyers, who have viewed unreleased body camera footage, allege an officer knelt on Reeder's neck for over three minutes while he said he couldn't breathe, drawing comparisons to the death of George Floyd. The city of Irondale disputes this characterization, stating no knee was placed on his neck and no excessive force was used.</p>

          <p>This article details the intense, behind-the-scenes effort by House Republican leadership to pass President Trump's signature legislative megabill. The process exposed deep internal divisions within the GOP, requiring leaders to overcome holdouts from fiscal conservatives and hard-liners through marathon sessions and direct negotiations with the White House. The passage ultimately relied on a charm offensive from President Trump and backroom deals struck with members of the House Freedom Caucus, who secured promises for executive actions on their priorities. The contentious fight highlights the challenging dynamics within the Republican party and the strategies used to achieve legislative wins.</p>

          <p>The European Union is reportedly considering the use of its "Anti-Coercion Instrument" (ACI), a powerful trade tool, as a potential response to the looming threat of a 30% tariff on EU imports by the Trump administration. This so-called "trade bazooka," created in 2023 but never used, allows the EU to impose a range of restrictive measures beyond counter-tariffs, including limiting access to public contracts and restricting imports, services, and foreign investment. While seen as a last resort, the ACI provides the EU with significant leverage in trade disputes, aiming to deter what it perceives as economic coercion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a major political influencer in Washington, with some analysts suggesting his clout now eclipses that of Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. Huang's influence is tied to the critical role of Nvidia's AI chips in the global technology race, giving him a strong position to navigate the political landscape. This was recently demonstrated when Nvidia announced it expects to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, a move Huang had openly lobbied for and which aligns with arguments made by key White House advisors about maintaining U.S. tech leadership.</p>

          <p>This opinion article presents research arguing that Democrats can win back a significant portion of working-class Donald Trump voters by adopting a "social populism" strategy. The analysis indicates that while these voters are more socially moderate or conservative than the Democratic base, they are also "economic egalitarians" who support pro-worker policies like raising the minimum wage and protecting jobs. The research identifies that approximately 11% of working-class Trump voters hold these socially moderate and economically progressive views, representing a crucial, winnable segment of the electorate that could sway future elections if targeted with the right message.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on the peculiar and enduring nature of sibling relationships, where childhood perceptions often override adult realities. While sorting through her late mother's house, she observes how she and her siblings continue to view each other through the lens of their youth, despite clear evidence of their adult skills and professions. For instance, she struggles to see her sister as a competent gardener or her brother as a skilled decorator, just as they seem to doubt her own capabilities. The piece humorously explores how these ingrained family dynamics and perceptions are remarkably resistant to change over time.</p>
