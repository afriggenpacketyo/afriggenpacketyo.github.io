          <p>Reports indicate that dozens of Palestinians were killed and nearly 200 wounded while attempting to collect aid in the Gaza Strip. Witnesses claim Israeli forces opened fire on crowds near an aid distribution site, while the Israeli Defense Forces stated they are unaware of injuries caused by their fire and are reviewing the matter. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which runs the site, denies reports of chaos and gunfire, stating they delivered aid without incident. U.N. agencies and aid groups have refused to work with the foundation, citing violations of humanitarian principles, as they say it allows Israel to control aid distribution. Optimism about the situation remains low amid conflicting accounts and ongoing conflict. </p>

          <p>Two individuals died and hundreds were arrested across France following celebrations of Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League victory. A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Dax, and a 23-year-old man was killed in Paris after being hit by a vehicle. Wild celebrations involved flares, fireworks, smashed bus shelters, and torched cars, leading to clashes with police. While the majority of fans celebrated peacefully, approximately 5,400 police were deployed across Paris to manage the raucous celebrations and maintain order, as the events followed PSG's 5-0 victory over Inter Milan. The events are a mixture of joy and tragedy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has withdrawn the nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, an associate of Elon Musk, to lead NASA, citing a "thorough review" of Isaacman's "prior associations." The White House did not immediately provide an explanation for the decision. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of Shift4, a credit card processing company, has been a close collaborator with Musk, purchasing spaceflights from SpaceX and conducting the first private spacewalk. Musk expressed disappointment, praising Isaacman's competence and character, and Trump is expected to announce a new nominee soon. </p>

          <p>Brave Lupus Tokyo, led by former All Black star Richie Mo'unga, secured their second consecutive Japan Rugby League One title with a narrow 18-13 victory over the Kubota Spears.

Despite a late surge from the Spears, Brave Lupus maintained their lead, soaking up defensive pressure in the closing minutes.

The lack of bilateral talks between China and other countries, including the U.S., disappointed many who sought discussions on Beijing's military capabilities.

          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke with the head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency after a report indicated Iran is increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Araghchi emphasized Iran's "continuous cooperation" with the International Atomic Energy Agency, asserting that all nuclear activities are within the framework of agreements and under IAEA monitoring. The IAEA report raised concerns that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material. Iran's deputy foreign minister rejected many of the report's findings, emphasizing that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons. </p>

          <p>Top tennis players are voicing concerns about the increasingly unsustainable physical demands of the tennis calendar. Australian world number nine Alex de Minaur cited burnout after an early French Open exit, while Britain's Jack Draper raised concerns about the "mental" schedule for top players. Five-time major champion Iga Swiatek also finds the current demands "pretty exhausting," as players' careers may get shorter due to mental strain. The ATP Tour acknowledges these concerns, and the WTA Tour emphasizes the health and wellbeing of players as a priority. </p>
