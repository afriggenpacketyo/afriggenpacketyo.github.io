          <p>An attack on a migrant facility in northern Yemen, controlled by the Houthi militia, resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, primarily African migrants. The Houthis attributed the attack to an American strike, claiming at least 68 fatalities. A U.S. Defense Department official stated that Central Command is aware of the claims of civilian casualties and is conducting a damage assessment and inquiry into the incident, which occurred after the U.S. military reported conducting over 800 strikes in Yemen since mid-March targeting Houthi command-and-control facilities and weapons sites. The situation underscores the complex and volatile nature of the conflict in Yemen and the potential for civilian harm.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has been marked by significant policy shifts and widespread division in the United States. Key issues include foreign policy, immigration, and the economy, with Trump taking a unilateral approach on many fronts.

Immigration policies have become more restrictive, and while some economic indicators are positive, concerns remain about the impact of tariffs and government stability.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly targeting unaccompanied immigrant children for deportation or criminal prosecution, raising concerns about "backdoor family separation." ICE is conducting "welfare checks" on these children, ostensibly to ensure their safety, but also gathering intelligence to assess their risk and deportability. Legal services for unaccompanied minors have been cut, and data sharing between agencies has increased. Advocates fear that ICE is criminalizing children and their sponsors, leading to trauma and fear within immigrant communities, as the Trump administration continues its hardline immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Salah's selfie celebration after scoring a goal for Liverpool has become an iconic moment, but it has also sparked debate over whether it was a genuine celebration or a marketing ploy. Salah borrowed a phone from a staff member to take the photo with cheering fans, leading to questions about whether it was an advertisement for Google Pixel, an official partner of the club. While some observers believe it was a natural celebration, others speculate that it was a planned marketing move, given Salah's history of posting selfies and Google's sponsorship of Liverpool.</p>

          <p>A disability-rights case at the Supreme Court grew heated, involving accusations of lying and concerns about a potential “five-alarm fire” for the disability-rights community. The case involves a teenage girl with epilepsy whose family argues that some courts have made it too difficult to sue public schools for failing to provide adequate accommodations. The justices appeared skeptical of the school district's argument that disability-rights claims should be held to a higher legal standard. A decision in the case is expected by the end of June, though a sweeping ruling appears unlikely.</p>
