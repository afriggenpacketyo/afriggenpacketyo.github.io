          <p>France and Indonesia have jointly called for "mutual recognition" between Israel and Palestine, emphasizing the need for a political solution to achieve lasting peace. French President Macron, during a visit to Jakarta, highlighted the absence of double standards in France's Middle East policy and announced plans for a conference on Gaza in New York, co-organized with Saudi Arabia. The conference aims to revitalize efforts toward recognizing a Palestinian state and affirming Israel's right to exist peacefully and securely. Both Macron and Indonesian President Subianto condemned Israeli actions to control Gaza and displace the Palestinian population.</p>

Jay Hurst, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, announced that the "five bullet exercise" is no longer mandatory. Employees are now encouraged to contribute ideas for improving efficiency and eliminating waste within the department. This decision aligns with similar actions taken by other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, marking a shift away from the Musk-led DOGE's initial efforts to streamline the federal government.</p>

          <p>The German government is considering suspending family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status, primarily affecting Syrian families. This controversial move aims to address concerns about the country's capacity to integrate the large influx of refugees. The proposal has sparked debate, with critics arguing that separation from family can cause psychological strain and hinder integration. The German Cabinet approved the restrictions on family reunification, and the draft bill must still be passed in the Bundestag to come into effect.</p>

The company was also fined for making undeserved shareholder payouts that did not reflect its performance. Ofwat has confirmed that the fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not by customers, as Thames Water continues to grapple with financial challenges and a £20 billion debt.</p>

          <p>In Gila County, Arizona, a region that heavily supported President Trump, many residents rely on Medicaid, leading to conflicted views about proposed cuts to the program. Despite conservative leanings and concerns about government waste, many value the healthcare safety net, especially in a rural area with limited resources. Residents like Heather Heisler, whose husband relies on Medicaid after a ranching accident, highlight the program's importance for accessing medical care. The debate over Medicaid cuts resonates deeply in communities where government health insurance has become increasingly vital.</p>

          <p>The word "pride" has evolved from a negative connotation of "inordinate self-esteem" to a symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment. The shift began in the LGBTQ+ community before the Stonewall Uprising, influenced by the civil rights movement's "Black pride" and "Black power." Organizer L. Craig Schoonmaker advocated for "pride" as a unifying slogan for the first march commemorating Stonewall, emphasizing self-esteem over power. While the LGBTQ+ community has made significant strides, recent pushback and anti-LGBTQ+ bills highlight the continued importance of the word's empowering message.</p>

          <p>Thousands of energy customers will receive compensation, potentially up to £1,000, and may have debts written off due to the scandal involving the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies are disbursing over £70 million in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem. The review found that suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent, often after they fell behind on bills. Ofgem has established stricter conditions for companies seeking to install prepayment meters without customer consent to prevent future abuses.</p>
