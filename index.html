          <p>Weleda, a natural cosmetics company, has initiated an inquiry into allegations that an anti-freeze cream it produced was tested on prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp during World War II. A new report by historian Anne Sudrow suggests links between Weleda and the SS, including claims of experiments on up to 300 prisoners. While a 2023 company report found no evidence of direct testing, Weleda acknowledges the new findings may not have been fully explored and condemns Nazi atrocities. The company has granted historians full access to its archives, with results expected in early 2027, demonstrating a commitment to transparently researching its history.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he was "not thrilled" and "very unhappy" after Israel's military targeted senior Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar. This operation, dubbed "Summit of Fire," aimed at those responsible for the October 7 massacre and ongoing war. The incident put the Trump administration in a delicate position, as both Israel and Qatar are key U.S. allies, with Qatar also mediating ceasefire talks. Trump emphasized his focus on securing the release of remaining hostages, while the U.S. confirmed it was notified but did not coordinate the strikes. The Qatari government condemned the action as a "cowardly" violation of international law.</p>

          <p>Archer, a 6.5-year-old police K-9 trained in narcotics detection, died last week in Hawaii after being left unattended in a hot patrol car. The Hawaii Police Department's interim chief called the incident a "preventable tragedy," initiating criminal and administrative investigations. The K-9 handler is reportedly devastated by the loss of his partner. This incident highlights the dangers of leaving dogs in hot vehicles, a leading cause of death for working K-9s, despite the availability of heat alarm systems that can sometimes malfunction.</p>

          <p>Many Americans face student loan burdens, prompting some homeowners to consider using home equity to pay them off. This strategy can simplify repayment and potentially lower interest rates, especially for high-interest private loans. However, experts warn of significant risks, as home equity loans are secured by the home, risking foreclosure upon default. Borrowers also lose federal loan benefits like forgiveness programs or deferral options. Additionally, closing costs and variable interest rates on HELOCs must be considered before pursuing this financial decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on President Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran, a top White House economic advisor, to the Federal Reserve Board. This vote follows a federal judge's temporary injunction blocking Trump from removing current Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Miran, tapped to replace the recently resigned Adriana Kugler, would serve until January 31, the end of Kugler's term. Democrats have expressed concerns over his plan to take an unpaid leave from the Council of Economic Advisors rather than resigning, as the Fed board prepares for a potential interest rate cut.

The propaganda also targets Moscow, signaling fearless comrades, and frames the conflict as a defense against perceived enemies like the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, masking the reality of dying for Moscow's interests.</p>

Despite potential territorial gains, Russia faces a permanently hostile, Western-armed neighbor, a gutted military, and increased isolation from Europe. The analysis highlights Russia's diminishing influence in regions like Africa, the Middle East, and the South Caucasus, where it once held sway. Furthermore, Russia's wartime economy is described as stagnant and increasingly dependent on China, suggesting the conflict has relegated it to a junior partner rather than restoring its superpower status.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies held urgent consultations under Article 4 of the alliance's founding treaty after multiple Russian drones entered Polish airspace and were shot down by Polish and Dutch fighter jets. Article 4 allows any member to call for urgent talks when its territorial integrity, political independence, or security is threatened. This marks the eighth time Article 4 has been invoked since 1949 and the third time in response to Russia's actions concerning Ukraine. Analysts emphasize that invoking Article 4 promotes coordination and understanding but does not automatically trigger Article 5, NATO's collective security guarantee.</p>

          <p>Global financial investors are cautiously entering Hong Kong's market, aiming to avoid undue attention due to rising geopolitical tensions, according to Clara Chan, CEO of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC). The HKIC, a government-owned fund, is facilitating this "low profile" capital flow, helping to "protect" investees from geopolitical risks. Chan noted a "great velocity" of capital, with many long-term investors believing they should not miss opportunities in Hong Kong or via Hong Kong into mainland China. This indicates a strategic, albeit discreet, confidence in the region's financial prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland's military declared an "unprecedented violation" after shooting down multiple Russian drones that entered its airspace during a widespread attack on western Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed constant communication with NATO, whose air defenses also engaged the drones. Ukrainian officials, including President Zelenskyy, warned that Russia is "testing the West" and escalating its war, calling for strengthened air defense and sanctions. This incident, the first time Poland engaged assets in its airspace since Russia's invasion, prompted calls for further pressure on Moscow from European leaders, with some Polish airports temporarily closing.</p>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by autumn 2026, creating the UK's first "super-university," to be named London and South East University Group. This move, welcomed by England's higher education regulator, aims to provide a strong financial foundation amid economic challenges, as many universities face deficits. While officials insist it's not a takeover, the University and College Union predicts "almost certainly" redundancies, raising concerns about staff stability. The new institution will serve nearly 50,000 students across existing campuses, with degrees still awarded under individual university names.</p>

          <p>A global education crisis has left over 270 million children worldwide out of school, an increase of 21 million from the previous year, exacerbated by war, violence, and cuts to international aid. Countries like Sudan, Gaza, Afghanistan, and Ukraine are severely affected, with schools damaged or inaccessible. For children in crisis zones, school provides crucial stability, meals, and support, leading many parents and teachers to create makeshift classrooms. Despite past progress in reducing out-of-school numbers, the current trajectory suggests worsening conditions, with significant economic and human costs if global education investment declines further.</p>

With countries like the US establishing a Space Force and Russia viewing foreign commercial satellites as legitimate targets, the potential for miscalculation is high.

          <p>Total mortgage application volume jumped 9.2% last week, reaching its highest level in three years, driven by a sharp decline in mortgage interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 6.49% from 6.64%, spurring both purchase and refinance applications. This downward rate movement, the lowest since October 2024, indicates a weakening labor market. The increase in demand suggests that lower rates are encouraging homebuyers and current homeowners to engage in the market, with adjustable-rate mortgages also seeing a pickup.
