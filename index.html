          <p>A 25-year-old man, Guy Edward Bartkus, is suspected of bombing a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. The FBI believes Bartkus, who had nihilistic views and was against bringing people into the world against their will, died in the explosion. The bombing, which officials are calling an act of terrorism, injured four others and caused significant damage to the surrounding area. The article states that all embryos stored at the clinic were saved, and investigators are currently working to determine the suspect's motive and whether he attempted to livestream the attack.</p>

          <p>The father of Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, says his son changed after moving to Twentynine Palms and that he hadn't spoken to him in over a decade. Richard Bartkus says his son was once helpful and fascinated with how things worked, even making harmless smoke bombs as a child. The FBI is investigating Bartkus' online posts, which suggest anti-natalist beliefs, and is asking the public for help in identifying his movements before the explosion.

The CuauhtÃ©moc's masts struck the bridge as the vessel departed the South Street Seaport, with officials citing a loss of power as the cause. Senator Schumer questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may have played a role, specifically regarding the functionality of the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service (VTS). The U.S. Coast Guard stated that the VTS was fully functional during the incident, and the Brooklyn Bridge was not structurally damaged.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is facing mounting criticism for accepting a $400 million luxury plane from Qatar, with both Democrats and some Republicans expressing concern. Leading Democrat Chris Murphy called the gift the 'definition of corruption,' while some of Trump's allies have labeled it a 'stain on the administration.' Trump defended the gift, claiming it was for the U.S. and not for him personally, but Murphy refuted this assertion. The article also mentions lawyers challenging the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding for civil servants.</p>
