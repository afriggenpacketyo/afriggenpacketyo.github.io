          <p>Utah officials have arrested and identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an outdoor university event. The arrest was facilitated by the suspect's family, who contacted law enforcement after he allegedly confessed to them. During a press conference, authorities revealed that politically charged messages, such as "Hey fascist! CATCH!," were found inscribed on bullet cartridges recovered from the scene. The investigation continues as the nation grapples with the politically motivated killing of a prominent public figure.</p>

          <p>At least 193 people were killed in two separate boat accidents this week in the Equateur province of northwestern Congo. In one incident, a boat carrying nearly 500 passengers caught fire and capsized, while in the other, a motorized boat capsized, killing mostly students. Authorities cite improper loading and night navigation as likely causes for these tragedies. Such events are increasingly common in the region, where many people rely on overloaded and poorly maintained wooden vessels for transportation due to the lack of viable road infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's lawyers have refuted claims made by actor Justin Baldoni's legal team that she had agreed to be deposed in his ongoing legal dispute with co-star Blake Lively. Baldoni's team sought to include Swift's testimony, which Lively's attorneys argue is an attempt to create a media spectacle. While Swift's lawyer stated she would comply if forced by the court, they maintain she has no material role in the case, which revolves around on-set sexual harassment allegations made by Lively against Baldoni.</p>

          <p>Phil Salt achieved the fastest T20 century in England's history, scoring an unbeaten 141 runs to lead the team to a record-breaking total of 304-2 against South Africa. The dominant performance, supported by Jos Buttler's quick 83 runs, resulted in a 146-run victory that leveled the series. England's bowlers, led by Jofra Archer who took three wickets, successfully contained the South African chase to ensure a comprehensive win. The victory sets up a highly anticipated series decider at Trent Bridge on Sunday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Memphis officials have announced that the city's crime rate is at a 25-year low, a claim met with scrutiny due to differing data methodologies. The city counts crime by incident, whereas the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) and FBI count by victim, which is the standard practice for national comparison. This discrepancy means that while the city's numbers are technically accurate by its own metric, they are not comparable to historical state data and may not fully reflect the number of people affected by crime in a given year.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on data software company Palantir, stating he is "inspired" by its high market valuation while also taking a jab at its pricing. Benioff noted that Palantir's software is the "most expensive" he has ever seen and suggested Salesforce offers a competitive product at a much lower cost. This public rivalry highlights the competition between the two tech firms, particularly for government contracts, as Palantir's market capitalization has grown significantly while Salesforce's stock has declined this year.</p>

          <p>The White House is continuing its search for the next Federal Reserve chair, with BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, Rick Rieder, emerging as a prominent candidate. Rieder recently interviewed with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the selection process for Jerome Powell's successor.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, claiming the ride-sharing giant systematically violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The lawsuit alleges that Uber drivers routinely refuse to serve passengers with service animals or stowable mobility devices, and sometimes charge improper fees. The DOJ seeks to force Uber to modify its policies, properly train its drivers, and pay damages to affected riders, stating that people with disabilities have been left stranded and missed important appointments due to the company's failures.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican-led legislature has approved a new congressional map that gerrymanders districts to favor the GOP and potentially eliminate one of the state's two Democratic-held seats. The plan, which now goes to the Republican governor, targets the district of longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by splitting up his Kansas City-area constituency. This mid-decade redistricting effort is part of a national strategy backed by Donald Trump to reshape districts and protect the narrow Republican majority in the House ahead of midterm elections.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars. The decision comes after significant pressure from European automakers, who cite challenges such as high costs, lack of charging infrastructure, and stiff competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Carmakers are calling for a relaxation of the 2035 target to allow for other low-emission technologies, arguing the current goal is "no longer feasible" under present conditions.</p>

          <p>Russia and its ally Belarus have commenced their quadrennial joint military exercise, known as "Zapad 2025," at a time of escalating regional tensions. The drills, which simulate responses to enemy attacks, are taking place in Belarus near the borders of NATO members Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania. The exercises are causing significant concern among neighboring countries, especially after a recent Russian drone incursion into Poland, prompting Poland to close its border and launch its own military drills in response to the perceived threat.</p>

Karki, who is widely seen as having a clean image, will lead a caretaker government tasked with restoring order and organizing general elections for next year, as the nation grapples with the aftermath of its worst unrest in decades.</p>

          <p>With a record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds, investors are watching to see if anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts will push this "wall of cash" into riskier assets like stocks and bonds. While some analysts believe lower yields on cash will prompt a significant outflow into the market, others are skeptical, arguing that the vast majority of these funds are held by institutions for liquidity and will not move. Historically, money fund assets have only declined during periods of extreme economic stress when interest rates were near zero. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are advised to remember several key factors to capitalize on the opportunity. The article suggests that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates before formal Federal Reserve action, and that the best rates are reserved for applicants with high credit scores. It also reinforces the conventional wisdom to "marry the home, date the rate," encouraging buyers not to lose their dream house while waiting for rates to drop further, as refinancing is always a future option.
