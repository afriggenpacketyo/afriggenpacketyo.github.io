            <p>As the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord is commemorated, the question of who fired the first shot of the American Revolution remains unanswered. Despite claims, there's no definitive evidence pointing to either the American militia or the British as the clear instigator. The colonial side successfully shaped the narrative early on, rallying support for the rebellion, while historians continue to debate the events. The White House proclamation labels the events at Lexington a "British ambush," though uncertainty still shrouds the incident.</p>

            <p>The felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, London, has sparked widespread anger and debate. The tree, located in Whitewebbs Park, was cut down by the owners of a Toby Carvery restaurant, who claimed it posed a health and safety risk, though locals dispute this assessment. The incident has ignited concerns about the park's future, particularly in light of a recent lease granted to Tottenham Hotspur for a training ground.

            <p>Former Los Angeles Councilmember Kevin de León is facing an $18,750 ethics fine for voting on city council decisions in which he had a financial interest and for failing to disclose income. De León admitted to voting on issues benefiting the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and USC shortly after receiving income from them, without proper disclosure. The ethics commission noted a pattern of conduct, while De León's spokesperson claims the matters involved provided homeless housing and health services during a pandemic. The case highlights potential conflicts of interest and raises questions about transparency in local government.</p>

            <p>The Tren de Aragua, a notorious Venezuelan gang, emerged from the Tocorón prison, where it controlled life within the walls. From there, the gang expanded its operations, engaging in extortion, kidnapping, and drug trafficking, eventually spreading to other countries. The gang's activities have drawn the attention of U.S. authorities, with President Trump invoking a wartime law to deport alleged members. While the gang's influence in Venezuela has waned, its presence in other countries remains a concern.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU argued that the men were being deported without due process. The White House has defended the use of the law, which was previously invoked only three times. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president power to detain and deport natives or citizens of "enemy" nations without usual processes. The lawsuit also said the men had not been told they had a right to contest the decision in court.</p>
