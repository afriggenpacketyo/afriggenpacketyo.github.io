          <p>Chipmaker Intel is reportedly in talks with other major investors for an equity infusion at a discounted price, building on a recent $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank. This search for additional funding underscores the company's urgent need for capital to fuel its difficult turnaround amid declining sales and struggles to compete in the booming AI semiconductor market. The situation is further complicated by the U.S. Commerce Secretary's stance that government CHIPS Act funds should be exchanged for an equity stake, potentially diluting value for existing shareholders.</p>

          <p>The British government is preparing for a potential takeover of Speciality Steels UK, the nation's third-largest steelworks, in a bid to save the business and its 1,500 jobs from collapse. The plant, owned by the financially troubled Liberty Steel, is facing a court order to be wound up over substantial unpaid debts, which has crippled its ability to operate. This potential intervention mirrors a previous government seizure of British Steel, presenting ministers with an unappealing choice between backing the current owner's uncertain restructuring plan or taking on a loss-making plant to protect a vital industrial asset.</p>

Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz highlighted the timing of the incident, which occurred amid ongoing discussions about achieving peace in Ukraine. Initial findings suggest the aircraft was a Russian-made decoy version of an Iranian Shahed drone, leading Poland's Foreign Ministry to condemn the violation of its airspace and vow to formally protest the incursion to the responsible party.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 30 major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, has formally called on the UK government to create a national strategy for stablecoins to prevent falling behind the United States in financial innovation. In an open letter to the Finance Minister, they argued that the UK should view stablecoins as a financial infrastructure to be embraced responsibly, rather than as a risk to be contained. The group believes a proactive and coordinated national strategy would significantly bolster the UK's position as a global financial hub and generate new revenue streams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old man from Buckinghamshire, UK, has been sentenced to nine years in prison after shooting a police officer in the leg with a crossbow during a violent confrontation. The incident occurred after police were called to a neighbor dispute, during which the man also stabbed another individual in the stomach. The court heard that he fired repeatedly at officers from an upstairs window before chasing them with the weapon. The judge described the man as posing a "significant" risk to the public and commended the responding officers for their bravery.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has announced that the entire U.S.-Mexico border wall will be painted black, a strategy she credits to an idea from President Trump. The stated purpose of the black paint is to make the structure absorb more heat, rendering it hotter and more difficult for migrants to climb, especially in high-temperature desert environments. This initiative is part of the administration's broader immigration crackdown, which has also included installing waterborne barriers and has coincided with a dramatic drop in the number of border crossings in recent months.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a groundbreaking "superfood" supplement that could help save honeybee populations from the severe threats of climate change and habitat loss. The new food provides all the essential nutrients bees require, particularly key lipids called sterols that are vital for their development but have historically been very difficult to synthesize. In laboratory trials, bee colonies that were fed the new supplement produced up to 15 times more offspring that successfully reached adulthood, offering a major breakthrough for global agriculture.</p>

Researchers from the University of Florida and University College London suggest this continues a trend of decline spanning at least 80 years. The study attributes the steep drop to a combination of factors, including the pervasive rise of digital media, an overall decrease in available leisure time, and persistent, uneven access to books and libraries across different communities, raising concerns about public well-being.</p>
