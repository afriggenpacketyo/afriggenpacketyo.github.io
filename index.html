          <p>A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, was placed on indefinite paid leave after being accused of failing to adequately advocate for the government's interests in a lawsuit involving a man wrongly deported to El Salvador. During the hearing, Reuveni struggled to answer questions about the deportation and the legal basis for the man's seizure, expressing his own frustration with the lack of information. The government is now seeking to appeal the judge's order to facilitate the man's return to the United States, highlighting the administration's commitment to rectifying the error.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, were denied entry to Israel while attempting to visit the West Bank, sparking criticism from UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Israeli authorities accused the MPs of intending to spread hate speech and document security forces, though the MPs stated the trip was organized with UK charities experienced in parliamentary delegations. The UK Foreign Office has offered support to the MPs, and Lammy has expressed his concerns to the Israeli government, emphasizing that this treatment of British parliamentarians is unacceptable and counterproductive.</p>

          <h2>Doctor Explains Causes and Remedies for Chronic Throat Clearing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 05:06:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Laryngologist Dr. Inna Husain explains that chronic throat clearing, often triggered by allergies or reflux, can damage vocal cords and worsen irritation. She recommends identifying the root cause through an ENT exam, addressing issues like sinusitis or nasal polyps. Hydrating vocal folds, avoiding irritants like smoke and acidic foods, and practicing alternative behaviors like swallowing or humming can help break the cycle. Dr. Husain cautions against unnecessary antihistamine use, as it can sometimes exacerbate throat clearing issues.</p>
