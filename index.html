          <p>Two crew members died and 22 were injured when the Mexican Navy sailing ship ARM Cuauhtémoc, carrying 277 people including 175 naval cadets, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge while leaving New York City. The ship, on a good-will tour, struck the bridge's underside, damaging its masts and rigging, with videos of the incident going viral on social media. Investigations are underway by the Mexican Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Transportation Safety Board to determine the cause, considering mechanical failure, tugboat involvement, or human error. The ship, used as a training vessel since 1982, was en route to Reykjavik, Iceland, after a stop in New York as part of a 254-day tour.</p>

          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, believed to have died in the explosion, which injured four others. Bartkus, who had nihilistic views against bringing people into the world against their will, used a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, causing significant damage to surrounding buildings. Authorities confirmed that all embryos stored at the American Reproductive Centers clinic were saved, and the clinic plans to reopen at a temporary location. The FBI is investigating the incident as an intentional act of terrorism, with no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>Researchers are deploying specially trained dogs to sniff out egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly in the Cleveland area, helping to eradicate the sap-sucking bugs that damage trees and fruit crops. Four dogs have uncovered over 4,000 egg masses, potentially eliminating up to 200,000 lanternflies, with the dogs trained through a Virginia Tech University project. The dogs, owned by local residents, receive treats for spotting egg masses, which are then scraped away, with female lanternflies laying eggs from late August through the first frost. This initiative aims to slow the spread of the insect, which is native to eastern Asia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oncology experts suggest that former President Joe Biden's "aggressive" prostate cancer diagnosis, which was revealed after the cancer had metastasized, is not uncommon in older patients, and that there are several potential reasons for the late diagnosis. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older, and it is possible that Biden did not undergo PSA screening or that his cancer grew rapidly between screenings. Even with screening, false negatives can occur, and some men with borderline results may choose not to pursue further testing, with advanced prostate cancer sometimes presenting no symptoms. Treatment options for prostate cancer vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements received by former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, alleging without evidence that some celebrities were illegally paid for their endorsements. Celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Bruce Springsteen, and Beyonce appeared at Harris campaign events, with the campaign paying their production companies for services. Winfrey and Beyonce's mother denied that the payments were for endorsements, but rather for production costs, and campaign law experts stated that there are no FEC regulations against campaigns paying celebrities for endorsements as long as payments are properly disclosed.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a pro-Palestinian activist, graduated from Columbia University with a bachelor's degree in philosophy after being released from immigration custody, where he was detained for allegedly posing a risk of "adverse foreign policy consequences". Mahdawi, who has a green card, was released by a Vermont federal judge who deemed his detention a punishment for protected speech, and plans to return to Columbia for a graduate degree. The Trump administration is seeking to deport Mahdawi under a law allowing visa revocation if the secretary of state believes someone's presence poses "serious adverse foreign policy consequences," with Mahdawi arguing his detention violated the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis of an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer has brought attention to the disease, which is the most common cancer diagnosed in American men, with diagnosis rates having increased about 3% every year since 2014. Early prostate cancer generally does not cause symptoms, but when they do occur, they include problems with urination or blood in the urine or semen. Prostate cancer can often be found early through screening tests, including a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigens (PSA), with treatment options varying depending on the stage and how far it has spread.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling declared DOGE's actions at USIP "null and void" and ordered the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose. The judge noted that Trump used force and "threats of criminal process" to take over the USIP headquarters, even though the agency is not part of the government's executive branch. The USIP, in a statement, said that the group for 40 years "has worked to spread peace and stability around the world."</p>

Morgan also testified about other instances of violence by Combs, including an incident in Jamaica where he allegedly dragged Ventura by her hair, and another where he allegedly choked Morgan and threw a wooden hanger at her head. David James, Combs' former personal assistant, testified about a conversation he overheard where Combs said Ventura was "very mouldable".</p>

          <p>Republicans are struggling to pass Donald Trump’s second-term agenda in Congress, as the minority party has had little real role so far. The struggle is between the House and Senate GOP, between moderates and hard-liners, and between Republicans and reality. The president’s “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” would make the country’s fiscal situation worse, slash taxes, and add trillions of dollars to the deficit. Republicans leaders are denying the downgrade from Moody's.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a major reset of relations that covers fishing, trade, defense, energy, and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation. The agreement involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. It marks the biggest reboot since the UK officially left the EU in 2020 and comes after years of disagreements over Brexit. The government said the deal would make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported by reducing paperwork and checks.</p>

Grealish has fallen down the pecking order this season, starting only 16 times in all competitions. He was an unused substitute in the FA Cup final, and his future at Etihad Stadium is unclear heading into the summer. There is likely to be interest from clubs across Europe in a player who may be attracted by the idea of a fresh start at a top club who could provide him with regular football.</p>

          <p>President Trump is telling some of the nation’s largest companies that they should eat the cost of his tariffs, as a growing number of businesses signal that they must raise prices to blunt the impact of a persistent global trade war. As a result, the man who ran for the presidency by boasting about his business acumen is now openly sparring with corporate America, seeking to dictate how Walmart, Mattel, and other retailers and manufacturers respond to some of the highest levies seen in decades. The White House has repeatedly dismissed evidence that tariffs fall hardest on U.S. companies and consumers.</p>

Dimon believes the risks of higher inflation and even stagflation aren't properly represented by stock market values. He said that he believed Wall Street earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies, which have already declined in the first weeks of Trump's trade policies, will fall further as companies pull or lower guidance amid the uncertainty. Dimon also stated the odds of stagflation, "which is basically a recession with inflation," are roughly double what the market thinks. (not investment advice)</p>
