          <p>A Chinese scholar urged the United States and China to exercise self-restraint and cease weaponizing their trade relationship, ahead of upcoming negotiations. The scholar, Da Wei of Tsinghua University, emphasized the need to avoid finding new tools against each other. This call comes as Beijing expanded export controls on rare earth elements, mirroring Washington's chip restrictions, highlighting escalating tensions. These critical raw materials are expected to be a key focus in the impending US-China trade talks in Malaysia.</p>

          <p>China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation (Comac) is making its debut at the Dubai Airshow to scout for Middle Eastern buyers for its C909 and C919 passenger jets. This participation is a strategic effort to challenge the global Airbus-Boeing duopoly in the passenger aircraft market. Analysts expect Comac to attract significant attention, with overseas sales potentially bolstered by China's growing trade ties with the Middle East. This international expansion is crucial for the company's long-term growth and influence.</p>

          <p>An extraordinary by-election in Caerphilly saw Labour and the Conservatives collectively secure only 13% of the vote, highlighting a significant shift in UK political sentiment. Plaid Cymru emerged victorious, with their long-serving councillor Lindsay Whittle finally winning after decades of attempts. Reform UK also performed strongly, securing second place, indicating growing discontent with traditional parties. This result signals a potential decline for Labour in Wales and poses serious questions for the current UK government.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales reached their highest level since 2022 in September, increasing 0.5% monthly and 0.9% quarterly. This rise was fueled by good weather boosting clothing sales and strong online performance, particularly in computer, telecoms, and gold jewelry. Despite this positive trend, economists caution that this retail strength might not be sustainable, citing weak employment, high inflation, and looming tax increases. This data is crucial for government policy and Bank of England financial decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top leaders concluded the Fourth Plenum by pledging to boost domestic consumption and strengthen self-reliance in advanced technologies over the next five years. The strategy focuses on balancing consumption with effective investment to expand internal demand, a nuanced shift in economic policy. While targeting around 5% annual growth, direct cash handouts are not part of the plan, with resources channeled into consumption-related sectors and business support. This aims for significant economic and technological advancement by 2035 amidst global challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump abruptly terminated all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an "egregious" anti-tariff advert sponsored by Ontario that quoted Ronald Reagan. Trump labeled the ad "FAKE" and accused it of attempting to influence an upcoming US Supreme Court decision on the legality of his tariffs. The advert, which featured Reagan's 1987 remarks on tariffs harming Americans, prompted the Ronald Reagan Foundation to state its "selective" use of audio. This decision further escalates trade tensions between the neighboring nations, impacting industries like car and steel manufacturing.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral race, just before early voting, signaling a reconciliation. Adams, who dropped out, sharply criticized Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani's rent freeze promises as unrealistic. He labeled Mamdani a "snake oil salesman" and "king of the gentrifiers." Cuomo, running as an independent, echoed these concerns, asserting Mamdani is not a true Democrat and poses an "existential threat" to the city.</p>
