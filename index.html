          <h2>Taiwan Dollar Weakens After Record Gains Amid Currency Talk Speculation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge against the U.S. dollar, fueled by speculation that Washington was pressuring Taiwan to strengthen its currency to win trade concessions from U.S. The currency weakened over 3% on Tuesday, following a 9% rally over the previous two days. While officials deny currency rates are part of trade negotiations, analysts remain skeptical given the central bank's limited intervention. The article suggests the pullback was driven by importers' increased demand for U.S. dollars, and the central bank may be allowing a currency realignment. Optimism is tempered by economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>The FBI has opened 250 investigations into a violent online network known as '764' that coerces teenagers into sexual and violent behavior, including creating graphic pornography and self-harm. The predators, labeled 'nihilistic violent extremists,' share the content and extort victims for more. The FBI's Counterterrorism Division is treating 764 as a potential form of domestic terrorism, as the group seeks to sow chaos and bring down society. Authorities have arrested at least 15 people associated with 764 on child pornography or weapons-related charges, with victims as young as nine potentially numbering in the thousands.</p>

          <p>Experts outline the potential repercussions of missing payments on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), including late fees, damaged credit scores, and the risk of default and foreclosure. Missing even one payment can significantly drop a credit score, and repeated late payments can lead to the lender demanding the full balance immediately. The article advises homeowners struggling with HELOC payments to contact their lender immediately to explore options like deferred payments or loan modification.

          <p>A new study indicates that the shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The research, published in the European Heart Journal, examined data from over 1 million people aged 50 or older and found a 23% lower risk of heart disease in vaccinated individuals. The protective effect was more pronounced in men, younger individuals, and those with unhealthy habits. Experts suggest the vaccine's impact on chronic inflammation could be a key factor in reducing heart issues.</p>

          <p>An analysis examines the constitutional and Supreme Court interpretations of 'due process' for non-citizens facing deportation under the Trump administration. While the Constitution guarantees due process, its application varies depending on the immigrant's status and circumstances.

The 'expedited removal' program allows for swift deportations without a hearing for migrants who have been in the country illegally for less than two years and are detained near the border.</p>
