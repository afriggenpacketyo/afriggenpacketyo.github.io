          <p>An early-season heat dome is causing record-high temperatures in the Eastern US, impacting cities like Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. The heat wave is particularly dangerous because it's occurring early in the summer before people have acclimated to warmer conditions. The high-pressure system is trapping hot air from the Southwest, leading to triple-digit temperatures and high humidity. Climate change has increased the likelihood of this heat wave, making it crucial for residents to take precautions and stay cool, as some areas may experience temperatures 40 degrees warmer than the previous week. The heat is testing the resilience of city dwellers, especially those vulnerable to oppressive conditions.</p>

          <p>Russian attacks involving drones and missiles have killed at least 14 civilians and injured dozens more in Ukraine, with significant damage reported in Kyiv. President Zelenskyy is currently in the UK to discuss defense strategies and ways to pressure Russia, following meetings with King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Ukraine's air force reported intercepting many drones and missiles, but some strikes still hit residential areas, hospitals, and infrastructure. Zelenskyy accused Russia, North Korea, and Iran of forming a "coalition of murderers," alleging that North Korean missiles were used in the Kyiv strike, as rescue workers continue searching for survivors amidst the destruction.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague emphasizes ambitious goals that place heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Merz has pledged financial resources to make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe, NATO plans for member states to spend 5% of their economic output on defense by 2035. This target, initially proposed by former US President Trump, faces skepticism within Germany's coalition government, with some members deeming it "irrational". The summit also addresses the need for additional troops in Europe, potentially requiring Germany to recruit between 50,000 and 60,000 soldiers, leading to discussions about reinstating compulsory military service.</p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's proposed changes to the benefits system, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. The MPs argue that the welfare reform bill will push people into poverty, lacks adequate consultation, and has an insufficient impact assessment on the job market and people's health. While the government defends the bill as necessary to address the rising number of people on long-term sickness and disability benefits, Labour MPs remain discontented with the reforms. The vote on the bill is scheduled for July 1, and the level of support for the amendment indicates a potential rebellion against the government's plans.</p>

          <p>Boy and girl scouts in Kyoto participated in harvesting "Ofuku Ume" plums at the Kitano Tenmangu shrine, known for producing these Japanese plums believed to bring good luck in the New Year. Around 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, carefully hand-picked the plums from the shrine's 1,500 plum trees. The harvested plums will be pickled and dried to become Ofuku Ume, and drinking tea made from them on New Year's Day is thought to promote good health and ward off illness.

The intensity of the storm, featuring winds over 35 mph and waves exceeding 8 feet, surprised forecasters, and the unusually cold temperatures may have contributed to the unstable air mass.

          <p>A recent report by US health and human services secretary Robert F.

American children are more likely to die from guns or in road traffic accidents than children in comparable countries. The lack of attention to these issues raises questions about the report's comprehensiveness and its ability to address the most pressing threats to child health, highlighting the need for systemic policy changes to prioritize health and wellbeing.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe and foster political integration on the continent. The alliance functions as a collective security organization, providing mutual defense through military and political means if a member state is threatened. Article 5 of the NATO charter, the collective defense clause, states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all, prompting a collective response. The article has only been invoked once, by the United States after the 9/11 attacks, and the organization continues to evolve its role in response to contemporary security challenges.</p>

          <p>Global equities have shown muted gains as investors digest President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire timeline between Iran and Israel, alongside growing weariness of Trump's policymaking. The markets are exhibiting signs of desensitization to policy changes, with limited reactions to the recent events. This is partly attributed to the subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, which left no reported casualties. The market's muted response indicates a sense of fatigue with the Trump administration's policy shifts, leading to reduced volatility in response to geopolitical events. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities reflects a willingness to prioritize Israeli perspectives over the assessments of US intelligence officials. For two decades, US intelligence has maintained that Iran has a uranium enrichment program but has not built a bomb, a view often at odds with Israel's concerns. Trump's skepticism towards the CIA and his ideological purge of national security experts have created an environment where he is less inclined to listen to expert opinions on Iran. This shift raises concerns about the potential for miscalculations and escalations in the region, as the president appears to disregard intelligence assessments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, compounded by US military strikes, is forcing airlines to avoid flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western airlines face greater disruption than their Chinese rivals because they are barred from Russian airspace, which Chinese companies continue to use. This situation gives Chinese airlines a competitive advantage in terms of airfare and flight times. Both Western and Chinese carriers have avoided Iranian skies due to safety concerns, but Chinese airlines have more flexibility in rerouting flights, potentially widening the competitive gap between them and Western firms.</p>

          <p>Germany faces potential tax hikes and increased debt as NATO allies consider a higher defense spending target of 5% of GDP. While Germany currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, meeting the new target would require significant additional expenditures, potentially financed by loans and budget cuts. Experts suggest that a complete financing through loans is unsustainable long-term, raising concerns about the impact on Germany's budget and compliance with EU fiscal rules. The feasibility of reaching the 5% target remains uncertain, prompting discussions about potential fiscal adjustments and policy priorities.</p>

          <p>China's dominance in rare earth production has been significantly strengthened by its reliance on supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's mines are key sources of heavy rare earth elements, particularly dysprosium and terbium, used in high-tech manufacturing. However, this reliance has also exposed China to supply chain risks, especially due to the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, which has disrupted production and caused price spikes. Despite Beijing's environmental controls, rare earth extraction in Myanmar has continued at a high environmental cost.</p>
