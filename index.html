          <p>A public feud has escalated between former President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk. Trump threatened Musk's government subsidies after Musk heavily criticized a massive Republican-backed budget bill, which Trump considers a legacy item. Musk, a former Trump ally, has denounced the bill for increasing national debt and threatened to support primary challengers against Republicans who vote for it. The conflict highlights a significant rift between the two influential figures over fiscal policy and the direction of the Republican party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll indicates that a vast majority of Americans, 76%, believe that U.S. democracy is under serious threat. This sentiment is shared across party lines, with 89% of Democrats, 80% of Independents, and 57% of Republicans expressing concern. The poll also found that 73% of Americans view politically motivated violence as a significant problem.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a brutal season of severe weather, including a high number of tornadoes and intense flooding, while the National Weather Service (NWS) is operating with critical staff and budget shortages. Recent cuts under the Trump administration have led to understaffed forecast offices, the suspension of 24/7 operations in some areas, and a reduction in vital data collection from weather balloons. This situation has raised serious concerns among meteorologists and former NWS directors, who warn that the degraded forecasting capabilities could lead to a needless loss of life as climate change makes extreme weather more frequent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the often-overlooked value of political protest as a tool to combat the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where individuals wrongly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. Public demonstrations serve as a powerful signal, correcting misperceptions about collective public opinion on sensitive issues like climate change or abortion rights. By making dissent visible, protests can build "common knowledge" and show that a viewpoint is more widely shared than assumed. This can empower individuals, break the cycle of silence, and prevent unpopular policies from persisting due to a falsely perceived consensus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to widespread confusion and fear among doctors, several Republican-led states are passing legislation to "clarify" the medical exceptions in their strict abortion bans. These new laws aim to provide more concrete guidance on when an abortion is permissible to save a patient's life, such as in cases of ectopic pregnancy. However, critics and abortion rights advocates argue that these clarifications do little to resolve the fundamental legal risks for physicians and may introduce new problematic language. The debate highlights the deep divisions over whether these incremental changes are helpful or simply a political maneuver.</p>

This article analyzes the team's dramatic fall from grace, comparing it to the 1998 Florida Marlins but noting the Galaxy retained most of its championship roster. Excuses like salary cap issues and injuries are dismissed, pointing instead to a collective, dramatic drop in performance from key players and questionable management decisions, including a contract extension for the coach amidst a winless streak.

          <p>The U.S. Senate conducted a marathon overnight session to vote on amendments to President Trump's massive budget package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The nearly 1,000-page bill, which includes spending increases for border security and defense funded by cuts to healthcare and social programs, faces a precarious path to passage. Republicans remain divided over the extent of welfare cuts needed to finance the extension of tax breaks, a key provision of the legislation. The bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt, drawing sharp criticism from Democrats and some conservatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Some National Guard Troops Deployed for Los Angeles Protests May Be Reassigned to Wildfire Duty</h2>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some of the California National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles back to their wildfire-fighting duties. The Trump administration had controversially federalized about 4,000 Guard members to respond to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, over the objections of state officials. With California expecting an active wildfire season, there are concerns that the deployment has left the state's firefighting force under-resourced. This potential shift highlights the tension between federal priorities and state needs for emergency response personnel.</p>

          <p>A Japan Airlines flight from Shanghai to Tokyo was forced to make an emergency landing after experiencing a sudden, rapid descent that terrified passengers. The aircraft, operated by Spring Airlines Japan, diverted to Kansai Airport after an alert indicated an issue with the cabin's pressurization system, causing oxygen masks to deploy. Passengers described the plane plummeting violently, dropping from over 10,000 meters to 3,000 meters in just 20 minutes. Fortunately, none of the 191 people on board were injured during the harrowing incident.</p>
