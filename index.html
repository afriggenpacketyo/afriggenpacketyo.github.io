          <p>London-based payments platform Checkout.com is launching a share buyback initiative for its employees, providing them with liquidity. This program is based on a new internal valuation of $12 billion, a substantial decrease from the $40 billion valuation it achieved during a 2022 funding round. Despite the lowered valuation, the company reports it is on track to exceed 30% core net revenue growth this year, positioning it competitively against rivals like Stripe and Adyen. This move reflects a broader trend of private tech companies offering liquidity to employees as IPOs become less frequent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new series of tariffs set to begin on October 1, targeting a range of imported goods. The measures include a 100% levy on branded pharmaceuticals, a 50% tax on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, and a 25% tariff on heavy-duty trucks. President Trump stated the tariffs are necessary to protect American manufacturers from what he described as a "flooding" of products from other countries. The move has prompted concern from international partners, including the UK, whose pharmaceutical exports to the US are significant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shipping consultancy Sea Intelligence reports a noticeable decrease in the deployment of Chinese-built vessels on transpacific trade routes to North America. This trend, observed in recent weeks, suggests that carriers may be proactively adjusting their operations to mitigate the impact of an anticipated new US port service fee. While the shift is more pronounced on the Asia-North America west coast route, Chinese state-owned carrier Cosco has affirmed its commitment to maintaining stable service to the US market despite potential challenges from the new fees.</p>

The storm, the most powerful globally this year, brought record-breaking winds and torrential rain, causing severe damage to undersea cables and widespread disruptions. Prior to the typhoon's arrival, authorities had evacuated over one million people, and as of Friday, no casualties had been reported within Guangdong, though the storm was deadly in the Philippines and Taiwan.</p>

          <p>In response to recent air incursions from Russia, several European Union member states are set to hold their first official talks on a proposal to build a coordinated anti-drone defense system. The discussion, which will include Ukraine, primarily involves countries along the EU's eastern border but has expanded to include Denmark following recent drone incidents. This initiative, referred to as a "drone wall" by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, aims to create a unified system to detect and neutralize hostile drone swarms, enhancing regional security.</p>

          <p>Cities across the world, including in the UK and North America, are experiencing a significant increase in rat populations, a phenomenon some are calling "ratmageddon." Experts attribute this surge to several factors, with rising global temperatures playing a key role by allowing for longer breeding seasons. Additionally, issues such as inconsistent rubbish collection and the abundance of food waste in urban environments create ideal conditions for rat populations to thrive, posing public health risks and challenging pest control efforts.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz addressed the recent controversy over Tylenol use during pregnancy, clarifying the Trump administration's position. Following an FDA letter and presidential comments suggesting a link to autism, Oz stated that pregnant women should absolutely take acetaminophen for a high fever if recommended by a doctor, as fevers themselves pose risks. However, he cautioned against casual use for minor aches and pains without medical consultation, emphasizing a prudent approach until more definitive evidence is available on the matter.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two criminal counts but, in an unusual move, declined to approve a third charge presented by prosecutors. The approved charges allege that Comey made a false statement to Congress about authorizing media leaks and obstructed a congressional proceeding. The rejected count also related to making false statements during the same 2020 Senate hearing. This detailed look at the grand jury's decision provides specific insight into the legal basis of the high-profile case against the former FBI chief.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks secured a dramatic 23-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals after kicker Jason Myers successfully converted a 52-yard field goal as time expired. The Seahawks had built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, only to see the Cardinals, led by quarterback Kyler Murray, rally to tie the game with just 33 seconds remaining. A penalty on the ensuing kickoff gave Seattle excellent field position, allowing quarterback Sam Darnold to quickly move the team into range for the game-winning kick, extending their winning streak over their NFC West rivals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is being widely interpreted as a significant escalation of President Trump's campaign of political retribution against his critics. The charges were filed just days after Trump publicly called for the Justice Department to prosecute Comey, raising serious concerns among legal experts about the erosion of the traditional firewall between the White House and federal law enforcement. This move is viewed by many as a fulfillment of Trump's long-standing promise to use the powers of the government to target his political adversaries.</p>

          <p>The parents of an 8-year-old girl still missing after a deadly flood at Camp Mystic in Texas have called the camp's decision to reopen in 2026 "unthinkable."

Her parents, along with other affected families, criticized the camp for announcing reopening plans and a memorial without consulting them, stating that the focus should remain entirely on recovery efforts and accountability for the failures that led to the disaster.</p>
