          <p>European leaders have jointly called for Ukraine to be a central party in any peace negotiations, expressing concern over a potential bilateral summit between the U.S. and Russia. In a joint statement, leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others emphasized that Ukraine's destiny and international borders cannot be decided without its direct involvement. The statement comes amid reports that the White House is considering a deal that might involve territorial concessions, a proposal Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has strongly rejected as rewarding aggression. European nations reiterated their commitment to providing ongoing diplomatic, military, and financial support to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a commanding performance, striking out ten batters over five scoreless innings in a 9-1 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays. This outing marks a strong return for the two-time Cy Young winner, who has now accumulated 18 strikeouts in 10 innings since rejoining the team from the injured list. The Dodgers' offense was powered by home runs from Max Muncy and Shohei Ohtani, who hit his 40th of the season. The win solidifies the Dodgers' rotation, which now appears to be at full strength heading toward the postseason.</p>

          <p>A new six-part documentary, "Zuo Zongtang Recovers Xinjiang," has been released in China, aiming to counter Western narratives and strengthen Beijing's historical claims over the region. Produced by Hunan's provincial broadcaster, the series focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang. The documentary portrays the historical invasion by Yaqub Beg, a Central Asian general backed by Britain and Russia, as an effort to establish a jihadist caliphate. This production aligns with President Xi Jinping's broader goal of forging a unified national identity by cementing China's official historical accounts of its borderlands.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford completed an extensive workout, throwing over 60 passes as he recovers from a back injury. Coach Sean McVay described the session as a positive step, noting that Stafford threw without limitations and felt good afterward. The 37-year-old quarterback, who is dealing with an aggravated disc issue, is expected to gradually return to practice next week, initially participating only in individual drills. The team remains hopeful for his return, though his participation in a now-canceled joint practice with the Chargers had already been ruled out as a precaution.</p>

Police arrested a 17-year-old suspect who now faces charges including attempted murder and assault. The intended target, a 19-year-old man, was shot in the foot, while an 18-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man were also wounded. All victims were hospitalized in stable condition, and a gun was recovered from the scene.</p>

A crucial piece of evidence, a small metal part from the broken bathroom door lock, was found under her body, suggesting the door was forced open before the shot was fired.

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a significant boom following the 2008 recession, is now facing a slowdown due to a combination of economic factors. Post-pandemic inflation, changing drinking habits among younger generations, and the looming threat of retaliatory trade tariffs have all contributed to declining sales. Major brands like Bulleit and Wild Turkey have reported sales drops of 7.3% and 8.1% respectively, and several smaller distilleries have faced bankruptcy. This downturn has created an oversupply in the market, as production decisions were based on demand forecasts from several years ago, further driving down prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the upcoming summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that any peace deal made without Kyiv's involvement would be a "dead solution." He emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that his country will not reward Russian aggression with land. Zelenskyy's statement reflects widespread anxiety in Kyiv and Europe that a direct U.S.-Russia meeting could marginalize their interests. Meanwhile, European leaders issued a joint statement reinforcing that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Man Incorrectly Fined for Parking After ANPR System Confuses His Car with Another</h2>

          <p>A man in Leicestershire, UK, was wrongly issued a £165 parking charge after an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle. Richard Lynn paid for 30 minutes of parking, but the system recorded his Hyundai entering and a Kia with a nearly identical plate leaving nine hours later. Despite providing photographic evidence of the error, the private parking firm, Horizon Parking, sent debt collection letters. The case highlights concerns that errors from automated systems can lead to aggressive and incorrect enforcement actions against innocent drivers.</p>

          <p>A recent comment by singer Ed Sheeran, who described himself as "culturally Irish" despite being born and raised in England, has ignited a conversation about the complexities of cultural identity in 2025. Sheeran defended his connection, citing his Irish grandparents, passport, and formative musical experiences in Ireland. The debate touches on the evolving nature of Irishness, especially for the diaspora in Britain, where identity is no longer a simple binary choice. Experts note that for many second-generation individuals, cultural identity is a deeply personal feeling that transcends citizenship or birthplace, reflecting a blend of heritages.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger is investigating how a rare and massive meteorite from Mars, discovered in its Sahara Desert region, was sold at a Sotheby's auction in New York for $4.3 million. Officials have expressed doubts about the legality of the artifact's export, suggesting potential illicit trafficking. The 24.7kg rock, the largest Martian meteorite ever found on Earth, was reportedly sold by a local community to an international dealer before ending up in an Italian gallery and then at auction. The incident highlights the ambiguous international laws governing extraterrestrial objects and the ongoing struggle of nations to protect their natural heritage.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has been widely panned by critics, earning a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes and being labeled one of the worst films ever made. The movie, where a government agent fights an alien invasion from his desk, was made during the pandemic and features a plot involving Amazon drones. This critical failure has sparked a broader discussion about the appeal of "so bad they're good" films. Some viewers and cinephiles argue that earnestly made but technically flawed movies are often more memorable and entertaining than polished but bland blockbusters.</p>

          <p>Six months after the Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 shocked Silicon Valley with its impressive capabilities and low development cost, its long-term impact remains a topic of debate. The app's release challenged the "bigger is better" philosophy of AI development, suggesting that smarter engineering could rival massive computational power. While DeepSeek forced a reevaluation of American AI dominance and is still used by some cash-strapped startups, the industry's major players appear to have returned to a strategy of massive spending on data centers and talent. Security concerns regarding DeepSeek's Chinese origins also continue to limit its widespread adoption in the West.</p>

The suspects, wanted in connection with a fatal shooting in May, were apprehended by U.S. Marshals at Lindsey's apartment-style dorm, where multiple firearms were reportedly found. Lindsey's lawyer claims the player was unaware his friends were wanted for murder and is cooperating with authorities.

Despite a major overhaul of the squad and coaching staff, Rangers have drawn both of their opening league matches, echoing the inconsistency of previous seasons where strong European performances were followed by domestic letdowns. Martin admitted the team showed lethargy and suggested a deeper change in culture and daily standards at the club is needed, a process he warned will take time to yield results.</p>
