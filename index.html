        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent allegedly made mortgage claims similar to those President Trump used when trying to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, according to a Bloomberg report. Documents show Bessent agreed that homes in both Bedford Hills, New York, and Provincetown, Massachusetts, would be his principal residence on the same day in September 2007. Cook signed mortgage agreements declaring houses in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta were each her principal residences, within two weeks of each other in summer 2021, before her Fed appointment. While there are differences between the two situations, there is evidence lenders knew the actual plans for the respective properties. The article details the statements from lawyers and banks involved in the transactions. </p>

          <p>President Trump has begun his U.K. state visit, greeted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. This marks Trump's second state visit to the U.K., occurring amidst the backdrop of the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The visit includes traditional pomp and pageantry, aiming to strengthen ties between the U.S. and the U.K. The visit is being shadowed by protests, and it is being closely watched by the public and the media. The meetings between Trump and U.K. officials are expected to cover a range of topics, including trade and security. </p>

          <p>Amazon's investment in Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, is drawing comparisons to Microsoft's investment in OpenAI. Similar to how Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI boosted its Azure cloud business, Amazon hopes Anthropic will do the same for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Analysts believe Anthropic could drive high-margin revenue for AWS and position Amazon as a leader in the AI space. Amazon is building its own chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia, aiming to offer better price performance to customers. </p>

          <p>A moderate House Democrat, Rep. Tom Suozzi, expressed disappointment in the partisan responses to Charlie Kirk's assassination, believing both parties have fallen short. He urged leaders to focus on unity and express condolences for Kirk's family, rather than engaging in further division. Suozzi attended a memorial vigil for Kirk, while partisan tensions continue to rise, particularly concerning comments made by Rep. Ilhan Omar. The current social media environment is also blamed for fueling divisions, as Suozzi encourages everyone to love their enemies. </p>

          <p>Major US tech firms, including Nvidia and Microsoft, have pledged billions in AI investment in the UK, with Nvidia predicting the country will become an "AI superpower." Microsoft is making its largest investment outside the US with a $30 billion spending package as part of a £31 billion "Tech Prosperity Deal" with the UK government. The investments will focus on building AI infrastructure and data centers, including a new supercomputer in Essex. While the deal is expected to drive UK growth and productivity, concerns remain about the energy consumption and potential for an AI bubble. </p>

          <p>Kenya's public pension and health insurance systems are facing a major fraud scandal, with millions lost to corruption. An Auditor General's report revealed over 260,000 cases of fraudulent activities targeting pension schemes, resulting in billions of Kenyan shillings being lost through fake payments. The health insurance scheme has also been targeted, with hospitals accused of stealing millions from the health tax fund. The government has promised to digitize the pension payment system to combat fraud, but many Kenyans have lost confidence in these systems. </p>

Johnson wants to delay ACA negotiations, arguing they are a December policy debate, not a September funding matter.

          <p>Ousted CDC director Susan Monarez plans to warn a Senate committee about the "real risk" of limited vaccine access for children if a new vaccine panel proceeds with its meeting. She intends to share her side of the story regarding a meeting with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., preceding her removal. Monarez believes she was fired for refusing to pre-approve recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). She also refused to dismiss career scientists at the agency. </p>

The agency's post on X could allow prosecutors to pursue federal assault charges for actions traditionally classified as resisting arrest or protest activities. The message follows DHS claims of increased attacks on Ice officers, despite examples including trash dumped on an agent’s lawn. Federal prosecutors have also filed assault charges against multiple protesters this year. </p>
