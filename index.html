          <p>An Army helicopter flight near the Pentagon caused two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with the aircraft. The 20-second communication lapse occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, leading the Pentagon tower to delay landing clearance. The incident added to concerns about close calls between military and civilian aircraft near the airport, especially after a fatal midair collision earlier in the year. The Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon to address safety issues, while the FAA is under pressure to modernize its air traffic control systems.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block is unconstitutional, permanently blocking its enforcement. The judge found that the order infringed on the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, resembling a "screed" motivated by animosity towards the firm due to its legal challenges against Trump's policies. The order had instructed officials to review and revoke security clearances of firm members, terminate government contracts, and halt future federal job hires from the firm. This ruling marks the second setback for the administration in its attempts to punish law firms involved in litigation against it.</p>

President Xi Jinping's attendance at Russia's Victory Day celebrations and the confirmation of North Korean troop deployments to Russia highlight this alignment. The article argues that China's reactive stance risks ceding influence to other actors, such as the U.S., and that the revelations of North Korean involvement in the war in Ukraine, with significant casualties, underscore the strategic implications of these relationships. This alignment could lead to further instability in the region and beyond.</p>

          <p>A two-month-old black bear cub, found alone and starving in a California forest, is being cared for at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center. Wildlife staff are using enrichment sessions, including wearing bear costumes, to mimic maternal behavior and prepare the cub for a future return to the wild. The goal is to minimize human interaction to avoid conflicts once the cub is released, as bears are smart and food-motivated. The cub is expected to remain at the center for up to a year before being released.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court ruling has moved the American right closer to achieving a major goal of Project 2025, which aims to centralize power in the presidency. The ruling allows President Trump to fire members of independent regulatory agencies, potentially overturning 90 years of precedent. This shift reflects a change in the right's view of big government, as they now embrace the expansion of executive power. Critics argue that this decision undermines the independence of agencies like the FCC and NLRB and threatens the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed a "partnership" between US Steel and Nippon Steel, a reversal from his earlier stance against the Japanese firm's $14.9 billion bid to acquire the U.S. company. The announcement came months after Trump insisted he was "totally against" the deal, citing national security concerns. Under the new arrangement, US Steel will remain in the US, with its headquarters in Pittsburgh, and Trump plans to hold a rally in the state to celebrate the agreement. The move signals a shift in Trump's position, as he now claims the partnership will create jobs and boost the U.S. economy.</p>

The restored version of Kurosawa's "Ran" is highly recommended, with the reviewer encouraging viewers to see the film on the big screen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by First Street projects that climate change-related extreme weather events could cause a significant increase in foreclosures across the U.S., potentially rising by 380% over the next decade. Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable, with the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums contributing to mortgage defaults. Lenders could face billions in losses as they absorb the cost of these defaults, highlighting the "hidden risks" of climate change that are often overlooked in underwriting practices. The study suggests integrating climate risk into loan assessments to better prepare lenders and homeowners for weather-related disasters.</p>
