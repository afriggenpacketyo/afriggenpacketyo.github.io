            <p>Technology stocks experienced a downturn, triggered by a 6% decrease in Nvidia's value, as the chipmaking sector voiced concerns that President Trump's extensive tariff proposals could negatively impact demand and growth. Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion charge linked to exporting its H20 graphics processing units to China and other nations, citing government licensing requirements for chip shipments to these destinations. AMD also projects an $800 million loss due to recent export restrictions on its MI308 products, which were designed for China during the Biden administration to meet U.S. export restrictions, highlighting the potential financial strain on the industry.</p>

            <p>Riley Gaines cautioned California, Minnesota, and other states regarding Title IX compliance, coinciding with Attorney General Pam Bondi's lawsuit against Maine for non-compliance. Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer and advocate for fairness in women's sports, emphasized that states failing to adhere to federal law cannot benefit from it, particularly concerning federal funding. Bondi's lawsuit challenges Maine's trans-inclusion policies, advocating for the return of titles to female athletes allegedly impacted by transgender athletes' participation. The debate has sparked heated reactions, with some lawmakers comparing bans on biological males in women's sports to practices employed by Nazi Germany, highlighting the complexities of balancing inclusivity and fairness.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to investigate the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported from the U.S. and currently imprisoned. Van Hollen is seeking to meet with President Nayib Bukele and visit Abrego Garcia to ensure his well-being and advocate for his return to the United States. ICE admitted that Abrego Garcia's deportation was due to an "administrative error," despite initially claiming he had gang ties, which his attorneys deny, arguing the only evidence was a confidential witness and Abrego Garcia wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie when he was first arrested. The Supreme Court previously ruled that Abrego Garcia's deportation was illegal, yet El Salvador's president has refused to return him, citing his alleged ties to MS-13.</p>

            <p>President Trump is reportedly exploring a proposal to detain U.S. citizens and incarcerate them in prisons in El Salvador, drawing widespread condemnation from legal scholars who deem it unconstitutional. The proposal, which has been discussed since Trump took office, involves sending U.S. citizens, including "homegrown criminals," to El Salvador's maximum-security prisons. Critics argue that this move would violate civil liberties and due process, particularly given concerns about inhumane conditions in Salvadoran prisons. While Trump's administration is studying the legal feasibility of the plan, legal experts warn it could lead to the arbitrary detention and deportation of U.S. citizens without judicial oversight.</p>

The Frankland separation center is now a crime scene under counter-terrorism investigation to determine if other inmates knew about the attack in advance. Martin Hibbert, a survivor of the 2017 bombing, criticized Abedi's access to kitchen facilities and expressed outrage at the perceived disrespect to survivors, prompting a full, independent review into the incident.</p>

            <p>Negotiations to end the Birmingham bin strike have collapsed, with the Unite union seeking a written guarantee of promises made by the council regarding workers' pay. The strike, ongoing for over five weeks, centers on the council's plans to remove the Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) role and concerns about bin lorry drivers' pay. The union claims drivers' pay could decrease from £40,000 to £32,000, and WRCO workers are not receiving adequate compensation for potential pay cuts. Council leader John Cotton expressed mystification, stating the council has been clear that "nobody needs to lose out," but the union insists on a written agreement to ensure these promises are upheld.</p>

However, Enfield Council disputes this, stating that a recent inspection deemed the tree healthy and that M&B did not consult them as the landowner.

San Jose, San Francisco, and Boston are among the most challenging locations, primarily due to high housing and transportation costs.

            <p>Promoter Eddie Hearn believes a fight between Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua could be agreed upon through a simple social media exchange between the fighters. Fury, who recently retired, and Joshua, who last fought in September, are both former heavyweight world champions. Hearn suggests that the fight could be arranged quickly if both fighters express interest. He notes that both fighters are still in their prime, making a potential super-fight highly anticipated.</p>

            <p>Heineken, which initially downplayed the potential impact of tariffs, is now expressing concerns about disruptions to its business due to new U.S. tariffs. The Dutch brewer indicated that tariffs, particularly those targeting canned beer, could force it to adjust spending and investments. While Heineken reported first-quarter revenue growth that beat analysts' expectations, its beer sales fell 2.1% in the first quarter. CEO Dolf van den Brink cited ongoing risks from inflation, weak consumer sentiment, and currency fluctuations, in addition to the uncertainty surrounding global tariffs.</p>

            <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has warned that the outlook for global trade has "deteriorated sharply" due to the surge in tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The volume of world merchandise trade is now expected to decline by 0.2% in 2025, a significant drop from previous forecasts. The WTO cited "severe downside risks," including the application of "reciprocal" tariffs and a broader spillover of policy uncertainty. The decline is anticipated to be particularly steep in North America, with exports forecasted to drop by 12.6% this year.</p>

The U.S. has been underbuilding since the 2007 housing crisis, leading to a supply gap and driving up demand for McMansions, particularly in suburban areas. Low housing inventory and inflated construction costs have made McMansions an appealing option for first-time homebuyers seeking spacious and affordable housing.</p>
