          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party won the Canadian election, prompting discussions about the country's future direction, especially regarding its relationship with the United States. Carney vowed to stand up to the US, particularly against President Trump's policies, which he views as attempts to undermine Canada's sovereignty. The Liberals, however, may fall short of a majority, requiring them to collaborate with other parties to govern effectively. Priorities for Carney include navigating the relationship with the US and securing Canada's economy in the face of potential tariff headwinds, including tax cuts for lower and middle-class Canadians.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of homes are at risk of losing hot water or heating due to the impending switch-off of old Radio Teleswitching System (RTS) electricity meters. Energy companies face challenges in replacing all RTS meters with smart meters before the June 30 deadline. Campaigners estimate that over 300,000 households could experience heating disruptions, particularly affecting vulnerable customers. The government urges the industry to accelerate replacements, while some customers express distrust of smart meters, creating additional hurdles in the transition.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 19:06:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying tariffs for carmakers, aiming to alleviate some of the economic pressure caused by the levies. The changes remove tariffs on steel and aluminum for carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports and provide tariff relief for imported components, phased out over two years. However, the 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains in place, still raising prices for new and used cars. General Motors abandoned its profit growth forecast due to the uncertainty created by Trump's trade policies, and the administration claims the changes will help reduce the industry's reliance on foreign manufacturing and encourage domestic production.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol had her eyesight saved by a metagenomics test that identified a rare bacterial infection plaguing her for five years. Ellie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and standard tests were inconclusive. The metagenomics analysis diagnosed a rare strain of leptospirosis, likely contracted while swimming in the Amazon river in 2018. Antibiotics successfully treated the infection, and Ellie's vision improved, highlighting the potential of metagenomics as a game-changing diagnostic tool for identifying elusive infections.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced plans to end the Women, Peace and Security program at the Defense Department, labeling it a "woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative." The program, signed into law by President Trump in 2017, aimed to promote women's participation in peacebuilding and protect their human rights. Hegseth stated the department would comply with minimum legal requirements but would seek to terminate the program during the next budget cycle. The decision has drawn criticism from Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who emphasized the importance of women's involvement in peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Hall of Famer Cris Carter critiqued Shedeur Sanders' decision-making during the NFL Draft process, suggesting Sanders sacrificed millions due to his handling of the situation. Carter stated that Sanders and his family may have overestimated his evaluation and made missteps by narrowing the teams he would go to and not working out at the Combine. Carter pushed back against the idea of league collusion, asserting that Sanders and his family "overplayed their hand." Carter admitted Sanders had first-round qualities but also pointed out physical limitations, ultimately concluding Sanders' entitled attitude negatively impacted his draft position.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration dismissed over 400 scientists and experts working on the latest National Climate Assessment report, raising concerns about the integrity and direction of future climate assessments. Scientists fear the administration might attempt to shut down the effort or enlist authors who would undermine climate science. The report, mandated by Congress, details the latest science on climate change and progress in addressing global warming, and its absence could leave the country unprepared for worsening climate-related disasters. Critics suggest the move prioritizes fossil fuel interests over public well-being.</p>

          <p>A new report challenges the narrative that US stock markets always outperform European ones, suggesting that the grass is not always greener for European companies that move their primary listings to the US. The analysis reveals that 70% of European companies that have moved to the US are trading below their listing price, and fewer than a fifth have beaten the S&P 500. While some companies may benefit from the move, the report indicates that the valuation premium on US markets does not always translate to individual companies or sectors, and the march of private equity still feels like the bigger threat to stock markets.</p>

Researchers warn that the country is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles due to declining vaccination rates and misinformation. The fight against rising measles cases is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination and confusing statements on unproven treatments.</p>

          <p>A new study links phthalates, commonly found in plastics, to 350,000 heart disease deaths globally in 2018, but experts caution that the data come with caveats. The study estimates that 13 percent of cardiovascular deaths among 55- to 64-year-olds worldwide could be attributed to phthalates. While experts agree that phthalates are harmful, they noted that the study relied on complex statistical modeling and assumptions that make it difficult to determine the exact number of deaths linked to the chemicals.

The administration said it wanted to help automakers during this little transition, but it is unclear how an automaker would get such a reimbursement.</p>
