          <h2>UK Conservative Leader Proposes Banning NHS Doctors from Striking</h2>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced that her party would ban all NHS doctors from taking strike action if it returns to power. The proposal would place doctors under the same legal restrictions as police and military personnel, who are prohibited from striking. The move comes amid an ongoing five-day strike by resident doctors over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) criticized the proposal as a "desperate intervention," defending industrial action as a fundamental right and a last resort for doctors whose pay has declined in real terms.</p>

          <p>A significant fire has broken out in the West Midlands, involving four factory units and 20 tonnes of tyres on Great Bridge Street near Tipton. More than 70 firefighters and 17 fire engines were dispatched to tackle the blaze, which sent a large plume of smoke visible for miles. Several nearby homes were evacuated as a precautionary measure due to the scale of the fire and concerns over a partial structural collapse. No casualties have been reported, and residents have been advised to keep windows and doors closed.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched new direct passenger flights between Moscow and Pyongyang, marking another step in the strengthening relationship between the two nations. The first flight, operated by a private Russian carrier, was scheduled for Sunday, representing the first direct air link between the capitals since the mid-1990s. This development follows the reopening of a direct train connection in June. The increased diplomatic and economic ties come as Western nations accuse North Korea of supplying Russia with military aid for its war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>In an interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot described the situation in Gaza as an "appalling" catastrophe and called for an immediate ceasefire and massive, unhindered humanitarian access. He detailed France's diplomatic efforts, including its decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the UN, aimed at restarting a political process for a two-state solution. Barrot also addressed European expectations for Israel, such as halting the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's operations and ceasing new settlement projects. He asserted these actions are complementary to U.S. efforts to bring long-term peace and stability to the region.</p>

The article notes that Colbert's show, despite being the highest-rated in its time slot, operated at a significant loss.

          <p>A growing cybercrime trend known as "quishing" involves tricking people into scanning malicious QR codes, which have become ubiquitous in daily life. Hackers place fake QR code stickers on things like parking meters or bills, leading unsuspecting users to fraudulent websites that steal personal information or install malware. As traditional email phishing becomes more protected, criminals are increasingly turning to this low-effort, high-return tactic. A recent study found that 26% of all malicious links are now sent via QR codes, prompting warnings from the FTC and cybersecurity firms.</p>

          <p>BBC International Editor Jeremy Bowen analyzes Israel's recent announcement of aid airdrops and tactical pauses in Gaza as a response to growing international condemnation over starvation. The article suggests these measures are likely a gesture to horrified allies rather than a fundamental policy shift, as Israel's claims of not restricting aid are widely disputed. It highlights the UN's refusal to cooperate with the new, militarized 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation' distribution system, which has been linked to over a thousand Palestinian deaths. The analysis concludes that airdrops are an inefficient last resort and only a full ceasefire can resolve the crisis.</p>

          <p>A financial columnist analyzes the newly proposed 'Trump IRA,' a savings account allowing parents to contribute up to $5,000 annually for children under 18, with a one-time $1,000 government contribution for those born in a specific window. While acknowledging the free government money is a benefit, the article argues that other strategies like 529 education accounts, custodial Roth IRAs, and whole life insurance policies offer more significant long-term advantages. The piece suggests the Trump IRA is more of a political giveaway than a robust savings tool for a child's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian authorities reported that Ukrainian drones targeted St. Petersburg on Sunday, causing the city's airport to close for five hours and injuring one person. The attack occurred as President Vladimir Putin was in the city to mark Russia's Navy Day. The traditional large-scale naval parade was canceled this year due to security concerns, with Putin instead observing drills remotely from the naval headquarters. The Russian Defence Ministry claimed to have downed a total of 291 Ukrainian drones across the country during the day's attacks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies on the four-day workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness comes not just from more free time, but also from feeling more effective at work. Lead researcher Juliet Schor explains that when faced with less time, workers and teams innovate to eliminate busywork and streamline processes, leading to a sense of accomplishment. This increased productivity and feeling of being on top of one's work has a significant positive impact on overall well-being. The shift also fosters a new sense of trust and team spirit between employees and management.</p>

          <p>Charities are warning that almost £275 million in government-allocated Child Trust Funds (CTFs) designated for disadvantaged young people in the UK are currently unclaimed. These tax-free savings accounts were set up for children born between 2002 and 2011, with initial government contributions. The Share Foundation, a charity that helps locate these funds, reports that over £400 million is dormant in total, with more than half belonging to young adults from low-income backgrounds. The charity is calling for an automatic release mechanism to ensure the funds reach their intended recipients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France's long-standing influence in its former African colonies, known as "Françafrique," is collapsing as countries in the Sahel region increasingly reject its political and military presence. This shift is forcing French companies, which once enjoyed preferential treatment, to adapt to a new reality where competitors like China are dominant. The article details how corporations in sectors like nuclear energy and infrastructure are facing challenges, such as losing mining licenses in Niger. In response, French businesses are exploring new strategies, including forming local partnerships and shifting focus to non-French-speaking African nations.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, has met with the U.S. Deputy Attorney General, sparking speculation about what she might reveal. The meetings come as the Trump administration faces pressure over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. This article analyzes the situation, questioning whether Maxwell can be believed, given her previous perjury charges, and what she could offer authorities at this stage. Experts suggest that while she has intimate knowledge of Epstein's operations, any potential testimony would require significant verification and may be a political maneuver rather than a genuine effort at transparency.</p>

          <p>This article presents a deep analysis of Donald Trump's worldview, arguing it is defined by "egonomics," an intimate link between his narcissism and an insatiable desire for money. The author posits that for Trump, dealmaking is not about market efficiency but about personal, adversarial contests that feed his brand and ego, regardless of the deal's ultimate success. This perspective is applied to his use of tariffs, which are framed not as sound economic policy but as a tool to dominate a global prestige economy. The piece concludes that avarice is Trump's core driver, with cryptocurrency being his latest vehicle for self-enrichment.</p>
