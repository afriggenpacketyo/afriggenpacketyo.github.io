          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 18:05:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Realtor.com report reveals a notable increase in homesellers withdrawing their properties from the market without a sale, rather than reducing asking prices. Delistings have surged by 38% since the beginning of 2025 and 48% year-over-year, indicating widespread frustration among sellers. This phenomenon is creating a deadlock in the housing market, as many homeowners are content with their current affordable mortgage rates and are reluctant to accept lower offers. This article highlights that sellers' pricing expectations have been slow to adjust to the cooling market, particularly in areas like Miami where price reductions are less common.</p>

          <p>Jermaine Mathews, identified by prosecutors as instigating the viral Cincinnati beatdown, has been indicted on federal drug conspiracy charges, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The 39-year-old is accused of conspiring to distribute over 40 grams of fentanyl and operating a property for narcotics trafficking. Mathews was already out on a $100,000 bond for aggravated riot and assault charges related to the July 26 downtown incident. This article notes that one of the alleged victims, Alex Tchervinski, has also been charged with disorderly conduct for slapping an assailant while defending himself and others.</p>

          <p>Australian Open champion Madison Keys experienced a shocking first-round exit at the US Open, attributing her defeat to "nerves" that "got the better of me for the first time in a while." The sixth seed made 89 unforced errors and 14 double faults in her 6-7 (10-12) 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 loss to world number 82 Renata Zarazua of Mexico. Keys, who was a runner-up in New York in 2017, described feeling paralyzed by the pressure, which led to slow movement and poor decision-making on the court. This unexpected loss marks another Grand Slam disappointment for Keys following her French Open quarter-final appearance and a third-round Wimbledon exit.</p>

This article explores why human elements remain central to decision-making and combat operations, even as autonomous weapons offer advantages like reduced casualties. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for accelerated drone adoption, and the US has envisioned drone swarms for Taiwan's defense. The ongoing investment signifies a belief that human judgment and presence are indispensable in complex warfare scenarios, ensuring crewed systems' continued strategic importance.</p>

          <p>A late-arriving monsoonal storm system has unleashed widespread wild weather across the US West, causing significant disruptions and hazards. The Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert was upended by a ferocious dust storm with winds up to 50 mph, forcing event closures and leading to several reported injuries. Meanwhile, Yosemite National Park experienced rare August rainfall and minor flooding, while numerous lightning strikes ignited several forest fires across California's interior mountains, including the rapidly growing 4,500-acre Garnet fire in the Sierra National Forest. Forecasters anticipate the humid, monsoonal pattern will continue for several more days, maintaining the threat of thunderstorms, dry lightning, and potential flooding, particularly in burn scar areas, as dry vegetation remains highly susceptible to ignition.</p>

          <p>Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, the long-standing leader of the Sinaloa cartel, has pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn federal court to charges including money laundering and drug trafficking, admitting to leading a criminal enterprise for over four decades. Zambada, 75, acknowledged promoting corruption in Mexico by bribing police, military commanders, and politicians to operate freely, and ordering killings that resulted in innocent deaths. Despite his lawyer's denial of cooperation, Zambada's guilty plea and his family's history of assisting US authorities fuel intense speculation that he could expose high-level corruption within the Mexican government and military. This article highlights that former DEA officials believe Zambada possesses unparalleled knowledge of decades of illicit payoffs, making his potential cooperation a significant development in US-Mexico relations.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic Daily posits that Donald Trump's second term is characterized by a significant expansion of federal power, which the article labels "right-wing socialism." This approach includes the government acquiring a 10% stake in Intel, an action described as a "protection racket" following demands for the CEO's resignation. Trump is also criticized for threatening to federalize National Guard forces in cities, attempting to control state election processes by opposing mail-in ballots, and intervening in private institutions like media and universities. The article argues that while Trump may reduce federal headcount, he simultaneously expands the government's intrusive role into new, unprecedented areas, thereby challenging long-held conservative ideals of limited government.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's vocal opposition to electric vehicles (EVs) and his administration's efforts to roll back incentives, Ford is making a significant $5 billion investment in a new, affordable EV platform. The company plans to launch a four-door pickup truck priced around $30,000 by 2027, aiming to attract a broader market segment. This article highlights that while EV sales in the US have seen a recent slowdown and federal tax credits are set to expire, the global market, especially in China, is rapidly shifting towards electrification. Ford's ambitious bet on a lower-priced EV truck suggests that automakers anticipate the EV transition will continue to accelerate globally, driven by competitive pricing and evolving market demands, irrespective of domestic political headwinds.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the Department of Justice intends to sue California over Governor Gavin Newsom's efforts to redraw the state's congressional map to favor Democrats. This declaration follows Trump's public praise for Texas Republican legislators, who recently passed a new map designed to give the GOP an advantage in five additional U.S. House races. Governor Newsom swiftly responded to Trump's threat with "BRING IT." This article underscores the escalating political and legal battle over redistricting, with the Trump administration challenging California's partisan mapping while openly supporting similar gerrymandering efforts by Republicans in Texas, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued executive actions threatening to cut federal aid to cities and counties that have adopted cashless bail policies, arguing these reforms contribute to a rise in crime. One order specifically targets Washington D.C., while another directs the Justice Department to compile a list of jurisdictions that have "substantially eliminated cash bail" for crimes posing public safety threats, making them eligible for federal funding cuts. Trump claimed cashless bail initiated "big crime" and was discriminatory, despite studies indicating no correlation between cashless bail and increased crime rates. This article highlights the administration's controversial efforts to pressure local governments to reverse these reforms, potentially placing Democratic-led jurisdictions like Los Angeles County under financial strain.</p>

Following the announcement, KDP's stock declined by 11%, while JDE Peet's shares rose by 15%. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2026, will precede KDP's plan to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies, effectively reversing its 2018 merger.
