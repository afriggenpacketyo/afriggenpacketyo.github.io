        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's first-quarter earnings report revealed a significant drop in automotive revenue, plummeting 20% year-over-year, contributing to a miss on both top and bottom lines. The company cited factory updates for the Model Y and lower average selling prices as factors. Simultaneously, CEO Elon Musk has been heavily involved in the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal government, raising concerns among investors about his focus on Tesla. The company refrained from promising growth this year, adding to investor unease amidst trade policy uncertainties and widespread protests related to Musk's political activities.

          <h2>Student Loan Repayments Could Slow Economic Growth, Experts Warn</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are expressing concern that the Trump administration's resumption of collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers could negatively impact the economy. The move, affecting roughly 5 million borrowers, involves wage garnishment, reducing consumer spending and potentially slowing economic activity. While the impact may be smaller than factors like tariffs, it could exacerbate a potential recession. The policy clarifies loan payment expectations after years of uncertainty, though the timing coincides with souring consumer sentiment and slowing growth.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly lowered its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, primarily due to the negative impact of trade tariffs and weakening consumer confidence. The IMF's chief economist noted that recession odds have increased to 40%. The revised forecast also considers stubborn price dynamics in the services sector and a recent uptick in core goods prices due to tariffs. The IMF also revised its expectations for headline inflation for advanced economies, which include the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada, to 2.5% for 2025, reflecting an increase of 0.4 percentage point from January's projection.</p>

          <p>As Tesla's sales and profits decline, investors are questioning Elon Musk's focus on his role within the Trump administration, specifically his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Analysts suggest that Musk's association with DOGE could permanently reduce demand for Tesla vehicles. Investors are keen to hear updates on Tesla's strategic initiatives, including a cheaper Model Y version and a driverless robotaxi service.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel, who previously criticized his predecessor for using government jets for personal travel, is now facing questions about his own frequent use of the aircraft. Concerns have arisen regarding potential misuse of taxpayer funds and the impact on the availability of jets for operational needs. Some bureau veterans worry that Patel's actions set a poor leadership example. The FBI declined to comment on travel arrangements for security purposes, stating that all ethical guidelines are followed rigorously.</p>
