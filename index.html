          <p>Artificial intelligence data center provider CoreWeave has announced its intention to sell $1.5 billion in bonds, causing its stock to rise. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, will be used for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a previous $2 billion debt offering in May that was heavily oversubscribed and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, the company's CEO has expressed confidence in meeting strong client demand.</p>

          <p>Tennessee Titans quarterback Will Levis will be sidelined for the entire 2025 NFL season after deciding to undergo surgery on his right shoulder. The team announced its support for his decision, emphasizing a focus on his long-term health and expressing confidence in his full recovery. Levis had been dealing with discomfort from an injury sustained last year, which was re-aggravated during the 2024 season. His absence positions rookie quarterback Cam Ward, the No. 1 pick in the 2025 draft, as the likely starter for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, as evidenced by Euro 2025's success, Eastern European nations have struggled to keep pace. Experts suggest a combination of historical, cultural, and financial factors contribute to this disparity, including a lack of investment and societal norms that have traditionally viewed football as a men's sport. While UEFA initiatives are beginning to increase budgets and visibility, the region has been slow to develop the necessary infrastructure and professional pathways for female players. However, there is hope that major tournaments will inspire change and investment in the region's talent pool.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Advise on Common Mistakes to Avoid When a CD Matures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As high-rate certificates of deposit (CDs) from the past two years begin to mature, financial experts warn savers against common missteps. One major mistake is allowing a CD to auto-renew at a potentially much lower interest rate without first shopping around for better offers. Experts also caution against chasing the highest rate without considering the term length and your own liquidity needs. Instead of letting funds sit in a low-yield regular savings account, savers should reassess their financial goals and consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts, which offer competitive rates with more flexibility.

          <p>Automaker Stellantis has issued a warning, estimating a net loss of 2.3 billion euros ($2.68 billion) for the first half of 2025. The company, which produces Jeep and Ram vehicles, attributes the anticipated loss to significant charges and the impact of U.S. tariffs. These charges include approximately 3.3 billion euros in pre-tax costs related to program cancellations, platform impairments, and restructuring efforts. The projection was provided as the company has suspended its formal financial guidance, adding to the challenges faced by its new CEO, Antonio Filosa. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has set a new national record for uranium exploration, discovering a significant deposit at a depth previously unreached in the country. The discovery was of a sandstone-type uranium deposit, which is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine compared to other types of reserves. This achievement highlights China's advancing capabilities in resource exploration. The nation, which is heavily reliant on uranium imports to fuel its nuclear power and weapons programs, produced 1,700 tonnes and imported 13,000 tonnes last year.</p>

          <p>According to leadership expert Jennifer Schielke, bosses who use excessive flattery to be liked by their employees are making a mistake. She argues that this tactic often stems from insecurity and can be perceived as manipulative and disingenuous, undermining a leader's credibility. Instead of empty compliments, leaders should focus on building authentic connections and demonstrating value through actions. This includes genuinely listening to employee perspectives, investing in their growth, and creating a positive workplace culture through meaningful team-building and supportive policies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the common parental mistake of turning chores into a source of conflict rather than a developmental opportunity. Researchers and psychologists suggest that very young children are often intrinsically motivated to help with household tasks, but parents can stifle this enthusiasm by prioritizing efficiency or micromanaging their efforts. To foster responsibility and valuable skills, parents should invite children to participate in tasks collaboratively rather than issuing demands. This approach helps integrate children into the family, builds their sense of competence, and avoids the pitfalls of bribes or punishments.</p>
