          <p>UK Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch has announced the Conservative party's intention to withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election. This policy shift follows a party-led legal review which concluded that the ECHR obstructs key government objectives, particularly regarding immigration reform and the protection of military veterans from legal action. The move is seen as a response to pressure from Reform UK and has drawn criticism from Labour and legal experts, who warn of significant political and legal consequences, including potential breaches of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <p>Police unions in several major U.S. cities, including Charlotte, Milwaukee, and Washington, D.C., have expressed support for or directly requested the deployment of federal law enforcement to combat rising violent crime rates. This push for federal intervention has been met with significant resistance from local Democratic leaders and city officials, who argue that such measures are unnecessary, potentially illegal, and fail to address the root causes of violence. While some union leaders have backtracked following the political pushback, others maintain that federal assistance has been effective where implemented.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scholars and cultural analysts in China are highlighting the growing importance of speculative fiction as a tool for national soft power, aiming to shape global narratives about the future. At a recent conference at Nanjing University, experts noted that the genre has historically been dominated by Western, often pessimistic, perspectives rooted in capitalist ideologies. By fostering its own science fiction, China seeks to present alternative, potentially more optimistic, visions of the future that reflect its cultural and political values. This represents a strategic effort to influence international discourse and challenge Euro-American dominance in imagining what lies ahead.</p>

          <p>Dr. Debra Houry, the former chief medical officer of the CDC, has sharply criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership, describing his tenure as a "hostile takeover" of the agency. In testimony and interviews, Houry stated that Kennedy avoided meetings with top health experts, even during serious disease outbreaks like measles, while promoting misinformation and pushing for scientifically unsupported changes to childhood immunization schedules. Her account alleges a deliberate dismantling of scientific expertise within the nation's public health institutions, raising concerns about the government's ability to respond to future crises.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination, many university students, particularly those from marginalized communities, are voicing concern over his sudden portrayal as a national hero. They critique his past rhetoric as hateful and worry that his death is being used to unjustly blame minority groups and stifle free speech on campuses.

          <p>Ahti Heinla, co-founder of Skype, is now leading Starship Technologies, a company deploying autonomous delivery robots in cities across the UK and Europe. Heinla asserts that the technology has matured to the point where robotic delivery is not only viable but also profitable and cheaper than human couriers, particularly in less dense areas. While facing competition and regulatory hurdles that vary by country, Starship has already completed over 8 million deliveries. Heinla argues that these robots will address the growing demand for delivery services without displacing human workers, who can focus on more complex jobs.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge in Massachusetts, William Young, delivered a powerful condemnation of the Trump administration's actions against non-citizen residents, ruling that it violated their First Amendment rights by targeting them for deportation based on their pro-Palestinian speech. In a highly personal and unusually direct opinion, the judge accused the president of ignoring the Constitution, engaging in "bullying," and attempting to silence dissent. The ruling affirms that freedom of speech protections apply equally to citizens and non-citizens, framing the administration's actions as a threat to fundamental American democratic values.</p>

          <p>The creation of "Tilly Norwood," a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar marketed as a synthetic actress, has sparked alarm and debate within the entertainment industry. While the UK-based company behind the avatar promotes it as the future of "synthetic talent," actors' unions like SAG-AFTRA and Equity have condemned the technology as a threat to human creativity and employment. Major talent agencies have so far publicly stated they will not represent AI clients, signaling resistance from established Hollywood players.

The cryptocurrency climbed approximately 12% this week, with investors reportedly treating it as a safe-haven asset to hedge against economic uncertainty and political instability in the United States. Analysts note that this behavior marks a shift from previous shutdowns, suggesting Bitcoin's growing role as a store of value during times of governmental fiscal risk.

          <p>Chinese director Lou Ye's new movie, "An Unfinished Film," has received international acclaim for its courageous, semi-documentary portrayal of a film crew quarantined near Wuhan during the initial COVID-19 lockdown. The film is praised for capturing the initial chaos and the subsequent anti-lockdown protests, breaking through China's official censorship. However, this article argues that while the film is an important acknowledgment of a suppressed national trauma, it conspicuously avoids depicting the mass deaths that followed the abrupt end of the "zero COVID" policy. This omission reflects a broader societal reticence to confront the full, painful scope of the pandemic's final chapter.</p>

This discovery of a "thermal asymmetry" provides new data to help scientists understand the long-observed differences in topography and volcanic activity between the moon's two faces.

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state-backed insurer for homeowners unable to get coverage elsewhere, is seeking an average rate hike of 35.8% following an estimated $4 billion in losses from January's wildfires. This request, which requires approval from the state's insurance commissioner, reflects the growing financial strain on the insurer as private companies retreat from high-risk areas. The proposed increase is controversial, coming amid lawsuits and consumer complaints accusing the FAIR Plan of improperly handling smoke damage claims. If approved, it would represent the plan's largest rate increase in years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and positive signals from Hamas, Israeli forces have reportedly continued to carry out airstrikes and shelling across the Gaza Strip. According to Gaza's civil defense, it was a "very violent night," with dozens of attacks hitting Gaza City and other areas, resulting in multiple fatalities. This ongoing military action complicates the diplomatic push for a ceasefire, even as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another key militant group, endorsed Hamas's conditional acceptance of the plan. The Israeli military has stated it is preparing for the plan's first phase but has not confirmed a halt to its operations.</p>

Both Starmer and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood argued that the protests would stoke tensions and divert police resources needed to protect the Jewish community. While police leaders echoed concerns about stretched resources, protest organizers have refused to cancel, stating that "cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win" and that they will demonstrate respect for the victims.</p>

While the staff can still process campaign finance disclosures, the lack of an enforcement body raises concerns about accountability for the billions of dollars spent in U.S. elections.

          <p>A lifelong Manchester United supporter has seen the cost of his season ticket double after being forced to relocate from a seat he held for over 40 years. The fan, Michael Carney, was moved along with other supporters to make way for a new, premium corporate seating area, a change implemented as part of the club's efforts to increase revenue and cut financial losses. He describes his new seat as being of lower quality and expresses a feeling of disconnect from the club, stating that the focus on business and money has eroded its soul.

A draft design shows Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him after his 2024 assassination attempt on the other, inscribed with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." The proposal is being explored under a 2020 law allowing for special coin designs for the semiquincentennial. However, the idea faces potential legal hurdles, as federal law generally prohibits living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, though exceptions can be made by Congress.</p>

          <p>A study by Italian researchers proposes a surprising origin for the iconic bronze Lion of St. Mark in Venice, suggesting it may have been a tomb guardian statue from China's Tang dynasty (618–907). The researchers cite stylistic similarities to mythical Chinese beasts and lead isotope analysis that matches ore from China's Yangtze River basin. They speculate the massive statue could have been transported to Venice by the family of Marco Polo before being altered to become a symbol of the Venetian Republic. This theory, which challenges the statue's long-held European origins, is being debated by some scholars in China.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is grappling with new EU and UK mandates requiring a percentage of jet fuel to be sustainable (SAF), but there are significant doubts about whether production can meet future targets. While some major airlines are investing in SAF, others, like Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, dismiss the 2050 net-zero goal as unattainable due to insufficient supply. The article highlights a growing divide between airlines, the high cost of SAF, and the challenges in scaling up production, especially for next-generation fuels made from waste. Political and economic factors, including shifting government incentives, are adding to the uncertainty surrounding aviation's path to decarbonization.</p>
