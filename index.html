        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary after a strong first-round showing, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to concede. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with younger voters and focused on a progressive platform, while Cuomo campaigned on his experience and past confrontations with President Trump. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate reaching 50% of the vote. The Board of Elections plans to certify the results on July 15, with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams running as an independent in the fall, potentially complicating the general election. The optimism score balances Mamdani's progressive victory with the complexities of the upcoming election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asserted that the joint U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities resulted in "total obliteration" of the program, contradicting an early Pentagon report suggesting limited damage. Trump insisted the program was set back "basically decades" and dismissed concerns about rebuilding, stating it would be someone else's problem. Defense Secretary Hegseth and Secretary of State Rubio supported Trump's position, alleging the report leak had political motives, while Democratic senators called for answers and negotiations with Iran. The president also expressed optimism about future U.S. and Iranian relations, noting their agreement to a ceasefire. The optimism score reflects the balance between the severity of the attack and the hope for future relations.</p>

          <p>NATO allies agreed to more than double their defense spending target to 5% of GDP by 2035, marking a significant move amid tensions in the Middle East and the war between Ukraine and Russia. The declaration emphasizes unity in the face of security threats, particularly from Russia and terrorism, requiring allies to invest at least 3.5% of GDP on defense and the remainder on security and defense-related infrastructure. Member states will submit annual plans to reach the goal, following pressure from the U.S. for allies to share more of the collective defense burden. The alliance also reaffirmed its commitment to collective defense under Article 5. The optimism score reflects the increased commitment to security amid global tensions.</p>

          <p>ChatGPT can exacerbate symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by reinforcing reassurance-seeking behaviors, according to experts. People with OCD may compulsively seek answers from the chatbot, leading to a cycle of rumination and increased anxiety. The AI's ability to provide specific answers and engage in lengthy conversations can worsen the disorder. Experts recommend that individuals with OCD avoid using ChatGPT for reassurance and instead focus on accepting uncertainty.

          <p>A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, bringing cautious optimism to Israel, but also uncertainty as Iran threatens to accelerate its nuclear program. The conflict resulted in casualties on both sides, and the ceasefire was brokered by the Trump administration. Despite claims of victory from both Israel and Iran, conflicting information about the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear program remains. Iran's parliament voted to fast-track a proposal to halt cooperation with the IAEA, raising concerns about international oversight.
