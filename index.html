        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog indicates that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, raising concerns internationally. As of May 17, Iran possessed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a nearly 50% increase since February. The IAEA warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, leading to serious proliferation concerns. In response, the White House urged Iran to accept its proposal for a nuclear deal, emphasizing that Iran must not obtain a nuclear bomb, while Israel called the report a clear warning sign that Iran intends to complete its nuclear weapons program. Optimism regarding the situation is low considering the potential for international conflict.</p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggesting that a "McMigraine Meal" (Coke and fries) can cure migraines is gaining traction, but experts caution against its efficacy. While some individuals report that the caffeine and sugar in Coke or the salt on fries may temporarily alleviate migraine symptoms, this is not a universal solution and can even be counterproductive. Neurologists emphasize that migraine is a complex neurological condition and that relying on fast food as a regular treatment is not advisable, as it can contain migraine triggers and lead to unhealthy dietary habits. The article highlights the need for further research into migraine treatments and the importance of consulting with healthcare professionals for personalized management strategies.</p>

After a local campaign, Coogler arranged for free screenings in Clarksdale, where residents had not been able to watch films locally since 2003. The film's success is anticipated to boost tourism and provide economic benefits to the town, while also celebrating its rich musical heritage.</p>

The move is part of a strategic defense review prompted by the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production.

          <p>Donald Trump's administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to redirect research funding and scrutinizing government contracts, citing concerns about antisemitism and a lack of conservative viewpoints. These measures are part of a broader effort to reshape universities in a more conservative-friendly image, leading to accusations of political bias and academic interference. While some view this as a necessary correction to liberal indoctrination on campuses, others fear it could undermine academic independence and diversity. The long-term impact depends on whether universities accommodate these demands or resist, as Harvard is currently attempting through legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain's (PSG) dominant 5-0 victory in the Champions League final marks a significant achievement for Qatar Sports Investments, but also raises questions about the ethics of state ownership in football. Despite years of heavy investment, PSG had previously fallen short of Champions League glory, but this win signifies a return on that investment. The victory also brings scrutiny to club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi's growing influence in European football. While PSG fans celebrate the victory, concerns linger about Qatar's human rights record and the potential for financial dominance to overshadow the sport's traditional values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for key public services. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact other unprotected areas, such as schools and the criminal justice system. With the government committed to increasing police numbers and capping bus fares, there are concerns that spending cuts will be necessary to balance the budget. The IFS emphasizes that the government's decision to front-load spending earlier in the term means that additional funding will now slow to a trickle.</p>

          <p>The UK's ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into effect, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. While shops can still sell rechargeable and refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which have been a key driver in the rise of youth vaping. Ministers predict the ban will significantly reduce youth vaping, but health experts say further regulation is needed. Retailers who breach the ban face fines, and similar bans have been implemented in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>Following a 5-0 defeat to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League final, Inter Milan may need to consider rebuilding their squad with younger players. The team's average age was significantly higher than PSG's, and fatigue was cited as a factor in their performance. While Inter has signed two players for next season, more additions are needed to compete at the highest level. Uncertainty surrounds the future of coach Simone Inzaghi, who has been linked to a Saudi club and did not commit to staying with Inter.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "Toxic Nation," produced by MAHA Films, focuses on four key issues: ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, herbicides and pesticides, and fluoride. The film aligns with the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, led by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The documentary claims that these factors contribute to chronic diseases, and features various voices in the health and wellness space. While the film aims to promote awareness and policy changes, some experts note that scientific consensus on the dangers and benefits of these substances is still evolving, and substantial budget cuts to HHS and the EPA may impede policy changes.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based scientist has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could potentially be exploited by eavesdroppers to compromise the satellite's quantum key distribution (QKD) system. Quantum communication relies on quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data, theoretically making it unhackable, but flaws in experimental implementation can create vulnerabilities. The researcher's analysis suggests that the distribution of quantum keys from Micius may not be secure.</p>
