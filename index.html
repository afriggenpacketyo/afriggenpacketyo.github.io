          <p>Richard Chamberlain, renowned for his roles in "Shogun" and "The Thorn Birds," passed away at age 90 due to complications from a stroke.  His partner described him as an amazing and loving soul, highlighting his extensive career in television, film, and theater, including a successful period as a recording artist. The article, from CBS News, presents a largely positive and celebratory tone, though a potential bias exists in focusing heavily on his positive accomplishments and downplaying any potential controversies throughout his life.</p>

          <p>British newspapers report on Prince Harry's resignation from Sentebale, a charity he co-founded, and the ensuing criticism from its chair.  The resignation, according to the Mirror, was due to Harry bringing a Netflix crew to a fundraising event. Other headlines cover President Trump's threats of tariffs on Russian oil and UK plans to combat people-smuggling. The BBC's summary presents a neutral overview of various news stories, though the selection of headlines could be interpreted as subtly biased towards highlighting negative aspects of Prince Harry's actions.</p>

          <p>David Marcus, in a Fox News opinion piece, argues that the replacement of "Anno Domini" (AD) with "Common Era" (CE) is a politically motivated attempt to erase Christianity from history. He suggests President Trump could mandate the use of AD in government-funded publications.  The article displays a clear conservative bias, framing the change as a "woke" agenda and ignoring potential arguments for neutrality in historical scholarship.  It is also strongly opinionated rather than presenting factual information.</p>

          <p>The construction of Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, England, is causing a housing crisis in the nearby town of Leiston. Landlords are reportedly evicting tenants and drastically increasing rents, exploiting the high demand for housing from construction workers.  The BBC News report highlights the struggles of local residents, presenting a sympathetic portrayal of their plight while also including perspectives from landlords and the council. However, there might be a subtle bias towards portraying landlords negatively, potentially overlooking the economic pressures they face.</p>
