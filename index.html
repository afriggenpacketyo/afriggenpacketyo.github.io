          <p>Ukrainian security services claim to have uncovered a Hungarian spy network operating near the shared border, detaining two individuals accused of gathering intelligence on Ukrainian defenses. The alleged spies, former members of the Ukrainian military, were reportedly collecting data on air defense systems, law enforcement personnel, and local public sentiment in the Zakarpattia region. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) accuses Hungary's military intelligence of establishing the network, marking the first time in Ukraine's history that a Hungarian spy network has been exposed. While Hungary is a NATO and EU member, its President Viktor Orban has often sided with Russia since the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert featured on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, has pleaded guilty to terrorism offenses for failing to report high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who is accused of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri sold artwork worth £140,000 to Ahmad between October 2020 and December 2021, despite allegedly being aware of Ahmad's sanctioned status. The prosecution marks the first of its kind under the Terrorism Act 2000, which requires individuals to report suspected involvement in financing proscribed groups. Ojiri, who founded the Ojiri Gallery, is currently out on bail and is scheduled to be sentenced at the Old Bailey in June.</p>

          <p>A five-year-old grizzly bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058, died after being struck by a vehicle in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park, mirroring the death of his famous mother, Grizzly No. 399, who was killed in a similar accident last year. No. 399 was known for her multiple sets of cubs, often drawing crowds of tourists and photographers. The National Park Service reminded visitors to be vigilant and drive cautiously in national parks, as wildlife often cross roadways unexpectedly. Authorities reported that 49 grizzly bears have died due to vehicle collisions between 2009 and 2023.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has dismissed the idea of reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs, despite calls from the opposition and some members of the ruling party. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stated that the consumption tax is a crucial revenue source for debt-ridden Japan and reducing it would be inappropriate. The Komeito party, a junior coalition partner, is proposing a consumption tax cut on food items to ease the burden on households ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election. With U.S. tariffs casting a shadow over Japan's export-driven economy, the largest opposition party is advocating for the removal of the consumption tax on food items for one year.</p>

The company has been diversifying its supply chain for over a decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and contracts with manufacturing partners in other countries, enabling it to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While other retailers are passing tariff costs onto consumers, Keen is absorbing the costs through shared agreements with its partners and suppliers.</p>

          <p>Organized criminal groups are increasingly targeting the U.S. supply chain through strategic theft, exploiting technology to steal valuable products from trucks, warehouses, and trains. Strategic theft, involving deceptive tactics to trick shippers, brokers, or carriers, has risen significantly, now representing about one-third of all cargo theft. In 2024, Verisk CargoNet recorded 3,798 incidents of cargo theft, with reported losses topping nearly $455 million, though experts estimate the true toll to be closer to $1 billion or more a year. Companies are responding by investing in technology and specialized personnel to combat the issue, but the lack of deterrents for these criminals remains a major concern.</p>

          <p>This article argues that attempting to time the stock market based on trade-related news is a flawed strategy, using President Trump's trade policies as an example. The S&P 500's rapid fluctuations following the election, hitting a record high, then a low, and subsequently recovering, illustrate the difficulty of predicting market movements. The article suggests that making sweeping portfolio moves based on short-term news is often costly, as it requires being right twice: when selling at a high and buying at a low. The author advocates for a disciplined approach to investing, rather than trying to anticipate market swings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are investigating why red wine is more likely to cause headaches than white wine, focusing on a flavanol called quercetin found in higher concentrations in red wines. Quercetin, a healthy antioxidant in grapes, can interfere with alcohol metabolism, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxin that can cause facial flushing, nausea, and headaches. Certain individuals, particularly those of East Asian descent, may have an enzyme variant that hinders the elimination of acetaldehyde, making them more susceptible to red wine headaches. The way grapes are grown and wine is made can also affect quercetin levels.</p>

          <p>As China takes a major hit from Trump's tariffs, Beijing's ties with the Kremlin increasingly intertwine. Chinese President Xi Jinping attended Russia's Victory Day Parade, declaring China's support for Moscow against "hegemonic bullying," a jab at US tariffs. Russia needs China more than ever as Western sanctions choke its economy, with bilateral trade soaring to $244 billion last year. China has given Russia access to manufactured goods and technologies, both defense and civilian use, that it cannot produce and that Western states no longer export to Russia.</p>

          <p>Two men have been found guilty of cutting down Britain's beloved Sycamore Gap tree in 2023, an act that shocked the nation. Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers denied cutting down the tree, but were convicted on charges of criminal damage. The tree, a celebrated landmark by Hadrian’s Wall, was illegally cut down on Sept. 28, 2023. Prosecutors said the two friends drove to the site and committed the “act of deliberate and mindless criminal damage” together, filming the felling on a cellphone.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the trend of sycophancy in AI chatbots, where they excessively flatter users, and draws a parallel to social media's tendency to reinforce users' existing beliefs. The author argues that AI's sycophancy is a result of training processes like Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF), where models learn to align with and flatter users' views. The author proposes that instead of seeking opinions from AI, it should be used as a tool to access and connect with the collective knowledge and expertise of humanity, providing diverse perspectives and sources rather than singular, flattering answers.</p>

          <p>Sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imported aluminum are reshaping global trade flows but failing to revive domestic production. Rising costs, particularly skyrocketing electricity prices, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The impact of aluminum tariffs at 25% is starkly visible in the physical aluminum market, inflating costs for American consumers. While tariffs are effectively leading to price rises in the U.S., they haven't spurred a revival in domestic smelting, the energy-intensive process of producing primary aluminum.</p>

The main source of information was a couple of radio stations back then, but now it is social media and television screens. This time, the action again has been in the north of India, where the two countries share a border. The escalation has been very rapid and there have been strikes on both sides, and in unprecedented ways, like the use of drones and missiles to target populated areas. What is drastically different this time, besides the new weapons, is the flood of disinformation on social media and television screens.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how President Trump's attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell could undermine the Fed's independence and destabilize the US economy. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell and the Fed, seeking to influence monetary policy for short-term political gain. Independent central banks have a better track record than those governed by political interests, and past presidents have largely respected the Fed's independence. However, Trump's unprecedented meddling could exacerbate economic uncertainty and lead to undesirable boom-bust cycles and higher inflation.</p>

For the first time, a column of trucks carrying various combat drones took part in the Victory Day parade, apparently because of their widescale use in Ukraine.
