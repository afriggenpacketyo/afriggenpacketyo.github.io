          <h2>Trump Administration Advances Seabed Mining Despite International Opposition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 20:00:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. government to aggressively pursue seabed mining, disregarding international treaties supported by most coastal nations. This executive order instructs NOAA to expedite mining permits in both U.S. and international waters, positioning the U.S. as a leader in seabed mineral exploration. The move is likely to provoke criticism from both allies and rivals, as it circumvents established international agreements that seek to regulate such activities in international waters. This action underscores the Trump administration's willingness to challenge international norms to secure resources.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has begun selling "Trump 2028" hats and T-shirts on its official retail website, fueling speculation about President Trump potentially seeking a third term in office. The U.S. Constitution's 22nd Amendment limits presidents to two terms, but Trump has repeatedly hinted at the possibility of running again in 2028. While the White House has not commented directly on the apparel, the sale raises legal and political questions about the president's intentions and the potential for challenging constitutional term limits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering a shift in U.S. policy regarding Crimea as part of negotiations to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This potential change would involve walking away from the 2018 Crimea Declaration, which pledged non-recognition of Russia's annexation of the peninsula until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored. While Trump had previously expressed openness to Russia's control over Crimea, his administration later reinforced the non-recognition policy. This shift signals a willingness to compromise on established positions to achieve a peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Alphabet executives have warned that President Trump's trade policies, particularly tariffs, are expected to create a "slight headwind" for the company's advertising business in 2025.

          <p>The U.S. Central Command asserts that a deadly blast near a UNESCO world heritage site in Yemen's capital was caused by a Houthi missile, not a U.S. airstrike.

The Pentagon's assessment is based on a review of local reporting, including videos documenting Arabic writing on missile fragments found at the site.

          <p>A massive Russian strike on Kyiv killed at least 12 people and injured dozens, marking the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital since last July. The attack occurred as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine appeared to stall, with President Zelenskyy cutting short his trip to South Africa in response. Russia claimed it was targeting Ukraine's defense industry, while Zelenskyy accused Russia of prolonging the conflict by refusing to surrender Crimea. Senior U.S. officials have warned that the Trump administration may abandon efforts to stop the war if the two sides do not compromise.</p>

The risk of shortages depends on the duration of the tariffs and the extent to which companies frontloaded inventory.

          <p>Health officials in Orange County have reported the discovery of a bat infected with rabies near Rancho Santa Margarita Lake.

Rabies is almost always fatal in humans once symptoms appear, making prompt medical attention crucial after potential exposure. Bats are the leading source of rabies transmission, and their bites often go unnoticed due to their small teeth.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office that was connected to the internet via an unsecured commercial line, also known as a "dirty line". This line was installed at Hegseth's request so he could use the Signal app on the personal computer, the sources said. A commercial internet line does not have any of the firewall protections that the Defense Department's unclassified system has, so that makes it potentially susceptible to being monitored particularly if sensitive information is being communicated.</p>
