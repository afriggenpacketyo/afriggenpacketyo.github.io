          <p>Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon delivered a speech on the Senate floor lasting more than 20 hours to protest the policies of the Trump administration. He criticized actions such as deportation efforts and the potential deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland, framing them as a threat to the U.S. Constitution. The marathon address, one of the longest in recent Senate history, was intended to draw national attention to what Merkley described as an erosion of democracy and an authoritarian grip on the nation.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli was joined on the campaign trail by Florida Representative Byron Donalds, a notable ally of former President Donald Trump. The move is seen as an effort to energize the MAGA base ahead of the election, as polls show a tightening race against Democratic opponent Rep. Mikee Sherrill. While Ciattarelli's campaign hopes to mobilize Republican voters who stayed home in previous elections, Democrats have criticized the association, framing it as an embrace of the party's most conservative fringe elements.</p>

          <p>Recent layoffs at several AI startups, including those following major investments or acquisitions by tech giants like Meta and HP, suggest a volatile trend for workers in the artificial intelligence sector. As large technology companies acquire smaller AI firms, they are increasingly streamlining operations by eliminating duplicate roles, prioritizing efficiency over preserving startup culture. This shift creates job instability for employees at AI startups, who now face greater risks despite the allure of high-growth opportunities, potentially altering how these smaller companies recruit and retain talent.</p>

          <p>Thames Valley Police have announced that no charges will be filed against four men arrested in September for projecting an image of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle. The incident occurred during the U.S. president's state visit to the United Kingdom. The men were initially arrested on suspicion of public nuisance and malicious communications, but authorities have concluded their investigation and will take no further action. The political campaign group Led By Donkeys claimed responsibility for the projection, calling the arrests a "ridiculous overreaction."</p>

While lower Fed rates could eventually trickle down, experts note that credit card rates are influenced by multiple factors and may not decrease significantly or quickly. Given that interest continues to compound at high rates, delaying action could be costly, making proactive debt relief strategies a critical consideration for many borrowers.

Conversely, opponents are more focused on state-level concerns, such as the potential for power to shift from rural areas to cities. The current lead for the "yes" vote reflects the state's strong Democratic leaning and the nationalization of this local issue.</p>

          <p>During a press conference, President Donald Trump suggested that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid would be "gone" under Democratic policies due to national bankruptcy, comments that have triggered widespread concern. Critics interpreted his remarks as a threat to cut these essential entitlement programs, which millions of Americans, including seniors and individuals with disabilities, rely on. The statements, made in the context of a government shutdown, have intensified public anxiety over the future of social safety nets and the potential consequences of the current political stalemate.</p>

This call for transparency follows revelations that the prince's deal with the Crown Estate involved large upfront payments in lieu of ongoing rent, an arrangement one former committee chair called a "rotten deal." The request highlights growing concerns about the secrecy surrounding royal finances and whether public assets like the Crown Estate are being managed in the best interest of the taxpayer.</p>

Des Cars, who had previously warned about the museum's obsolete equipment, tendered her resignation after the heist but it was refused, and she now plans to double the number of cameras.</p>

Now, Moscow is using similar tools, including cultural foundations and state-funded NGOs, to sanitize its image, consolidate authority in occupied territories like Ukraine, and build alliances, effectively weaponizing the very tactics it once condemned.</p>
