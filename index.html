        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing increased tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, experts believe Temu and Shein will remain competitive in the U.S. e-commerce market. These companies are adapting by onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses to mitigate tariff impacts, although this may reduce product variety on Temu. Shein is expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey and Mexico, potentially absorbing tariffs due to high margins in fast fashion. Experts also highlight that agile supply chains and small-batch production contribute to their success, allowing them to quickly adapt to consumer trends and remain price-competitive even with tariffs.

          <p>Overnight Ukrainian drone attacks forced the temporary closure of several airports in Moscow and other Russian cities. Russian authorities reported downing 19 drones in Moscow, with no casualties or damage, and additional drones in other regions. Ukraine has yet to comment on the attacks, which come days before Russia's Victory Day parade on May 9. The attacks highlight the ongoing conflict's reach and Ukraine's increasing strikes on key Russian infrastructure, as President Zelenskyy dismisses Putin's proposed ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A guest essay in the New York Times describes a catastrophic humanitarian emergency in Gaza, exacerbated by an Israeli blockade that has cut off aid and commercial supplies for over two months. With the World Food Program's stores depleted, two million Palestinians are surviving on minimal meals, and starvation indicators are rising. The author, Sean Carroll, accuses Israel of exploiting aid as a tool of war, violating international law, and creating conditions resembling "de facto internment." He calls for immediate resumption of aid, secure humanitarian corridors, and a political agreement ensuring Palestinian dignity and self-determination.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from receiving new federal grants, citing concerns over antisemitism and diversity policies. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated Harvard failed its "legal obligations," leading to the freeze of billions in research grants. This action follows similar measures against other universities amidst campus protests related to the Israeli-Gaza conflict. Harvard has vowed to fight what it calls "illegal government overreach," arguing the demands would impose improper control over the university, potentially stifling research and innovation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from GOP-led states seeking to limit telehealth access to mifepristone. While not directly addressing the core issue of abortion medication access, the Justice Department argues the states lack legal standing to sue. The lawsuit, initiated by Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri, seeks to reinstate restrictions on mifepristone access, including prohibiting telehealth prescriptions and requiring in-person visits. The DOJ contends the states are challenging FDA actions from 2016, exceeding the statute of limitations.</p>

The drills, ordered by the home ministry, will assess public readiness for conflict in 244 districts, including testing air raid sirens and instructing civilians on blackout procedures and evacuations.

          <p>A New York Times guest essay discusses President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials, which raises questions about China's readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan by 2027. The removal of senior officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force and Gen. He Weidong, suggests potential issues with corruption, ideological differences, or the reliability of military commanders. This internal turmoil could weaken Xi's appetite for war, providing Taiwan and the United States with more time to strengthen their defenses. The article emphasizes that military effectiveness depends on competent battlefield leadership, which China currently lacks.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's first domestically built submarine, the Hai Kun, is facing potential delivery delays due to ongoing testing issues and pipe leaks. The submarine, part of Taiwan's Indigenous Defence Submarine (IDS) program, was originally scheduled to begin Sea Acceptance Tests in April, but progress has been stalled. Former navy captain Kuo Hsi reported repeated piping system failures causing compartment flooding, which has led to suspension of work by foreign testing teams, further casting doubt on the November delivery deadline.</p>

          <h2>Bangladeshi Garment Industry Faces Threat from US Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a cornerstone of its economy, faces a potential crisis due to proposed U.S. tariffs. Despite a pause in tariffs, the possibility of reinstatement worries workers who rely on exports for their livelihoods. The tariffs threaten Bangladesh's economic growth, particularly after a recent economic collapse and political instability. The country's garment sector has transformed itself since the Rana Plaza collapse, focusing on improved safety and sustainability, but tariffs could undermine these efforts and impact millions of workers.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariff Loophole Closure Impacts Delivery Companies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 00:00:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to close a tariff loophole, which allowed inexpensive goods from China to enter the U.S. without tariffs, is expected to significantly impact delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. This closure may reduce the volume of shipments from China, affecting revenue for these companies and airlines. While UPS anticipates a decline in revenue from China-to-U.S. shipments, some experts believe logistics companies may struggle to compensate for lost sales in other markets. The move aims to encourage domestic production but could increase costs for American consumers.</p>
