          <p>A scenic 10-mile stretch of Angeles Crest Highway has reopened to the public just before Labor Day weekend after a multi-year closure. The road, a key route for accessing hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, was shut down due to severe damage from storms in 2022-23 and the 2024 Bridge fire. Costing nearly $8 million, the repairs included new guardrails and drainage systems, which officials hope will also reduce trail overcrowding. While celebrated by the hiking community, some express concern that the holiday weekend reopening coincides with extreme fire danger warnings for the area.</p>

          <p>Three men were arrested during a protest outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, England, following a court decision to allow asylum seekers to continue being housed there. The arrests were for offenses including violent disorder and assaulting a police officer, with two officers sustaining minor injuries. A Court of Appeal ruling overturned a temporary injunction that had blocked the hotel's use, allowing 138 asylum seekers to remain. The situation has created significant tension and mixed feelings within the local community, with police enforcing a dispersal order to manage the unrest.</p>

          <p>Mass protests have broken out across Indonesia, leading to violent clashes with police after a 21-year-old ride-sharing driver was killed by a police vehicle during an anti-government demonstration. The unrest has resulted in at least three deaths after a regional parliament building was set on fire in Makassar, with police deploying tear gas in major cities like Jakarta. The protests, fueled by frustrations over cost-of-living issues and political perks, represent a significant challenge for President Prabowo Subianto's administration. Despite apologies from police and the president, tensions remain high as demonstrators demand justice.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump are illegal, stating they exceed the authority granted to the president under federal economic emergency laws. While the decision is a significant legal blow to Trump's signature trade strategy, it does not immediately block the tariffs, giving the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling applies to broad baseline tariffs and specific duties targeting countries like China, Mexico, and Canada. The administration has vowed to appeal the decision, which it claims undermines U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Florida has scheduled the execution of Victor Tony Jones, 64, for the fatal stabbing of a married couple during a 1990 robbery. This marks the state's 13th scheduled execution of the year, extending a record for the most inmates put to death in Florida in a single year since 1976. The state has executed more people this year than any other, contributing to a national increase in executions.

          <p>The Social Security Administration's chief data officer, Charles Borges, has resigned days after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging a major data security risk. Borges claimed that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency uploaded a copy of the entire country's Social Security information to a "vulnerable cloud environment." The SSA has refuted the claim, stating the data was stored in a secure environment "walled off from the internet" and that it is unaware of any compromise. In his resignation letter, Borges cited retaliation and a hostile work environment as reasons for his departure.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery analyzed by Yale University reveals that paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are constructing an extensive earthen wall around the besieged city of el-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region. Researchers warn the barrier, which stretches over 19 miles, is designed to trap civilians and create a "literal kill box" as the RSF intensifies its offensive. El-Fasher is the last major army stronghold in Darfur, and its potential fall could lead to the partitioning of the country. The siege has created a dire humanitarian crisis, with civilians facing constant bombardment and shortages of food and medicine.</p>

          <p>Data obtained by the BBC reveals that live-fire military training has caused hundreds of wildfires across the UK since 2023. Firefighting efforts are frequently complicated and made more dangerous by the presence of unexploded ordnance from both current exercises and historical military use, such as World War II-era bombs. Residents near training sites like Salisbury Plain have raised concerns about health risks from smoke and environmental pollution. The Ministry of Defence states it has a robust policy to monitor fire risk and restricts live ammunition use during dry periods.</p>

With the rise of high-quality home coffee machines, chains are under pressure to offer a unique experience.

          <p>A massive manhunt is active in the rural Australian town of Porepunkah for Dezi Freeman, a heavily-armed man with anti-government beliefs who allegedly shot and killed two police officers. The officers were attempting to serve a search warrant at his property when they were met with gunfire, which also left a third officer gravely injured. The incident has shocked the small community and revived national concerns about the growing threat of violence from sovereign citizen and pseudo-law conspiracy theorist groups. The suspect remains at large in the dense bushland surrounding the town.</p>

          <p>Warning signs about gymnastics coach Sean Gardner, who was recently arrested for sexual abuse, were reportedly ignored for years by authorities and gym owners. Gardner's former boss claims she reported his "grooming" behavior to USA Gymnastics in 2018, and parents at his next job at an elite academy owned by coach Liang "Chow" Qiao also raised concerns. Despite these complaints, Qiao promoted Gardner, and it took years before the U.S. Center for SafeSport issued a ban. The case highlights continued systemic failures to protect young athletes from predators within the sport.</p>

Security at the Royal Albert Hall removed the protesters, and the orchestra was able to restart its performance. The BBC apologized to its radio audience for the disruption to the live broadcast.</p>

          <p>At the request of President Trump, Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts. The goal is to create a new map that favors Republicans and could help the party capture an additional U.S. House seat currently held by a Democrat in the Kansas City area. This move makes Missouri the latest state to engage in an unusual mid-decade redistricting battle, following similar partisan efforts by Republicans in Texas and a counter-move by Democrats in California to gain a political advantage.</p>

          <p>A review of director Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," praises its gritty, nostalgic depiction of 1998 New York City but criticizes its lack of substance. The film stars Austin Butler as a bartender caught in a case of mistaken identity, pursued by various underworld figures. The reviewer finds that despite a talented cast, the characters are underdeveloped and cartoonish. Ultimately, the article describes the movie as a stylish but disposable thriller that fails to create compelling action or stakes, recalling a forgettable rental from the era it depicts.</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans have officially enacted a new congressional map designed to create five additional safe GOP seats, a key part of the party's national strategy to maintain control of the U.S. House. Four of these new districts are Hispanic-majority, representing a high-stakes gamble that the party can solidify the gains it made with Latino voters in the last election. However, recent polling suggests that some Hispanic support for the GOP may be softening due to economic concerns and immigration policies, making the outcome of this redistricting effort uncertain.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta has embarked on a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The march is a protest against severe budget cuts to SEPTA, the region's public transit authority, which provides essential services to students, workers, and the elderly. Kenyatta is using the protest to draw attention to the funding crisis, which he attributes to the inaction of Republicans in the state legislature. He aims to highlight the growing impact of the service cuts on working people across the region.</p>

The arrest on assault charges came after Longoria's lawyers released video that appears to contradict official claims that he tried to run over the officers. His attorneys described the pre-dawn raid on his home by heavily armed agents as an act of intimidation for speaking out. Longoria has since been transferred to ICE custody, which his lawyers believe was the true purpose of the arrest.</p>

          <p>Residents in Mexico City are protesting against the growing gentrification of their neighborhoods, which they attribute to a large influx of American and European tourists and remote workers. The demonstrations, some of which have included chants of "Gringos out!", are fueled by anger over soaring rent prices and the proliferation of short-term rentals that are displacing long-term residents. Activists argue that the city's character is being eroded, with local businesses replaced by establishments catering to foreigners, forcing locals to move to the city's distant outskirts.</p>
