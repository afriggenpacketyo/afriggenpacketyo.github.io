          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit signals a potential thaw in relations, driven by shared economic challenges like U.S. tariffs. Despite recent gestures such as resuming direct flights, deep-seated issues including border disputes, a significant trade deficit favoring China, and Beijing's military support for Pakistan remain major obstacles. Experts are skeptical of a long-term strategic partnership but acknowledge the meeting could establish common ground on economic cooperation, particularly given India's reliance on Chinese components for key industries. The summit will be a key indicator of the future trajectory of this complex relationship.</p>

This development is significant as the U.S. attempts to limit China's access to cutting-edge chip technology. Luo founded the company in 2015, focusing on gallium nitride (GaN) technology, a next-generation semiconductor material. Her company achieved a major breakthrough by becoming the first to mass-produce 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers, placing China in a leading position in this specific semiconductor sector.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted of charges related to the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The decision was based on concerns of judicial bias after the original presiding judge allegedly made prejudicial comments suggesting police department infiltration by gangs. Nichols' death after a violent traffic stop sparked nationwide protests against police brutality. While the officers were convicted on federal witness tampering charges, they were acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing his death, and they were also acquitted of separate state charges including second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>A former Department of Justice employee, Sean Charles Dunn, has been charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal officer in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors were unable to secure a felony indictment from a grand jury for the incident, which occurred during a period of heightened federal presence in the capital. Dunn, who was fired after his arrest, allegedly shouted profanities at the officers, calling them "fascists." This marks the second recent case where D.C. prosecutors failed to obtain a grand jury indictment for alleged assaults on federal law enforcement.</p>

They argue that public comments from officials, including President Trump and the DHS Secretary, have branded Abrego Garcia as a criminal and gang member, jeopardizing his right to a fair trial on human trafficking charges. Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order and then returned to the U.S., faces renewed deportation efforts, this time to Uganda, while his legal case in Tennessee is pending.</p>

          <p>The White House has appointed Jim O’Neill, a biotech investor and top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His appointment follows the controversial firing of Dr. Susan Monarez and is expected to advance Kennedy's agenda of reshaping federal vaccine policy. O'Neill, who lacks formal medical or infectious disease training, previously worked for conservative tech investor Peter Thiel and voiced support for unproven COVID-19 treatments. His selection has drawn criticism from public health experts who question his qualifications to lead the nation's top public health agency during a period of significant turmoil.</p>

The investigation identified that two separate staircases were hit almost simultaneously, followed nine minutes later by a "double-tap" strike where two projectiles hit the same location milliseconds apart. The attack, which killed at least 20 people including journalists, has drawn international condemnation. Israel's narrative has evolved since the incident, with the IDF's initial inquiry claiming it identified a Hamas camera in the area, a justification that experts say may not absolve it of violating international law.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before proceeding with a major reorganization to merge local councils in 21 areas of England, a BBC investigation found. The government's claim that the mergers could save £2.9 billion over five years was based on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting that some reorganization scenarios could result in no savings or even cost money. Critics argue it is astonishing that the government embarked on such a significant reform without independent, up-to-date evidence to justify the changes.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have expressed outrage after a major Russian missile attack on Kyiv killed at least 23 people and damaged the EU's delegation office. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that two missiles struck within 50 meters of the diplomatic mission, calling it another grim reminder of Russia's willingness to terrorize Ukraine. The attack, one of the largest on the capital in months, has been widely condemned as a deliberate escalation and an attempt to mock peace efforts. In response, Russia's ambassadors in the UK and Brussels were summoned by their respective foreign ministries.</p>

          <p>A new Texas law, SB 17, set to take effect September 1st, restricts individuals and companies from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying or renting property. While proponents, including Governor Greg Abbott, frame the law as a national security measure, opponents argue it is discriminatory and anti-immigrant, drawing comparisons to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. The law exempts U.S. citizens and green card holders, but critics fear it will lead to unfair scrutiny of anyone of Asian descent and harm the state's economy. A lawsuit challenging the law's constitutionality was recently dismissed, though an appeal has been filed.</p>

Zhao suggested that Hong Kong's government has shown a clear willingness to adopt the technology but needs to move quickly on policy changes.

Despite a minor dip in its stock price after a strong earnings report, Cramer argued that Nvidia's dominance in the generative AI chip market positions it for continued success. He believes the full potential of AI has yet to be realized across various business sectors, which will drive future demand for Nvidia's technology.

Testimonies gathered by the BBC describe being taken from Delhi under false pretenses, flown to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and then forced onto a warship where some were beaten. They were allegedly given life jackets and told to swim to a shore they were told was Indonesia, but was actually war-torn Myanmar.

Although the fish was sterile and unable to reproduce, its presence highlights the ongoing threat these fish pose to the Great Lakes ecosystem. Grass carp are highly destructive, consuming up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, which degrades habitats for native species and clouds the water. Officials are increasing surveillance and reminding the public that it is illegal to release non-native fish into waterways.</p>

          <p>A new survey of U.S. consumers indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is more likely to dissuade potential buyers than attract them. The report found that 35% of respondents were less likely to purchase a Tesla because of FSD, compared to only 14% who said it made them more likely to buy one. The findings suggest a market education and trust issue for Tesla, which has positioned the technology as crucial to its future value, even as the company faces a sales slump. The survey also revealed strong public support for stricter regulation of autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
