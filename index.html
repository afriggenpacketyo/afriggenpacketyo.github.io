          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol for women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for publicly testifying against her ex-husband, who drugged her and allowed dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Her courageous testimony during a public trial led to the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants, shocking the nation. The case has been a catalyst for legal reform, contributing to the French Senate passing a bill to include lack of consent in the legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a statement reflecting on the one-year anniversary of the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania. He expressed his belief that divine intervention spared his life and reaffirmed that the 'American spirit' will always overcome evil. Trump paid tribute to the first responders and citizens who acted heroically during the event and honored Corey Comperatore, the rally attendee who was killed. The statement also touched upon the ongoing questions regarding security lapses that allowed the attack to occur, while emphasizing a message of national resilience.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 22:18:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy successfully averted a technical recession by posting a 1.4% quarter-over-quarter growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. The expansion was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector, which grew 5.5% year-over-year. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook, citing significant global uncertainty, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. This economic data precedes an upcoming monetary policy decision, with recent low inflation figures potentially supporting another rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to show signs of slowing. In an interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for interest rates, currently at 4.25%, is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay raises. This follows Chancellor Rachel Reeves's increase in employers' national insurance contributions. The governor's comments come as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, adding pressure on the government to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A volatile wildfire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed dozens of structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and a water treatment facility. The fire, which expanded to 5,000 acres, also caused a chlorine gas leak, forcing firefighters to evacuate and hampering containment efforts. Meanwhile, smoke from a severe wildfire season in Canada is blanketing the U.S. Upper Midwest, causing unhealthy air quality across several states, including Minnesota and North Dakota. These events highlight a period of extreme fire danger and hazardous weather conditions across North America.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of the season with a 5-2 extra-innings win over the San Francisco Giants, securing a comfortable 5.5-game lead in the NL West. Despite their strong standing, the team's performance has been inconsistent, marked by an injury-plagued pitching staff and slumps from veteran stars. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto has been a standout performer and a potential first-half MVP, but the bullpen, particularly closer Tanner Scott, has struggled. The team's powerful offense has also seen mixed results, reflecting a successful yet imperfect first half for the defending champions.</p>

          <p>While Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's 'illiberal democracy' model is admired by some conservative figures abroad, his power is facing a significant challenge at home. A new political rival from the center-right, Peter Magyar, has gained substantial support by criticizing the government's corruption and the poor state of public services. This challenge emerged after a political scandal eroded public trust in Orban's Fidesz party. With polls showing Magyar's party ahead and the national economy stagnating, Orban's long-established playbook of leveraging voter fears may no longer be enough to secure his position.</p>

          <p>A decades-long drought in northern Mexico is intensifying a water-sharing dispute with the United States, centered on an 81-year-old treaty. Mexico is in arrears on its obligation to send water from the Rio Grande to Texas, prompting the Trump administration to threaten withholding water from the Colorado River in return. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue they cannot give what they don't have, as their reservoirs are at critically low levels. Texan farmers, however, accuse Mexico of hoarding water and using inefficient irrigation, leading to a tense standoff over a scarce and vital resource.</p>

The defense comes amid criticism that the move is a pretext related to a criminal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. (not investment advice)</p>
