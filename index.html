          <p>President Trump has announced plans to pursue an executive order aimed at banning mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, citing unsubstantiated claims of corruption and fraud. This move faces significant legal challenges, as the U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate election procedures. Experts and nonpartisan groups have highlighted that mail-in voting has been a secure and established practice in the U.S. for decades, and is also utilized by numerous other developed nations. The proposed ban has been described as logistically impossible and a threat to election security by election officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The dietary supplement market in the United States, used by an estimated 60% of Americans, operates under loose federal regulation, creating what some critics call a "Wild West" environment. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, companies can make vague health claims without undergoing rigorous clinical trials for safety or effectiveness. Health experts caution that while some supplements like creatine may offer modest benefits when combined with specific activities, many others, such as collagen, lack convincing scientific support. Consumers are advised to be skeptical of marketing claims and prioritize obtaining nutrients from a healthy diet rather than relying on pills.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is projected to grow substantially as it moves north, parallel to the U.S. East Coast. While not expected to make landfall in the U.S., the Category 3 storm will generate dangerous rip currents and high waves, prompting warnings and some beach closures from North Carolina to New York. Evacuation orders have been issued for North Carolina's Outer Banks due to the risk of coastal flooding. The National Hurricane Center is urging the public to heed local warnings, as the hazardous ocean conditions are expected to persist for several days.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has withdrawn its demand for Apple to create a "backdoor" into its encrypted services, marking a significant victory for the tech company and global privacy advocates. The decision came after extensive discussions with the U.S. government, which had raised national security concerns about weakening encryption. Governments have long sought access to encrypted data for criminal investigations, but tech companies and cybersecurity experts argue that any backdoor would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, compromising user security. This development may allow Apple to reintroduce its most secure cloud data service, Advanced Data Protection, to its U.K. customers.</p>

The strike, which began on a Saturday, had disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The union had previously defied two back-to-work orders from the Canada Industrial Relations Board, with union leaders risking fines and jail time to continue negotiations. The dispute centered on pay and compensation for unpaid work performed by flight attendants while planes are on the ground.</p>

Prices for typical school supplies have reportedly increased by over 7% this year. To save money, experts recommend comparing prices, considering refurbished electronics, buying store-brand products, and giving teens a budget on a gift card to instill financial discipline.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will facilitate a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to be followed by trilateral talks involving the U.S. The development aims to build momentum toward ending the war in Ukraine, with recent discussions focusing on security guarantees and the return of Ukrainian prisoners. While Ukraine is pushing for a ceasefire before further negotiations, Russia has expressed its own red lines, including opposition to European troops in Ukraine. This diplomatic effort is unfolding alongside a separate U.S. domestic political battle over mail-in voting.</p>

          <p>A former coach at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute, an Iowa academy known for training Olympic champions, has been arrested by the FBI on a federal charge related to child sexual abuse images. The coach, Sean Gardner, was previously suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022 following allegations of sexual abuse from at least three young gymnasts at the academy. Court records indicate he was also accused of secretly recording gymnasts in a bathroom at a previous job.

Walton believes the Democratic party's losses among working-class voters stem from abandoning populist economic policies in favor of catering to corporate interests.

          <p>A cultural trend is emerging within some conservative and MAGA-aligned circles, promoting cow-based products like beef tallow and raw milk as symbols of a traditional, healthier lifestyle. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has advocated for beef tallow over seed oils, despite disagreement from the American Heart Association, and skincare products containing the animal fat are gaining traction. This movement aligns with a romanticization of a bygone era and homesteading aesthetics, positioning the cow as an icon of rural, traditional values in contrast to modern urban life. Nutrition experts note that while beef can be part of a healthy diet, the claimed benefits of tallow are largely unproven.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has effectively ended the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) student loan repayment plan by resuming interest charges for borrowers, causing financial distress for millions. Many of the 8 million people enrolled in the Biden-era plan, which offered interest forbearance, now face significantly higher monthly payments or accruing interest if they choose not to pay. Borrowers, including teachers and those with master's degrees, report that the change is forcing them to delay major life plans like having children and is creating overwhelming financial anxiety.

          <p>The traditional model of U.S. college athletics, where revenue from football and basketball subsidizes non-revenue sports like squash and diving, is facing a potential collapse. Recent court rulings allowing universities to directly pay athletes have created pressure to cut less popular, often upscale, sports to fund the stars who generate billions in revenue. President Trump has issued an executive order to protect these non-revenue sports, but critics argue the old system was an unfair subsidy. The shift towards a free-market approach could mean the end for many collegiate teams, fundamentally altering the landscape of university athletics and its role in education.</p>

          <p>A new study from Poland raises concerns that physicians may become overly dependent on artificial intelligence, potentially dulling their own diagnostic skills. The research found that gastroenterologists were approximately 20% less effective at identifying polyps during colonoscopies on their own after just three months of using an AI-assisted system that highlights abnormalities. The study's lead author suggests that doctors may subconsciously wait for the AI's prompt rather than actively scanning for issues themselves. While some experts are skeptical that such a short period could degrade a long-held skill, the findings point to the need for more research into how AI integration is changing medical practice.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has announced the deployment of 4.5 million militia members across the country in response to what he termed "outlandish threats" from the United States. The move follows the Trump administration's decision to double the bounty for Maduro's arrest to $50 million on drug trafficking charges and the launch of U.S. anti-drug operations in the Caribbean. The Venezuelan militia, founded by Hugo Chavez, officially numbers around 5 million people. Maduro's announcement signals a significant escalation in rhetoric and military posturing between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations, marking the first time it has missed on both metrics in over a decade. Despite this, the company is maintaining its full-year forecast, anticipating a 2.8% growth in total sales. The retailer noted that while homeowners are still showing a "deferral mindset" on large projects due to the sluggish housing market, there are positive signs, including an increase in big-ticket transactions over $1,000. Home Depot's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, focusing instead on its core business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old Florida man, Donald Jamesbrown Henry, has been convicted of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing his friend, Shawn Popp, during a 2022 argument. The dispute reportedly began over Donald Trump's business bankruptcies, which escalated into a physical confrontation. Henry claimed he acted in self-defense after being struck, but investigators found insufficient evidence to support the use of deadly force. He now faces a sentence ranging from a minimum of 16 years to life in prison for the killing, which illustrates the extreme consequences of political polarization on personal relationships.</p>

          <p>A proposal by former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt to build a gondola from Union Station to Dodger Stadium, first pitched eight years ago, remains mired in bureaucratic delays and is facing strong community opposition. In an effort to speed up the process, lobbyists for the project have added language to a state transit bill that would fast-track legal challenges. However, the Los Angeles City Council has passed a resolution opposing this move, and a city-commissioned study of traffic alternatives is itself facing a multi-year timeline.

A Miami jury recently found Tesla partly liable in a fatal crash involving Autopilot, ordering a $240 million payment to victims, a first-of-its-kind verdict for the company. Additionally, the California DMV has sued Tesla for false advertising, and a shareholder lawsuit accuses Musk of inflating stock prices by exaggerating the readiness of the robotaxi program. These cases intensify questions about the safety and capabilities of Tesla's technology at a critical time for the company.</p>

          <p>The California State University (CSU) system is facing a significant student housing crisis, with demand for on-campus living far exceeding supply at many of its 22 campuses. Housing can account for half the cost of attendance, and an estimated 11% of CSU students experience housing insecurity. While the system has added over 17,000 beds in the last decade, campuses like Cal State Northridge still had thousands of students on housing waitlists. State lawmakers are now considering a 2026 bond measure to help fund the construction of more affordable student housing across California's public university systems to address the growing need.</p>

The complaint highlights the disparity between the hotel's luxury pricing and its compensation for staff, noting some employees earn less per hour than the cost of a bowl of hummus at the hotel's restaurant.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is facing criticism from Republicans and good-government advocates for pushing a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps to counter a similar Republican effort in Texas. The move would override the work of California's independent redistricting commission, established to prevent political gerrymandering. While Newsom frames it as fighting fire with fire against Trump-era tactics, opponents, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, argue it undermines democratic processes. The article notes the hypocrisy of California Republicans who now decry gerrymandering after supporting the political maneuvers that prompted Newsom's response.</p>

This action is part of a broader effort to cut NASA's Earth science budget by 50%, targeting programs related to global warming.

The signatories argue the measures are "misguided and punitive," stating that cutting vital research funds will not make the campus safer for Jewish students. They contend that the administration is cynically weaponizing the issue of antisemitism to advance a political agenda against higher education.</p>
