          <p>An opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area, encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macau, is uniquely positioned to host the 2036 Olympic Games. The region already possesses numerous world-class sports facilities and a highly efficient, expanding transport network, which would significantly reduce the economic burden typically associated with hosting the event. By leveraging existing infrastructure and the scenic backdrop of Hong Kong's harbor for temporary venues, the area could meet and even surpass the logistical standards set by previous Games. This approach would offer a cost-effective and sustainable model for future Olympic hosts.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed that he was 'not thrilled' and 'very unhappy' following an Israeli military strike in Doha, Qatar, that targeted senior Hamas leadership. The operation, which Israel claimed was justified and for which it took full responsibility, has placed the Trump administration in a difficult diplomatic position as both Israel and Qatar are key U.S. allies. While Hamas confirmed casualties among its members, it stated its negotiating team was unharmed. Trump emphasized his desire to secure the release of remaining hostages and noted in a social media post that the U.S. was not involved in the unilateral strike.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly urging the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India over their continued purchases of Russian oil. The proposal is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, with Washington indicating it would mirror any tariffs implemented by the EU. The U.S. has already placed significant tariffs on Indian imports due to its Russian oil trade, a move India has labeled as unfair. This diplomatic push highlights the administration's strategy of using secondary sanctions to influence global trade dynamics and isolate Russia's economy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki has re-entered consideration for the team's postseason roster after a strong rehabilitation performance for the triple-A affiliate. In his start, Sasaki pitched four shutout innings and reached speeds over 100 mph multiple times, a significant improvement from his previous rehab struggles. While a starting role is unlikely, manager Dave Roberts indicated that a bullpen position is possible for the 23-year-old, who has been on the injured list with a shoulder impingement since May. The organization will now convene to determine the next steps for Sasaki as the regular season nears its end.</p>

Judge hit his 359th career home run during a game against the Detroit Tigers, which was also his 44th of the current season.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a landmark case challenging the legality of President Trump's widespread tariffs, setting the stage for a major decision on his economic policies. The court will review lower court rulings that found the president exceeded his authority by imposing the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Trump administration argues that this authority is crucial for national security and ongoing trade negotiations, warning of severe economic consequences if the lower court's decision is upheld. Arguments are scheduled for November, marking a significant test of presidential power in trade matters.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw has won the special election for a congressional seat in Northern Virginia, further tightening the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in a reliably Democratic district where federal job cuts under the Trump administration were a key issue. His victory continues a trend of Democratic overperformance in recent elections and adds another voice to the House ahead of critical federal funding deadlines. Walkinshaw has also pledged to support a bipartisan effort to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

Researchers attribute this change to the widespread availability of cheap, high-calorie, ultra-processed foods displacing traditional diets.

          <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is facing growing accusations of dismantling democratic norms and using the judicial system to silence political rivals. A prominent example is the arrest of Istanbul's popular mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, on corruption charges that his supporters claim are politically motivated to eliminate him as a presidential threat. This is part of a broader crackdown that has seen hundreds of opposition party members arrested, sparking large-scale protests. Critics argue that Erdoğan is consolidating power and turning Turkey into an autocracy, a trend they say is being overlooked by the international community.</p>

          <p>A top UK planning lawyer has advised the government that granting planning permission for a large-scale Chinese embassy near the Tower of London would be 'unlawful.' The legal opinion, commissioned by concerned residents, argues that China has redacted key details about the intended use of certain rooms in the plans, making a proper planning assessment impossible. Concerns have been raised by activists that these rooms could be used for interrogations. Additionally, security risks associated with a publicly accessible area on diplomatic territory have not been resolved, creating a complex legal and geopolitical challenge for UK officials.</p>

          <p>The British horse racing industry will stage an unprecedented one-day strike, with no fixtures taking place, to protest a proposed government tax hike on betting. Industry leaders warn that raising the tax rate could cost the sport hundreds of millions in revenue, leading to significant job losses and reduced investment. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) argues that the sport's betting product is unique and should be treated differently from online gaming. On the day of the strike, prominent figures from the racing world will lobby lawmakers at Westminster to highlight the potential negative impacts of the tax increase.</p>

The National Natural Science Foundation of China will provide grants for research into stablecoins and the development of cross-border monitoring systems. The initiative aims to generate policy suggestions on how China can manage the challenges posed by global stablecoins and contribute to digital finance governance. This move reflects a cautious yet proactive approach from a nation that has otherwise strictly banned decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted that companies aggressively buying back their own stock are currently outperforming in the market, citing analysis from Goldman Sachs. While the overall pace of buybacks has slowed, investors are rewarding what the analysis calls 'buyback aristocrats'—companies that consistently reduce their share counts. Cramer pointed to Apple and Wells Fargo as prime examples, suggesting their generous repurchase programs signal strong management confidence and provide an 'edge' for investors, especially as the economy slows. This strategy helps absorb excess share supply from the market, supporting stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The conservative majority of the Supreme Court has allowed a lower court ruling to be overturned, effectively permitting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to conduct stops and detentions based on racial profiling. The case, Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, centered on whether ICE could use factors like race, ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or being in a known gathering spot for immigrants as justification for a stop. This decision lifts a previous injunction from a California district court that had barred such practices. The ruling is a significant blow to civil liberties advocates who argue it violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona is moving to block the Pentagon from providing full military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Gallego argues that such honors are reserved for those who defend the Constitution, not individuals who participate in an attempt to overthrow the government. His legislation aims to prevent what he calls a 'discredit' to the Air Force, following a recent Pentagon decision to reverse its initial denial and grant the honor. The move places the contentious legacy of the Capitol riot back into the political spotlight.</p>

The action directs the FDA and HHS to enforce existing regulations more strictly, particularly concerning the disclosure of risks and side effects in ads on television and social media. The administration plans to send hundreds of cease-and-desist and warning letters to companies, including online pharmacies and social media influencers who fail to provide adequate disclosures. This move stops short of an outright ban on pharma ads but seeks to level the playing field for all companies.</p>

Signatories including Emma Stone, Olivia Colman, and Ava DuVernay have committed to avoiding work with Israeli film companies that benefit from what the letter describes as a system of apartheid. The campaign, organized by Filmmakers for Palestine, is modeled on the cultural boycotts against apartheid-era South Africa. An Israeli film industry group has responded by calling the boycott 'profoundly misguided' and an attempt to silence dialogue.</p>
