          <p>Kim Moon Soo, a former Labor Minister, has won the People Power Party's nomination for South Korea's snap presidential election set for June 3. Kim, who previously served as governor of Gyeonggi province and as a National Assembly member, is expected to form an alliance with former Prime Minister Hand Duck-soo to consolidate the conservative vote against liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung. Kim's acceptance speech emphasized a staunchly conservative vision and a firm stance against North Korea. The election aims to find a successor to President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached in December. Optimism score should be 65</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luke Charters, the York Outer MP, is advocating for a reevaluation of the 1985 legislation that prohibits alcohol consumption in view of the pitch at the top five tiers of men's football in England. Charters argues that the ban creates an inconsistency compared to other sports where drinking is permitted, and he suggests trialing relaxed restrictions, similar to ongoing trials in the women's game. The Football Supporters Association supports the MP's call, and Charters proposes starting with lower leagues and family zones where alcohol consumption would remain inappropriate. The debate coincides with discussions on the Football Governance Bill and ticket pricing.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexican wetlands, offering hope for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into restored and artificial wetlands, revealing they gained weight and adapted to their new environment, recognizing predators and catching prey. This success is significant because it demonstrates that axolotls can survive in man-made habitats, which could mitigate the effects of habitat degradation and climate change. Axolotls are culturally important to Mexicans and are also studied for their regenerative abilities.</p>

          <p>Data shows that women in the Bay Area are delaying motherhood more than women in other parts of the United States, with Marin County having the highest percentage of women giving birth at 40 or older. This trend is attributed to career prioritization, progressive social norms, and access to reproductive technology. The average age of first-time mothers in the Bay Area is significantly higher than the national average. The article also discusses the economic factors influencing this decision, including high childcare costs and the desire for financial stability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is attempting to fill critical positions just a day after hundreds of employees left as part of a deferred resignation offer. This offer was made to reduce the federal workforce under the Trump administration, but now the agency is scrambling to find replacements. This has caused frustration among those who accepted the resignation offer, as the government will be paying two salaries for the same job through September. The USDA claims it is optimizing the workforce without compromising critical functions.</p>

          <p>Cases of whooping cough are on the rise in the United States, with preliminary data indicating a doubling of cases compared to the same time last year. Experts attribute this surge to decreased mask-wearing and social distancing post-COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a cyclical pattern of the disease. Concerns are also growing about declining vaccination rates and increasing anti-vaccine sentiment. The article highlights the importance of vaccination, especially for infants and pregnant women, and notes that some states are experiencing significant outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Following Germany's classification of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as extremist, Trump administration officials have strongly criticized the decision. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Germany is giving its spy agency powers to surveil the opposition, which he deems tyrannical. Vice President JD Vance likened the situation to the rebuilding of the Berlin Wall by the German establishment, arguing that the AfD, a popular party, is opposing deadly open border immigration policies.

          <p>China is reportedly considering offering greater cooperation with the United States in combating the flow of fentanyl as a means to de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The plan involves sending a high-ranking security official to Washington to discuss the issue and potentially pave the way for simultaneous tariff reductions. This move signals a potential shift in China's stance, which has previously resisted pressure to address fentanyl while facing tariffs. Cooperation on fentanyl was previously frozen in 2022 after a visit to Taiwan by then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, showing how cooperation on this issue is tied to other political events.</p>
