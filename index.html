          <h2>Appeals Court Temporarily Blocks Order for Trump to Return Control of California National Guard</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily blocked a lower court's order that would have instructed President Trump to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Newsom. The initial order deemed Trump's federalization of the Guard illegal, but the appeals court intervened, scheduling a hearing to consider whether to extend the stay. The legal battle arose after Trump federalized 4,000 Guard members and mobilized Marines in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles, a move Newsom challenged as an overreach of presidential authority and a violation of the Tenth Amendment. The case highlights the ongoing tensions between the federal government and California regarding immigration enforcement and the use of military forces on city streets. Optimism score is based on the article focusing on the legal process and checks on executive power. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration can continue deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles while an appeals court considers the administration's appeal. This decision temporarily halts a judge's ruling that would have returned control of the Guard to Governor Newsom. The initial ruling found that California was likely to succeed in its challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles, arguing that Trump circumvented Newsom and violated the Constitution. The legal battle stems from Trump's deployment of over 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to assist immigration agents, prompting protests and raising concerns about the militarization of law enforcement. This decision by the appeals court sets the stage for further legal arguments regarding the president's authority and the role of the military in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations allegedly related to Iran's nuclear program, including the commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami, who was killed in a targeted strike. The strikes also reportedly killed two leading Iranian nuclear scientists. Iran's Supreme Leader vowed to avenge the attacks, while Israel's Defense Minister declared a state of emergency, anticipating a potential missile and drone attack. The United States stated it was not involved but was briefed beforehand, emphasizing its priority to protect American forces in the region; meanwhile, oil prices surged, and U.S. stock futures fell amid fears of a broader regional conflict. This action marks a significant escalation in the long-standing tensions between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced that it targeted Iranian nuclear facilities and research scientists in a series of preemptive airstrikes, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," with Prime Minister Netanyahu stating the operation would continue until the Iranian threat is removed.

The United States has denied involvement in the operation, with Secretary of State Rubio emphasizing that Israel took unilateral action and warning Iran against targeting U.S. interests. The strikes occurred amid ongoing U.S.-Iran nuclear talks and heightened tensions in the region, with the U.S. Embassy in Israel advising personnel to shelter in place.

          <p>The owner of a nightclub in the Dominican Republic, Antonio Espaillat, and his sister Maribel Espaillat, were arrested following a roof collapse that resulted in the deaths of 236 people. The Attorney General's Office accused the Espaillats of negligence for failing to prevent the collapse, which also left over 180 people injured. The Espaillats are also accused of intimidating potential witnesses in the case. The nightclub, known for its Monday night merengue parties, had been operating for nearly five decades and attracted international celebrities. The tragedy prompted a government-appointed committee to investigate the cause of the collapse, as authorities continue to gather information.</p>

          <p>North Korea announced the successful repair and relaunch of a 5,000-ton destroyer that was damaged during a failed launch attempt last month. Leader Kim Jong Un attended a ceremony at the Rajin shipyard, revealing plans to build two more destroyers of the same type annually. The destroyer had tipped over during the initial launch at the Chongjin Shipyard, causing damage to its lower sections. Kim expressed condolences to the family of a worker who died during the repair work. The newly launched warship is scheduled to be handed over to the navy around mid-2026.</p>

          <p>Researchers discovered structures resembling red blood cells linked to a tumor in the fossilized remains of a Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus dinosaur. This finding suggests that soft tissue can be preserved in fossils more often than previously thought, offering insights into ancient diseases. The discovery could be crucial in understanding cancer mechanisms and how they have evolved, potentially informing new approaches to cancer prevention or treatment in humans. The study emphasizes the importance of long-term fossil conservation efforts to ensure future researchers have access to specimens for molecular investigations.</p>

          <h2>Dan Wang's Observation on China's Engineering State</h2>

          <p>Dan Wang characterizes China as an "engineering state" due to its extensive infrastructure development and emphasis on STEM education. China's rapid construction of subways, high-speed rail, dams, and bridges surpasses other nations. The country's STEM graduates significantly outnumber those in the US, and many top officials are engineers. This focus on engineering is considered a matter of national security and priority in China, contrasting with the US, which Wang describes as a "lawyerly state."</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Tehran issued a warning to Chinese citizens and businesses in Iran following Israeli military strikes, describing the security situation as "severe and complicated." The embassy advised citizens to closely monitor the situation, enhance safety awareness, and strengthen security measures. The warning comes after Israel confirmed strikes on nuclear targets in Iran, with Prime Minister Netanyahu stating the operation would continue for several days. Secretary of State Rubio stated that the United States was not involved in the strikes.</p>

          <p>Israel carried out numerous airstrikes in Iran, targeting the country's nuclear sites, with an Israeli military official confirming the operation. Iranian state TV reported that Israel struck the Revolutionary Guards' headquarters in Tehran, resulting in the death of Commander Hossein Salami. Iranian armed forces spokesperson Shekarchi threatened a "heavy price" for Israel and the U.S. Sirens sounded across Israel, and Defense Minister Katz declared a "special state of emergency," anticipating missile and drone retaliation. The news of the airstrikes caused global markets to react, with oil prices jumping and U.S. stock futures dipping.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that pigs were already domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, according to archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes. The study analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. These findings suggest that the domestication process of wild boars occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society in southern China. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East.</p>
