          <p>Zia Yusuf, who had recently resigned as Reform UK chairman, is set to rejoin the party in a new capacity, leading the "Doge team." This team is modeled after the Department of Government Efficiency established by former US President Donald Trump, focusing on streamlining governmental processes. Yusuf's initial departure was attributed to his belief that working to get the party elected was not the best use of his time. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced that Yusuf will now take on a more public-facing role, increasing his media presence to further the party's agenda. The optimism score for this article reflects a sense of stability as the party realigns its leadership. </p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak connected to a recent egg recall has resulted in dozens of illnesses across seven states in the West and Midwest, according to federal health officials. August Egg Company recalled approximately 1.7 million brown organic and cage-free eggs due to potential salmonella contamination, with the affected eggs distributed to grocery stores between February and May. At least 79 people have been infected with the salmonella strain linked to the eggs, leading to 21 hospitalizations.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance characterized Elon Musk's recent attacks on President Trump as a "huge mistake" while also attempting to minimize the significance of the public dispute. Musk had criticized Trump's spending package, leading to a social media exchange where Trump labeled Musk as "CRAZY" and threatened government contracts with Musk's companies. Vance expressed hope that Musk would eventually "come back into the fold," attributing the outburst to frustration and suggesting that Musk should "chill out a little bit." Vance defended Trump against claims related to Jeffrey Epstein, asserting that the president did nothing wrong with the disgraced financier.</p>

Biles accused Gaines of bullying the trans community and being a "sore loser," advocating for inclusive sports environments for transgender athletes.

Dr. Andrew Freeman suggests preparing oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to keep it lower in calories, and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for added health benefits. Oatmeal contains beta-glucan, a dietary fiber that helps maintain healthy cholesterol and blood glucose levels. Eating oatmeal for breakfast can also reduce hunger and promote healthy gut bacteria, making it a beneficial addition to one's diet.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges.
