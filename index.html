          <p>A 57-year-old man, Vance Luther Boelter, has been arrested in Minnesota on suspicion of killing Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Boelter is also accused of shooting and wounding Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who are currently hospitalized. The arrest followed a two-day manhunt, and authorities stated that Boelter was armed but surrendered peacefully. Investigators found a list of potential targets in Boelter's car, including other state officials, and are still determining the motive behind the attacks, which Governor Tim Walz has called a politically motivated assassination attempt. Optimism surrounding the situation is low given the tragic circumstances and the potential for further political violence.</p>

          <p>Israeli defense industry exhibitions at the Paris Air Show have been sealed off with black partition walls after Israeli firms allegedly failed to comply with a directive to remove offensive weapons. Israel's Defense Ministry criticized the move as "outrageous and unprecedented," claiming it was politically and commercially motivated, especially given competition with French industries. French authorities reportedly instructed the organizers to seal off the exhibits after Israeli firms did not comply with requests to remove certain weapons from display. The air show's organizer stated they are in talks to find a resolution to the situation.</p>

The summit takes place amid ongoing trade disputes and potential for a global trade war, with bilateral meetings between Trump and other leaders expected to address these concerns.

          <p>Experts predict potential shifts in mortgage rates this summer, influenced by factors like inflation, employment, and consumer spending. While dramatic swings are unlikely, rates could remain stable in the high 6% range or see modest declines. Scenarios include rates staying the same if economic conditions remain stable, rising if inflation jumps or the economy grows too fast, or declining if the economy shows signs of cooling. Experts advise focusing on controllable variables and consulting with lenders to lock in rates that align with individual budgets and needs. (not investment advice)</p>

The event, which included tanks, missiles, and aircraft, was largely funded by taxpayers and corporate sponsorships. Critics argue the parade was a self-aggrandizing display of power meant to underscore Trump's determination to quash dissent, with the armed forces used as props for his ego. The parade was contrasted with large-scale protests that took place across the country earlier that day, highlighting opposition to Trump's vision of America.</p>

Conservative shadow minister Alan Mak said Labour had been forced to make "rushed cuts that hurt the most vulnerable and sickest" because "the economy is generally in a mess".</p>
