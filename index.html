        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have taken the rare step of removing Alina Habba from her role as the state's interim U.S. Attorney. Habba, a personal attorney for President Trump, was replaced by her top assistant, a career prosecutor, by order of the judicial panel. The move drew criticism from the Justice Department, which accused the judges of political activism and subsequently removed Habba's replacement hours later. The conflict highlights ongoing tensions between the judiciary and the Trump administration over key appointments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a major trade deal with Japan, which he stated includes a 15% tariff on Japanese imports and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States. The agreement would also reportedly open Japan's markets to more American products, including vehicles and agricultural goods. As of the announcement, the Japanese government had not publicly confirmed the details of the deal. This development marks a significant step in the administration's ongoing trade negotiations with the key Asian ally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A measure to rename the opera house at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts after First Lady Melania Trump has been advanced by House Republicans. The proposal was included in an amendment to a government funding bill, citing the first lady's role as the center's honorary chair. The move has been criticized by Democrats as divisive and follows a period where President Trump has asserted more control over the cultural institution's board and programming. The proposal's future is uncertain as it would require bipartisan support in the Senate to become law.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, Texas Instruments saw its stock price fall in after-hours trading. The drop was attributed to the company's disappointing forecast for the upcoming third quarter, which fell short of market estimates. The chipmaker's revenue for the second quarter saw a 16% year-over-year increase, driven by strong performance in its analog chip division. However, the weaker outlook suggests potential headwinds for the company, a key supplier of semiconductors for the automotive and industrial sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Her journey is particularly remarkable, as she served as a ball girl for an England match just four years ago. Now, the young Arsenal forward is making a name for herself on the pitch with her calm demeanor and clutch performances. Her ability to change the game as a substitute has been a key factor in the Lionesses' dramatic run to the final.</p>
