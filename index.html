          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly set to propose a full military reoccupation of the Gaza Strip to his security cabinet. This potential plan has drawn concern from the families of hostages and international allies who advocate for a ceasefire. Within Israel, hundreds of former security officials have urged the US to pressure Netanyahu to end the war, arguing that continued military action strengthens Hamas as an ideology. The proposal comes after ceasefire talks stalled and as a humanitarian crisis deepens in Gaza, where the majority of the population is displaced and facing starvation.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is purchasing additional shares of DuPont, citing the company's strong second-quarter performance and positive future outlook. The industrial firm surpassed sales and earnings expectations, driven by significant profit margin expansion and better-than-expected cash flow. Management also raised its full-year guidance and reaffirmed the November 1 spin-off date for its electronics business, Qnity. The club believes the stock's muted reaction to the positive news presents a valuable buying opportunity ahead of the company's upcoming breakup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two largest banks in the U.S., had previously rejected him as a customer. In a CNBC interview, he stated that JPMorgan gave him 20 days to move hundreds of millions in cash, and Bank of America subsequently declined to open an account for him. Trump suggested these rejections were due to regulatory pressure from the Biden administration, reviving claims of financial institutions discriminating against conservative clients. JPMorgan responded by denying that accounts are closed for political reasons and stated it looks forward to working with the White House on regulatory changes.</p>

          <p>A new report from the FBI reveals that crime rates in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, including violent crime, murder, and property crime. This marks the continuation of a downward trend from a spike observed after the COVID-19 pandemic, with the murder rate falling for the second consecutive year. Notably, motor vehicle thefts saw a significant 18.6% drop, the largest one-year decrease ever recorded for that category. While experts credit various factors, including community intervention programs, they also note that aggravated assaults remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt remaining at historically high levels, financial experts are offering guidance on how to qualify for debt settlement, also known as credit card debt forgiveness. To improve the chances of creditors agreeing to accept less than the full amount owed, individuals should first organize their finances and review their credit reports. It is crucial to document evidence of financial hardship, such as job loss or medical bills, as this strengthens the case for settlement. Finally, experts recommend either contacting creditors directly or working with a reputable debt settlement firm, ensuring any final agreement is put in writing.</p>

          <p>Consumers of Swiss products like luxury watches, chocolate, and skincare could see significant price increases due to a potential 39% U.S. tariff set to take effect this week. The high tariff rate, far above the 10-15% for the U.K. and E.U., has stunned businesses and could heavily impact sales of iconic Swiss goods in the U.S., their largest export market. While major producers like Nestlé have local U.S. production, brands that rely on the "Swiss-made" label, such as Rolex and smaller chocolatiers, would have to absorb the cost or pass it on to customers. Swiss negotiators are currently scrambling to avert the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has responded to the escalating trade dispute between the United States and India over Russian oil imports. The Kremlin stated that India is a sovereign nation with the right to choose its own trade partners, labeling President Trump's tariff threats as illegitimate attempts to force countries to sever ties with Russia. The comments came after Trump threatened to "substantially" raise tariffs on Indian goods if New Delhi continues purchasing discounted Russian oil. This dispute is being closely watched as it involves major global economies and has significant implications for international trade relations and energy markets.</p>

          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining relatively high, savers are considering whether to lock in long-term rates or maintain flexibility with short-term options. Currently, short-term CDs are offering slightly higher yields than long-term ones, an "inverted curve" that often signals market expectations of future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Financial experts advise that the choice depends on individual goals; short-term CDs suit those needing access to funds soon, while long-term CDs can lock in current high rates for predictable income. For those unsure, a CD ladder strategy can provide a balance of both benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of Russia and its trade partners, stating that Russia's economy "stinks" and that lower oil prices are needed to halt its war machine. He reiterated his threat to significantly raise tariffs on India within 24 hours for purchasing Russian oil, accusing New Delhi of "fueling the war machine." These comments reflect a souring of relations between Washington and Moscow, with Trump recently shortening a deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine. The escalating rhetoric highlights a complex geopolitical dynamic involving trade, energy, and the ongoing war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45 to 49 is linked to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates in this group grew 62% from 2019 to 2023. This corresponded with a sharp rise in the detection of localized, more curable cancers. Experts call the findings promising news, as removing precancerous polyps during a colonoscopy can prevent cancer from developing, though they caution that screening rates in this younger demographic remain suboptimal.</p>

China's strategic goals for a stable energy supply make its cooperation with Russia mutually beneficial and critical. In 2023, Russia was China's top source of crude oil. While the U.S. has threatened secondary sanctions on nations trading with Russia, experts predict that Beijing will continue to prioritize its national interests and energy security, even in the face of potential economic penalties from Washington.</p>

Alumni include Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, Brinker International CEO Kevin Hochman, and Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino. The company's deep talent pool often means that high-performing executives must look externally to secure a top CEO position, further spreading Yum's influence.</p>
