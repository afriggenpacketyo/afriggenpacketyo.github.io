          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is aiming to establish a presence on the Texas coast with its Starbase project, which seeks to create a new town primarily populated by SpaceX employees.

SpaceX aims to launch rockets up to 25 times a year, leading to worries about the impact on the environment and the community's way of life. While SpaceX seeks control over the beach and roads, residents are fighting to maintain public access, citing the state's Open Beaches Act. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term, marking a historic win for the Labor Party. The election was fought against the backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with both Labor and the opposition coalition, led by Peter Dutton, focusing on energy policy and inflation. Dutton's campaign faced criticism for allegedly mimicking U.S. President Donald Trump's policies and divisive tactics, leading to the moniker "DOGE-y Dutton." Albanese emphasized his government's improved relations with China, highlighting the removal of trade barriers. The New York Times article emphasizes that voters opted for the known quantity of the incumbent leader, Anthony Albanese, amid global uncertainty arising from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel the New Jersey state police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes from the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, which occurred 93 years ago. The case, involving the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's son, led to the conviction of Bruno Hauptmann, who maintained his innocence. Researchers believe that DNA testing could clarify whether Hauptmann acted alone or with co-conspirators. The state police have cited concerns about damaging the evidence as the reason for restricting access, but plaintiffs argue that the pursuit of historical justice necessitates modern forensic testing.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaires' embrace of the far right is not a recent development, but rather a return to their longstanding right-wing libertarian ideals. Figures like Elon Musk and Sam Altman promote fantasies of space colonization and super-intelligent AI, which serve as vehicles for autocratic control free from government oversight. These visions offer them a sense of meaning and moral absolution for their actions. Their unwavering faith in technological salvation leads them to believe in the imminent arrival of a perfect world, algorithmically guaranteed, but this faith offers nothing for those who cannot afford to live anywhere other than the real world.</p>

          <p>Inspired by NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's public service announcement about atrial fibrillation, Warren Donaldson sought medical attention for his symptoms, leading to the discovery of an orange-sized mass in his heart. Doctors at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center identified the mass as a pericardiac cyst, an extremely rare condition. The cyst was compressing Donaldson's right ventricular outflow tract, causing heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Donaldson underwent open-heart surgery to remove the cyst and reconstruct his RVOT, enabling him to return to normalcy and resume his active lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Steep tariffs on imports from China are impacting U.S. businesses, particularly bridal shops and wedding dress designers, as nearly all bridal gowns are made in China or Asia. The tariffs have led to surcharges and slowed production, affecting small businesses already struggling with expenses. Industry groups are pushing for exemptions, warning that the tariffs could wipe out the industry and eliminate the ritual of finding garments for special occasions. Some brands, like David's Bridal, are accelerating efforts to move production out of China to mitigate the impact of tariffs on prices for brides.</p>

          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not strike a trade deal with the U.S. unless all of President Trump's new tariffs are reviewed. The remarks highlight the disagreement between the two countries, with the U.S. unwilling to back down from duties on automobiles, steel, and aluminum. Japan is particularly concerned about the 25 percent duties targeting the auto industry, which accounted for nearly 30 percent of total exports to the U.S. last year. In another blow, a 25 percent tariff on certain auto parts took effect, causing disappointment in Japan.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. The tariffs aim to protect national security by incentivizing domestic production, but they affect even cars made in the U.S. due to imported components. While components from Canada and Mexico are exempt under certain conditions, the move is expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles. The uncertainty is creating headaches for carmakers, with GM estimating the tariffs will cost it up to $5 billion this year.</p>

          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) teaches aides to avoid using 'elderspeak,' a form of communication resembling baby talk, when interacting with older adults. Elderspeak, characterized by inappropriate endearments, simplified language, and controlling tones, can lead to resistance to care and lower use of antipsychotic drugs. The CHAT program, which includes videos of communication between staff and patients, has shown success in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes.

          <p>A helicopter from a China Coast Guard ship briefly violated Japanese airspace near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, according to the Japanese Defense Ministry. The helicopter took off from one of four Chinese coast guard ships that entered Japan's territorial waters around the Senkakus. Japan Coast Guard patrol vessels spotted the helicopter flying above the territorial waters for about 15 minutes, prompting the Air Self-Defense Force to scramble jet fighters. This marks the first intrusion by Chinese vessels into the area since April 7 and the 11th such incident this year.</p>

          <p>The release of the documentary 'The Encampments,' which offers access to the student protest movement for divestment against Israel’s actions in Gaza, has been met with controversy and attempts to silence it. Theaters have faced threats and vandalism, and social media ads for the film have been censored. The article argues that these efforts are part of a politically motivated campaign to suppress Palestinian voices and challenge the dominant narrative. The authors assert that Palestinian films are not dangerous because they incite violence but because they offer a perspective contrary to the US government and Israel.</p>

Some who were previously skeptical have embraced certain policies, such as cuts to federal spending and efforts to expose corruption.

          <p>A leading immunologist warned of a “post-herd-immunity world” as measles outbreaks affect communities with low vaccination rates. The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in a quarter-century, centered in west Texas, with cases spreading to neighboring states. Three large outbreaks in Canada, Mexico, and the US now account for the majority of measles cases across the World Health Organization’s Americas region. Experts fear the rate of infection will increase as the US health secretary spreads misleading claims about vaccines, undermining public confidence and threatening vaccine accessibility.</p>

The experience underscores the strength found in community and the importance of choosing joy and support over fear in times of adversity.</p>

          <p>Following local elections, Reform UK has gained control of several local councils, marking a significant shift in local politics. Nigel Farage aims to implement "Doge"-like efficiency measures, cutting spending on climate change initiatives and diversity programs. The party also intends to resist the accommodation of asylum seekers in their communities. While many newly-elected councillors lack political experience, Reform's deputy leader views this as an advantage, promising common-sense solutions and honest leadership.</p>

The study suggests that reintroducing captive-bred axolotls to restored wetlands can aid in the species' comeback, despite their critically endangered status. The ability to survive in man-made habitats also offers hope for mitigating habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
