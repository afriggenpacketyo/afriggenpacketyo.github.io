          <p>Emergency crews in Kerr County, Texas, have suspended search operations for the 161 people still missing from the catastrophic July 4th flash floods. The halt was prompted by a new flood threat as more heavy rain fell on the already saturated region. The original disaster along the Guadalupe River resulted in at least 132 deaths statewide, with the search and recovery efforts being intermittently hampered by difficult weather and terrain. Governor Greg Abbott has expanded the federal disaster declaration to include more counties affected by the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:09:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant 5.8% year-on-year increase in June, exceeding market predictions. This acceleration is attributed to exporters capitalizing on a temporary 90-day tariff truce with the United States to expedite shipments. Imports also saw an unexpected rise of 1.1%, contributing to a monthly trade surplus of nearly $114.8 billion. Despite ongoing trade tensions, China's trade performance has remained robust through the first half of the year, signaling some resilience in its export-oriented economy.</p>

          <p>A volatile wildfire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire expanded rapidly due to high winds, and firefighting efforts were complicated by a chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment facility, forcing evacuations. This event occurs as smoke from separate Canadian wildfires blankets the U.S. Midwest, causing widespread poor air quality. Officials have not reported any loss of life from the Grand Canyon fire, but the loss of the iconic lodge is a significant cultural blow.</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol of women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband and 50 other men who had drugged and sexually assaulted her over a decade. Her insistence on a public trial shocked the nation and was instrumental in pushing for legal reforms, including a new bill that incorporates the lack of consent into the criminal definition of sexual assault.

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, successfully avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was largely driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry issued a caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, primarily due to unclear U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans for a significant increase in France's defense spending, warning that European liberty faces its greatest threat since World War II. Citing a complex geopolitical environment and the threat from Russia's "imperialist policies," Macron called for doubling the military budget by 2027, three years ahead of schedule. In a speech to the armed forces, he emphasized that to be free, a nation must be powerful and feared. The proposal reflects a broader trend among European nations to bolster their military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Cincinnati community is in an uproar after Imam Ayman Soliman, a former hospital chaplain, was detained by ICE. His asylum status, granted in 2018 after he fled persecution in Egypt, was revoked by the U.S. government, a process that began in late 2024. His sudden arrest during a routine check-in has shocked those who know him as a respected community figure. The case has sparked urgent questions about due process for non-criminal immigrants and has mobilized local support for the detained imam.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose "illiberal democracy" playbook has earned him admirers abroad, including President Trump. However, his long-standing power is now facing a significant challenge at home from Peter Magyar, a surprise opposition figure from his own former circle. Magyar has gained traction by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of public services. As Orban's economic promises falter, Hungary may be closer than ever to a major political shift.</p>

          <p>A severe, prolonged drought is exacerbating a long-running water dispute between the United States and Mexico. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is obligated to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to the U.S., but it is currently in arrears. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue they cannot give what they don't have due to critically low reservoir levels, while Texas farmers insist they are being denied water that is rightfully theirs. The conflict highlights the growing strain that climate change is placing on international resource-sharing agreements.</p>
