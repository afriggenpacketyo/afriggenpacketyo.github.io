          <p>Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval is facing two Republican challengers, Cory Bowman (half-brother of Vice President JD Vance) and Brian Frank, in the city's nonpartisan primary. The top two vote-getters will advance to the November general election. Bowman, an evangelical pastor and coffee shop owner, says he wants to improve Cincinnati and was inspired by his brother's inauguration, while Pureval, a former special assistant U.S. attorney, is seeking reelection after winning in 2021 with nearly 66% of the vote. Voters will also decide on State Issue 2, which seeks to reauthorize $2.5 billion for infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and new tariffs on Chinese goods, e-commerce experts believe Temu and Shein will remain competitive in the U.S. market. The de minimis rule, which exempted imports under $800 from tariffs, has closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties as high as 120%. The companies are expected to onboard more American sellers and utilize local warehouses to mitigate the impact of tariffs, maintaining competitive pricing. While prices may increase, experts suggest Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and existing price advantages will allow them to compete effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ongoing purge of top military officials in China, including leaders of the Rocket Force and Gen. He Weidong, is raising questions about President Xi Jinping's plan to prepare for a potential invasion of Taiwan by 2027. This internal turmoil, potentially stemming from corruption or ideological differences, may weaken China's military readiness and Xi's appetite for war. The instability within the People's Liberation Army could offer Taiwan and the United States more time to strengthen their defenses, despite China's continued military exercises near Taiwan. Ultimately, Xi may be reluctant to risk a military failure with a scandal-plagued army.</p>

          <p>India's government has ordered civil defense drills across the country, particularly in border regions, in preparation for potential military conflict with Pakistan. Tensions have escalated following a deadly attack in Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, which Pakistan denies. The drills include testing air raid sirens and instructing civilians on blackout procedures and evacuations, signaling heightened concerns over regional security.</p>

          <p>El Salvador President Nayib Bukele ordered the arrest of five bus company heads after they defied his mandate to provide free transport for a week due to highway construction. Bukele accused them of sabotaging the country, asserting that the government would cover their usual daily income, a claim that remains unverified. This action is seen as another example of Bukele's authoritarian tactics, criticized for undermining democratic institutions and due process.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, Germany continues its effort to locate, identify, and rebury the remains of its fallen soldiers across Europe. The German War Graves Commission works to provide dignified burials, even for those who served in the Nazi military, emphasizing a humanistic goal rather than honoring the fallen. The search involves exhuming remains from old battlefields, following tips, and checking military records, with the aim of notifying surviving family members and offering closure.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz expressed disbelief and dismay at Donald Trump's proposal to reopen the former prison, with many calling the idea "insane" and impractical. Visitors emphasized the island's current role as a museum and site of Indigenous resistance, arguing that reopening it as a prison would erase its historical significance. Some suggested the proposal was a political stunt to distract from other issues, while others supported Trump's plan, viewing it as a symbol of law and order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to close a tariff loophole is expected to significantly impact delivery companies like UPS, FedEx, and DHL, which have benefited from a surge in inexpensive goods shipped from China to the U.S. The de minimis exemption, allowing tariff-free entry for goods under $800, has ended, potentially reducing shipping volumes and revenue. UPS has already projected a 25% decline in revenue from China-to-U.S. shipments, and the broader trade war may limit the ability to compensate for lost sales in other markets. To mitigate these effects, Chinese businesses may shift focus to markets outside the U.S.</p>
