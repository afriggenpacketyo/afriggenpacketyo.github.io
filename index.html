        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 115 education scholars have strongly condemned Harvard University's cancellation of a special issue of the Harvard Educational Review focused on Palestine, decrying it as censorship and a manifestation of anti-Palestinian discrimination. The issue, which aimed to examine Palestinian education and related debates amidst the Gaza conflict, was reportedly halted after the publisher demanded an unprecedented "risk assessment" by Harvard's general counsel, a move authors rejected. Critics argue this decision sets a dangerous precedent, illustrating a "Palestine exception" to academic freedom and hindering crucial knowledge dissemination, with some signatories labeling it "scholasticide" in action. This article highlights profound concerns regarding academic integrity and institutional autonomy under perceived political pressure, especially given the context of the Trump administration's pressure on Harvard.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong developer Road King has officially defaulted on its substantial offshore debts, totaling $1.51 billion, after creditors rejected proposed amendments, leading to the suspension of $22.62 million in interest payments and deferred distribution on perpetual securities. This critical development could prompt creditors to demand quicker repayment, though no such notices have been received yet. The company plans to explore a comprehensive restructuring solution, prioritizing a broader financial overhaul over using asset sales for direct note repurchases.

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has expressed "real disappointment" regarding NFL legend Tom Brady's "very unfair" comments, which questioned Rooney's work ethic during his brief 83-day stint as Birmingham City's head coach. Brady, a minority owner of the club, had voiced concerns in a documentary after a training ground visit. Rooney countered that Brady, unfamiliar with football's nuances, visited on a lighter training day and didn't fully grasp the sport's demands compared to the NFL. This article details Rooney's defense and highlights Birmingham City's subsequent struggles, including relegation, despite later significant investment and a record-breaking League One season under new leadership.</p>

          <p>Over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), have jointly urged Israel to cease the "weaponisation of aid" in Gaza, citing deepening starvation and severe restrictions on supply delivery. They claim new Israeli regulations, introduced in March, have led to dozens of aid requests being denied, preventing the delivery of critical supplies like food and medicine. While Israel asserts the rules prevent Hamas involvement and that aid is flowing, the groups argue the measures "delegitimize" and ban organizations, causing preventable deaths among vulnerable populations.

          <p>In Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, a growing number of workers, 60% in 2024, are living paycheck to paycheck, significantly higher than regional peers. This article highlights how rising living costs, particularly expensive housing and imports, combined with a cultural shift towards prioritizing experiences over savings, contribute to financial strain. Real median employment income has declined post-pandemic, making saving increasingly challenging despite a strong economy. Experts note a "debt society" trend, with younger generations less inclined to save for traditional milestones like homeownership or children. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu hydropower station, the world's fourth-largest dam, has reportedly ceased using Western industrial chips in its critical control systems due to escalating national security concerns. This strategic shift follows growing alarms over inherent vulnerabilities in industrial control systems, exemplified by historic cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus, which allegedly exploited Siemens PLCs. The decision reflects China's broader effort to reduce reliance on foreign technology for its vital infrastructure, potentially indicating a trend of technological decoupling amidst geopolitical tensions.
