          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from cutting $11 billion in public health funding.  This action followed a lawsuit filed by 23 states and the District of Columbia, who argued the cuts would severely harm public health programs. The temporary restraining order will remain in effect for two weeks, with a longer-term injunction to be considered later.  Democratic officials celebrated the ruling, highlighting the potential negative impacts on essential services.</p>
