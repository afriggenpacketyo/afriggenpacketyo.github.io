        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report backed by the London mayor calls for the decriminalization of possessing small amounts of cannabis for personal use, recommending removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act. Lord Falconer, who chaired the London Drugs Commission, argues that current laws disproportionately affect ethnic communities, particularly young Black men, through stop and search practices based on the smell of cannabis. Sir Sadiq Khan supports the report, stating that current rules "cannot be justified" and emphasizing the need for better education, healthcare, and equitable policing. The report also suggests improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and monitoring international developments for broader legalization considerations.</p>

          <p>Poland's presidential election is heading for a close runoff between Rafal Trzaskowski, a liberal-conservative, pro-European candidate, and Karol Nawrocki, a national-conservative, Euroskeptic rival. Recent polls indicate a neck-and-neck race, with a significant percentage of voters still undecided. Trzaskowski held a "March of Patriots" rally in Warsaw, receiving support from leaders of the ruling coalition, while Nawrocki organized a "March for Poland" emphasizing national community and security. The election is marked by increasingly rough rhetoric, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk warning against "common gangsters" reaching for power, referencing Nawrocki's past as a bouncer. </p>

          <p>The German Cabinet is considering a bill to curb family reunification for some migrants, particularly refugees with limited protection status. The proposed law, aligned with the coalition deal between conservatives and Social Democrats, would suspend this possibility for two years for refugees who haven't received full asylum but are allowed to stay due to potential persecution in their home countries. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt defends the bill as a means to reduce pull factors to Germany, while the Green Party criticizes it as a policy that tears families apart and hinders integration.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating allegations of "targeted violence" against religious groups after an evangelical conservative group's rally in Seattle led to clashes with counter-protesters. The "Rattle in Seattle" demonstration was held in response to the mayor's blaming Christians for inspiring violence at a previous demonstration. Eight people were arrested for assault during the dueling demonstrations, with no reported injuries. Mayor Bruce Harrell has released statements from Christian and Jewish leaders condemning the "Rattle in Seattle" protest, while organizers argue his remarks show religious bigotry and disregard their First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Chinese customs authorities are intercepting suspected smugglers of Pop Mart toys, including the popular Labubu and Molly series, as prices surge due to the retailer's global expansion. Agents have confiscated undeclared toys from travelers allegedly seeking to profit from resales, with some buying the toys overseas and bringing them back into China. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has expanded to over 500 stores in more than 30 countries, and its sought-after toys sometimes sell at lower prices abroad due to currency fluctuations and discounts. The crackdown aims to regulate the resale market and ensure fair pricing within China.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7m for breaches related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts, marking the largest penalty ever issued by the water regulator Ofwat. The fine includes Â£104.5m for sewage operation breaches and Â£18.2m for "undeserved dividends," the first time Ofwat has penalized a water company for such payouts. Thames Water is currently under a "cash lock up," preventing further dividend payments without Ofwat's approval, and it faces criticism for sewage discharges and leaks amidst a Â£20bn debt. The company serves about a quarter of the UK's population and recently secured an emergency Â£3bn to avoid collapse.</p>

While some shoppers joked about the technology, others complained it was a step too far, potentially leading to increased surveillance.

          <p>SpaceX's latest Starship flight reached space but failed to complete its return, experiencing a propellant leak and spinning out of control, leading to its disintegration during reentry. The debris fell into the Indian Ocean, away from populated areas. Despite the setback, SpaceX achieved progress, including reaching the scheduled engine cutoff and minimal heat shield tile loss during ascent. Elon Musk stated the next three test flights would occur more frequently, every three to four weeks, though progress on Starship has been slower than initially projected.</p>

          <p>The UN's weather agency reports a 70% chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 will exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius benchmark, set by the 2015 Paris climate accords. This comes after the planet experienced the two hottest years on record in 2023 and 2024. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) forecasts global temperatures to remain at historic levels, with growing negative impacts on economies, daily lives, ecosystems, and the planet. Many climate scientists now believe the 1.5-degree target is unattainable due to rising CO2 emissions.</p>
