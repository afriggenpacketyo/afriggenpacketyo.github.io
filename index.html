          <p>A confidential report by the UN nuclear watchdog reveals that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, reaching 900.8 pounds as of May 17, a nearly 50% increase since February. The IAEA expressed serious concern, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, which is a short technical step from weapons-grade levels. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the U.S. has sent a detailed proposal to Iran, urging them to accept it, while Israel has warned that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program. The IAEA has requested Iran to fully cooperate with its investigation into uranium traces discovered at undeclared sites. </p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggesting that a "McMigraine Meal" (Coke and fries) can cure migraines is being questioned by health experts. While some migraine sufferers report temporary relief from the caffeine and sugar in Coke or the salt in fries, experts caution against relying on fast food as a regular treatment. Dr. Kay Kennis notes that caffeine can disrupt nerve activity, but excessive caffeine can also trigger migraines, and fast food often contains tyramine, which can worsen migraines. Neurologist Prof Peter Goadsby emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes and consulting medical professionals for effective migraine management.</p>

          <p>Ryan Coogler's film *Sinners*, set in 1932 Clarksdale, Mississippi, is bringing renewed attention to the historic town, known as the birthplace of blues music. The film's success has led to free screenings in Clarksdale, which had lost its only movie theater in 2003, thanks to a local campaign and Coogler's support. The movie, blending elements of musicals, horror, and period drama, captures the soul and history of the Mississippi Delta, according to Clarksdale native Tyler Yarbrough. Local residents appreciate Coogler's careful respect for their culture and hope the film will boost tourism and provide a better understanding of the town's rich heritage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in its upcoming spending review, citing the need to balance priorities like the NHS, defense, and schools. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact other "unprotected" areas, potentially leading to real-terms cuts. The government's commitment to increasing defense spending further complicates the situation, requiring even larger cuts elsewhere. Chancellor Rachel Reeves' stance against borrowing more money and raising taxes adds to the pressure to make difficult spending decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into effect across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. The ban targets the rise in youth vaping, with disposable vapes being a key driver, while also addressing the environmental issue of millions of vapes being thrown away annually. While rechargeable and refillable devices are still permitted, retailers face fines for breaching the ban. Health experts emphasize that further regulation is needed to fully tackle youth vaping, even as vaping is considered less harmful than smoking.</p>

          <p>Eric Spofford, the former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers in New Hampshire, was arrested for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to stalk journalists who published an investigation detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Spofford is accused of hiring individuals to vandalize and threaten the homes of the targeted journalists and their families. Several individuals involved in the harassment campaign have already been convicted and sentenced. Spofford had previously sued New Hampshire Public Radio for defamation, but the lawsuit was dismissed in 2023.</p>
