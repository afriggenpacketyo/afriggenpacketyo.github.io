          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish on stage 17. The Lidl-Trek rider navigated a rain-soaked final 30 kilometers and avoided a late crash that involved several of his main rivals. This victory strengthens his hold on the green jersey for the points classification, while Tadej Pogacar safely retained the overall leader's yellow jersey with no changes in the general classification.</p>

Barcelona will cover all of Rashford's wages, saving United a significant sum. The move follows a difficult period for Rashford at Old Trafford, where his form declined and he faced criticism from management, leading to him being excluded from first-team training.</p>
