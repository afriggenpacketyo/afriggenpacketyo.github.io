            <h2>Zelensky Accuses Russia of Violating Easter Truce</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 01:23:24 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Despite Vladimir Putin's announcement of an "Easter truce," Volodymyr Zelensky claims that Russian attacks are ongoing, raising doubts about Moscow's commitment to de-escalation. Zelensky stated that Ukraine would adhere to the truce if Russia truly engaged in a format of full and unconditional silence, but he accused Moscow of breaking it and indicated a willingness to extend the truce beyond the proposed 30 hours if Russia demonstrates genuine commitment. Ukraine's Foreign Minister also expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need to observe actions rather than trust words given the history of unfulfilled promises. The UK Foreign Office echoed this sentiment, urging Putin to demonstrate seriousness about peace by ending the invasion and committing to a full ceasefire.</p>

            <p>Eddy Massaad, CEO of Swiss Butter, credits the brand's growth to its unique steak sauce and the resilience fostered by his Lebanese background. Despite the destruction of his original Beirut restaurant in 2020, Massaad reopened it within 30 days, showcasing his pragmatic problem-solving skills. Swiss Butter began its expansion in late 2021, opening 10 restaurants within a year, including its first London location, and is now aiming for 100 locations within five years.

            <p>The Indiana legislature has passed a bill to establish the Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission, signaling the first step in a long-shot plan to acquire parts of Illinois.

While the Indiana government supports the idea, approval from the Illinois government and the U.S. Congress is necessary, and Illinois officials have expressed opposition. The effort reflects broader political tensions between the Democrat-controlled Chicago area and the Republican-represented regions of Illinois.</p>

He warned that an anti-net zero agenda would not only risk climate breakdown but also jeopardize future clean energy jobs. Despite the UK's legal commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, some political figures and trade unions have voiced concerns about the potential economic consequences for traditional industries.</p>
