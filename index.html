          <p>Following a period of disarray within NATO, European leaders are struggling to project a unified and independent geopolitical front as they approach a significant summit with China. Despite numerous discussions on achieving strategic autonomy, Europe's perceived weakness on the global stage has been highlighted in recent summits. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte commented on the challenges, suggesting that Europe's current position could lead to significant consequences. The article explores the continent's difficulty in translating ambitions of geopolitical independence into coherent action amid complex international relations.</p>

          <p>Jake Paul secured a unanimous decision victory against former middleweight champion Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. but was met with a hostile, booing crowd in Anaheim, California. In his post-fight interview, Paul defiantly told the audience to "shut the f--- up," stating that his actions in the ring speak louder than their words. The bout saw Paul control the majority of the fight against a largely inactive ChÃ¡vez, who only mounted a significant offense in the later rounds. The win improves Paul's record to 12-1, continuing his controversial but lucrative boxing career.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium for a potential bomb within a matter of months, despite recent US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities. Contradicting claims that the program was obliterated, Grossi explained that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart production. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) remains concerned about the location of previously enriched uranium. This assessment comes as Iran's parliament voted to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, further complicating diplomatic efforts for a long-term solution.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul earned a unanimous points victory over a lackluster Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. in a cruiserweight bout in California.

Despite a late surge from ChÃ¡vez in the ninth round, the judges scored the fight decisively in Paul's favor.

Activists argue that patriarchal norms, which perceive publicly visible women as a threat to cultural values, fuel this hostility.

The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but argued it was not premeditated.

After merging with British venture OneWeb, Eutelsat is the only European operator with a functional Low Earth Orbit (LEO) network, a key asset for the EU's technological sovereignty goals. However, experts note Eutelsat faces significant challenges, as its LEO constellation of 650 satellites is dwarfed by Starlink's over 7,600. Achieving parity will require massive investment to expand the constellation and upgrade its technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, an island group administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from the mainland Chinese city of Xiamen, serves as a unique example of the geopolitical stalemate in the Taiwan Strait. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transitioned into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance, on-the-ground observations suggest there are clear limits to the influence both Beijing and Taipei can exert over the island's 130,000 residents. The island remains a strategic, yet complex, piece in the cross-strait relationship.</p>

          <p>With a critical House of Councillors election looming, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has urged senior members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to unite. His appeal for solidarity is aimed at maintaining the coalition government with its partner, the Komeito party. The call comes after the LDP suffered its worst-ever result in a recent Tokyo assembly election, a setback attributed to ongoing money scandals and a shift in voter support towards smaller parties. Losing their upper house majority could jeopardize Ishiba's position and significantly alter Japan's political landscape.</p>

The rocket has now been officially replaced by the next-generation H3 rocket. The new model is designed to be more cost-effective, offering a lower price for launch services to remain competitive in the global space industry.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. This move would allow them to produce and deploy land mines as part of a new, heavily fortified border strategy. The plan is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end. Proponents argue it is a necessary deterrent, while human rights organizations warn against creating a new, explosive "Iron Curtain" with devastating long-term consequences.</p>

Hulme reported that his initial complaints to both the police and the Bishop of Leicester were dismissed, with the bishop even accusing him of witchcraft.

          <p>Following a disappointing single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. National team members lived together in a "virtual athletes' village" during a recent competition, an exercise aimed at accustoming them to the challenges of communal living and unfamiliar environments typical of an Olympics. Officials hope this approach will build resilience and team morale, enabling athletes to perform at their best even under less-than-ideal conditions, such as travel delays or sleeping in close quarters.</p>
