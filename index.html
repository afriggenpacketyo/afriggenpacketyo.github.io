          <p>Lululemon shares have experienced a significant drop as the company navigates the impact of Trump administration tariffs and broader economic uncertainties. The athleisure brand has joined a growing list of companies warning about the effects of U.S. trade policies, citing lower store traffic and inflationary pressures. In response, Lululemon plans to implement strategic price increases on a portion of its products and cut costs, as clothing and footwear brands are particularly affected by tariffs on goods made in Asian countries. Other companies, such as Adidas, Skechers, and Nike, have also reported similar challenges related to import taxes and economic uncertainty (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The Tokyo High Court reversed a district court's decision that had found the executives liable for compensation after the combined impact of an earthquake and tsunami caused one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. The appeal trial focused on whether the management's decisions on tsunami countermeasures were appropriate, and the court's decision acquits the former executives of liability.</p>

The company believes its lunar lander Resilience impacted the Moon's surface after failing to slow sufficiently during its descent. This follows an unsuccessful attempt in April 2023, and the CEO expressed a desire to catch up with U.S. companies that have already achieved this feat. The company's first attempt to reach the Moon's northern hemisphere in April 2023 with a different spacecraft was also unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>Driven by concerns around ultra-processed foods, more retailers and food brands are offering items with fewer ingredients. Consumers with allergies and food sensitivities are driving demand for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. Plant-based brand THIS recently launched a new Super Superfoods range in response to surveys indicating that shoppers are avoiding meat replacement products due to their processed nature and the presence of artificial additives. Nutritionists caution that simply reducing ingredients can sometimes lead to the omission of fortified nutrients, and food scientists note that processed foods will remain essential for feeding a large population, and that new technologies can help produce products with higher nutritional retention and longer shelf life without significantly altering the physical structure and chemical composition of the food.</p>

The test marked a key step in Chinaâ€™s transition from experimental validation to the construction of a fully integrated space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network, according to the academy. QSDC is considered complementary to quantum key distribution (QKD), skipping the key-sharing step and sending the actual message directly through a quantum channel.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in detention, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. In many states, time spent in detention before adjudication doesn't count toward any incarceration they may face, extending their confinement and negatively impacting their rehabilitation. Policy experts argue that this lack of time credit stems from the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to disparities and unequal treatment. The article highlights the challenges faced by young people in detention, the financial costs of the system, and the need for reforms to ensure fairness and due process.</p>
