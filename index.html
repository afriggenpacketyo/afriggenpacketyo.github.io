          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its microchips contain any 'backdoors' that would permit unauthorized remote access or control. This statement follows a meeting where Chinese regulators summoned company officials to address national security concerns regarding its H20 AI chips, which are designed for the Chinese market. The scrutiny from Beijing comes amid calls from some U.S. lawmakers to implement mandatory tracking features on advanced chip exports. This situation highlights the geopolitical tensions Nvidia faces while navigating between U.S. semiconductor policies and the valuable Chinese market.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's parliament has passed constitutional amendments that extend the presidential term to six years and remove all limits on reelection. The changes, approved by a supermajority of President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party, will allow the incumbent to run for office indefinitely. The reforms also eliminated the need for a second-round runoff in presidential elections, further consolidating Bukele's power. Opposition lawmakers have decried the move as the death of democracy in the country, criticizing its swift passage during a holiday period.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have issued responses to the Trump administration's newly announced schedule of 'reciprocal' tariffs. Nations like Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief after their tariff rates were significantly reduced from previously announced levels, viewing it as a positive development for their economies. In contrast, Taiwan faces a 20% tariff pending further negotiations, while India, having not reached a deal, is subject to a 25% rate. The varied reactions highlight the widespread economic impact and uncertainty created by the U.S. trade policy across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the widespread financial anxiety and burnout experienced by millennial women, even after years of diligently working and following their passions. The author argues that systemic issues, such as the undervaluing of female-dominated and creative labor, contribute to a persistent state of precarity. Comparing her generation's financial standing to that of her parents, she reflects on the broken promise that hard work would lead to stability. The article highlights a collective feeling of being overworked, underpaid, and caught in a system not designed for their success.</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait are deepening their military relationship, highlighted by the imminent opening of a joint ammunition factory. At a recent event, Kuwait's deputy defense minister called the project a 'milestone' in their cooperation. The two nations have also committed to expanding joint military training programs, which have been ongoing since 2019. This development signifies Beijing's increasing engagement and strengthening ties in the Gulf region, building on a military cooperation agreement first signed with Kuwait, a key U.S. ally, back in 1995.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $200 million in federal science and medical research grants allocated to UCLA. The government cited the university's alleged 'deliberate indifference' to the civil rights of Jewish students and a failure to prevent antisemitism on campus as the reasons for the punitive action. UCLA's chancellor called the decision 'deeply disappointing,' arguing that defunding life-saving research does not address the underlying allegations.

While some nations saw their proposed rates lowered, the order solidifies a more aggressive U.S. trade posture and increases costs for many trading partners who have not finalized individual deals.

The government also increased the amount students can borrow through maintenance loans to help with rising living costs. The fee hike comes after universities warned of significant funding pressures due to high inflation and a decline in the number of international students. This change adds to the financial burden on students, who are already facing sharp increases in accommodation and other daily expenses.</p>

          <p>Despite having low projected playoff chances, the Los Angeles Angels chose to be modest buyers at the MLB trade deadline instead of selling major assets. The team acquired two veteran relief pitchers and an infielder, moves aimed at bolstering the current roster. General Manager Perry Minasian explained the strategy is to provide the team's young core with the experience of playing meaningful, competitive games in August and September. This approach prioritizes short-term competitiveness and player development over a long-term rebuild through trading established players for prospects.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans for the construction of a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom on its grounds. President Trump described the project, which will be funded by himself and other 'patriot donors,' as his 'gift to the country.' The new building will replace the current East Wing and is designed to host large-scale events that currently require the use of temporary tents on the South Lawn. This represents the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire fund, which officials warn could be exhausted by early next year. The plan calls for the state's three largest for-profit utilities—PG&E, Southern California Edison, and SDG&E—to contribute $9 billion from shareholders. The remaining $9 billion would be paid by their customers through a 10-year extension of an existing surcharge on their monthly bills. The proposal faces criticism from both consumer advocacy groups and utility executives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Testimony at a Texas state hearing revealed that top emergency officials in Kerr County were either asleep or out of town when catastrophic flash floods struck, killing at least 95 people. The county's emergency management coordinator and sheriff both testified they were asleep, while the county's top executive was away. The officials stated they had no warning of the storm's devastating magnitude from the National Weather Service. Their absence during the initial hours of the disaster has fueled criticism over the adequacy of the region's emergency preparedness and response.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data for the first five months of President Trump's second term shows that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests were heavily concentrated in Southern and border states. Texas alone accounted for nearly a quarter of the more than 109,000 arrests. Overall, ICE arrests have increased by 120% compared to the same period in 2024 under the previous administration. Experts attribute the geographic concentration to local law enforcement cooperation with ICE and the demographics of immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study published in the journal 'Cell' has revealed that the modern potato likely evolved from an ancient hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a wild potato species around 9 million years ago. Researchers discovered that a crucial gene from the ancient tomato, combined with a gene from the wild species, enabled the development of the starchy tubers that characterize potatoes today. This finding solves a long-standing puzzle about the origin of one of the world's most important food crops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a CBS News investigation, China is systematically evading U.S. sanctions by using a 'dark fleet' of tankers to secretly purchase oil from Iran. The illicit ship-to-ship transfers are conducted in international waters, where vessels turn off their tracking transponders and obscure their identities to avoid detection. This trade, which props up the Iranian regime with billions of dollars, undermines U.S. foreign policy and continues to grow despite multiple rounds of sanctions. China does not recognize the unilateral U.S. sanctions and considers its trade with Iran legitimate.</p>
