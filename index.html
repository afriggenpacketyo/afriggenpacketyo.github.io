          <p>The trial of Erin Patterson, accused of murdering relatives with a beef Wellington containing death cap mushrooms, continues with prosecutors alleging she calculated a lethal dose using kitchen scales. Patterson denies intentionally adding the poisonous fungi to the meal, claiming it was a tragic accident. The prosecution presented images from Patterson's phone depicting mushrooms being weighed, suggesting she knowingly foraged them. Patterson admits to deleting electronic data fearing blame but denies intentionally poisoning her guests, stating that she may have accidentally used dried, foraged mushrooms from a shared container with store-bought ones. The trial is ongoing, with Patterson facing cross-examination.</p>

          <p>The fragile US-China trade truce is unraveling as both countries accuse each other of violating the terms of the agreement. The US is frustrated with China's stalling on export license approvals for rare earths, while China points to US curbs on chip design software and warnings about AI chips produced by Huawei. The US seeks to cut its trade deficit with China and eliminate non-tariff barriers, while China has doubled down on reducing its dependence on US technology. With the 90-day pause expiring soon, the prospects for a lasting ceasefire remain uncertain, and a potential call between Presidents Trump and Xi is anticipated to break the deadlock.

Ramsey recounts her experiences battling the August Complex fire, the largest in California's history, and the physical and mental stamina required to be a hotshot. The article emphasizes the role of climate change in exacerbating wildfires, leading to prolonged droughts and increased ember activity. Ramsey left firefighting due to an autoimmune disorder after two seasons, joining the estimated 45% of wildland firefighters who leave each year due to health issues, low pay, and stress.

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss jabs that they must use effective contraception due to potential risks to unborn babies. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro, and for a specific period afterward. Concerns have arisen that the growing popularity of these 'skinny jabs' may lead to unsafe usage or inadequate advice. The MHRA has received reports of unintended pregnancies and emphasizes the importance of consulting with a prescriber about the risks and benefits.</p>

Some analysts believe the Thunder's superior metrics and depth will lead to a victory in five games, while others suggest the Pacers' pace and ball movement could disrupt the Thunder's rhythm. The series presents a stylistic matchup between two homegrown teams, with the coaching advantage leaning towards Mark Daigneault of the Thunder.</p>

The decline in user engagement is also reflected in both platforms' Apple App Store rankings, which have fallen.

          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan, Family Mart and Lawson, have begun selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka. This initiative aims to increase the availability of rice for consumers struggling with soaring prices. The rice, from the 2021 harvest, is sold in small portions to make it affordable for individuals, including those living alone. Seven-Eleven Japan Co. will also start selling stockpiled rice in some stores on June 17.</p>

          <p>Automotive industry groups are expressing increasing concern over a potential rare earth shortage due to China's export controls. Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already been shut down, with warnings of more outages as inventories deplete. China imposed export restrictions on several rare earth elements and magnets widely used in the automotive, defense, and energy sectors in response to US President Donald Trump's tariff increase. Some affected rare earth elements are vital components for both combustion engines and electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the militarization of the US-Mexico border under President Trump, including the deployment of Stryker combat vehicles and thousands of soldiers. The deployment is intended to stop what Trump calls an "invasion" at the border, but crossings have slowed significantly. The article discusses the legal implications of using the military for domestic law enforcement, particularly the Posse Comitatus Act. Critics argue that Trump is bypassing this act by creating National Defense Areas along the border, effectively turning parts of the border into military installations.</p>

Despite a historic start to the season, the Dodgers have been inconsistent, with their pitching staff ERA being a concern. Manager Dave Roberts attributed the team's struggles to the lack of run prevention, particularly the inability to secure quality starts and consistent innings from the bullpen. The Dodgers' only run came from Andy Pages' solo home run, but the team's overall performance has been affected by injuries and a lack of clutch hitting.</p>
