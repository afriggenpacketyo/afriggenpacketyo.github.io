            <p>White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett stated that numerous countries have offered the U.S. "amazing" trade deals following President Trump's tariff impositions, while also confidently dismissing any possibility of a U.S. recession in 2025. Hassett indicated that Trump, along with trade officials, are evaluating these offers, considering whether to proceed with individual agreements or a comprehensive package. This optimistic outlook contrasts with an industry survey revealing that a majority of U.S. CEOs anticipate an economic downturn within six months. He also denied any insider trading by Trump or White House officials ahead of the president's monthslong pause in so-called reciprocal tariffs last week. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker, accused of conspiring to murder Fabio Sementilli, were photographed together at a family memorial shortly after his death, raising suspicions among relatives and friends.

DNA from the blood at the crime scene matched Baker, leading to his arrest along with Monica Sementilli, who was found guilty of murder and conspiracy for masterminding the murder of her husband Fabio.

The prosecution presented evidence of Monica's affair and actions on the day of the murder, including alleged remote monitoring of her home surveillance cameras.
