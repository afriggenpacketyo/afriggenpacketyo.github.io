          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence tools to improve their online dating prospects. Apps like Rizz and Keepler function as AI-powered "wingmen," helping users craft witty messages, navigate conversations, and even handle difficult situations like ghosting. While these services can boost confidence for those who struggle with writing, their rising popularity raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest the technology is useful as a supplement to human connection but caution against it becoming a substitute.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods if the Trump administration follows through on a threat to levy a 50% tariff on Brazilian products. The U.S. threat is linked to the criminal trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, an ally of Trump, representing a direct use of trade policy to influence another nation's domestic legal affairs. This development risks a trade war between the two largest economies in the Americas and has created rare political unity within Brazil against what is seen as foreign interference.

          <p>A preliminary report from India's aviation investigators on the fatal Air India crash reveals that the fuel control switches for both engines were moved from "run" to "cutoff" just seconds after takeoff. This action starved the engines of fuel, causing the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to lose thrust and crash, killing all 260 people on board and 19 on the ground. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so, leaving the reason for the critical action unclear.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a civil lawsuit against Brant Frost IV, a prominent figure in Georgia's Republican party, for allegedly running a massive Ponzi scheme. The complaint claims his company, First Liberty Building and Loan, defrauded around 300 investors out of at least $140 million by using new investor funds to pay off earlier ones. Frost is also accused of misappropriating over $19 million for personal expenses, including jewelry, rare coins, and political contributions, while his business was collapsing.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has thrown out a plea agreement for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his co-defendants, who are accused of planning the September 11th attacks. The deal would have allowed the men to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, avoiding the death penalty. The court ruled that the former Secretary of Defense had the authority to overrule the agreement, a decision that undoes years of negotiations. This ruling ensures the controversial and long-stalled military prosecution will continue indefinitely, leaving no clear path to a trial or resolution.</p>

          <p>Two prison employees in Arkansas have been fired for policy violations that allowed Grant Hardin, a convicted murderer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," to escape. Officials stated that one guard allowed Hardin unsupervised access to a kitchen dock, while another opened a gate for him without proper identification. Hardin, who escaped wearing a makeshift uniform, was captured after nearly two weeks. While the two employees were held directly responsible, lawmakers have raised concerns about deeper systemic problems within the corrections facility that facilitated the escape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, set to begin on August 1st. In a letter posted on social media, Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and the bilateral trade deficit as justifications for the new levy. This move escalates trade tensions between the two closely integrated economies, even as they approach a deadline to finalize a new trade agreement. The threat is part of a broader tariff strategy the administration is deploying against multiple U.S. trade partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is set to lose its spot in the Europa League to Nottingham Forest due to UEFA's multi-club ownership regulations. The issue stems from Crystal Palace's part-owner, John Textor, also holding a stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified for the competition. Because Palace missed a key deadline to alter its ownership structure to comply with the rules, UEFA has ruled them ineligible. As a result, Nottingham Forest, the next eligible English club, is poised to take their place, a decision Palace is expected to appeal.</p>

Despite this monthly positive, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.34 trillion, and the cost of servicing the national debt continues to be a major expense. (not investment advice)</p>
