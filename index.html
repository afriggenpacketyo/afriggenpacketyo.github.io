          <p>The United States has indicated it may impose secondary sanctions on India and China for their continued purchases of Russian oil, a critical revenue source for Moscow's war in Ukraine. Both nations have defended their actions, citing needs for energy security and economic sovereignty, while highlighting that Western nations also continue to import Russian energy. India, in particular, has significantly increased its Russian oil imports since 2022, benefiting from discounted prices and saving an estimated $33 billion, which has helped stabilize global markets.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute has identified the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as the most frequently stolen vehicle in the U.S., with a theft rate 39 times higher than average. The analysis found that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks are common targets for thieves. In contrast, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, a trend the institute attributes to them often being parked in secure garages for charging and having better tracking capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new wave of sweeping US tariffs, ranging from 10% to 41%, has taken effect on goods from dozens of countries, escalating global trade tensions. The levies are part of President Trump's "reciprocal" trade policy, which aims to rebalance trade deficits but risks increasing prices for consumers. While some partners like the UK and EU secured modified rates through negotiations, others like Brazil face steep increases, and countries such as Switzerland are still attempting to avert the high duties.

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 100% tariff on imported computer chips has sent mixed signals through Asian semiconductor markets. Japanese chip-related stocks like Tokyo Electron and Renesas Electronics saw declines, fearing the impact of the steep levy. However, shares for South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC rose, as both companies have made significant investments in US-based manufacturing facilities and are expected to be exempt from the new rule.

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order threatening to impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, which would bring the total rate to 50%. The move is a direct response to India's continued purchasing of Russian oil, which the White House claims undermines efforts to counter Russia's actions in Ukraine. The new tariff is set to take effect in 21 days, a decision India's foreign ministry has labeled as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable." (not investment advice)</p>
