          <p>A submersible exploring Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered dense ecosystems flourishing on unexploded Nazi-era bombs from World War II. Researchers were astonished to find tens of thousands of animals, including starfish, crabs, and marine worms, colonizing the munitions, turning instruments of death into life-sustaining habitats. This "rare but remarkable" finding highlights nature's resilience and its ability to adapt to human-made structures on the seafloor, even those containing toxic materials. The discovery offers a unique, if ironic, look at how wildlife can reclaim and repurpose remnants of human conflict.</p>

          <p>A London court has thrown out the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap known as Mo Chara. He was charged with supporting the proscribed organization Hezbollah after allegedly displaying a flag at a concert, a charge he denied and described as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" and "null" due to a technical error in how it was brought forward by prosecutors. The decision was met with applause in the courtroom and celebrated by supporters as a victory against political policing.</p>

          <p>A major sting operation coordinated by Interpol across 14 African nations has led to the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of running extensive cybercrime networks. The operation targeted criminals engaged in romance scams and "sextortion," where victims are blackmailed with explicit images, resulting in estimated losses of nearly $2.8 million. Authorities in countries like Ghana, Senegal, and Ivory Coast dismantled 81 cyber-crime groups and seized numerous devices and forged documents. The crackdown highlights the sharp rise in digital-enabled crime in the region and ongoing international efforts to combat these fraudulent activities.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reveals her candid reaction to the Biden campaign's attempt at damage control following his poor debate performance against Donald Trump in June 2024. Harris recalls being given talking points declaring "JOE BIDEN WON" and being instructed to dismiss what viewers had seen with their own eyes. She describes throwing the paper on the table and internally refusing to be fed "bulls--t," opting instead to pivot her media interviews to focus on Trump's falsehoods. The book provides an inside look at the turmoil within the campaign as it grappled with the fallout from the pivotal event.</p>

          <p>As global trade tensions escalate, Beijing has a variety of measures at its disposal to protect its domestic industries and respond to actions from partners like the United States. Beyond traditional anti-dumping investigations, China's policy toolbox includes mechanisms like the "Unreliable Entity List," which can restrict trade and investment with foreign firms deemed to harm Chinese interests. The country has also implemented stricter export controls on "dual-use" items, which are goods that have both civilian and potential military applications.

          <p>The number of detainee deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody has reached at least 16 since January, raising serious concerns among lawmakers and advocacy groups. This figure marks a significant increase in the monthly death rate compared to the previous administration, even when accounting for a record-high detainee population that surpassed 60,000 in August. Critics point to "horrendous conditions" and an inherently inhumane system, while ICE maintains it provides comprehensive medical care in safe environments. The rising death toll has prompted calls for immediate information and a plan from the Trump administration to prevent further fatalities.</p>

          <p>The impending sale of TikTok's U.S. assets to a group of American investors, including billionaires Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch, highlights a growing trend of media ownership concentration among the ultra-rich. This development raises concerns about the control of information on a platform where one in five Americans, and nearly half of young adults, now get their news. The article suggests that when billionaires with significant political and business interests control major news purveyors, it can lead to self-censorship and a shaping of public discourse to favor their agendas. This consolidation of power threatens to further erode the independence of media at a critical time.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has made the creation of a network of city-owned grocery stores a central plank of his campaign platform. The proposal aims to lower food prices for residents by operating on a non-profit basis and avoiding costs like rent and property taxes. While the idea has found support among many likely voters, it has drawn sharp criticism from private supermarket executives, who argue it is unrealistic and misunderstands the complexities of the grocery business.

Critics argue the case, even if weak, forces the congresswoman to expend significant personal and campaign funds on legal defense, effectively punishing her through process.

This plan is one of several being considered for the future governance of the territory following the conflict.

Despite Trump's claim that he received a "go ahead" from Chinese President Xi Jinping, Chinese state media has not commented on the agreement, and the ultimate fate of the app still requires Beijing's approval. Details of the deal remain partially unclear, but it involves creating a new U.S.-based joint venture to oversee data and algorithms, with TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, retaining a minority stake.

To meet overwhelming demand and combat scalpers, Pop Mart significantly ramped up production, increasing its monthly output of plush toys tenfold compared to last year. This strategy appears to be stabilizing the market, shifting the focus from short-term profit to long-term brand sustainability. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House budget would eliminate all funding for English language learners, while the House proposal targets Title I funding, which supports schools in low-income communities.

Scholars note this incident echoes a historical pattern of wrongly blaming mothers for autism, such as the discredited "refrigerator mom" theory of the mid-20th century, which attributed the condition to a lack of maternal warmth. This history of seeking singular, simplistic causes for a complex neurodevelopmental condition has often fueled stigma and placed an undue burden on parents. The current claims about Tylenol are seen as a continuation of this trend, creating unnecessary guilt and potentially risky health choices for pregnant women.</p>

          <p>London-based fintech firm Checkout.com has announced a share buyback program for employees, setting its new internal valuation at $12 billion. This figure represents a significant drop from the $40 billion valuation it achieved during a funding round in 2022, reflecting a broader market correction in the tech sector. The company, which competes with payment processors like Stripe and Adyen, stated the move is designed to provide employees with a path to liquidity as many tech companies are staying private for longer. Despite the lower valuation, Checkout.com reports it is on track for strong revenue growth and is forecasting $300 billion in annual e-commerce payment volume. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BMW is recalling 196,355 vehicles in the United States, including several of its own models and some Toyota Supras, due to a potential fire risk. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that the engine starter relay in the affected vehicles may corrode, which could lead to overheating and a short circuit. The recall covers various models manufactured between 2019 and 2022, including the popular 330i, Z4, and X3 series. Owners are being advised to park their vehicles outside and away from structures until the issue is repaired, and dealers will replace the faulty part free of charge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled a new set of industry-focused tariffs, including a 100% levy on imported branded pharmaceuticals unless the manufacturer is building a factory in the U.S. The new measures also include a 25% import tax on heavy-duty trucks and a 50% tax on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, which Trump stated is necessary to protect American manufacturers from being "flooded" by foreign products. This latest wave of tariffs expands on the administration's protectionist trade policies, which have been a key feature of his second term. The move comes despite calls from U.S. business groups to avoid further tariffs, which they argue will raise costs for industries and consumers.</p>

          <p>Canadian apparel brand Arc'teryx is facing intense public criticism and a government investigation after a marketing campaign involving fireworks at the foothills of the Himalayas. The event, intended to promote the brand's connection to nature, was quickly condemned on social media for posing a risk to a fragile ecosystem and for being hypocritical for an environmentally-conscious brand. The company's public response, which sought to distance its global team from its local team in China, and reports of debris left on the mountain slopes have further fueled the outrage. The incident has become a cautionary tale in brand marketing, highlighting the damage that can occur when a company's actions contradict its stated values.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has stated that his country will continue to purchase fossil fuels from Russia, despite a recent demand from his ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. Orbán said he informed Trump that cutting off Russian energy would be an economic "disaster" for Hungary, causing its economic performance to drop by 4% and bringing the economy "to its knees." Hungary is one of the few EU nations that has not weaned itself off Russian oil and gas since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, citing geographical and infrastructural constraints. The stance underscores the ongoing tension between Hungary's economic interests and the broader Western strategy to isolate Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After 25 years of negotiations, members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have finally agreed to ratify a deal to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies. The agreement is a significant achievement for the institution, which has struggled to secure multilateral deals, and is being viewed by some diplomats as a welcome sign that multilateralism is not in full retreat. The deal's success, coupled with China's recent announcement that it will no longer use its "developing country" status to delay trade liberalization, provides a much-needed boost for the WTO. This progress comes at a time of widespread skepticism about global institutions, fueled in part by criticism from leaders like U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that he will move 2026 World Cup matches away from any of the 11 scheduled U.S. host cities if he considers them to be unsafe. While FIFA is officially in charge of tournament organization and city selection, Trump's statement suggests a potential political intervention in the major international sporting event. The president, who chairs the World Cup taskforce, specifically mentioned Democratic-run cities like Seattle and San Francisco when making the remarks. This threat aligns with his broader political agenda of tackling crime in cities governed by his political opponents, but it is unclear if he has the authority to make such changes.</p>

          <p>Emma Webber, the mother of Barnaby Webber who was killed in the 2023 Nottingham attacks, has described the police watchdog as "inhumane" and untrustworthy. Her comments follow reports that staff from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) suggested to officers under investigation that the inquiry was "politically motivated" by the victims' families. The IOPC is investigating Leicestershire Police's prior contact with the killer, Valdo Calocane, and has since removed some staff from the case and commissioned an external review. Mrs. Webber stated the allegations are indicative of the "car crash of our institutions" that has failed her family and led to a public inquiry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a new U.S. port fee targeting Chinese vessels, shipping carriers are already beginning to reduce the deployment of Chinese-built ships on transpacific routes, according to a shipping consultancy. Analysis shows a downward trend in the share of Chinese vessels on routes from Asia to the North American west coast in recent weeks. This proactive move by carriers appears to be an attempt to dodge the financial impact of the impending U.S. policy. The trend suggests that the market is already adapting to the new trade measure before it is even implemented, highlighting how businesses are navigating the ongoing economic tensions between the U.S. and China.
