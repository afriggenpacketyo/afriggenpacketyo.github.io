          <h2>Waymo Aims to Double Robotaxi Production in Arizona by 2026</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waymo and Magna International plan to double robotaxi production at their Mesa, Arizona plant by the end of 2026, increasing capacity to over 2,000 Jaguar I-PACE vehicles and eventually tens of thousands of fully autonomous vehicles per year. The expansion will support Waymo's growing commercial robotaxi service, which currently operates in several major cities and plans to expand to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C. in 2026. Waymo is also exploring partnerships with Toyota to bring self-driving technology to personally owned vehicles, and the company is in competition with Tesla, which plans to launch its own robotaxi service in Austin. The article highlights the differences in technology and approach between Waymo and Tesla, with Waymo using more sophisticated and expensive sensors. Optimism about Waymo's ability to produce robotaxis is high as they continue to beat Tesla to market with the product.</p>

          <h2>Trump Falsely Claims Low Gas Prices to Pressure Federal Reserve</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices had fallen below $2 per gallon to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. This claim is inaccurate as U.S. drivers are paying an average of $3.165 per gallon, which is an increase since Trump took office. While RBOB gasoline futures did touch $1.98 per gallon, this contract doesn't reflect retail prices as it excludes taxes, transportation, and other costs. The article emphasizes that RBOB is only relevant to analysts and wholesalers, not consumers, and that Trump's claim is misleading.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has decided not to run for Senate in 2026, depriving Republicans of their strongest potential challenger against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Despite being heavily courted by top Republicans, Kemp announced his decision, stating that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for him and his family. Kemp's decision leaves the field open for other Republican candidates, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mike Collins, and others, and this news comes as Kemp continues to raise funds, leaving open the possibility he may seek higher office in 2028. Ossoff, who has raised $11 million in the first quarter of 2025, is preparing for a tough race.</p>

Trump claims he wants to help the industry, which he believes has been decimated by other countries and incompetence in Los Angeles. However, the White House clarified that no final decision has been made on the tariffs, as the administration explores options to safeguard national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again. The article notes that spending on films and television series made in the United States has been declining, while spending on foreign productions has increased due to tax incentives and foreign exchange rates.</p>

          <p>TeleMessage, a messaging app used by former President Donald Trump's national security advisor, has temporarily suspended services following a reported hack.

A photo showed Trump's former national security advisor using the app to communicate with high-ranking officials, and the White House has defended the use of Signal within the administration.</p>

          <p>Nineteen states and Washington, D.C., have sued the Trump administration over mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), arguing that the job cuts have brought work at large swaths of the agency to a "sudden halt." The lawsuit claims the Trump administration has sought to "dismantle" HHS through layoffs that disproportionately hit "disfavored work and programs," like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. The states argue that the job cuts have "systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job."</p>

The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities.</p>

While the current price is high, it may continue to rise, presenting a short-term profit opportunity. However, for those who haven't invested yet, the high price may be a deterrent. It's advised to monitor the market and consider fractional gold options to lower the entry price. It's important to limit gold to no more than 10% of your overall portfolio.
