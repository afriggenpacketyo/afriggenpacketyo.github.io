          <h2>UK to Impose Stricter Affordability Checks on 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:32:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New UK regulations effective next July will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. This move by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees, bringing the currently unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit. While charities praise the increased protection, the new rules mean some consumers will be denied credit, potentially slowing down impulse purchases. Regulators estimate this will save consumers £1.8 billion over ten years, though it will reduce provider profits. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environment Agency reports that serious water pollution incidents in England increased by 60% in 2024, reaching a record high of 2,801 total incidents. Three companies, Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water, were responsible for the majority of the most severe events, which pose significant harm to fisheries, drinking water, and public health. Critics and a parliamentary committee have described the situation as a "national disgrace," blaming years of underinvestment by water companies and weak regulatory oversight. The industry acknowledges poor performance but points to regulators previously suppressing bill increases needed for infrastructure investment.</p>

          <p>Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil who famously broke the sound barrier during a record-setting free fall from the stratosphere in 2012, has died at the age of 56. The fatal incident occurred during a paragliding accident in Porto Sant Elpidio, Italy, where his paraglider crashed. Baumgartner was a celebrated figure in extreme sports, known for his skydiving, BASE jumping, and helicopter acrobatics, often sponsored by Red Bull. His 2012 Stratos project jump from nearly 24 miles above Earth captivated a global audience and set multiple world records.</p>

          <p>Grant Shapps, the former UK Defence Secretary, has defended the government's decision to use a super-injunction to hide a major data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had assisted British forces. Shapps argued the secrecy was "entirely justified" to prevent individuals from being pursued and potentially killed by the Taliban, stating his focus was on saving lives. The breach, which also included data on over 100 British officials, occurred in February 2022 but was not discovered until August 2023, prompting a covert resettlement scheme that has already moved 4,500 people to the UK.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has introduced a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for most non-immigrant visa applicants, including tourists and students. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be collected upon visa issuance, starting from the 2025 fiscal year on October 1, 2024. While the provision allows for reimbursement if visa holders comply with all conditions, such as not overstaying, the process is unclear and expected to be lengthy. The U.S. Travel Association has noted significant implementation challenges, and experts advise applicants to treat the fee as non-refundable.</p>

In a letter to DHS and the State Department, they allege the administration misled courts and Congress about the arrangement, citing recent court filings where El Salvador stated the U.S. retains "legal responsibility" for the deported individuals. This contradicts the administration's claim that it cannot intervene because the migrants are under Salvadoran jurisdiction.

The restrictions follow extended periods of warm, dry weather and several heatwaves, which have pushed water usage to unprecedented levels. Under the ban, using hosepipes for activities like watering gardens or washing cars is prohibited, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. This action follows similar bans by other water companies as parts of the UK face drought conditions after an exceptionally dry spring.</p>

Trump emphasized his use of trade as a tool for settling conflicts, aiming to economically squeeze Russia and its trade partners.

          <p>Shares of Swedish defense manufacturer Saab soared over 12% after the company reported second-quarter profits and sales that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The maker of the Gripen fighter jet has seen its stock rise 131% this year, benefiting from a massive increase in defense spending across Europe. This surge is driven by NATO members agreeing to raise spending targets and a broader "era of rearmament" in response to regional security threats. Saab's CEO stated the company is ramping up production dramatically to meet the high demand, underscoring the need for a strong European defense industrial base. (not investment advice)</p>
