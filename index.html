        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several British newspapers lead with the government's Strategic Defence Review, highlighting increased spending on drones and submarines, and the potential for tax increases. The review also suggests a military "gap year" for over-18s, while a former Army chief warns that the budget delay will be too slow to counter Russian threats. Many tabloids also feature the "new Maddie search," referring to the renewed efforts to find Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal in 2007. The search involves more than 20 sites and radar technology near the prime suspect's old home. The review also touches on Sir Tony Blair's call for Britain to lead in AI for healthcare. The optimism score for this article is reasonably balanced due to the combination of serious defense matters and the ongoing search for a missing person.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is set to test a domestically produced kamikaze sea drone later this month to bolster its naval defenses against growing pressure from China. Developed under the "Kuai Chi Project" by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), the drone will undergo combat capability evaluations. The defense ministry has allocated over NT$800 million for the project, with mass production expected to begin in 2026. The army intends to acquire more than 200 of these AI-enabled vessels to support coastal assault operations, enhancing Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy. The article describes a defensive military development, suggesting a cautious but proactive approach to security, hence the optimism score reflects this.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland's recent presidential election saw a nationalist candidate, Karol Nawrocki, narrowly defeat a liberal mayor, signaling the resilience of populism. This outcome reverses the trend seen in other recent elections where Trumpist candidates were rejected. The election underscores the challenges liberal democracy faces in defeating populism, even after a change in government. The previous Tusk government had some successes in restoring judicial independence and unlocking EU funds, but many promises went unfulfilled. The election outcome serves as a reminder that dissatisfaction and polarization remain deeply embedded in Poland's political landscape, and the future of its democratic restoration is uncertain. The article presents a balanced view of the political situation in Poland, acknowledging both the successes and failures of the previous government, resulting in a neutral optimism score.</p>

          <p>MI5 is under renewed scrutiny after a High Court judge expressed "no confidence" in the Security Service's account of how a senior officer provided false evidence in the case of a violent neo-Nazi agent. The judge ordered MI5 to hand over secret documents and raised concerns about the "correctness" of new evidence from a senior MI5 officer. The case involves an agent who used his MI5 role to coerce and terrorise his girlfriend, and MI5's false claim about disclosing the agent's status during investigations. A panel of High Court judges will consider potential actions, including contempt of court proceedings. The article reveals serious misconduct within a security agency, leading to a lower optimism score.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in May, marking its fastest decline since September 2022, as new export orders sharply decreased due to U.S. tariffs. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI fell below 50, indicating contraction for the first time since last year, with foreign demand dropping to its lowest level since July 2023. The job market also remained weak, and factories' inventories accumulated due to falling sales and shipment delays.
