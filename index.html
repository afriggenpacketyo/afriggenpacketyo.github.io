          <p>President Trump has stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite past criticisms, but would like Powell to be "a little more active" in cutting interest rates. He also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, suggesting tariffs would be reduced if a deal is reached. These remarks follow earlier reports of Trump considering Powell's dismissal and escalating trade tensions with China. Trump's softened stance aims to reassure financial markets amidst concerns about the Fed's independence and the potential economic fallout from the trade war.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that the UK government's borrowing exceeded expectations in the past year due to increased expenditure on public sector pay and benefits. The Office for National Statistics reported borrowing at £151.9bn, significantly higher than the forecasted £137.3bn. This surge in spending, attributed to inflation-related costs, has pushed the UK's debt to levels not seen since the early 1960s. The figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares to attend meetings with the IMF and World Bank, where discussions will likely focus on the UK's economic outlook and strategies to manage government debt.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that coral bleaching is affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, marking the highest level ever recorded, primarily due to rising ocean temperatures caused by human-induced climate change. This widespread bleaching event, ongoing since 2023, threatens the health and survival of coral reefs, which are vital ecosystems for marine life and human livelihoods. Scientists emphasize the urgent need to address the root cause of climate change by reducing emissions from fossil fuels. The loss of coral reefs would have devastating consequences for biodiversity and the planet's ability to sustain life.</p>
