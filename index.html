          <p>This article examines China's evolving diplomatic strategies with the United States, particularly contrasting the approaches of different ambassadors. Xie Feng's low-profile approach is highlighted, emphasizing cooperation and modernization, which is a departure from the more confrontational style of his predecessor, Qin Gang. The article draws parallels with Cui Tiankai's measured approach during the Obama and Trump eras, noting his ability to navigate turbulent times and build relationships with key figures. Xie's approach mirrors Cui's, aiming to foster stability and understanding between the two nations through composed engagement and emphasis on shared interests rather than direct confrontation.</p>

          <p>Decision coach Nell Wulfhart suggests that spending less time deliberating can lead to faster and more confident decision-making. Wulfhart advises individuals to identify their core values and envision their ideal life in the future to align choices with long-term goals. Accepting that some regret is inevitable and focusing on opportunity costs rather than sunk costs can also help minimize regret. Testing options and limiting the number of people consulted for advice are additional strategies to make more effective and timely decisions.</p>

          <p>Garrett Waggoner, the 34-year-old CEO of Cirkul, shares his top piece of advice for entrepreneurs: don't blindly follow all advice, but rather interpret it through your own lens. Waggoner emphasizes the importance of solving a real problem and focusing on customer experience, which were crucial to Cirkul's success. He also recounts instances where conventional advice, such as outsourcing manufacturing, didn't work for his unique business model. Cirkul, a flavored-water business, achieved a $1 billion pre-money valuation by focusing on innovation and customer needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis, but quickly reverted to attacking his former rival and promoting conspiracy theories about his health. Trump questioned the timing of the announcement and suggested Biden hid the diagnosis while in office. He also amplified claims about Biden's alleged use of an "autopen" to sign legislation, implying cognitive impairment. Other figures in Trump's orbit made unsavory comments, mocking Jill Biden and perpetuating the conspiracy theories, revealing a stark contrast between initial compassion and subsequent political attacks.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Morning Consult indicates that favorable views towards China have surpassed those towards the United States for the first time in recent years. The shift occurred between January and late April, with China achieving a positive net favorability rating while the U.S. rating declined. The report notes that the U.S.'s standing has diminished in most of the tracked markets since January, coinciding with President Trump's return to office.

The new law is expected to help Hong Kong develop digital currency payment and settlement interfaces.

          <p>This article analyzes the emerging fiscal crisis in the United States, attributing it to rising Republican deficits, refusal to raise revenue, and policies depreciating the dollar. The author notes growing jitters in the Treasury market, exacerbated by a downgrade from Moody's. While inflation remains under control, the real issue is political, with markets reacting to the scale of Republican deficits and a perceived lack of fiscal responsibility. The author suggests that the Federal Reserve's power to print money mitigates default risk, but the value of U.S. debt could drastically change, causing market instability.

          <p>The OECD forecasts a sharp economic slowdown in the U.S., projecting GDP growth to decline to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, primarily due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. The report highlights that new import duties have significantly increased the effective tariff rate, leading to higher costs for consumers. As a result, the OECD anticipates inflation in the U.S. to spike in mid-2025, reaching 3.9% by the end of the year.

While the WHO suspects that the new mutations may increase transmissibility and potentially diminish the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies, there is no evidence suggesting that it causes more severe disease.
