        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades, marked by drone attacks and shelling across the Kashmir border. The conflict was triggered by a militant attack in India-controlled Kashmir, leading to retaliatory airstrikes and claims of downing enemy jets. Civilians on both sides are experiencing exhaustion and fear, with some expressing a desire for nuclear war to end the suffering. Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to de-escalate the situation, as both countries mobilize forces and suspend cricket leagues due to safety concerns. The conflict has escalated since Wednesday, when India conducted airstrikes on Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Army Sgt. Brian Lieberman received the Soldier's Medal for his heroic actions during a shooting at his apartment complex where he saved a 14-year-old girl's life. Lieberman, an Army medic, rushed into the line of fire to treat the wounded girl, using his combat medic expertise, even using grocery bags as a makeshift seal, and shielded her when the gunman returned to fire again. Lieberman credits his upbringing and his parents, a nurse and a paramedic/police officer, for instilling in him a sense of service and selflessness. He also humbly acknowledges his roommate's crucial role in providing medical supplies during the incident.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility during a visit with New Jersey's congressional delegation. The arrest occurred amid protests against the opening of a private immigration detention center in Newark, which Baraka and other officials argue is dangerous and illegal. Federal authorities claim Baraka ignored warnings to leave the facility, while Baraka's supporters allege the arrest was an act of intimidation meant to suppress dissent. The Department of Homeland Security asserts the facility detains dangerous criminals, while members of Congress claim the arrest was meant to intimidate.</p>

          <p>Asfandyar Mir writes in The New York Times about the escalating military conflict between India and Pakistan, highlighting a shift from past patterns of negotiation and diplomacy. The conflict, triggered by a terrorist attack in Kashmir, reveals a dangerous shift in the India-Pakistan rivalry, eliminating diplomatic space. India's rise as a geopolitical power and Pakistan's internal struggles have contributed to this shift, with India now pursuing a more absolutist approach towards Pakistan. The absence of U.S. mediation further exacerbates the situation, raising concerns about potential nuclear escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested the U.S. may be open to lowering tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. This comes after Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory levies from China. Analysts believe this is part of the negotiation process, with expectations that tariffs could be cut further. Wall Street is eager for a resolution to the trade war, which has caused market volatility.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists are urging the UK Prime Minister to update copyright laws to protect them from artificial intelligence. They are requesting the government to back an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill, which would require developers to be transparent with copyright owners about using their material to train AI models. The artists argue that failing to provide this protection would essentially mean "giving away" their work to tech firms, potentially harming the UK's creative industries.

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels along the California coastline due to naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating mussels that aren't commercially harvested, as these toxins are unpredictable and can rapidly increase. Symptoms of paralytic shellfish poisoning include tingling of the lips and tongue, loss of balance, and in severe cases, death. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to regular testing.</p>

Judge Sessions criticized the government's lack of evidence against her and highlighted declarations attesting to her peaceful character.

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating the data privacy rights of state residents. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022 for unlawfully tracking and collecting user data. The settlement, which covers allegations in two separate lawsuits, is the largest data privacy settlement by a state with Google. Google did not admit wrongdoing but stated that the settlement involves old claims and product policies that have since been changed.</p>

          <p>Future Forward, the super PAC that supported Kamala Harris's presidential bid, held a closed-door conference to discuss what went wrong in the election. The event drew prominent Democrats and donors, but questions remain about the group's effectiveness and future role in the party. Some Democrats have criticized Future Forward's approach, suggesting it aired ads too late and didn't focus enough on turning out key voter groups. Despite raising $1.4 billion since its founding, it is unclear whether Future Forward will be the leading group for a 2028 presidential nominee.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on China are significantly impacting the port of Long Beach, the busiest port in the western hemisphere, with traffic down by nearly a third. The decline translates to fewer ships, containers, and trucking jobs. The impact is felt throughout the supply chain, leading to shortages and price hikes.

The virus is spread through contaminated food or drinks and close contact with infected individuals. Officials are concerned as many recent cases have occurred in people without typical risk factors, leading to investigations into food contamination and community circulation.</p>
