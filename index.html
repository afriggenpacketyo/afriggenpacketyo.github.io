        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional leaders from both parties at the White House to discuss averting a government shutdown, after canceling a previous meeting due to what he called "unserious and ridiculous demands" from Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries will join House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader John Thune. Democrats insist on a bipartisan spending agreement to meet the needs of the American people, while Trump accuses them of pushing radical left policies. Without action, a shutdown would commence, impacting non-essential programs and federal worker pay, as agencies prepare for potential layoffs. The meeting aims to find a resolution before the deadline.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have jointly called on Iran to avoid escalating tensions and pursue negotiations following the reinstatement of UN sanctions due to concerns over Iran's nuclear program. These nations reimposed sanctions after Iran allegedly failed to cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog and breached commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran has recalled its ambassadors from the three European nations for consultations, while maintaining that it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons. Iran suspended IAEA inspection after Israel and the US bombed several of its nuclear sites and military bases in June. The European nations said they would continue to pursue diplomatic routes and negotiations, even with the reimposition of sanctions.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall in Arizona has resulted in at least four fatalities due to devastating flooding, with three deaths occurring in Globe and one in suburban Phoenix. The flooding in Globe also caused a hazardous situation due to approximately 1,000 propane tanks being displaced from a distributor, though none have ignited. The Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport recorded its highest one-day rainfall total in nearly seven years. Search and rescue operations are underway, and residents are urged to avoid floodwaters, as authorities assess the full extent of the damage and search for any missing persons. The local government has declared an emergency.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sanctions on Iran following accusations from European countries regarding the country's lack of transparency in its nuclear program. Germany, France, and the UK have activated the "snapback" sanctions, leading to Iran recalling its ambassadors from these nations for consultations. Talks at the UN General Assembly failed to resolve the stalemate, while the UAE's Foreign Minister met with the Israeli President to urge an end to the Gaza conflict. Meanwhile, Hezbollah is commemorating the one-year anniversary of the death of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The reimposed sanctions will freeze Iran's overseas assets, ban arms deals, and penalize ballistic missile development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have reportedly killed at least 91 people across Gaza, according to hospital sources, as international pressure for a ceasefire intensifies. These strikes occurred shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated his nation "must finish the job" against Hamas in Gaza at the United Nations General Assembly.

          <p>The UK's first experimental rice crop is nearing harvest in Cambridgeshire, benefiting from the country's hottest summer on record. This trial, led by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, explores the potential for growing rice in Britain amid climate change. Nine rice varieties, including risotto, basmati, and sushi rice, were planted in mini paddy fields to assess their viability. The project also aims to address climate change by re-wetting peat soils, which could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative could revolutionize UK farming and food production.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley defended American Ryder Cup fans as "passionate" despite reports of unacceptable shouts and personal insults directed at European players during the event at Bethpage Black. In contrast, European captain Luke Donald acknowledged that some fans crossed the line with personal insults and disruptive sounds during players' backswings. Bradley cited stories of violent behavior at the Ryder Cup in Rome two years prior to justify his stance. Europe leads the US significantly, and the US requires a sporting miracle to win the cup.

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, further straining the country's economy as its currency hits a record low and food prices rise. The sanctions, which include freezing Iranian assets abroad and halting arms deals, were triggered by European nations due to Iran's restrictions on nuclear program monitoring. The economic pressures and renewed fears of conflict have increased psychological distress among Iranians, with activists reporting a surge in executions.

          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is debated among experts, with conflicting information and industry interests influencing research. While some studies suggest oral collagen intake may improve skin hydration and elasticity, others find no significant effect. Dermatologists note that collagen molecules are large and may not reach the skin effectively when taken orally or applied topically. The best approach for maintaining skin health includes using sunblock, maintaining a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking, which have a greater impact than collagen supplements.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has pledged to begin construction of three new towns in England before the next general election, aiming to address the housing crisis. A taskforce has recommended 12 locations for development, with Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London identified as the most promising sites. The party aims to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029 and plans to invest in local services and infrastructure for the new developments. The government has welcomed a recommendation from the New Towns Taskforce that at least 40% of these new homes should be classed as affordable housing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. This decision follows Trump's designation of antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the move, citing a lack of need for federal troops and expressing concerns about potential abuses of power. Local lawmakers have also accused ICE of targeting individuals who are not a danger to society, leading to increased tensions between federal and local authorities.</p>

          <p>Major Hurricane Humberto is currently swirling over waters north of the Caribbean and could potentially interact with another developing system, creating the rare Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two storms merge and become entangled around a common center, though the outcome depends on their relative strength. While forecasters predict Humberto will not touch land, the possibility of interaction with the weaker system could slightly alter their expected paths. South Carolina has already declared a state of emergency in anticipation of potential impacts from the storm systems.</p>

          <h2>Trump Posts Cartoon Depicting Him Firing Fed Chief Powell</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted a cartoon image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The image, which appears to be AI-generated, reflects Trump's ongoing criticism of Powell's cautious approach to cutting interest rates. Trump has repeatedly threatened Powell's position, despite the central bank's recent rate cuts and Powell's term extending until May 2026. While firing the Fed chair would be unprecedented, it remains a point of contention between Trump and the central bank, raising concerns about Fed independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Comey's Indictment Signals Escalation in Trump's Retribution Campaign</h2>

          <p>The Justice Department's indictment of former FBI Director James Comey marks a dramatic escalation in President Trump's efforts to go after his political enemies. Trump, who campaigned on ending the weaponization of the Justice Department, is now facing criticism for allegedly using his power to target perceived adversaries. The indictment, which focuses on alleged false statements to Congress, is seen by some as a thin case motivated by political retribution. Experts express concern about the potential chilling effect on dissent and the erosion of traditional checks on executive power.</p>
