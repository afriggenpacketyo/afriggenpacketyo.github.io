          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan. According to Trump, the operation was a success, with all planes safely returning after dropping a full payload of bombs on the primary site, Fordo. This action signifies a major escalation in the United States' involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran, marking a shift from the previous stance of non-involvement in Israel's preemptive strikes. The decision to engage the American military in active warfare in the Middle East contradicts Trump's earlier promises to avoid costly foreign conflicts, and the diplomatic path with Iran may now be closed.

          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners after an appeal from the White House, signaling a potential thaw in relations between Belarus and the US. The release occurred shortly after a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Minsk, marking a high-profile engagement. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, expressed gratitude to President Trump for brokering the deal, and Lukashenko's spokeswoman indicated that the release was ordered at Trump's request. The freed prisoners have been transferred to Lithuania and are receiving care, with several European politicians and members of Belarus's exiled opposition welcoming the news.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles amidst ongoing protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, touring a Federal Joint Operations Center and a Federal Mobile Command Center. During the visit, Vance received briefings from various agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and local law enforcement. His visit coincided with clashes between protestors and law enforcement over ICE raids and deportations, with a federal appeals court ruling that Trump could keep the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell the protests. Vance has previously criticized the protests and advocated for the passage of legislation to secure the border.</p>

          <p>A yacht carrying approximately 400 people struck a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street, resulting in non-life-threatening injuries to 35 people. The boat hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park, causing passengers who were waiting to disembark to fall. Marine units escorted the yacht to a dock at West 125th Street, where passengers were unloaded, and 22 individuals were taken to local hospitals for treatment. The Coast Guard is currently investigating the incident, which follows a similar crash last month involving a Mexican navy training ship and the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a law requiring all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, making it the largest state to attempt such a mandate, and the law is expected to face legal challenges. The measure, signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, has drawn criticism for potentially violating the separation of church and state. The law requires schools to post a 16 x 20-inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, although interpretations and translations may vary. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are fundamental to the US judicial and educational systems, while opponents contend the measure infringes on religious freedom.</p>

          <p>A BBC report examines the challenges faced by GP receptionists during the daily 8 AM rush for appointments in England. Receptionists often encounter frustrated patients who perceive them as obstacles to accessing care. The Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham, like many others, experiences a surge in calls when lines open, with appointments typically booked within half an hour. Despite upgrades to the telephone system, high demand means some patients inevitably miss out, leading to verbal abuse and emotional strain on reception staff. The government is implementing measures to address the issue, including increased funding and online appointment booking options.</p>

While band members were born at the start of the millennium, their fondness for the era stems from older siblings and friends.

          <p>Thirty years ago, giant statues of Michael Jackson were erected worldwide to promote his album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. These 32-foot fiberglass statues followed Jackson on his global tour, but their fates have varied since then. Some may have been destroyed or locked in storage, while others have remained on display in unexpected locations. One statue stood for decades at a McDonald's in the Netherlands before being removed due to the Leaving Neverland documentary, and another has found its way to an abandoned nightclub in Austria. The statues serve as a reminder of Jackson's enduring legacy and the controversies surrounding him.</p>

          <p>A BBC article questions the validity of social media advice promoting "quick fixes" to lower cortisol levels, a stress hormone. The article notes the prevalence of posts advising cortisol cocktails, supplements, and lavender balm, while experts caution against relying on these methods. Professor John Wass of the University of Oxford argues that attributing body changes solely to cortisol levels is misleading, as various factors can contribute. Jasleen Kaur Carroll, a technology company manager, found that social media hacks were ineffective in addressing her burnout and autoimmune condition flare-up, emphasizing the need to tackle the root cause of stress through therapy and mindfulness.</p>

          <p>Senator Alex Padilla criticized the Trump administration as "petty and unserious" after Vice President JD Vance referred to him as "Jose" during a press conference in Los Angeles. Padilla stated that Vance knows his name and suggested the misnaming was intentional, reflecting the administration's skewed priorities. Vance's press secretary claimed it was a mistake, but Padilla and other California Democrats rallied against the incident, highlighting racial undertones in Vance's comments. The incident occurred after Padilla was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference while attempting to ask a question.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, proposed offering new army recruits a £10,000 bonus to boost troop numbers amid concerns about global instability. The plan aims to increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000, and former armed services personnel would be offered £20,000 to return for two additional years. Additionally, the Liberal Democrats suggested distributing pamphlets to every British home to prepare citizens for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The party plans to fund the bonus scheme through an increase in the Digital Services Tax on large social media and tech companies.</p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) has significantly more cash on hand than the Democratic National Committee (DNC), with a gap of $57 million, the widest since at least July 2020. The RNC reported $72 million on hand at the end of May, while the DNC had just $15 million. This financial disparity comes amid internal tensions within the DNC following President Trump's return to the White House. While some Democrats express concern, the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, with roughly $40 million raised in individual donations since February. (not investment advice)</p>
