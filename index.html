        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial procedural vote on a sprawling legislative package championed by President Trump. The bill, which includes significant tax cuts alongside funding for immigration and defense, faces an uncertain future as Republican leadership has not yet secured enough votes for it to advance. The legislation proposes funding these priorities by making substantial cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Final text was released late, giving senators little time to review it, and several internal GOP disputes over its provisions remain unresolved ahead of the vote.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News posits that the idea of a "transgender child" is not a biological reality but a modern concept created by a confluence of psychiatry, endocrinology, and political activism. The author traces the idea's origins to the 1960s, its formalization in the DSM-III in 1980, and its materialization with the development of puberty blockers. The piece argues that this framework pathologizes gender nonconformity, which would otherwise often result in gay or lesbian identities, and locks children into a medical pathway based on ideology rather than evidence. The author concludes that the concept is a "manufactured tragedy."</p>

          <p>Eric Trump has hinted at the possibility of a future presidential campaign by a member of the Trump family, including himself, once his father's term concludes. In an interview, he stated that the political path "would be an easy one" but expressed hesitation about subjecting his own children to the "brutality" his family has experienced over the last decade. While his siblings have been more politically involved, Eric Trump claimed he could do the job "very effectively," contrasting himself with politicians who have left him unimpressed. He also defended his family against accusations of profiting from the presidency.</p>

          <p>Human rights advocates are raising alarms as Pakistan and Iran have drastically increased the forced deportation of Afghan refugees, sending thousands back daily to a country already in a severe humanitarian crisis. Many of these refugees, some of whom have lived in the host countries for decades, are being returned with minimal belongings to face food scarcity and instability under Taliban rule. The surge in deportations, with over 71,000 returned in the first half of June alone, coincides with significant cuts in international aid to Afghanistan.

          <p>A legislative proposal championed by President Trump aims to cut up to $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to help fund tax breaks for the wealthy. This article highlights the story of a single mother in Maryland who relies on SNAP to feed her daughter and fears a return to food insecurity. The proposed changes would impose stricter work requirements on parents and older adults, potentially removing millions from the program. Anti-hunger advocates warn these historic cuts would be catastrophic, increasing hunger across the country and disproportionately affecting families in rural, Republican-leaning states.</p>

          <p>The victory of self-described socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York's Democratic mayoral primary has triggered a strong backlash from the city's financial leaders. Billionaires like Daniel Loeb and Bill Ackman have voiced concerns that Mamdani's progressive policies will lead to "class warfare" and an exodus of wealth, ultimately harming the city's tax base and public services. Ackman has pledged to help fund a campaign against Mamdani, framing the election as a critical moment for New York's economic viability. The reaction highlights a deep ideological divide and the frustration of Wall Street figures who heavily funded the losing incumbent.</p>

The group recently installed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. By collecting soil from lynching sites and placing markers, the EKRP aims to confront a painful and often ignored part of local history. The project's work is seen by its members as especially vital amid current political efforts to downplay or erase difficult aspects of America's racial past.</p>

          <p>A report from the nonprofit Earthsight alleges that leather used by luxury brands like Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss is connected to illegal deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. The investigation traced cattle from illegally operated farms, including some within Indigenous territories, to a Brazilian meatpacker and then to Italian tanneries that supply these high-end brands. The report highlights gaps in supply chain transparency, such as "cattle laundering," which allows hides from deforested areas to enter the global market. While most accused brands have denied the claims, the findings raise serious questions about the ethics of the luxury fashion industry.</p>

This move involves a constitutional change to create a special $117 billion fund, allowing for massive investment in the armed forces without cutting social programs.

          <p>Despite Kentucky being a staunchly pro-Trump state, its most prominent Republican congressional membersâ€”Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, and Thomas Massieâ€”have become a notable bloc of resistance to the president's agenda. The trio has opposed Trump on issues ranging from his major tax and spending bill to tariffs and war powers, drawing the ire of the president and his supporters. This intra-party conflict has made Kentucky a rare hotbed of GOP dissent, with Trump calling for a primary challenger against Rep. Massie. The dynamic reflects the state's unique political landscape and creates a sensitive situation for local party officials caught between their popular president and influential lawmakers.</p>

Over 100 musicians, organized into nine ensembles, were spread throughout the 900-foot-long, art-free space, performing an expanded version of Washington's work "Harmony of Difference." The performance was a grand-scale celebration of the new building's potential for interdisciplinary art, with the music interacting with the unique acoustics and changing sunset light. The event echoed the museum's 1965 opening, which also featured a major musical premiere, signaling a continued commitment to performance art in the museum's new era.</p>

          <p>Lawyers suing Southern California Edison claim that the same faulty equipment on a high-voltage transmission line in Sylmar ignited both the 2019 Saddleridge fire and the 2025 Hurst fire. Edison has admitted its equipment may be linked to the recent Hurst fire but denies responsibility for the earlier, more destructive Saddleridge blaze, which damaged over 100 structures and caused one death. The lawsuit alleges that a pylon on the line is improperly grounded, leading to electrical faults that spark fires. The plaintiffs' court filings also accuse the utility of being deceptive during the 2019 investigation, further intensifying the legal battle over its maintenance practices.</p>

          <p>Following devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County, many homeowners are interested in rebuilding with fire-resistant and sustainable natural materials like adobe and straw bale. However, some architects and engineers report that the county's permitting process for these alternative construction methods is onerously complex and uncertain. This creates a significant barrier for fire victims who wish to build more resilient homes but cannot afford the time and expense of navigating the unclear regulatory hurdles. While county officials express openness to such materials, the lack of a clear, streamlined approval pathway is forcing many to revert to traditional wood-frame construction, despite its vulnerability to fire.</p>

          <p>California is leveraging the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 in its legal effort to challenge President Trump's deployment of federal troops for immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The 19th-century law generally forbids the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. A federal judge has ordered the administration to provide evidence related to the troops' activities, signaling the law's central role in the case. The article provides historical context, noting the act's origins in the end of Reconstruction, which effectively allowed for the rise of Jim Crow by removing federal protection for Black voters. This historical law is now at the center of a modern separation-of-powers conflict.</p>

          <p>Voters in Huntington Beach, California, a city known for its conservative politics, have decisively rejected two ballot measures pushed by the MAGA-aligned city council. The measures would have created a parent review board to censor children's books and allowed for the privatization of the city's library system. The victory for library advocates is being hailed as a significant grassroots success against far-right overreach, demonstrating that even in a Republican stronghold, there are limits to politically motivated attacks on public institutions.

          <p>This article revisits the 1972 wrongful conviction of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther Party leader in Los Angeles, for a murder he did not commit. Defended by a young Johnnie Cochran, Pratt was convicted based on the testimony of a police informant and a flawed eyewitness identification, spending 27 years in prison. It was later revealed that authorities, including the FBI under its COINTELPRO program, had hidden exculpatory evidence, such as the informant status of the star witness. Pratt's conviction was finally overturned in 1997, in a case that haunted Cochran and exposed the lengths to which law enforcement went to neutralize perceived political threats.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the spirit of the LGBTQ+ rights movement is rooted in diversity and progress, not in the "respectability politics" being promoted by some conservative gay figures. The author criticizes former ambassador Richard Grenell's attempts to separate "normal gays" from transgender issues, drawing a parallel to a scene in the 1999 film "Flawless." The piece asserts that the movement was historically led by its most marginalized members, such as drag queens and gender-nonconforming people at Stonewall. It concludes that attempts to appeal to the mainstream by silencing more flamboyant or radical elements betray the community's history and collective interest.</p>

          <p>Americans may face higher prices and potential shortages for fireworks this Fourth of July due to new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods. The U.S. is almost entirely dependent on China for both consumer and professional pyrotechnics, with the industry now facing import taxes as high as 30%. Importers have struggled with fluctuating prices and some have halted shipments, which could lead to less variety for consumers. The industry is particularly concerned about 2026, the nation's 250th birthday, as continued high tariffs could severely diminish the scale and availability of fireworks for the planned celebrations.</p>

The delay has puzzled legal experts and left the future of a key VRA provision, Section 2, in a state of uncertainty.

          <p>In one of the largest drug seizures in the UK in the last decade, Border Force officers have intercepted a 2.4-tonne shipment of cocaine with an estimated street value of Â£96 million. The haul was discovered at the London Gateway port in Essex earlier this month, hidden on a container vessel that had arrived from Panama. The intelligence-led operation required officers to move 37 large containers to locate the hidden drugs. The Home Office stated that the interception deals a significant financial and operational blow to the organized crime groups responsible for the importation, disrupting their supply chains.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to scrap 201 organizations responsible for overseeing and running parts of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting argued the current system is overly complex and that the health service needs "more doers and fewer checkers." The move is part of the Labour government's new 10-year health strategy, which aims to simplify bureaucracy and bring the NHS under closer government control, though critics worry about losing vital oversight functions.</p>

          <p>China is developing a series of high-altitude AI computing centers in Tibet, with the first, Yajiang-1, now operational at an elevation of 3,600 meters. The strategy aims to leverage the region's natural cold, which reduces cooling costs, and abundant solar power to create a frontier for sustainable supercomputing. These facilities will support innovation in fields such as AI model training, autonomous driving, and monitoring the plateau's delicate ecosystem. The project, a collaboration between a tech company and the local government, is part of a broader plan to transform the remote region into a hub for the high-altitude digital economy.</p>
