        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority has outlined a compensation scheme for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance. The plan covers 14 million agreements from 2007 to 2024, addressing issues like unfair commission arrangements and inaccurate information provided to consumers. While initial estimates were higher, the average payout is now expected to be around £700 per person, with lenders potentially facing a total bill of £8.2 billion. This regulatory action aims to provide fair restitution to customers who were overcharged for their vehicle loans.</p>

          <p>The US government shutdown is approaching its second week with no resolution in sight as the Senate remains deadlocked. Republican leaders are struggling to secure enough Democratic votes to pass a funding bill, with bipartisan support appearing to weaken. The key sticking point is the extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies, which Democrats insist on addressing before reopening the government. As political pressure mounts on both sides, the stalemate persists, leaving federal operations partially suspended and negotiations at a standstill.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization has significantly increased its global trade growth forecast for 2025 to 2.4%, citing strong performance in the first half of the year driven by demand for AI-related goods and favorable macroeconomic conditions. However, the organization has sharply downgraded its outlook for 2026, predicting growth will slow to just 0.5% due to the cooling global economy and the full impact of trade tariffs. The report highlights the dual influence of technological innovation boosting current trade and protectionist policies posing a significant future risk. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's stock price fell by 5% after a report suggested its high-stakes investment in Nvidia chips for its cloud services is yielding thin profit margins. According to internal documents cited in the article, Oracle's Nvidia cloud business had a gross margin of just 14%, far below the company's overall average of around 70%. This has raised concerns among investors about the long-term profitability of Oracle's aggressive push into the AI infrastructure market. The challenge stems from the high cost of Nvidia's advanced chips and competitive pricing for cloud rentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an article adapted from his book, author Morgan Housel argues that financial happiness is less about wealth and more about contentment and managing expectations. He presents five rules for living a happier life without needing a lot of money, emphasizing the importance of appreciating the ordinary and recognizing that happiness is the gap between one's expectations and circumstances. Housel suggests that the relentless pursuit of more often leads to dissatisfaction, while finding satisfaction with what one already has creates a form of "psychological wealth." This perspective challenges the conventional link between high income and personal fulfillment.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to significantly increase protection for its steel industry by doubling tariffs on foreign steel and reducing the volume of duty-free imports. The proposal, aimed primarily at countering the influx of cheaper steel from China, comes after the US imposed similar 50% tariffs. EU officials stated the measures are necessary to protect the European steel sector, which is described as being on the verge of collapse, and to enable it to invest in decarbonization and regain competitiveness. The plan requires approval from EU member states and the European Parliament.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from deploying the Texas National Guard to the city. Pritzker condemned the move as an "authoritarian march" and an effort to use service members as "political props" to create chaos. The lawsuit argues that the deployment violates the principle separating military forces from domestic law enforcement.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case challenging Colorado's law that prohibits licensed mental health professionals from practicing "conversion therapy" on minors. The plaintiff, counselor Kaley Chiles, argues the ban infringes on her free speech rights by censoring conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity with young clients who seek to align with their biological sex. Colorado defends the law as a regulation of professional conduct designed to protect minors from a practice widely deemed harmful by major medical associations. The justices are weighing whether the law constitutes permissible regulation of conduct or unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.</p>

          <p>Tesla has rolled out a new version of its Full Self-Driving supervised software, but the move has been overshadowed by anticipation for a more significant product reveal. The company fueled speculation with cryptic teaser clips posted online, leading investors to expect an announcement about a lower-cost Model Y, the long-promised next-generation Roadster, or another new venture. This comes as Tesla seeks to shift focus toward its robotics and autonomous driving ambitions amid a slump in auto sales and increasing competition.

          <p>The logistics sector showed signs of a potential freight recession in September, a month that typically sees a boom in shipping ahead of the holiday season. The latest Logistics Managers' Index reported the lowest transportation utilization reading ever recorded for September, indicating that the expected surge in holiday merchandise shipments has not materialized. Experts attribute the slowdown to businesses front-loading imports earlier in the year, which has led to high inventory levels and reduced demand for truck transportation. This trend, if it continues, could signal a broader economic cooling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is increasing its position in GE Vernova, purchasing 20 additional shares of the power equipment manufacturer. The move comes as the stock has traded sideways following a strong second-quarter earnings report, providing what the club sees as a buying opportunity. The rationale for the investment is tied to the long-term demand for AI infrastructure, as the proliferation of data centers will require a massive increase in power generation. GE Vernova is positioned to benefit from this trend through its gas turbines and grid solutions, despite softness in its onshore wind business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The attorney for Marimar Martinez, a woman shot by federal agents in Chicago, claims that body-camera footage captures an officer taunting her with the words, "Do something, bitch," just before opening fire. Martinez was shot after allegedly ramming a Customs and Border Protection vehicle during a period of intensified immigration enforcement in the city. While federal prosecutors allege she was part of a convoy that aggressively pursued and boxed in the agents' vehicle, her lawyer disputes this account. A judge has ordered Martinez and another driver released from custody pending trial as the conflicting narratives emerge.</p>

          <p>The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) has announced it will appeal a ruling by FIFA's Disciplinary Committee that accused it of "cheating" and imposed a significant fine and player suspensions. The case involves seven foreign-born players who represented Malaysia in a match against Vietnam, with FIFA alleging they were ineligible and that their documentation was forged. FIFA described the conduct as a form of "pure and simple" cheating that erodes trust in the sport. The FAM vehemently denies the allegations, stating the players acted in good faith and that it will challenge what it calls an "inaccurate and unfair" portrayal.</p>

Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, argued that Norris remains a danger to the public and should not be released, as he has not shown full contrition.

          <p>With the US government shutdown halting the release of official economic data, investment firm Carlyle has provided an alternative analysis suggesting the labor market is weaker than previously thought. According to Carlyle's proprietary data, the economy added only 17,000 jobs in September, a significant slowdown from previous months. This figure aligns with other private-sector data indicating anemic hiring growth. The absence of the official Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report has forced investors and analysts to rely on such alternative measures to gauge the health of the US economy during the government impasse.

The conflict has also created a severe humanitarian crisis, with 1.9 million Gazans displaced, the healthcare system collapsed, and a growing malnutrition crisis affecting hundreds of thousands, particularly children.

          <p>The creators of the Paddington Bear films and the estate of his author, Michael Bond, are suing the producers of the satirical puppet show "Spitting Image." The lawsuit, filed in the UK's High Court, cites copyright concerns over a parody sketch that depicts the beloved children's character as a foul-mouthed podcast host who swears and admits to taking cocaine. The sketch, titled "The Rest is Bullsh*t!," features Paddington with a strong South American accent interviewing public figures like Elon Musk and Prince Harry. The legal action challenges the satirical use of the iconic and typically gentle character.</p>

          <p>Recent drone sightings that twice forced the suspension of flights at Munich Airport have ignited a political debate in Germany over who is responsible for drone defense. The discussion centers on whether the federal government or the individual German states should have primary authority for protecting critical infrastructure. Currently, state police handle most drone threats, but they lack the military-grade equipment to shoot them down, and the German constitution restricts the military from operating domestically in such scenarios. This has exposed a potential security gap, prompting calls for a clearer division of power and a more robust national strategy.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of the war in Ukraine suggests the country is effectively adapting its military tactics to counter Russia's manpower advantage and settle in for a long-term conflict. Ukrainian commanders are increasingly focused on minimizing their own casualties through the sophisticated use of drones, more precise artillery strikes, and better troop rotation schedules. This strategy aims to avoid direct infantry engagement whenever possible, conserving their limited number of soldiers. This shift, combined with successful strikes on Russian infrastructure, indicates a growing confidence that Ukraine can sustain its defense and that time may be shifting in its favor.</p>

Gold, which tends to perform well in times of low interest rates and instability, has risen 52% this year.
