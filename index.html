          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a 33-year-old Louisiana resident, with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and visa fraud. Newly unsealed court documents allege al-Muhtadi coordinated armed fighters to cross into Israel hours after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, with his phone pinging near Kibbutz Kfar Aza where 60 people were killed. He is also accused of entering the U.S. on a fraudulent visa in September 2024, falsely denying terror ties and firearm training, and later posting photos with a gun in his Tulsa apartment. This development underscores the U.S.'s commitment to prosecuting individuals linked to the attack, highlighting the global reach of such investigations.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational V-level courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify the current "confusing landscape" of post-16 qualifications in England. These V-levels are set to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with ministers also proposing an alternative qualification to reduce the number of teenagers resitting maths and English GCSEs. The initiative aligns with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's emphasis on vocational training, targeting two-thirds of young people to pursue university or technical qualifications. While some welcome the potential for greater clarity, organizations like the Sixth Form Colleges Association warn that V-levels may not adequately fill the gap left by BTecs, highlighting ongoing debate in education reform.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, discussed the US-China rivalry, Chinese innovation, and gender equality in a recent interview. She argues that the economic impact of US tariffs on China is often exaggerated, noting that exports to the US now constitute only about 2.8% of China's GDP, a significant reduction from previous levels. Qian highlights that the competition extends beyond trade to technology and ideologies, emphasizing that continued "unhealthy competition" will harm both nations and the world. The article underscores China's strategic shift towards domestic consumption and diversification of export markets, with ASEAN now being its largest destination, diminishing the direct impact of US trade policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI will remain in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies having "at best minimal connections" to the area. Judge Mark Pittman, in an ironically worded order, encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, even providing a link to local business services. The lawsuit, filed by Elon Musk's companies, alleges an anticompetitive scheme to maintain AI monopolies by favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT and deprioritizing competitors like xAI's Grok.

          <p>The Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by Air Force One during former President Trump's visits to Florida. The FBI director confirmed the finding, with the Secret Service sharing a photo of what appeared to be a hunting stand high in a tree, located over 200 yards away across a highway. Sources indicate the stand had been there for months, predating Trump's recent use of that specific airport section due to construction, and it did not have a direct line of sight to him. Officials reported no impact on movements and no individuals were present, though the discovery highlights ongoing security concerns following a past assassination attempt near Trump's golf club.</p>

          <p>During a closed-door meeting, former President Donald Trump reportedly engaged in a "shouting match" with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to accept Russia's terms for ending the war. The Financial Times reported that Trump warned Zelensky that Russian leader Vladimir Putin "will destroy you" if Ukraine did not make a deal, reportedly echoing many of Putin's talking points from a prior call. Trump allegedly insisted Zelensky surrender the entire Donbas region and declined to send Tomahawk missiles, leaving the Ukrainian delegation disappointed and confused by the proposal to offer security guarantees to both Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky later stated that "decisive steps are needed" from international powers to end the conflict, resisting the pressure to concede territory.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores whether contemporary great powers can manage hegemonic transitions through "managed accommodation," drawing parallels to Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai's diplomacy in the early 1970s. It argues that a multipolar world is already present, with economic fundamentals dictating this reality, and the key question is whether it will be managed through patient statecraft or confrontation. The article highlights two distinguishing factors from past transitions: the irrationality of total war due to nuclear weapons and the catastrophic costs of systemic rupture caused by technological interdependence, exemplified by complex global supply chains. It suggests these factors create powerful domestic constituencies with strong interests in avoiding systemic breakdown, favoring diplomatic solutions.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to grant new powers allowing troops to shoot down drones threatening military bases, a direct response to a growing threat posed by Russia and increased drone incursions across Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce these plans, which aim to cut "red tape" and enable "decisive action" against unidentified drones using kinetic options, in addition to existing counter-drone technology. The initiative follows a series of mystery drone sightings at British airbases used by US forces and a significant increase in Russian drone attacks in Ukraine, with thousands launched monthly. While initially for military sites, the government is considering extending these powers to other critical locations like airports, reflecting heightened security concerns.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," reveals her profound fear of dying a "sexual assault slave" at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. The book details Giuffre's allegations of having sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including one instance with Epstein and approximately eight other young women, whom she believed were under 18. Prince Andrew, who settled a civil case with Giuffre in 2022 and recently relinquished royal titles, has consistently denied any wrongdoing. The memoir further describes sinister aspects of Epstein's sexual assault trafficking, including requirements for girls to appear "childlike" and instances of physical abuse, adding significant scrutiny to the royal family.</p>

The short video clip reveals distinctive features like 'split rudders' and a counter-shaded paint job, possibly intended for camouflage to obscure its shape at altitude.

The initiative, proposed by Governor Newsom, aims to temporarily depose the independent redistricting commission to redraw state maps and counter a similar move by Texas Republicans.

This article hails the win as the most significant of the Charlotte Edwards/Nat Sciver-Brunt era, demonstrating England's ability to perform under pressure after previous instances of "buckling." Despite batting struggles and India's strong partnership, England's improved fielding and unit cohesion allowed them to seize the opportunity when India made mistakes. Captain Heather Knight's sparkling century was a key difference, though the team's middle-order batting still presents issues to address before facing their greatest rivals, Australia.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate centre-left politician, won the Turkish Cypriot presidential elections with 62.8% of the vote, defeating hardliner incumbent Ersin Tatar. Erhurman's victory signals a major policy shift, as he has pledged to explore a federal solution to end the island's nearly 50-year division, a stance long supported by the United Nations. This contrasts with Tatar's two-state policy, which Greek Cypriots had ruled out. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan congratulated Erhurman, praising the democratic maturity of Turkish Cypriots, while Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides also welcomed the commitment to resuming peace talks. The election outcome offers renewed hope for stalled reunification efforts.</p>

          <p>The "No Kings" protests, with an estimated 7 million participants across 2700 events nationwide, represent one of the largest single-day protests in American history. This article features Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, who emphasizes the importance of these mass public demonstrations against President Trump. She explains that such mobilization aims to signal deep, passionate opposition to Trump and his allies, as well as to non-partisan institutions like the media, demonstrating that there is deep opposition. Furthermore, the protests serve to connect anti-Trump Americans, helping them realize they are not alone, and fostering ongoing, smaller-scale activism against what they perceive as autocratic tendencies.</p>

          <p>Atlanta United has fired coach Ronny Deila following a disappointing 5-13-16 season, his first in charge of the team, which saw them finish 14th in the Eastern Conference.

CEO Garth Lagerwey stated that the team's standard of play was not met and a global search for a replacement would begin immediately. Deila's tenure ended after just one win in their last 18 matches, marking a period of struggle for a club that had immediate success after entering the league in 2017 but hasn't claimed a trophy since 2019.</p>

Despite her long career with the party, including being the first Black and openly queer White House press secretary, she felt betrayed and sought to channel her disappointment into independent action.

Muscat, currently managing Chinese side Shanghai Port, is still contending for the Super League title, with their season potentially extending into November or December. The potential delayed start to his tenure made the deal unworkable for both parties, despite advanced discussions to bring the former Ibrox player to Glasgow. This article notes that the development follows former Rangers boss Steven Gerrard declining a return and Danny Rohl withdrawing from consideration. The club is now reportedly speaking to multiple other candidates and is confident an appointment will be made in the coming days, after Russell Martin's dismissal earlier this month.</p>

Petro had previously called a September US strike on an alleged drug boat in Colombian waters "murder," identifying a fisherman as the victim. Trump's remarks and the ongoing US military actions against alleged drug traffickers, which have killed at least 29 people, signal escalating tensions and raise legal questions about adherence to laws of war, despite Colombia being a traditional US ally.</p>
