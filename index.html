          <p>A shooting at a high school in Evergreen, Colorado, resulted in at least four students being injured, with three reported in critical condition. The suspected shooter, a student at the school, was also injured from a self-inflicted gunshot wound using a revolver. Authorities responded to the incident around midday, placing the school on lockdown while law enforcement conducted a thorough search of the campus. The FBI and ATF have joined the local sheriff's office in the ongoing investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating why approximately 75 cargo containers fell from a vessel at the Port of Long Beach, causing a minor oil spill and one worker to suffer a sprained ankle. The containers, filled with general merchandise, tumbled into the water and damaged a smaller barge used for emissions collection. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that the damaged barge, which held renewable diesel, was the source of a light oil sheen that is now being contained. The port remains fully operational as officials work to recover the submerged containers.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum in the United States. President Trump, who announced Kirk's death, ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and praised Kirk's influence on young conservatives. Former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush, along with other prominent Democratic and Republican leaders, issued statements denouncing the violence and expressing condolences to Kirk's family, emphasizing that such acts have no place in American democracy.</p>

          <h2>Thousands in Rural West Virginia Face Crisis of Unreliable and Unsafe Drinking Water</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant portion of West Virginia's rural population, estimated at around 250,000 people, lacks access to reliable, treated drinking water. Many residents depend on untreated sources like abandoned coal mines, a legacy of the coal industry's decline, which led to the decay of water infrastructure the companies once maintained. Crumbling and abandoned treatment plants highlight the systemic failure, forcing communities to rely on makeshift solutions. Non-profit organizations like DigDeep are now working to install modern water systems, offering hope to residents who have endured this hardship for decades.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 21:09:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior cancer specialists from the Royal College of Radiologists are raising concerns that bureaucratic hurdles in England are creating unequal access to advanced cancer treatments. They argue that cumbersome funding application processes lead to a "postcode lottery," where cutting-edge therapies like Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) are only available at larger, better-funded centers. This disparity means some patients miss out on potentially life-saving care, prompting calls for the government to streamline access and reduce red tape in its upcoming national cancer strategy.</p>

The piece cautions against using this tragedy to suppress free expression or civic spaces, suggesting that the proper response is a renewed commitment to democratic principles, even in the face of continued threats.</p>

Harris also claims that she was often undermined by Biden's inner circle, who she alleges fueled negative narratives about her.

          <p>An investigation by BBC Eye and partner organizations has uncovered evidence that the international charity SOS Children's Villages International was involved in the disappearance of children of political detainees under Syria's Assad regime. Whistleblowers and leaked documents suggest the charity, with senior staff appointed by the Assad palace, held children in its facilities and complied with intelligence agency orders to prevent reunification with relatives. The organization allegedly changed children's identities and used them as political pawns, making it nearly impossible for families to trace them even after the regime's fall.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer reflected on the changing attitudes of investors, noting a recent return to the optimism of the 1990s. He recalled the show's early days as a time when individual stock ownership was celebrated, a sentiment that faded after the dot-com bubble burst and index funds became dominant. Cramer suggests that today's market, with significant gains in major individual stocks like Nvidia and Oracle, is reviving that excitement and awareness around single-stock rewards, making market information accessible once again.</p>

          <p>A White House official has emphasized the need for the U.S. to defend its lead in artificial intelligence as China rapidly closes the technology gap. Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the U.S. is in danger of losing its preeminence in this critical field. He advocated for a strategy of exporting cohesive "AI tech stacks"—which include chips, algorithms, and applications—to allied nations. This approach aims to prevent China from gaining global market share and to ensure American technology sets the international standard.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against Uber by a woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted after her driver abandoned her in an unsafe neighborhood. The suit claims the driver forced the 23-year-old woman out of the vehicle late at night after she vomited, leaving her miles from her destination without her phone or keys. She was then approached by two individuals who, under the pretense of helping her, took her to an apartment where she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint. The lawsuit accuses Uber of failing in its duty of care.</p>

          <p>England's T20 cricket captain, Harry Brook, labeled the opening match against South Africa as a "shambles" due to multiple rain delays and revised targets. The game was initially reduced to nine overs per side, but another downpour forced England to chase a revised target of 69 runs from just five overs, a task they failed. Brook felt little could be learned from such a disjointed contest and also defended the decision to rest key bowler Jofra Archer, citing the risky conditions and the need to protect him for future matches.</p>

          <p>The UK's Treasury Committee has criticized the government for slow and insufficient reforms to the Lifetime ISA (LISA) savings product, warning that it remains unsuitable for many individuals. MPs are pushing for more significant changes to be included in the upcoming November Budget, questioning the program's value as it is projected to cost taxpayers £3 billion over five years. The committee highlighted that LISAs can penalize benefit claimants and that their dual purpose for home buying and retirement saving can lead to poor investment choices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. They hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' "dark DNA"—the non-gene sections of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. Scientists believe this mysterious genetic material could enable the spiders to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. By decoding the DNA of these colorful, dancing arachnids, the project aims to uncover fundamental principles of evolution and variation that apply across the natural world.</p>

          <p>Security experts are expressing growing concern over the formation of a potential "anti-Western alliance" centered around China, Russia, and North Korea. Recent high-profile meetings, including a military parade in Beijing attended by leaders from these nations, signal a strategic shift toward creating a new global order based on military strength and repressive governance. While not a formal military pact, this deepening partnership is seen as a functional network designed to challenge the existing international system and undermine Western interests on the global stage.</p>
