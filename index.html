          <p>Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Rally party, was found guilty of embezzling EU funds and banned from running for office for five years.  The court deemed the ban necessary to prevent public order disruption.  While Le Pen denies wrongdoing, the judge described the actions as a 'democratic bypass'. The ruling likely impacts the 2027 presidential race, and international figures have reacted with mixed responses, highlighting potential political bias in their commentary.</p>
