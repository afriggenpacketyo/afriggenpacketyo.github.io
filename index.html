          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged over 4% to a record high, with the Topix also reaching an all-time high, following Sanae Takaichi's election as the Liberal Democratic Party leader. Her victory positions her to become Japan's first female prime minister, and investors anticipate her "high-pressure economy" policy will maintain accommodative monetary policy from the Bank of Japan. The yen weakened past 150 against the dollar, raising concerns from the finance minister, though Deutsche Bank predicts near-term losses but no material weakness. Takaichi has vowed to tackle inflation and boost the economy, focusing on rural areas and primary industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Other Side Village near Salt Lake City offers a unique program to help chronically unhoused individuals overcome addiction and mental illness. Residents, typically experiencing homelessness for years, undergo a "prep school" phase to relearn life skills, maintain sobriety, and work in Village-run businesses. After graduation, they can move into tiny cottages for permanent housing, supported by a strong community and coaches who have similar lived experiences. This model, though expensive and challenging to scale due to its sober and work requirements, aims to restore purpose and self-worth, providing a comprehensive path to long-term stability.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers faced the Golden State Warriors in a preseason game without their star players Luka Doncic, LeBron James, and Austin Reaves, who were all rested. Despite a 111-103 loss, coach JJ Redick focused on building "championship habits" like physicality and pace among the available roster. Guard Gabe Vincent made his preseason debut with 16 points and five assists, while Deandre Ayton contributed seven points and seven rebounds. The team aims to improve organization on offense and defensive sprints, with Doncic expected to play before the regular season begins and James on a slower ramp-up schedule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, citing out-of-control crime, a move that Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called an "invasion" and an abuse of power. This follows a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, temporarily blocking Trump's deployment of 200 troops there, a decision the administration plans to appeal. Governors in California and Illinois have criticized the federalization and deployment of National Guard units without state consent, arguing it violates state sovereignty and inflames tensions. The deployments raise constitutional questions as such forces are typically deployed by state governors, with century-old laws limiting military use for domestic matters.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing sector installed nearly 300,000 new industrial robots last year, addressing labor gaps caused by the nation's declining population. Over half of the world's new robots in 2024 were deployed in Chinese factories, performing repetitive tasks like welding and assembly. Experts like Professor Gao Xudong from Tsinghua University emphasize that this automation trend is inevitable and will help China maintain its competitive edge in manufacturing despite demographic shifts. This strategic adoption of robotics underscores China's efforts to sustain industrial productivity amidst a shrinking workforce and evolving economic landscape.</p>

          <p>The article explains why COVID-19 vaccines are not covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), the "vaccine court" established in the 1980s to compensate individuals for rare vaccine-related injuries. Instead, COVID vaccines fall under the more restrictive Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), designed for emergency measures, which has compensated fewer than 100 of 14,000 claims. Legal experts advocate for including COVID vaccines in the VICP, requiring them to be a recommended childhood vaccine, an excise tax, and a decision by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. However, concerns exist about the VICP's existing backlog and capacity to handle thousands of additional cases.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 million UK consumers who bought Apple or Samsung smartphones between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a share of a £480 million payout. This potential compensation stems from a lawsuit by consumer campaign group Which? against US tech giant Qualcomm, accusing it of anti-competitive practices. Which? alleges Qualcomm forced Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices for essential components, driving up smartphone costs for consumers. The trial, expected to last five weeks, will determine if Qualcomm abused its dominant market position, with a successful outcome potentially resulting in approximately £17 per affected phone owner.

          <p>The article explores the "swag gap" phenomenon in relationships, where one partner is significantly more fashionable or puts more effort into their appearance than the other. While some, like Ifesinachi Mamah, believe matching aesthetics are crucial for a cohesive "vibe," others like Jessica Raialo argue that differing styles can be positive if both partners feel good about themselves. Dating coaches and relationship psychologists suggest that a significant style disparity can lead to conflicts, feelings of disrespect, or even unhealthy power dynamics if one partner tries to change the other. Ultimately, the article suggests that mutual support and shared "energy plane" are more vital than identical fashion sense.</p>

          <h2>Federal Workers Sue Education Department Over Partisan Shutdown Emails</h2>

          <p>A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Education violated employees' First Amendment rights by inserting partisan messages into their out-of-office emails during the government shutdown. The lawsuit claims these messages, blaming "Democrat Senators" for the lapse in appropriations, were imposed without consent and replaced existing replies. Legal experts suggest this practice may also violate the Hatch Act, which limits political activity by civil servants. This legal challenge highlights concerns over the politicization of government communications, with other federal workers also reporting similar partisan messaging in official agency newsletters.</p>

          <p>Russell Martin's tumultuous tenure as Rangers head coach has ended after just 17 games, following a chaotic period marked by fan animosity and poor results. Despite initially impressing the club's owners, Martin's team struggled with league draws and significant European losses, with fans consistently demanding his sacking. His explanations often deflected blame to players or external factors, further alienating supporters. The article notes that Martin inherited a squad assembled with substantial investment, raising questions about the roles of the sporting director and chief executive in player acquisitions. His departure underscores a dysfunctional atmosphere at Ibrox, with the club now seeking its fifth manager in three years.</p>

          <p>Jim Gavin, the Fianna Fáil candidate, has withdrawn from the Irish presidential election "with immediate effect" after a news report alleged he owed €3,300 to a former tenant. Gavin, a former Dublin gaelic football manager, stated he made a mistake "not in keeping with my character and the standards I set myself," emphasizing the need for the office of Uachtarán na hÉireann to be "untainted by controversy." Taoiseach Micheál Martin supported Gavin's decision, acknowledging the error and his commitment to public service. Gavin had previously sent legal letters over online "smears," highlighting the intense scrutiny faced by candidates.</p>

          <h2>Jaguar Land Rover to Resume Partial Production After Cyber Attack</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to gradually restart some production this week following a major cyber attack that forced a month-long shutdown of its factories. Operations will resume first at the Wolverhampton engine plant, with full capacity expected to take several weeks. The government has offered a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to support JLR's suppliers, many of whom are small businesses facing severe financial pressure from the disruption. The hack, claimed by "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters," paralyzed JLR's IT systems, preventing car production and parts distribution globally, incurring estimated losses of £50 million weekly. The restart brings relief but highlights ongoing challenges for the supply chain.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a French woman known for her defiance in a mass sexual assault case, is returning to court to face one of her attackers who is appealing his conviction. Last year, 51 men were convicted of sexually assaulting her while she was drugged by her husband. Despite her public stance aiming to shift "shame" from victim to perpetrator, optimism for substantive change in France appears to be waning. Campaigners note conviction rates remain flat despite a rise in reported cases, and a Senate report criticized the government's efforts against sexual violence. This ongoing legal battle underscores persistent challenges in combating such crimes and supporting victims in France.</p>

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI and robotics to challenge US dominance in high-end AI chips, a market currently led by Nvidia. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei have introduced new chips, claiming performance similar to Nvidia's H20s and aiming to reduce reliance on US technology. While Nvidia acknowledges the competition, experts note Chinese claims lack consistent benchmarks, and their chips still lag in complex analytics. Despite progress, China needs access to advanced American technology and lacks developed supply chains, though it aims for independence within five years. This tech race underscores global competition and strategic investment. (not investment advice)</p>

Crisis negotiators spent 90 minutes communicating with him before he surrendered. He was subsequently booked on a charge of making criminal threats, bringing a resolution to a concerning incident that caused alarm among the tech company's employees.</p>

          <p>India aims to attract skilled professionals back home, seeking a "reverse brain drain" following President Trump's proposed $100,000 hike in H-1B visa fees. Policymakers view the US's increasingly hostile immigration environment as an opportunity to repatriate talent. Some Indians have already returned, citing immigration limitations and even launching platforms to assist others. While interest in returning is growing among Indian students and executives, experts caution that large-scale reverse migration requires significant, concerted government effort. This effort is currently missing, and India faces global competition for skilled migrants, making the endeavor challenging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced major housing market reforms to cut costs, reduce delays, and halve failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed asserts these changes will "fix the broken system," potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710 and shortening transaction times by up to four weeks. Key proposals include legally mandating upfront property information from sellers and agents, covering home condition and leasehold costs. The government also plans binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals, aiming to reduce the £1.5 billion annual cost of failed transactions. A new industry Code of Practice will further enhance professional standards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mohamed Salah's reduced defensive contribution is creating a "little problem" for Liverpool, especially against stronger teams, by leaving the right-back exposed. Coach Arne Slot may grant Salah this freedom for attacking focus, but the team's defensive structure behind him is currently inadequate, as seen in a recent loss to Chelsea. While Salah's scoring form is anticipated to recover, the article points to a broader concern about Liverpool's current lack of game control and chaotic play, a shift from last season's stability. Despite these tactical issues, the team is still close to the league leaders, with expectations for improvement as the season progresses.</p>
