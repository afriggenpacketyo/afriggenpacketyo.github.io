          <p>A current Milwaukee County Circuit Judge, Hannah Dugan, and a former New Mexico Judge, Joel Cano, along with his wife Nancy Cano, were arrested on federal charges. Judge Dugan is accused of obstructing an immigration arrest by misdirecting federal agents, while the Canos are accused of harboring a Venezuelan national with gang ties and tampering with evidence. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the arrests, asserting that "no one is above the law," while critics, including Wisconsin's Governor Tony Evers, accused the Trump administration of intimidating judges. The arrests have ignited a debate about the administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants and the independence of the judiciary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to address the declining U.S. birth rate, which is nearing a record low. While President Trump expressed interest in the idea, other countries with similar incentives have seen mixed results, with Australia's birth rate continuing to decline despite a baby bonus program. Experts suggest that tackling long-standing economic issues, such as affordable day care and paid parental leave, might be more effective in creating a family-friendly environment. The U.S. currently has a Child Tax Credit, but a baby bonus could provide immediate financial assistance to new parents.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is on track for its worst performance during the first 100 days of a presidency since the Nixon era, having lost approximately 9% since January 20. President Trump's tariff policies have led investors to seek assets outside the U.S., weakening the dollar. UBS Group AG has cut its dollar forecast, citing the U.S.-China trade standoff. Deutsche Bank AG warns of a structural downtrend for the dollar in the coming years. Speculative traders have increased their bets against the dollar in April.</p>
