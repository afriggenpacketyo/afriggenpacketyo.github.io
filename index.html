          <p>The UK's home secretary has initiated an urgent review into the significant costs of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments. This action follows a BBC investigation that uncovered instances of long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as one 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment that reportedly cost £600. Government officials have acknowledged the issue, stating that while asylum seekers are not "ordinary citizens just jumping on a bus," the necessity for such expensive travel is questionable.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Olha Stefanishyna, described the recent meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy as their "longest and most thorough" yet, fostering a new level of trust. She attributed Trump's policy shift on the war to this improved relationship and a better understanding of the situation, contrasting it with previous interactions where Trump received incorrect information from Russia. The ambassador emphasized that this trust is vital for securing U.S. contributions to Ukraine's long-term security guarantees after the war ends.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal of his previous stance, U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine is in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump posted on social media that Russia's economic troubles present an opportunity for Kyiv to reclaim its original borders with European and NATO support. This marks a departure from his earlier suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory to achieve peace.</p>

          <p>At least 14 people have been killed and dozens are missing in Taiwan after Super Typhoon Ragasa caused a landslide that led to a catastrophic lake flood. The floodwaters engulfed Guangfu township in Hualien county, burying homes and streets under mud and debris, with many elderly residents feared trapped.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lauded a "big shift" in U.S. President Donald Trump's position after Trump declared Ukraine could win back all its territory. Zelenskyy suggested the change came from Trump being better informed about the battlefield reality and Russia's economic struggles. However, the reaction within Ukraine is mixed, with some parliament members expressing cautious optimism while others view it as the U.S. washing its hands of the war rather than a commitment to victory.</p>

          <p>The mother of Tamzin Hall, a 17-year-old who died after being struck by a car on the M5 motorway, claims her daughter was "desperately failed" by authorities. Tamzin, who was known to be impulsive, managed to escape from a police vehicle and run onto the busy highway despite being handcuffed with an officer beside her. Her mother questions how this was possible and states that her daughter never received the proper mental health support she needed, leading to the tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>A 67-year-old woman from the Scottish Highlands has shared her story of enduring nearly five decades of abuse before finding the strength to leave her husband. Eve Graham suffered physical, mental, and financial abuse but felt trapped due to her children and a lack of financial independence. She found a path to freedom after taking up welding and sculpture, a hobby that gave her the confidence and potential for self-sufficiency to finally report her husband to the police, resulting in his imprisonment.</p>

          <p>England rugby centre Meg Jones has emerged as one of the top players at the World Cup, her on-field success achieved while navigating profound personal grief.

Jones has channeled her grief into her performance, finding the rugby pitch to be a "safe haven" and playing with a fearlessness born from her painful experiences.</p>

This reaction elevates a minor mechanical mishap, which the UN attributed to an accidental triggering of a safety feature, into a potential diplomatic issue.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman defended the company's plan for an $850 billion infrastructure buildout, acknowledging public concern over the staggering scale of the investment. In partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, the project is equivalent to powering over 13 million homes and is driven by what Altman describes as soaring, near-infinite demand for AI compute. He stated that while such massive investment cycles can lead to losses for some, the long-term value of the technology to society will be "gigantic." (not investment advice)</p>

The judge stated the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the ABC understood the unacceptability of surrendering its employee's rights to appease a lobby group.</p>
