            <p>Amanda Knox, reflecting on her time in an Italian prison, describes how a Catholic priest, Don Saulo, became her closest friend and helped her find hope. Despite identifying as an atheist, Knox found value in Saulo's teachings and philosophical discussions, which shifted her perspective from despair to hope. Saulo supported her by allowing her to play guitar during mass and teaching her Latin, brightening her dark days in prison where she felt vulnerable and at the mercy of male guards. Knox dedicated her new book to Saulo, acknowledging his role in cultivating compassion and empathy during her imprisonment.</p>

            <p>Alaska faces budget uncertainty due to volatile oil prices influenced by President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs.

Lawmakers are hesitant to raise taxes and have depleted savings to cover budget deficits. The state's reliance on oil revenue makes it vulnerable to market changes, impacting its ability to fund crucial programs and distribute dividends to residents. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's reversal on tariffs has created confusion and uncertainty in the global market, leading economists to question his dealmaking strategy.

Despite facing opposition from her own party, Luna collaborated with Democrats to draft a bill extending proxy voting to all new parents. The conflict highlighted the challenges of adapting outdated rules to modern family needs and congressional procedures.</p>

After the US imposed a 34% tariff on Chinese goods, Beijing responded with a matching tariff, boosting domestic manufacturers of blood plasma products. The US is a major exporter of blood proteins to China, and the tariffs are expected to increase costs for foreign exporters, giving domestic companies a competitive edge. (not investment advice)</p>
