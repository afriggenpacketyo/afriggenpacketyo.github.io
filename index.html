          <p>Democratic senators and representatives are demanding full disclosure of White House financial transactions preceding President Trump's tariff pause.  Concerns have been raised about potential violations of federal ethics and insider trading laws. The letter, sent to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, requests the release of all securities transaction reports since the start of Trump's term.  This follows Trump's Truth Social posts suggesting it was a "great time to buy" before the market surge.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asserts that China bears the responsibility for de-escalating trade tensions.  He points to China's significantly larger export volume to the U.S. as a factor in the unsustainability of high tariffs. Bessent's comments come amidst market uncertainty following President Trump's tariff announcements and subsequent modifications.

          <p>This commentary expresses skepticism regarding the effectiveness of Vatican diplomacy in influencing President Trump's stance on the Ukraine conflict.  The author highlights three key reasons for this skepticism: the alignment of Trump and Putin's worldviews, Trump's erratic decision-making, and his tendency to prioritize power displays over strategic policy outcomes. The author concludes that Europe must prepare for a potential prolonged standoff with Russia independent of U.S. support.</p>
