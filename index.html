          <p>A recent MAHA Commission report has brought attention to the increasing rates of chronic diseases among Americans, especially children, with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calling it an epidemic. Physicians like Dr. Andy Tanner are observing more cases of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, which he refers to as 'the trifecta,' particularly in states with older and less healthy populations. The report connects rising obesity rates to the high consumption of ultraprocessed foods, which make up nearly 70% of American children's caloric intake. Psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen emphasized that chronic illnesses can negatively impact mental health by increasing stress hormones and inflammation, recommending a diet of foods that are beneficial for the brain.

          <p>The upcoming New Jersey gubernatorial primary is drawing significant attention as experts suggest it could serve as an early indicator of national sentiment ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Political scientists note that the race may reflect voter attitudes toward President Donald Trump and the strength of his endorsement for Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. Key issues in the election include immigration enforcement, sanctuary cities, housing costs, and general affordability, all of which resonate with voters nationwide. The Democratic primary features a crowded field of candidates, including U.S. Representatives Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, as well as Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, each vying to succeed term-limited Governor Phil Murphy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to prevent Harvard University from enrolling international students, following a lawsuit filed by the university. Harvard argued that the administration's decision was a violation of the law and free speech rights, while the Trump administration claimed that Harvard has not done enough to combat antisemitism. The order pauses the Department of Homeland Security's move to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), a database managing foreign students.

          <p>President Trump has announced a 'planned partnership' between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, ensuring that U.S. Steel will remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. According to Trump, this partnership is projected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. While the details of the agreement remain unclear, U.S. Steel praised Trump's leadership, stating that the company will grow bigger and stronger through the partnership with Nippon Steel. Shares of U.S. Steel experienced a significant jump following the announcement, though the United Steelworkers union had no immediate comment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to adequately protect Jewish students, marking the latest action in a monthslong targeting of the institution. The accusation stems from alleged breaches of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal funds. This action follows previous measures, including the suspension of over $400 million in research funding to Columbia, and reflects the administration's approach to universities it believes are not adequately addressing antisemitism. Columbia has responded by announcing changes to campus protest and security policies, as well as increased oversight of its Middle Eastern studies department.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a budget package that includes significant cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, potentially impacting millions of Americans. The 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' proposes slashing Medicaid spending by approximately $700 billion and SNAP by about $300 billion, marking the largest cuts in the programs' history. These measures are intended to offset tax perks primarily benefiting the wealthy, with President Trump asserting the goal is to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. Critics argue that the proposed work requirements and overall reductions will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and those entitled to these benefits.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is undertaking a significant restructuring of the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), involving substantial reductions in staff and a shift in authority towards the State Department and the Defense Department. Staff members dealing with major geopolitical issues have received termination notices as part of the effort to reduce the NSC's size to a few dozen people. This move follows Marco Rubio's recent appointment as national security advisor and aims to streamline the agency, which serves as the primary body for coordinating national security strategy.

          <p>President Trump has signed four executive orders designed to expedite the construction of nuclear power plants, including small, advanced reactors, in the United States. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months, while another encourages the Energy and Defense departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands. The administration also aims to quadruple the nation’s nuclear power capacity by 2050, citing a 'national energy emergency' and the need for increased electricity, especially for data centers supporting artificial intelligence. These actions have garnered bipartisan support due to nuclear power's lack of planet-warming emissions and its potential to strengthen U.S. energy security.</p>

The case gained traction when the nanny, after her relationship with Worrell ended, provided crucial information to investigators during a trip to Costa Rica.

The author met Sarah on an interfaith trip to Morocco, and saw her as someone who believed in the possibility of a different Middle East, one built on coexistence, not conflict. She worked with Arab and Palestinian communities through Tech2Peace, and was committed to a concept known as the “third narrative,” a vision that seeks to rise above the noise of vengeance and violence by focusing instead on shared humanity.</p>

Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, an MS-13 leader, possesses knowledge of a secretive pact between the Salvadoran government and the gang. Critics suggest the move aims to prevent Arevalo-Chavez from testifying in a U.S. court or cooperating with federal authorities, potentially limiting disclosures about Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's past ties to the gang. The U.S. Justice Department cites 'sensitive and important foreign policy considerations' as the reason for seeking the dismissal.</p>

          <p>Chinese students at Harvard have voiced concerns and uncertainty following the Trump administration's decision to revoke Harvard's right to enroll international students. The Department of Homeland Security's measure requires current international students to transfer to another university or risk losing their legal status. Students express limited options, as transfer deadlines have passed, and are awaiting further information from the university. International students constitute approximately 27% of Harvard's student body, highlighting the significant impact of this policy change.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meme coin, DJT, experienced a 16% price drop following a black-tie gala for its biggest buyers, who collectively spent $148 million on the token. Attendees, including crypto influencers and former NBA star Lamar Odom, were promised an exclusive experience, but some were underwhelmed by the event. One attendee, Nicholas Pinto, described the food as poor and security as lax, with Trump making only a brief appearance without engaging with most guests. Despite the opulence, the atmosphere was reportedly muted, with many attendees focused on monitoring the coin's price.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., has temporarily shielded the Trump administration from a lower court order requiring Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to release internal documents requested under open records laws. This stay allows the full court time to consider an emergency application from the administration, arguing that DOGE should be exempt from public records laws. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), seeking information about Musk’s team.
