        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland has reinstated spot checks at its borders with Germany and Lithuania, a move prompted by Germany's own toughened migration policies. This has created significant disruptions in the German-Polish border region, particularly for cities like Frankfurt an der Oder and Slubice, which have long operated as a model of European integration. Residents, commuters, and students now face long delays and uncertainty, sparking concerns among locals and officials that these political decisions are damaging years of cross-border cooperation and restricting the freedom of travel promised by the Schengen Agreement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, following a national security assessment. The rationale provided cites copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military hardware, and other essential technologies, with the stated goal of revitalizing the domestic copper industry. The announcement caused an immediate surge in copper prices, reflecting the metal's importance in the global market and signaling potential price increases for a wide range of consumer and industrial goods.

          <p>A massive emergency response is underway in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles after a tunnel collapsed, trapping at least 15 people inside. The Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed all of its Urban Search and Rescue teams to the site, but communication with those trapped has been lost. The collapse occurred within the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel project, a seven-mile-long tunnel currently under construction to upgrade the region's aging wastewater infrastructure. The incident presents a highly dangerous and complex rescue operation for first responders.</p>

This measure is part of a broader push to stabilize the labor market, which has been under pressure from sluggish growth and intense competition.

          <p>Former CIA Director John Brennan said he is "clueless" about why he might be under investigation by the FBI, following reports that evidence of potential wrongdoing was referred for prosecution. The referral reportedly relates to his handling of the 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian election interference. Speaking on MSNBC, Brennan stated he has not been contacted by the Justice Department and stands by the work of the intelligence community. The development is the latest fallout from the politically charged investigations into the Trump-Russia collusion probe.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was arrested while covering a protest in Georgia and subsequently turned over to ICE, remains in detention despite an immigration judge granting him a $7,500 bond. His lawyer claims that ICE is challenging his release and has put his bond on hold, alleging a "concerted effort" to keep him detained. Guevara, who has a work permit and a pathway to citizenship, has pleaded for his release from a federal facility, stating he is being persecuted for his journalistic work.

          <p>The Roman Catholic Bishop of San Bernardino, Alberto Rojas, has issued a decree allowing his one million parishioners to miss Sunday Mass due to widespread fear of federal immigration enforcement. The bishop cited the "grave inconvenience" and fear impeding the spiritual well-being of the faithful as the reason for the dispensation. This unusual step comes in response to an aggressive push by the Trump administration on immigration sweeps in Southern California, which has caused many in the community to go into hiding and avoid public spaces, including their places of worship.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has only partially rebounded from its sharp decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the virus is no longer the primary driver, its place has been taken by drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease, which are now significantly holding down the state's average lifespan. The research also highlights persistent and stark disparities, with the recovery being much slower for Black and Hispanic Californians compared to white and Asian residents. This data provides an early look at the pandemic's lasting public health consequences.</p>

          <p>A high-ranking Iranian official has made a direct and imaginative threat against U.S. President Donald Trump. Mohammad-Javad Larijani, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader, remarked on Iranian television that Trump "can no longer sunbathe in Mar-a-Lago" because a small drone might strike him "in the navel." The comment, made while discussing Iran's military technology, represents a significant escalation in rhetoric from a senior figure within the Iranian regime.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur who investigates human rights in the Palestinian territories. U.S. officials accused Albanese of spewing antisemitism and expressing support for terrorism, actions she and her supporters deny, calling the sanctions an attempt to silence criticism of Israel's military offensive in Gaza. This move is the latest escalation in the administration's campaign against international bodies and officials it deems hostile to Israeli and U.S. interests, provoking a backlash from human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>Just before reporting to prison to begin a seven-year sentence for fraud, former Rep. George Santos made a dubious claim on social media. He alleged, without providing any evidence, that House Speaker Mike Johnson had intervened and blocked President Donald Trump from granting him a pardon. The allegation was met with widespread skepticism, as the House Speaker has no formal power to block a presidential pardon. This final public statement is consistent with the pattern of unsubstantiated claims that defined Santos's brief and controversial political career.</p>
