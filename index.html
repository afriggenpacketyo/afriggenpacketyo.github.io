          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, carrying 277 people, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, resulting in the deaths of two people and injuries to 19 others. The ship's captain reportedly lost power and mechanical function, causing the vessel to collide with a pillar of the bridge. Numerous cellphone videos captured the collision, showing crew members dangling from the masts. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue with the sailboat. The bridge was temporarily closed but has since reopened, with officials confirming no structural damage.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the Trump administration's efforts to ramp up logging and drilling across public lands, shrink national monuments, and cut the budgets and morale of conservation workers. It draws a parallel to the McCarthy era, when environmental advocates were targeted. The piece highlights the Valentine's Day massacre, where the department of government efficiency fired numerous National Park Service and US Forest Service employees. The author argues that these actions undermine the protection of valuable national assets and disregard the importance of public lands for water conservation and recreation. The article underscores the historical context of public land conservation and the need to protect these resources for future generations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores concerns that the Trump administration might interfere with the impartiality of statistical agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), to present a more favorable economic picture. A proposed rule change making it easier to fire civil servants could allow the White House to remove statisticians whose figures prove politically inconvenient. Experts warn that tampering with data agencies' independence could damage the US's reputation as a reliable economic power, drawing parallels to countries like Argentina and Greece, where manipulated statistics led to severe economic consequences.</p>

Nature reclaims the land, with vines crawling up church walls and snow covering abandoned porches. Bradburn also explored Kejonuma Leisure Land, closed in 2001 due to falling demand and a struggling economy, finding a decaying Ferris wheel and children's train rides. The area had no security and was simply 'left to rot.'</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet approval rating has hit a record low of 27.4 percent due to growing dissatisfaction over rising prices and the government's failure to implement effective solutions. A significant majority of respondents feel "uneasy" about U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, primarily due to concerns over tariffs. The survey also indicates that over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will achieve its goal of having women occupy 30 percent of top corporate roles by 2030.</p>

          <h2>Boeing 777X Omission of Engine Chevrons Reflects Advancements in Noise Reduction Technology</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:25:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Boeing 777X, a new aircraft, does not feature engine chevrons, which are serrated edges on jet engines designed to reduce noise. This decision reflects advancements in engine design that allow for noise reduction without the drawbacks of chevrons, which reduce engine thrust. The GE9X engines on the 777X utilize new nozzle designs, materials, and honeycomb architecture to minimize noise while maintaining thrust. This advancement allows for quieter flights without compromising engine power or fuel efficiency.</p>

          <p>A fire in a building near the Charminar monument in Hyderabad, India, has resulted in the deaths of at least 17 people. The fire, reportedly caused by a short circuit, broke out in a building housing a jewelry store and residential space. Authorities stated that the narrow staircase and single exit hindered escape efforts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced financial compensation for the victims' families. Fires are common in India due to builders and residents flouting building laws and safety norms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the CDC indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies, attributed to the widespread availability of a vaccine given during pregnancy and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Compared to pre-pandemic seasons, RSV hospitalizations in babies under seven months decreased by up to 56%, and in newborns, by up to 71%. This trend suggests that the new preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young children from severe illness. Researchers note that older children who did not receive the preventatives had higher hospitalization rates, reinforcing the impact of the vaccine and treatment.</p>

The author advises businesses to use the pause to buy up products, find alternative suppliers, or bring manufacturing back to the US. The author also cautions that President Trump's past actions indicate that the trade war could escalate again, urging businesses to prepare for further disruptions.</p>
