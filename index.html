          <p>Seventeen Greek coastguards have been charged in connection with the 2023 migrant shipwreck off the coast of Pylos, Greece, where up to 650 people are feared to have drowned. Survivors allege that the Greek coastguards caused the overcrowded Adriana fishing vessel to capsize during a towing attempt and subsequently silenced witnesses. The Deputy Prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court has charged the coastguard ship captain with causing a shipwreck leading to at least 82 deaths, with other officials facing charges of exposing others to danger and failure to provide assistance. Syrian survivors, who had paid thousands for a spot on the boat, feel vindicated by the charges and hope to see justice served.</p>

The investigation into the Dobbs leak had previously failed to identify the responsible party, while the Secret Service closed the White House cocaine case due to a lack of physical evidence.

          <p>Online travel booking data indicates that tourists from countries heavily affected by Donald Trump‚Äôs trade tariffs are avoiding travel to the US. Trivago, a hotel search site, has reported double-digit percentage declines in bookings to the US from Japan, Canada, and Mexico, with Germany also showing a decrease. Concerns over an uncertain economy are also leading UK and US travelers to opt for domestic holidays. The US tourism industry is increasingly worried about a ‚ÄúTrump slump‚Äù due to the disruptions caused by the president's tariff war, as shown by an 11.6% drop in overseas visits in March compared to the previous year.

Despite facing frigid waters and harsh weather, Pugh emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, highlighting that approximately 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day. He hopes his swim will encourage people to view sharks differently and recognize their essential role in maintaining a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the sounds of rocket launches, particularly those of SpaceX, to understand the impact of rocket noise on communities. With the increasing frequency of launches, scientists are examining sonic booms and other acoustic phenomena to determine acceptable noise levels and potential mitigation strategies. Researchers are investigating why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and are preparing for the even louder sounds expected from SpaceX's Starship. The goal is to gather data that can inform regulations and reduce disruptions caused by rocket noise.</p>

          <p>President Trump has granted an unconditional pardon to Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of federal bribery charges. Jenkins, who was set to report to jail on Tuesday, was found guilty of conspiracy, fraud, and bribery related to federal programs. The Justice Department stated that Jenkins exploited his official powers for personal gain, receiving over $75,000 in cash payments for appointing individuals as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. Trump, however, described Jenkins as a victim of an overzealous Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress have revoked California's authority to set three of its mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, leading Democrats to accuse them of attacking the state. Republicans argue that California's policies are impractical for their constituents and that the state has too much influence. California has long been allowed to set its own pollution limits, resulting in stringent rules and a push toward electric cars, but this has drawn resentment from Republican states with ties to the fossil fuel industry. The move highlights ongoing tensions between federal and state environmental regulations.</p>
