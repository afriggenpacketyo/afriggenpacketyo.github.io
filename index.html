        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Health Organization has issued a stark warning about the increasing spread of drug-resistant superbugs, which are undermining the effectiveness of modern medicine. In 2023, one in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections globally demonstrated resistance to antibiotics, a trend accelerated by the overuse of these drugs in humans and agriculture. This rise in antimicrobial resistance is responsible for over a million direct deaths annually and threatens to make common infections and minor injuries life-threatening. The WHO report highlights that surveillance remains inadequate in many countries, particularly in regions with weaker health systems where resistance rates are highest.</p>

          <p>An editorial in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, has called for China to overcome technological "choke points" and secure its independence in core technologies. The commentary emphasizes that true national strength and competitiveness can only be achieved by controlling key innovations and avoiding technological subordination to other countries. This call for self-reliance comes as Beijing faces escalating trade and tech tensions with the United States and prepares its next five-year economic plan. The article frames breaking through these technological barriers as a matter of national perseverance and spirit.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion article uses the historical journey of Christopher Columbus as a metaphor for the importance of courage in overcoming personal challenges and achieving one's potential. The author reflects on the immense risks Columbus took by sailing across the Atlantic in small ships with limited navigational tools, framing it as an act of profound bravery. While acknowledging the modern controversy surrounding Columbus and the rise of Indigenous Peoples' Day, the article focuses on the theme of courage to inspire readers. It encourages individuals to confront fear, break negative habits, and pursue their goals despite uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly gutted the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) through sweeping layoffs, raising concerns about the oversight of services for 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to department sources, the reduction-in-force eliminated most staff responsible for monitoring state compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and managing billions in funding. This move is seen by critics as a significant blow to federal protections for students with disabilities, potentially leaving states without necessary oversight. The union representing employees has called the firings illegal and warned of the harm these cuts will cause.</p>

          <p>A heartwarming story recounts how a college professor's act of kindness enabled a struggling student to continue her education in 1971. Silvana Clark, who was financially abandoned by her parents after high school, was on the verge of dropping out of community college due to a lack of funds. Her drama professor, George Meshke, told her she had received a "college drama scholarship" that would cover her next semester's tuition. Clark later discovered that no such scholarship existed and that Professor Meshke had paid for her tuition himself, a gesture that allowed her to ultimately graduate.</p>

          <p>South Africa is currently debating the decriminalization of sex work, a move supported by advocacy groups to protect the rights and safety of the country's estimated 150,000 sex workers. Proponents argue that current laws make workers vulnerable to extreme violence, with studies indicating nearly 60% have been sexually assaulted, sometimes by police officers. A national moratorium on prosecuting sex workers is in place until a high court trial in May 2026, which will decide the constitutionality of the existing laws. Opponents, however, contend that sex work is inherently exploitative and should remain criminalized.</p>

          <p>The United States has demanded the release of 30 leaders from Zion Church, one of China's largest underground Christian networks, who were detained in coordinated raids across several cities. The arrests, which included the church's founder Jin Mingri, are being described by advocacy groups as one of the most extensive crackdowns on Christianity in China in decades. The Chinese Communist Party officially promotes atheism and requires religious groups to join state-sanctioned bodies, putting unregistered "house churches" at risk of persecution. U.S. officials condemned the detentions as an affront to religious freedom and a challenge to the international community.</p>

The FCA estimates that lenders could face a total payout of £8.2 billion across approximately 14 million unfair deals.

          <p>In a significant step toward ending the two-year conflict, Hamas has begun releasing the final group of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The initial handover to the International Committee of the Red Cross sparked celebrations across Israel, where tens of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square. The release is a critical part of a broader ceasefire agreement, which also includes the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners by Israel and an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. The successful exchange is seen as the first major test of the truce, with many difficult challenges still ahead for a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, is reviving his career at Barcelona, earning praise from head coach Hansi Flick and winning over fans. After a slow start, Rashford has become a key contributor to Barcelona's attack, leading the team in goal involvements with three goals and four assists across all competitions. Injuries to other key players provided him with an opportunity for more starting time, which he has used to showcase his talent and growing confidence. While his move was initially met with modest expectations, his recent performances have raised the possibility of Barcelona making the loan deal permanent.</p>
