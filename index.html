          <p>British Member of Parliament Zarah Sultana has announced she is resigning from the Labour Party to establish a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was suspended from Labour last year, cited the current government's stance on Gaza, growing poverty, and welfare policies as primary motivations for the move. She stated the new party will challenge a "broken" political system and offer a socialist alternative, though Corbyn has not officially confirmed his involvement. Labour responded by highlighting its own achievements in government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records currently held at a naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. This ruling clarifies a previous order, effectively lifting restrictions that prevented their removal to a third country without a chance to claim fear of persecution. The decision was met with a sharp dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who argued the court was enabling the administration to send individuals to a place where they might face torture or death.</p>

          <p>This article proposes a strategy to make expensive GLP-1 anti-obesity medications more accessible for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. It suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, which inflates list prices, and instead having manufacturers charge health plans a direct, lower price. Under this model, employers could then contribute a portion of the cost, significantly reducing the out-of-pocket expense for employees and aligning U.S. prices more closely with those in other countries.

          <p>A key provision in the newly passed Republican spending bill will allow workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income. The law aims to fulfill a campaign promise to eliminate federal taxes on tips for most service workers, though it includes an income cap to prevent misuse by high earners. Tax experts note the policy will primarily benefit middle-income workers, as the lowest earners often have little to no taxable income, and the tax break is set to expire in 2028.

The report links the sale of counterfeit and smuggled tobacco to international crime gangs, people trafficking, and the exploitation of illegal workers.

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries set a new record for the longest speech on the House floor, speaking for nearly nine hours to delay the final vote on the major Republican tax and spending bill. Using a procedural privilege known as the "magic minute," Jeffries vehemently criticized the legislation's cuts to healthcare and social programs. While the marathon speech served as a high-profile protest and stalled proceedings, it did not alter the final outcome, as the bill passed shortly after he concluded.</p>

          <p>Israeli military operations across Gaza have killed at least 69 people, according to local rescuers, as bombardment of the territory intensifies. One airstrike hit a school being used as a shelter in Gaza City, killing 15 people, while another 38 were reportedly killed while queuing for aid. The violence continues as international pressure mounts on both Israel and Hamas to agree to a U.S.-backed ceasefire and hostage release deal, though significant obstacles to an agreement remain.</p>

The discussion took place after the White House confirmed it was pausing some weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision attributed to a Pentagon review of U.S. military stockpile levels. The Kremlin's readout stated the two leaders discussed the war in Ukraine and the Middle East, while the White House has yet to provide details of the call.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology for broadcasting a controversial performance by the rap-punk group Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury festival. During their set, the band led the audience in a chant of “Death to the IDF,” referring to the Israel Defense Forces. The incident prompted a police investigation into the comments and resulted in the band's U.S. visas being revoked. The BBC's director-general expressed deep regret for the broadcast of what he termed "offensive and deplorable behavior."</p>

          <p>The diplomatic relationship between Russia and Azerbaijan is under significant strain following a violent police raid in Yekaterinburg that led to the deaths of two ethnic Azeri Russian citizens. In response, Azerbaijan cancelled Russian cultural events and arrested Russian journalists, prompting a cycle of reciprocal accusations and arrests. Experts indicate this crisis deepens existing tensions, which have been simmering since a Russian missile downed an Azerbaijani passenger plane late last year, leading to questions about Moscow's waning influence in the region.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece, authored by former State Department diplomats, argues that Secretary of State Marco Rubio's plan to restructure the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor is a grave mistake. The authors contend that closing human rights offices and dismissing expert staff will dismantle decades of bipartisan foreign policy infrastructure and undermine U.S. national security interests. They warn that this retreat from promoting democracy and justice globally sends a dangerous signal to authoritarian regimes and imperils vulnerable populations worldwide.</p>

          <p>President Trump's legal team has entered into discussions with Google regarding a 2021 lawsuit alleging that the company violated his First Amendment rights by restricting his YouTube account. This development follows multi-million dollar settlements in similar cases against Meta and X (formerly Twitter), where payments were made to Trump's presidential library fund. The article suggests a pattern of the administration using the power of the presidency to pressure major tech companies into settling these legal challenges.</p>
