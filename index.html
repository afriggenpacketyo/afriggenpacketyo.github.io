            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning against the United States' trade tactics, asserting that attempts to trade away China's interests for temporary gains will backfire. The ministry spokesperson criticized Washington's approach as "unilateral bullying" and "economic hegemony," vowing firm countermeasures if foreign governments compromise Chinese interests in trade deals. The statement emphasizes China's determination and capability to defend its rights and calls for joint efforts to resist US trade coercion and uphold a fair global trading system. China views a return to protectionism as harmful to all countries.</p>

            <p>The Ukrainian military has reported a series of Russian drone attacks across several regions of Ukraine, occurring just hours after the expiration of a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Moscow. Air raid alerts were issued for the Kyiv region and several other areas, and explosions were reported in the southern city of Mykolaiv. While the extent of casualties remains unclear, these attacks signify a resumption of hostilities following the brief ceasefire period, during which both sides accused each other of violations. The attacks highlight the fragile nature of attempts to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

            <p>A nine-year-old boy's death has brought the total drowning toll in Australia to seven over the Easter weekend, marking a tragic holiday period. Most fatalities occurred due to strong swells washing people off rocks, with two individuals still missing. Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steven Pearce described the weekend as the "worst" on record for Easter, lamenting the devastating loss of life during what should have been a joyous and religious occasion.

            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has proposed a prisoner exchange with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported from the US in exchange for political prisoners held by Venezuela. Bukele addressed President Nicolás Maduro on X, stating that Venezuela's prisoners have committed no crime other than opposing him. He named specific political prisoners, including family members of opposition leaders. Tarek William Saab, Venezuela's General Attorney, responded by requesting the names and medical status of the Venezuelans in El Salvador and accusing the government of human rights breaches.</p>

            <p>This article critiques the second episode of The Last of Us Season 2, focusing on the death of Joel. It argues that the show's expansion beyond the game's storyline has been awkwardly inserted, diminishing the shock and impact of key events. The article contrasts Season 1's exploration of building bonds with Season 2's focus on fractured relationships and undiluted pain. The author suggests the show has become a punishing watch, lacking the elegant insights of the first season, and ultimately, is blinded by misery.</p>

            <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing renewed calls for his dismissal following reports of a second group chat where he allegedly shared sensitive military operations details with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The messages, sent via the Signal app, reportedly contained details of an attack on Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis. Democratic politicians have repeatedly called for Hegseth to step down, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stating that Trump is too weak to fire him.

Local policymakers are betting on the sports sector as traditional growth drivers, like real estate, are no longer as effective.

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China’s Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's US production hub due to the impact of tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. The jet, painted with Xiamen livery, was one of several waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion center for final work and delivery. With Trump raising tariffs on Chinese imports and China retaliating with tariffs on US goods, a Chinese airline taking delivery of a Boeing jet could be crippled by the increased costs. The decision to return the aircraft highlights the economic consequences of the ongoing trade war.</p>

            <p>A growing number of couples in Japan are entering into "friendship marriages," nonsexual unions driven by practical advantages like social security benefits, despite contradicting their sexual orientations. These arrangements, exemplified by Satsuki and Minato, offer companionship without romantic or sexual expectations. A Tokyo-based marriage agency has facilitated over 300 such marriages in the past decade, highlighting a shift away from traditional expectations. Experts suggest that these unions are a response to the lack of legal same-sex marriage recognition and the desire to provide parents with peace of mind.</p>

The rollout of "free hours" scheme, which aims to provide 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents, has not been the panacea many hoped for. Childcare deserts persist, particularly in deprived areas, and experts are concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those missing out.

Other factors deterring men from seeking medical help include appointment systems that don't fit their work patterns and services that rely on open communication.

            <p>Scientists are investigating the Santorini volcano in Greece to assess the potential danger of a future eruption, using the British royal research ship the Discovery to search for clues. This research aims to understand what seismic unrest could indicate an imminent eruption and map the hydrothermal system to determine if seawater mixing with magma increases explosiveness. The expedition will provide data and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency and help local residents feel safer. The work is timely given the recent earthquakes, highlighting how exposed the island is to seismic threats.</p>
