          <p>Danish renewable energy giant Orsted has received shareholder approval for a crucial $9.4 billion rights issue to ensure its financial stability. The company has been facing significant turmoil, including a recent profit warning and a halt to its Revolution Wind project off the U.S. coast by the Trump administration. Orsted is currently suing the administration to resume construction on the nearly completed wind farm. The approval of the capital raise was met with some relief by investors, causing a modest rise in the company's struggling share price.</p>

          <p>European stock markets traded higher on Friday as investors anticipated the release of a key U.S. jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on an interest rate cut. The regional Stoxx 600 index saw gains, led by mining stocks. Among individual companies, Danish wind farm developer Orsted's shares rose after securing shareholder approval for its emergency capital raise. Overall market sentiment has improved on bets of a Fed rate cut, though concerns about government debt and fiscal policies remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has strongly rejected a Western proposal to deploy a "reassurance force" in Ukraine following any potential ceasefire, stating that any such troops would be considered "legitimate targets." The warning comes after a Paris summit where 26 of Ukraine's allies, led by France, committed to providing security guarantees once fighting stops. Putin also expressed skepticism about reaching any agreement with Kyiv, despite recent talks with U.S. President Trump, creating further uncertainty about a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities, along with other federal agencies, conducted a major enforcement operation at a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia, leading to the detention of 450 individuals. The raid targeted the construction site for an adjacent EV battery plant, a joint venture with LG Energy Solution, forcing a temporary halt to its construction. The operation is part of the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement agenda and has prompted a response from the South Korean government, which expressed concern over the potential impact on its citizens and investment companies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release its latest jobs report, the first since President Trump fired the agency's commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, last month. The dismissal followed a weak jobs report and unsubstantiated claims from the President that the statistics were manipulated. Economists are closely watching the new data for signs of a hiring slowdown, which could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. The controversy has raised concerns about the politicization of federal statistical agencies and the integrity of economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German women's Bundesliga season has begun with a landmark match, as an expansion to 14 clubs helped draw a record-breaking crowd of over 50,000 for Bayern Munich's opener. The league is aiming to increase its visibility and competitiveness, with more matches than ever set to be broadcast on free-to-air television. Despite this positive momentum, the article notes that the league still faces challenges in infrastructure and financial growth compared to rivals like England's WSL and the U.S. NWSL. The dominance of top teams Bayern and Wolfsburg also remains a key issue for overall league competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has suspended production at its UK factories and instructed staff to stay home after a significant cyber attack forced the company to take its IT systems offline. The disruption has severely affected car manufacturing in Halewood and Solihull, as well as sales operations during a typically busy period for new vehicle registrations. A hacker group has claimed responsibility for the breach. The company is working to restore its systems in a controlled manner, but the complex process has also caused knock-on effects for parts suppliers and repair garages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a preliminary ruling that pork and pork by-products from Europe are being dumped into its market, causing "material injury" to the domestic industry. As a result, importers will be required to pay deposits based on anti-dumping margins starting September 10. The move is seen by Chinese analysts as a justified countermeasure to similar investigations launched by the European Union against Chinese exports. This action signals escalating trade tensions between China and the EU and is framed as a necessary step for Beijing to safeguard its economic interests.</p>

          <p>Kenya is in advanced discussions with the Export-Import Bank of China to restructure its debt, including a proposal to make repayments in Chinese yuan instead of U.S. dollars. The move is aimed at easing pressure on Kenya's foreign reserves and could significantly lower the interest rate on loans for major infrastructure projects like the Standard Gauge Railway. According to Kenya's Treasury, switching to yuan-denominated debt would reduce the interest rate from over 6% to approximately 3%. This potential agreement reflects a broader trend of yuan internationalization in bilateral finance.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the UK and other parts of the world can witness a total lunar eclipse on Sunday evening, which will cause the full moon to take on a deep red color, an effect known as a "Blood Moon." The eclipse occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. For UK observers, the Moon will rise already in total eclipse around 19:30 BST. The article advises finding a clear view of the eastern horizon to see the event, which does not require special eye protection.</p>
