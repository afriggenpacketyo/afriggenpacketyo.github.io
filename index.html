          <p>A survivor of the attack on the Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester has described the harrowing moments when an assailant killed two worshippers during Yom Kippur services. Alan Levy, a synagogue trustee, recounted helping to barricade the doors against the attacker, whom he described as a "deranged, evil monster" shouting threats. The attack claimed the lives of Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, and left three others injured. Police have made several arrests on suspicion of terrorism in connection with the deadly assault.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he believes hostages held in Gaza could be freed "very soon" as mediators prepare for peace talks in Egypt. His comments come after Hamas partially agreed to a U.S.-led 20-point peace plan, which includes releasing hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and transferring governance to technocrats. Despite the diplomatic movement, Israeli airstrikes have continued in Gaza, and key Hamas demands like disarmament remain unresolved. The upcoming negotiations in Cairo are seen as a critical opportunity to determine if a path to ending the nearly two-year conflict is achievable.</p>

          <p>Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young faced scrutiny after a strange fumble during the first quarter of the game against the Miami Dolphins. While under pressure from Dolphins pass-rusher Bradley Chubb, Young attempted a pump fake but lost control of the ball, leading to a turnover that Miami subsequently converted into a touchdown. The play intensified criticism of the third-year quarterback's performance, which has been inconsistent through the early part of the season. Young later threw an interception, adding to a difficult outing for the Panthers' offense.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government shutdown extending into another week, congressional leaders from both parties publicly blamed each other for the ongoing stalemate. House Speaker Mike Johnson asserted that the House had fulfilled its duty by passing a funding measure, placing the responsibility on Senate Democrats. In response, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Johnson of not being serious about negotiations, particularly regarding an extension of health insurance tax credits. The impasse leaves hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay as political gridlock in Washington continues with no clear resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>Everton's Jack Grealish continues to make a strong case for an England national team call-up after scoring a dramatic late winner against Crystal Palace. Despite being left out of the latest squad, Grealish's impressive form, including four assists and a key goal, is reportedly giving England manager Thomas Tuchel a "headache" regarding future selections. The 30-year-old has been a standout performer while on loan at Everton, demonstrating his capabilities ahead of next summer's World Cup. Grealish remains focused on his club performance but hopes his consistent play will earn him a spot on the international stage.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou is facing mounting pressure after a 2-0 loss to Newcastle United extended his winless start with the club to seven games. The team, which qualified for European competition last season, is now just one point above the relegation zone, leading to speculation about the manager's future. Postecoglou acknowledged the difficult situation and stated that he expects to have discussions with the club's owner about the team's direction. Despite the poor results and a shift to a more pragmatic style, he remains confident in his ability to overcome the challenge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, a move he says is intended to address crime but which state and local leaders have condemned as an abuse of power. The decision follows clashes between protesters and federal immigration authorities in the city and is part of a broader administration strategy of sending federal forces into Democrat-led cities. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accused the administration of "attempting to manufacture a crisis." The deployment raises legal and constitutional questions regarding the use of military forces for domestic matters without state consent.</p>

The plan's next phase involves establishing a stable, terror-free governance structure in Gaza, which he acknowledged would be a longer and more complex process.

          <p>Two years after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack and Israel's subsequent military response, the war in Gaza has resulted in immense devastation and a complex geopolitical landscape. Israel's stated goals of recovering all hostages and destroying Hamas have been only partially achieved, with dozens of hostages still held and Hamas remaining operational despite significant losses. The conflict has led to widespread international condemnation of Israel's military conduct, accusations of genocide, and a growing movement for the recognition of Palestinian statehood. The war has also weakened Israel's regional adversaries but has caused deep social fragmentation within Israel itself over the conflict's direction.</p>

This recent tragedy adds to a growing list of fatalities and serious injuries, many involving teenagers, linked to the dangerous activity often fueled by social media. While the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has launched public awareness campaigns and is exploring engineering solutions like barriers between cars, critics argue that not enough is being done to physically prevent access to train roofs.

While the stock market has remained resilient, a prolonged shutdown could increase economic uncertainty, especially with the delay of key government data like the jobs report. With official economic reports paused, commentary from companies such as PepsiCo, Delta Air Lines, and Constellation Brands will be crucial for gauging consumer spending and the broader economic climate.

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, the number one cause of fights in relationships is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used when discussing these topics. Research suggests that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate conflicts by becoming self-aware, pausing to correct a harsh tone, and rephrasing their statements. For the person on the receiving end, calmly asking their partner to try again in a different tone can also prevent arguments from spiraling.</p>

          <p>Russia's foreign ministry has strongly condemned a U.S. military strike that killed four people on a vessel in international waters near Venezuela, which Washington alleged was transporting narcotics. In a call between their foreign ministers, Russia and Venezuela expressed serious concern that Washington's actions could escalate tensions throughout the Caribbean region. Moscow stated there was "no certainty" the U.S. would not link its anti-drug operations to the ongoing crisis in Haiti. Russia reaffirmed its full support and solidarity with the Venezuelan government amid the heightened regional tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>The rapid increase in transfer fees in women's football, with the world record being broken five times in 2025, signifies major growth in the sport's ecosystem. These record-breaking moves, primarily to clubs in England's Women's Super League and the U.S. National Women's Soccer League, are fueled by rising viewership, longer contracts, and larger commercial deals. However, this financial boom also risks creating a significant competitive gap between the wealthiest leagues and others, such as Germany's Bundesliga, which struggle to compete financially. The trend highlights both the sport's increasing marketability and the challenge of maintaining competitive balance globally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrats are reportedly embracing the political risks of a government shutdown as their most significant effort to challenge the Trump administration's actions. Activists and strategists suggest the move is a calculated response to pressure from their base to "do something" to rein in a president they view as a threat to democratic norms. By holding firm on demands for healthcare provisions, particularly the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, Democrats aim to force a confrontation on an issue where they feel they have strong public support. This shutdown is viewed not just as a budget dispute but as a battle over presidential power and constitutional authority.</p>

          <p>The widespread administration of the HPV vaccine to adolescents in the United States has been so effective that herd immunity against the primary virus causing cervical cancer is now considered within reach. A recent study found that high, gender-neutral vaccination rates have led to major reductions in HPV infections, even among unvaccinated women, who saw a 75% decline in infections from certain strains. Experts say this demonstrates the power of community protection but caution that maintaining this resistance depends on sustaining high vaccine uptake. The success in the U.S. offers a model for global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to give police new powers to place conditions on repeated protests, allowing them to consider the "cumulative impact" on communities. This could enable senior officers to restrict the location or duration of demonstrations that have repeatedly occurred at the same site. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the move is about balancing the right to protest with residents' right to live without fear, citing recent concerns within the Jewish community. The announcement, which follows a day of mass arrests at a pro-Palestinian demonstration, has been criticized by civil liberties groups as a crackdown on free speech.</p>

          <p>Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, known for its massive spending on social media political advertising, is adapting to new ad bans by platforms like Google and Facebook by mobilizing a network of online activists. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has launched a "fight club" initiative to recruit "digital freedom fighters" who will promote the party's message organically through comments and content sharing. This shift in strategy comes as Fidesz faces a strong challenge from opposition figure Peter Magyar, whose online presence has grown significantly without paid advertising.

          <p>A cluster of small earthquakes, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.5, occurred near the Big Bear area in Southern California overnight from Saturday into Sunday morning. The series of temblors was centered in the San Bernardino Mountains and produced weak shaking that was felt by some residents, but no damage was reported. The U.S. Geological Survey noted the vibrations were likely comparable to a large truck passing by. The event serves as a minor seismic reminder for a region that experienced a much stronger pair of earthquakes, including a magnitude 6.3 in Big Bear, back in 1992.</p>

An opening-lap collision between the two led Piastri to protest over the radio, adding to a series of recent on-track disputes. While Russell controlled the race from the front, McLaren clinched the constructors' championship, though the celebration was somewhat overshadowed by the internal team conflict.

Brown suggests that being clear, using precise language, and avoiding text for sensitive topics are crucial skills. The article reinforces her advice with phrases that can help de-escalate conflict by showing empathy and a willingness to understand the other person's perspective.</p>

Concrete manufacturing is a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the alliance aims to use its collective purchasing power to create a stable market for low-carbon alternatives. By guaranteeing demand, the group hopes to incentivize producers to invest in the expensive technologies needed to create more sustainable cement and concrete.

          <p>Syria is conducting its first elections in over four decades, a complex and indirect process to form a new parliament following the ouster of dictator Bashar Assad. Due to the displacement of millions and a fragile infrastructure, citizens are not voting directly; instead, a multi-stage system involves appointed committees selecting an "electoral college" which will then choose 121 parliamentarians. The country's interim president will directly appoint another 70 members, a point of major controversy. While some see the process as a modest first step, critics, including minority groups, have called it a "charade" designed to legitimize the new government without genuine democratic input.</p>
