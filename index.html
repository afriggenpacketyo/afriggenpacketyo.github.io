        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced a plan to remove all net-zero requirements for oil and gas companies in the North Sea, aiming to maximize fossil fuel extraction. This policy shift, which echoes former U.S. President Donald Trump's "drill, baby, drill" approach, reverses the UK's legally binding 2050 net-zero target. The Labour government and environmental groups have criticized the plan as reckless, warning it would accelerate the climate crisis without lowering energy bills for consumers. The move comes as 2024 was recorded as the hottest year since 1850, underscoring the urgency of climate action.</p>

          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, now 98, has curated an exhibition at Maine's Portland Museum of Art titled "Painting Energy," featuring over 100 paintings he gifted from his personal collection. After a seven-decade career focused on his own figurative art, Katz is now championing the work of other emerging and established artists, aiming to support those who face the same early-career difficulties he once did. The collection is defined not by a specific style but by the energetic impact of the art, reflecting Katz's belief in the immediate, visceral connection a painting can create. Katz continues to paint daily, embracing the fear and excitement of starting new work.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Six Phrases to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:35:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests six key phrases to foster long-term cooperation rather than immediate obedience. The approach emphasizes creating emotional safety and connection, which helps calm a child's nervous system and makes them more receptive. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative, defusing shame and preventing power struggles. By validating feelings and ensuring children feel heard and supported, parents can build a foundation of trust where listening becomes a natural outcome rather than a forced behavior.</p>

Newcastle United's Alexander Isak is reportedly attempting to force a move to Liverpool, a saga that has dominated the summer transfer period. Meanwhile, Arsenal secured Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a last-minute £60 million deal, hijacking the move from rivals Tottenham. Other potential moves include Manchester clubs vying for PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and Crystal Palace negotiating the sale of defender Marc Guehi to Liverpool, setting the stage for a frantic final day of club roster changes.</p>

          <h2>Indoor Heat Deaths in Arizona Highlight Dangers of Energy Poverty Amid Extreme Temperatures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:29:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from Arizona details the alarming reality of indoor heat-related deaths, often linked to malfunctioning air conditioning units and energy poverty. The article highlights the case of Richard Chamblee, a 52-year-old man who died in his mobile home just two days after his AC failed, as his family could not afford immediate repairs. In Maricopa County, nearly a quarter of the 608 heat fatalities in the previous year occurred indoors, with 70% of victims having a broken AC unit. Experts warn that as climate change intensifies heatwaves and energy costs rise, vulnerable populations, including the elderly and low-income households, face a growing and deadly risk.</p>

          <p>Tennessee authorities have announced that Buford Pusser, the legendary McNairy County sheriff who inspired the 1973 movie "Walking Tall," killed his wife, Pauline, in 1967. For decades, Pusser claimed they were ambushed by his criminal enemies, a story that cemented his heroic image. However, a cold case review by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation uncovered inconsistencies, including evidence suggesting Pauline was shot outside the car and that Pusser's own wound was likely self-inflicted. The district attorney stated that if Pusser were alive today, he would be indicted for murder, bringing a shocking conclusion to a 58-year-old case.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly disrupting the labor market, with job postings declining 6.7% over the past year and entry-level positions being particularly affected. While AI is poised to automate tasks in fields like coding, accounting, and graphic design, it is less likely to replace jobs requiring empathy, creative thinking, or physicality, such as healthcare, teaching, and skilled trades. Labor economist David Autor from MIT suggests that while some jobs will be displaced, AI also holds the potential to create entirely new job categories and improve efficiency in critical sectors like medicine and energy. The full impact of this technological shift is expected to unfold gradually over time.</p>

The author recounts the emotional gravity of her first hunt, emphasizing a deep connection to the animal and the environment, a stark contrast to the detachment of buying plastic-wrapped meat. The article suggests that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, with licensing fees and taxes on firearms directly funding wildlife management. By taking direct responsibility for sourcing food, hunters engage in a practice that fosters stewardship for the land and a greater appreciation for the cycle of life and death.</p>

He highlights "reverse translational research," a patient-first approach where scientists study real-world pain experiences to identify objective biomarkers. This method has enabled researchers to map the unique neural signatures of an individual's pain, leading to treatments like deep brain stimulation (DBS) that can predict and interrupt pain signals. While still in early stages, these breakthroughs offer evidence that pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, promising a future with more effective, non-surgical pain management.</p>

          <p>Using new chromosomal analysis techniques, scientists have resolved a long-standing debate by identifying the comb jelly as the first animal group to diverge from the common ancestor of all animals. For decades, researchers debated whether sea sponges or comb jellies held this distinction. By comparing the gene arrangements on chromosomes of both creatures to their closest single-celled relatives, the team found that comb jellies showed the least genetic reshuffling, indicating they split off earlier in evolutionary history. This discovery provides a crucial anchor point for understanding the subsequent evolution and diversification of the entire animal kingdom.</p>

Critics and victims' advocates argue this represents a reluctance to pursue dangerous truths, noting that the interview seemed to indulge Maxwell's claims of a poor memory.

          <h2>Potential for Joint US-Taiwan Weapons Production Raises Concerns in Beijing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prospect of joint weapons production between the United States and Taiwan is gaining traction, sparking warnings from mainland Chinese analysts about potential regional instability. U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently stated he expects such cooperation to move forward following a visit to Taipei. While both the U.S. and Taiwan see strategic and industrial benefits in co-producing arms, observers in Beijing view the move as a significant escalation. This development follows decades of U.S. arms sales to the self-governing island and could further strain already tense cross-strait relations.</p>

          <p>A new trend in state taxation, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax," is seeing states like Rhode Island and Montana impose new surcharges on high-value second homes. Rhode Island's measure adds a significant levy on non-primary residences valued over $1 million, a move that could substantially increase property taxes for wealthy owners in exclusive communities. While proponents see it as a way to generate revenue and address housing affordability, real estate professionals and some locals argue it unfairly targets seasonal residents who contribute significantly to local economies without heavily using municipal services like schools.

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively expanding its global presence and enterprise operations under the leadership of COO Brad Lightcap, who has grown the company's go-to-market team from 50 to over 700 people in 18 months. The company recently announced new offices in Brazil, Australia, and India to meet surging business demand for its AI models. This expansion places OpenAI in direct competition with its primary partner and investor, Microsoft, as both companies vie for enterprise clients. Lightcap's strategy involves tailoring OpenAI's approach to local markets and using engineers to work directly with partners, ensuring its technology solves real-world business problems effectively.</p>

          <p>The FDA has announced a Class II recall for approximately 1,950 cases of 7Up Zero Sugar Tropical soda after a labeling error resulted in full-sugar soda being packaged in cans marked "Zero Sugar."

Consumers, especially those who monitor their sugar intake for medical reasons, are advised to check the lot codes and UPCs on their cans and cartons. The full-sugar version contains about 38 grams of sugar per can, posing a potential health risk for those expecting a sugar-free beverage.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader effort to combat plastic pollution, the Australian state of South Australia has banned the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers. These iconic single-use plastics, popular in Asian restaurants and takeaways, will be prohibited starting Monday. Environment Minister Susan Close noted that the containers are used for mere seconds but can persist in the environment for centuries. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process. The ban is the latest step in the state's legislation against single-use plastics, which already includes items like plastic straws and carrier bags.</p>

If its price had matched inflation, the cocktail would cost around $20.33 today.

Alix Tichelman, a 26-year-old model he met on the website SeekingArrangement.com, was captured on a security camera injecting Hayes before he collapsed. Instead of calling for help, she is seen cleaning the scene and leaving, an action that led to her conviction for involuntary manslaughter. The case became more complex with the revelation that Tichelman's previous boyfriend had also died of a heroin overdose just two months prior, prompting a re-examination of that case as well.</p>

          <p>A recent Federal Reserve report indicates that the median retirement savings for U.S. households aged 55 to 64 is approximately $185,000, an amount considered insufficient for a comfortable retirement. Compounding the issue, an AARP survey found that one in five Americans over 50 have no retirement savings at all. The article suggests several strategies for those behind on their savings, including consulting with a financial advisor to review investment strategies and exploring alternative assets like Gold IRAs to hedge against economic volatility.

          <p>An essay by Avram Alpert addresses the common feeling of guilt or misery when experiencing personal success while the world faces numerous humanitarian and political crises. Drawing on ancient religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that feeling the world's pain is a moral response. However, this connection should also extend to sharing in the world's joys, a concept known as sympathetic joy or "freudenfreude." The article suggests that embracing both horror and delight is a form of resistance against cynicism and despair, allowing for a more complete and resilient human experience.</p>

          <p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to reform the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a move experts warn could destabilize the vaccine market and harm public health. Critics argue that dismantling the program, which shields manufacturers from most litigation and compensates those with rare vaccine side effects, could cause companies to exit the market, leading to vaccine shortages. Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist, could use his authority to alter the program's table of recognized injuries or direct the DOJ to concede more claims. This approach could undermine trust in vaccines and make it harder for genuinely injured individuals to receive aid.</p>

Entering his sixth season, Herbert has yet to win a playoff game, and the challenge has intensified with a season-ending knee injury to star left tackle Rashawn Slater. Rookie Joe Alt will now protect Herbert's blind side as the team prepares to lean on a more physical running game under offensive coordinator Greg Roman. With a talented but crowded AFC quarterback field, this season will be a critical test of whether Herbert can elevate his game and lead the Chargers to postseason success.</p>
