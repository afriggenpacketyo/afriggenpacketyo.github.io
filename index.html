          <p>The Republican-led legislature in North Carolina has passed a new congressional map designed to increase the party's seats in the U.S. House. The redrawn map specifically targets a competitive district held by a Democrat, altering its boundaries to be more favorable for a Republican candidate. Democrats have criticized the move, alleging it dilutes the voting power of Black communities, while Republicans defend it as a map that should elect 11 Republicans from the state, up from the current 10. This action is part of a broader national trend of partisan redistricting ahead of upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted its eighth strike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel since early September, with the latest attack occurring in the Pacific Ocean and resulting in two fatalities. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated the vessel was operated by a designated terrorist group involved in narcotics smuggling. This series of strikes has now led to at least 34 deaths, raising questions from some lawmakers about the legal and constitutional basis for these actions. The administration maintains it is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asserted that U.S. cattle ranchers "don't understand" the benefits of his tariff policies, urging them to lower their prices for consumers. His comments follow criticism from the ranching industry over his proposal to import beef from Argentina as a measure to reduce domestic prices. Trump defended his actions, crediting his tariffs on foreign cattle for the ranchers' recent success and emphasizing the consumer's importance in his economic considerations. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and some Republican senators have voiced strong opposition to the Argentine beef plan.</p>

          <p>Tesla is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating a return to revenue growth after two consecutive quarters of decline. Expectations are set at 54 cents per share on $26.37 billion in revenue, though projections for the fourth quarter suggest a potential drop. The report comes after Tesla announced record vehicle deliveries for the quarter, but overall deliveries for the year are down compared to 2024. Investors and analysts will be closely watching for updates on the company's Robotaxi service, new lower-cost models, and the impact of a sales slump in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old woman has been arrested and charged in New York City for allegedly abandoning her newborn child at the Penn Station subway stop. The baby girl was discovered alive and conscious, wrapped in a blanket on a stairway with her umbilical cord still attached. After being alerted by a caller, first responders transported the infant to a local hospital for care. The arrest followed a public appeal by the police, who had released security camera footage of the suspect. Authorities reminded the public of New York's Safe Haven Law, which allows for the safe and legal surrender of newborns.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet has found that physiological side effects like weight change and altered heart rate vary significantly among different antidepressant medications. Researchers analyzed data from over 58,000 participants and compared 30 common antidepressants, noting that some were associated with weight gain while others led to weight loss. The study's authors emphasize that these findings should not discourage use of the effective medications but rather encourage doctors to better tailor treatments to individual patient needs. Experts advise careful monitoring of side effects and weighing the risks against the benefits of treatment.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a delay in its planned reforms for the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) system, pushing the publication of its Schools White Paper to the following year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the delay allows for a "further period of co-creation" to test proposals with families and educators. The decision has drawn criticism from groups like the County Councils Network, which called it "massively disappointing" given the financial crisis in the current system. However, some parent and advocacy groups welcomed the extra time to ensure the reforms are effective and well-considered.</p>

          <p>Seventy years after her execution, the grandchildren of Ruth Ellis are formally requesting a posthumous pardon for her 1955 murder conviction. Ellis, who was hanged for killing her lover David Blakely, is now understood to have been a victim of severe and prolonged domestic abuse. Her family's lawyers argue that in a modern court, this context of abuse would likely have reduced the charge to manslaughter. The case was a landmark in British legal history, contributing to the eventual abolition of the death penalty, and this new appeal highlights the evolution of the justice system's understanding of domestic violence.</p>

          <p>The UK's Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is reportedly considering a tax change that would increase the amount paid by professionals such as lawyers, accountants, and some doctors. The proposal involves imposing a new charge on those operating under limited liability partnerships (LLPs), who are currently treated as self-employed and do not pay employers' National Insurance. This potential move, which could be announced in the upcoming Budget, aligns with the chancellor's goal of having "those with the broadest shoulders" contribute more.

          <p>Graham Platner, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maine, has apologized for and covered up a skull-and-crossbones tattoo that bears a resemblance to the "Totenkopf" symbol used by Nazi forces. The tattoo became a point of controversy after being seen in a social media video. Platner, a Marine veteran, explained he got the tattoo in 2007 with fellow Marines, choosing it from a parlor wall without knowing its historical association, and stated he would never have kept it if he had been aware. The incident adds to recent scrutiny of the candidate's past online remarks.</p>

          <p>A trend is emerging where employees at artificial intelligence startups face layoffs shortly after their companies are acquired by or receive major investments from large tech firms. Examples include staff reductions at Snorkel AI, Scale AI, and Humane following deals with companies like Accenture, Meta, and HP. This pattern marks a shift from past acquisition strategies, where retaining startup talent and culture was often a priority. Now, as big tech companies streamline operations and focus on AI-driven efficiency, duplicate roles are quickly eliminated, creating job volatility for workers in the burgeoning AI sector.</p>

Dyche, known for his pragmatic philosophy, emphasized that the team must play "effective football" to stabilize their position in the Premier League, where they are currently in the relegation zone.
