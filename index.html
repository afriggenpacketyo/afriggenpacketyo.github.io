          <p>Jose Mourinho has departed as Fenerbahce manager after just over a year, following the club's elimination from the Champions League play-offs. The Portuguese coach guided Fenerbahce to a second-place league finish, but his tenure was marked by controversy, including a four-match ban for comments about referees and a lawsuit against Galatasaray after denying their accusations of racist statements. Fenerbahce thanked the 62-year-old for his efforts, wishing him success in his future career. This article details a significant and often contentious change in European football management, highlighting the challenges and high stakes involved in top-tier club leadership.</p>

          <p>Australia's ANZ bank has issued an apology after an automated email mistakenly informed some staff of their termination, asking them to return their laptops ahead of schedule. Retail banking executive Bruce Rush stated this was not the intended method for sharing sensitive news amidst job cuts in the retail banking business. The Financial Sector Union condemned the "botched" episode, describing it as "disgusting" and causing "panic and distress" due to a "chaotic pace of change" implemented without proper consultation. This article highlights a significant corporate communications failure, underscoring the critical importance of dignity and respect for employees during periods of organizational change and workforce reduction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has significantly reduced its 2025 growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, primarily due to weaker expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry cited a significant fall in Denmark's U.S. exports in early 2025, following inventory build-up and increased competition in the weight loss drug market, which has seen Novo Nordisk lose market share. Despite this downward adjustment, the ministry emphasized that the Danish economy remains strong overall with high employment and low inflation, and it revised its 2026 growth forecast higher. This article details a national economic adjustment largely influenced by a key industry player's market performance and global trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>The UK government has ordered the removal of an advertisement for a "balloon-craft" and cake decorating tutor role at an asylum seeker center, following public and political criticism. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra instructed contractor Mitie to withdraw the job, which Conservative critics labeled as "perks" diverting taxpayer money from deportations. Conversely, asylum seekers' rights charities argue that the government has a duty to provide such activities to support the mental health and well-being of detainees, citing contractual obligations and highlighting poor conditions in some centers. This article illuminates a contentious debate over welfare provisions for asylum seekers versus perceived taxpayer value.</p>
