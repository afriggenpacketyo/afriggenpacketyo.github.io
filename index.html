          <p>Meta Platforms saw its shares jump over 6% following a strong earnings report that highlighted the company's resilience in advertising despite a complex macroeconomic backdrop. The article cites Citi's Ronald Josey, who noted Meta's healthy advertising demand trends and the offsetting effects of its large user base and focus on new products against macroeconomic challenges. First-quarter revenues increased by 16% year-over-year to $42.31 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate macroeconomic uncertainty, and the company issued in-line guidance for the current period.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported mixed quarterly results, including a 3.6% decline in U.S. same-store sales, the largest domestic drop since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, due to bad weather and cautious consumer spending. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted a significant decrease in quick-service restaurant traffic from low- and middle-income consumers, with economic pressures broadening across income levels. The company plans to focus on value meals and popular menu items to attract customers back, and new items like McCrispy Chicken Strips and Minecraft tie-in meals are showing promise. Despite challenges in some international markets, McDonald's reiterated its full-year outlook, planning to open 2,200 locations.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have identified two 18th-century shipwrecks off the coast of Costa Rica as Danish slave ships named Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus.

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will not be allowed to compete in women's football starting June 1. The decision has sparked debate, with some advocating for the safety and fairness of women's sports, while others argue it excludes transgender women from participating in the sport. Natalie Washington of Football vs Transphobia suggests many transgender women may now give up football, while Pride Sports notes a lack of football-specific research indicating safety risks from existing policies. The government maintains that biology matters in women's sport and supports sporting bodies in setting their own rules.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has signed an agreement with the United States granting control over a portion of its future revenue from natural resources, aiming to secure continued U.S. support amidst its war with Russia.

This agreement, reached after challenging negotiations and an Oval Office confrontation, seeks to give President Trump a stake in Ukraine's future while addressing concerns about unchecked U.S. aid.

          <p>A new bill introduced by Rep. Hank Johnson seeks to increase accountability for federal judges accused of misconduct, ensuring that investigations continue even if the judge retires or resigns. The Transparency and Responsibility in Upholding Standards in the Judiciary Act (TRUST) aims to close a loophole that allows judges to collect pension benefits despite facing credible allegations of wrongdoing. The legislation follows an NPR investigation highlighting issues with the federal judiciary's system for reporting workplace problems. The bill's future in a GOP-controlled Congress remains uncertain, but it underscores ongoing concerns about integrity and safety within the federal court system.</p>

          <p>General Motors has lowered its 2025 financial outlook, anticipating a $4 billion to $5 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs. The revised guidance considers some benefits from recent changes to the tariffs, such as reimbursements for U.S. parts and reduced tariff stacking. GM CFO Paul Jacobson mentioned the company aims to mitigate at least 30% of the tariff-related cost increases through internal initiatives. CEO Mary Barra said the company is working to offset increased costs by strengthening its supply chain and increasing U.S. sourced parts, and the company plans to leverage its existing U.S. assembly plants.</p>

          <p>As of May 1, 2025, the average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage is 6.89% and 6.11% for a 15-year mortgage, according to national averages. Refinance rates are similar, with a 30-year refinance at 6.86% and a 15-year refinance at 6.12%. Experts recommend strengthening credit profiles, comparing different lenders, and considering loan terms to secure the best rates. Taylor Jessee, CFP, anticipates mortgage rates to stop rising if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, and borrowers should pay attention to fees and lock in their rate after making a decision.</p>

          <p>As of May 1, 2025, the national average savings account interest rate is 0.41%, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates, ranging from 4.10% to 4.45%. Experts recommend choosing high-yield savings accounts, especially those offered by online banks, to maximize savings. Shane Cummings, CFP, advises that many top accounts start with a minimal deposit and have no monthly fees, making them accessible for individuals looking to save even small amounts. It's important to compare different accounts to find the best rate and terms for individual savings goals.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors highlight a lesser-known 401(k) feature—after-tax contributions—as a way to significantly increase retirement savings. For 2025, individuals can defer up to $23,500 into their 401(k), with additional catch-up contributions for those 50 and older, and some plans offer after-tax contributions on top of these caps. Certified financial planner Dan Galli emphasizes the potential for tax-free income through converting these after-tax funds to Roth, but many plans still don't offer this option. It's important to convert after-tax funds to Roth periodically to minimize future tax liability.</p>

The company's CEO Chris Kempczinski described navigating "the toughest of market conditions," with global comparable sales falling 1%. The disruptive nature of President Trump’s trade policy has worsened financial pressures for lower-income customers in the U.S. and Europe.

          <p>In this New York Times article, Ross Douthat interviews Jonathan Keeperman, a figure in the emerging right-wing counterculture, to discuss its ideas and influences. The conversation covers topics such as vitalism, the longhouse, and the role of Donald Trump. Keeperman argues that the right-wing counterculture seeks to revive genuine cultural and ideological elements to counter a dominant left, emphasizing individuality, strength, and a rejection of what he sees as an over-feminization of society. The article examines the counterculture's relationship with Christianity, taboos around race, and its potential to influence mainstream culture.</p>

          <p>Local elections in England are serving as a major test of the political landscape following Prime Minister Keir Starmer's rise to power. With the economy struggling and the government facing low opinion polls, Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., aims to capitalize on voter discontent. The elections will reveal whether Reform can translate its polling surge into actual votes, while the Conservative Party, led by Kemi Badenoch, faces challenges in defending seats won during a previous high point. The elections include council seats, mayoral races, and a special election for Parliament.</p>
