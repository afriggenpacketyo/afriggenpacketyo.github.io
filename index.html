          <p>Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting that he will step down as CEO by the end of the year, designating Greg Abel, the vice chairman of non-insurance operations, as his successor. Buffett, who has led the company since 1965, stated he will still be around to assist, but Abel will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment. This transition marks the end of an era for the $1.1 trillion conglomerate, as Abel, 62, prepares to take the reins. Buffett also stated that 'Trade should not be a weapon' when discussing the economy.</p>

As a result, Carter joked he would wear a jersey with just his last name.
