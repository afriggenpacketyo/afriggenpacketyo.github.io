          <p>England's struggles in one-day international cricket persisted as they lost to South Africa by five runs at Lord's, conceding the series with one match remaining. Despite a strong chase of 331 runs, led by notable performances from Joe Root and Jacob Bethell, England fell just short. This marks England's fifth ODI series loss in their last six attempts since the 2023 World Cup. The team's performance has raised concerns about player fatigue and team balance ahead of the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>The FBI successfully thwarted a potential mass shooting by arresting a 25-year-old North Carolina man who allegedly posted violent, racist threats online. The suspect threatened to attack a preschool and harm dozens of Black children. FBI Director Kash Patel praised the quick action of law enforcement, stating that threats against children are unacceptable acts of cowardice. The arrest was made possible after Google reported the threatening YouTube comments, allowing authorities to trace the suspect and take him into custody before he could act.</p>

          <p>After nearly 25 years, Daniel Levy has stepped down as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, leaving behind a legacy of significant off-field success but on-field underachievement. He was the driving force behind the club's world-class £1 billion stadium and modern training facilities, transforming Tottenham into a financially profitable entity. However, his tenure was marked by frequent managerial changes and a failure to secure major trophies, with only one League Cup and one Europa League title to show for his long reign, which often made him a target of fan protests.</p>

          <p>Northwestern University President Michael Schill has announced his resignation after a turbulent three-year tenure marked by significant challenges. His leadership faced scrutiny over the handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests and a subsequent congressional hearing on antisemitism. The university has also been grappling with a $790 million federal funding freeze imposed by the Trump administration, which led to a hiring freeze and hundreds of staff layoffs. Schill stated he believes it is the right time for new leadership to guide the institution through its next chapter.</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation is officially dropping a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight disruptions. The rule, introduced under the Biden administration, was designed to mitigate inconveniences from delays and cancellations within an airline's control. Airline industry groups, which had opposed the measure arguing it would increase ticket prices, praised the decision. The department is also reviewing other consumer protection rules related to airline refunds and ancillary fee disclosures.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma saw its stock plummet to its lowest price since its July IPO, following its first earnings report as a public company. Although second-quarter revenue slightly exceeded expectations, investors were concerned by a third-quarter forecast that suggested slowing growth. The company's net retention rate, a key metric for customer expansion, also showed a slight decline. The sharp drop in share price reflects market volatility and heightened scrutiny on newly public tech companies in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock dropped nearly 5% after the company issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the third quarter, deepening its significant year-to-date losses. While the software giant's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed analyst expectations, the weak guidance amplified investor concerns. The company has not seen the same lift from the AI boom as some of its tech peers, and Wall Street remains anxious about the future of the software-as-a-service (SaaS) sector. CEO Marc Benioff, however, maintained an optimistic tone about the company's transformation. (not investment advice)</p>

While that court upheld the finding that Trump committed fraud, James's office is now seeking to have the original monetary judgment restored.
