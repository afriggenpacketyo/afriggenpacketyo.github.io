          <p>At least five tourists were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir after gunmen opened fire on them in Pahalgam, a popular beauty spot. The region's chief minister, Omar Abdullah, described the attack as "much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years." Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, deploying security forces to the area. The attack occurred in Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow, and no group has claimed responsibility for the long-running insurgency in the Muslim-majority region. Optimism score: 10</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin signaled a potential openness to direct talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, a shift from Russia's stance since the early stages of the war, although Russian strikes persisted across Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified that Putin's comments indicated a willingness to discuss avoiding civilian targets. However, attacks continued, including a strike on an apartment block in Zaporizhzhia that killed one woman and injured 20 others. Zelensky denounced the attacks as "deliberate Russian terror" and reiterated his proposal for a 30-day cessation of strikes on civilian infrastructure. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly reduced its 2025 U.S. growth forecast from 2.7% to 1.8%, attributing the change to the negative impact of trade tensions and reciprocal tariffs. The IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, noted that weakening consumer confidence also played a role in the downward revision. The IMF also increased its estimate of a U.S. recession to 40%, up from 25% in October 2024, while also reducing the global growth forecast to 2.8%. These revisions reflect the economic disruption caused by recent trade policy decisions. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan has agreed to step aside, paving the way for President Trump to appoint his nominee, Jay Clayton, as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. This marks another significant change in leadership for the prominent prosecutor's office.

          <p>According to Dan Ives, Head of Global Tech Research at Wedbush Securities, the tech sector may face significant volatility due to escalating tariffs on China, which are now as high as 125%. This is causing companies to reconsider the costs of importing critical components, leading to a pause in tech spending that is expected to continue through the current quarter. Ives predicts that Street estimates are likely to see earnings cuts of about 10% across internet and big tech companies, reflecting the broader pullback in spending and ongoing volatility.
