          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport immigrants to Libya, a move that legal experts argue violates both U.S. and international law due to the country's instability and human rights abuses. The plan faces significant legal hurdles, including potential violations of court orders requiring due process for deportees and the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits sending individuals to places where they face persecution or danger. Libya's warring governments have denied any agreement to accept deportees, raising further questions about the legality and feasibility of the scheme. The article highlights the legal and ethical concerns surrounding the proposed deportations, emphasizing Libya's history of migrant abuse.</p>
