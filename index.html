          <p>A declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang, the Maduro regime does not have a policy of cooperating with it. The release of the memo further undermines the Trump administrationâ€™s rationale for using the act and raises questions about its criticism of news coverage on the topic. Optimism score: 45</p>
