          <p>With insomnia affecting a significant portion of the adult population, particularly during summer heatwaves, this article outlines several evidence-based methods for improving sleep. Recommendations include maintaining a cool, dark, and quiet bedroom, engaging in daily exercise to increase melatonin production, and avoiding caffeine late in the day. The article also emphasizes reducing screen time before bed, as it can disrupt sleep cycles, and suggests trying relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, such as the '4-7-8' method, which may help calm the nervous system despite limited scientific backing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study from Tsinghua University reveals that China produced over one billion tonnes of textile fibers between 1978 and 2022, an amount roughly double the total human mass on Earth. This massive output highlights China's dominant role in the global textile industry, where it accounts for more than half of the world's processing capacity. However, the research also points to significant environmental challenges, noting that China's textile waste recovery rate is only 17%, with most of it being downcycled into lower-quality products, posing a major issue for sustainability.</p>

          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, local residents are displaying a range of reactions from hope to outrage. Protesters waving Ukrainian flags expressed their dismay, with some calling Putin's presence in their state "gross," while others, including a military veteran, voiced frustration. Conversely, some community members, like an Orthodox priest and local fishermen, hold onto hope that the summit could lead to a peaceful resolution of the war in Ukraine, reflecting the state's complex historical ties to Russia.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of deliberately trying to sabotage the upcoming peace summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Greene made the claim in response to reports of a major Ukrainian drone attack on Russia, stating that Zelenskyy "doesn't want peace" and is undermining Trump's efforts. The accusation comes just before the high-stakes meeting in Alaska, as Ukraine continues to launch strikes following recent Russian attacks on its territory, creating a tense backdrop for the diplomatic discussions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has invalidated two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities by threatening to withhold federal funding. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully by issuing guidance that ordered an end to all "race-based decision-making," which the judge described as a "sea change" in regulation imposed without proper procedure. This decision is a significant victory for educational institutions and advocacy groups who argued the administration's policy constituted illegal government censorship.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies remain apprehensive, fearing that Trump might concede to Putin's demands, such as allowing Russia to retain occupied territories, in exchange for an end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>After winning the Premier League title in his first season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot now faces heightened pressure following an extensive summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike, dramatically shifting expectations from a transitional year to demands for sustained success. This significant investment means that anything less than a major trophy and a strong challenge in both the league and the Champions League would likely be viewed as a disappointment for the newly assembled, expensive squad.</p>

Putin is expected to be deeply familiar with the details of the Ukraine conflict, a stark contrast to his opponent, and will likely aim to guide Trump toward a peace deal favorable to Russia. To achieve this, he may offer superficial concessions, such as a potential future meeting with President Zelenskyy, while appealing to Trump's transactional nature with offers of economic cooperation and a new nuclear arms control pact.</p>

          <p>An Australian man convicted of murdering Emma Lovell, a British woman, during a home invasion in Queensland in 2022 will be eligible for supervised release sooner after a successful appeal. The attacker, who was 17 at the time, had his non-parole period reduced from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence. The Queensland Court of Appeal cited the man's early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and potential for rehabilitation as reasons for the change, meaning he could be released after serving eight years and five months, a reduction of 17 months.</p>

          <p>As a federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police department unfolds, President Trump has made false claims that the city's crime is at an all-time high. The administration's operation includes the deployment of National Guard troops, federal agents setting up checkpoints, and the clearing of homeless encampments. The move has been met with resistance from local leaders and protesters, while D.C.'s mayor has pushed back against the president's portrayal of the city, noting that violent crime actually hit a 30-year low in 2024 after a spike the previous year.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights as a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants looms, threatening to ground the country's largest airline and disrupt travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The airline issued a lockout notice after the union, representing the flight attendants, gave a 72-hour strike notice. If no agreement is reached, a full work stoppage will begin on Saturday. The main points of contention in the contract negotiations are what the union describes as "poverty wages" and issues surrounding unpaid labor.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan for Democratic lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional maps, a direct response to a Republican-led effort in Texas to create new districts favorable to their party. Newsom's proposal, called the "election rigging response act," would override California's independent redistricting commission and would only take effect if Texas or another state advances a partisan mid-cycle redistricting plan. The governor framed the move as a necessary defensive measure to "neuter and neutralize" what he describes as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>The series finale of 'And Just Like That' concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending that this article argues is more authentic to her character than a traditional fairytale romance. After navigating widowhood and a failed relationship, Carrie embraces the idea that her life can be fulfilling without a male partner, reinforcing the original show's theme that female friendships are the true soulmates. The article suggests that while the revival was often criticized, it ultimately provided a more daring and realistic conclusion for its main character than the original 'Sex and the City' did.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a technological advancement that could effectively turn any warship into a small aircraft carrier. The runway-independent drone is designed to launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, the new uncrewed aircraft is significantly faster than other mainstream VTOL drones, potentially providing the Chinese navy with a major strategic advantage by expanding its aerial surveillance and strike capabilities.</p>
