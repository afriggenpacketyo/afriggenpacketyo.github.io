          <p>Independent UK Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe publicly mistook a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast for "illegal migrants," sharing a picture of their boat on social media and alerting authorities. After the crew, who were raising money for motor neurone disease, was confirmed by the Coastguard, Lowe issued an apology and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, which included a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" but also noted the "vigilante-style" response from people on the shore who were alerted by the MP's post.</p>

          <p>A divided D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has nullified a lower court's criminal contempt finding against Trump administration officials. The case originated from the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, which a district judge had ordered halted under the Alien Enemies Act. The appeals court ruled that since the planes were already outside U.S. airspace when the order was issued, the administration did not violate the injunction. This decision marks a significant legal victory for the administration in a contentious dispute over executive power and immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Billy Long is leaving his position as IRS commissioner after only two months to become the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, a move confirmed by President Trump. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will temporarily lead the agency, which has seen significant leadership turnover and planned workforce reductions under the current administration. Long, a former congressman without a background in accounting, had previously advocated for repealing parts of the tax code. His short tenure continues a period of instability for the tax collection agency.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed a U.S.-brokered peace agreement at the White House, aiming to end decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The deal establishes a new transit corridor, to be named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity," connecting Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory. Both nations' leaders credited President Trump for the diplomatic breakthrough, which also serves to diminish Russia's historical influence in the South Caucasus. The agreement marks a significant step toward regional stability and economic cooperation.</p>

This surge followed CEO Tim Cook's White House appearance, where he announced a $100 billion investment in American companies and parts. President Trump subsequently stated that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips due to its increased U.S. investment. The news alleviated investor concerns about the financial impact of tariffs on the company's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating another investigation into the origins of the probes concerning Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This move follows the declassification of documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who alleged the Obama administration knowingly promoted a false narrative to undermine Trump's campaign. With Attorney General Pam Bondi authorizing the new inquiry, questions arise about what new information can be uncovered from the extensively examined subject. The effort is seen by some as an attempt to reframe the conclusions of previous investigations.</p>

Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant drops from their 2022 peaks, largely due to an increase in housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and tight inventory, creating a divided national housing market. The data suggests a modest rebalancing is occurring, though affordability remains a major challenge nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Importance of Short Movement Breaks for Enhancing Creativity and Focus</h2>

          <p>This article explores how simple physical movement can serve as a powerful tool to overcome creative blocks and improve focus, particularly for those who work at a desk. Drawing on insights from author Kelly Corrigan, it suggests that short breaks for walking or dancing can effectively reset one's mood and mental state. The piece advocates for working with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than against them. It reframes these small breaks not as distractions, but as an integral part of the creative process itself.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has rejected a wave of international criticism following its security cabinet's approval of a plan to take full control of Gaza City. The move, which would involve relocating around one million residents, was condemned by the UN, UK, France, and Canada, and led Germany to halt military exports to Israel. An Israeli defense minister stated that condemnation would not weaken their resolve. The plan to escalate the war has drawn fierce opposition, including from within Israel's military and from the families of hostages.</p>

          <h2>Economists Raise Stagflation Concerns Over President Trump's New Tariffs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's latest round of sweeping tariffs on trade partners is fueling concerns among some economists about the risk of stagflation—a combination of high inflation and low economic growth. The new import duties, which have raised the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest point since 1934, could lead businesses to pass costs onto consumers, pushing prices up. Simultaneously, the tariffs could cause businesses to scale back hiring and investment to absorb costs, potentially slowing down the economy and weakening the job market. (not investment advice)</p>

His mother, Melissa Palomar, ran to his aid and scared the coyote away after hearing his screams. The incident was reported to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which notes that while coyotes typically avoid humans, they can become conditioned to human environments.</p>

          <p>While the "Make America Healthy Again" movement has successfully pressured food companies to phase out many synthetic food dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5, the whitening agent titanium dioxide is often excluded from these pledges. This chemical is used in numerous products, from ice cream to salad dressing, to make them appear whiter or more vibrant, and can be labeled simply as "artificial color." Despite being banned in the EU over potential health concerns, its removal is more complex for U.S. manufacturers as effective natural replacements are difficult to find, posing a challenge for reformulation.</p>

Starmer had called Israel's plan "wrong" and warned it would only lead to more bloodshed.

The demonstrators were accusing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of operating a covert and inhumane detention facility on the 10th floor of the 26 Federal Plaza building. Activists, citing footage of detainees in bare rooms, held a sit-in to demand access for officials and journalists, which authorities have previously denied. The protest highlights ongoing tensions and lack of transparency surrounding the treatment of immigrants in federal custody.</p>
