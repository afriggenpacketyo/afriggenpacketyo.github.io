          <p>Mallorca is experiencing a record number of tourists, projected to exceed 19 million in 2025, despite growing local opposition and protests against mass tourism. This influx, however, has not translated into universal economic prosperity, as many local businesses report significantly lower sales figures. The tourism industry is grappling with concerns that anti-tourism sentiment, coupled with rising prices and extreme summer heat, might be deterring traditional visitors like Germans. Despite the challenges and calls for limitations, the regional government has hesitated to implement measures to curb tourism due to the island's heavy economic dependence on the sector.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team has announced an unchanged lineup for the upcoming World Cup final against Canada at a sold-out Twickenham stadium. Head coach John Mitchell is maintaining the same starting fifteen and replacements that secured a 35-17 victory over France in the semi-final. The Red Roses, currently on a 32-Test winning streak, are seeking their first World Cup title since 2014 after losing the last two finals to New Zealand. The event is set to break attendance records for a women's rugby match, highlighting the growing prominence and support for the sport.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix stock indices both closed at new record highs, continuing a multi-session winning streak and signaling strong investor confidence in the Japanese market. This positive performance contrasted with mixed results across other Asia-Pacific markets, which did not follow Wall Street's recent downturn in tech stocks like Nvidia. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index saw a slight decline, while mainland China's CSI 300 posted gains. The varied market movements reflect differing regional economic sentiments and investor reactions to global tech sector volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has installed a new 'Presidential Walk of Fame' at the White House, featuring portraits of past presidents but notably excluding a traditional one for his predecessor, Joe Biden. Instead, Biden is represented by a photograph of an autopen signing his name, a symbolic gesture referencing Trump's repeated, unsubstantiated claims about Biden's cognitive state and decision-making capacity during his term. This move is part of a series of aesthetic changes Trump has made to the White House and continues his pattern of challenging the legitimacy of his 2020 election loss and his predecessor's presidency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets experienced a downturn, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling, largely driven by concerns over U.S. trade policy. The decline was particularly notable in the medical technology sector after the United States initiated a national security investigation into imports of medical devices, which could lead to new tariffs. In contrast, the retail sector showed strength, with H&M shares surging over 10% after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. Investors are also monitoring consumer confidence reports from France and Germany and awaiting the latest U.S. weekly jobs data for further economic indicators.</p>

          <p>A large sinkhole suddenly opened up on a major road in Bangkok, Thailand, causing significant traffic disruption, infrastructure damage, and the evacuation of nearby buildings, including a police station. Officials believe the collapse, which damaged three vehicles but caused no casualties, was linked to construction work for an underground train station. The sinkhole severed a four-lane road and exposed underground structures, prompting authorities to cut utility services as a precaution. Emergency crews are working to repair the damage, concerned that heavy seasonal rains could worsen the situation in the capital city.</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring options to provide financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a cyber-attack forced the carmaker to halt production. The prolonged shutdown of JLR's factories, which is expected to last until at least October, has raised fears that smaller suppliers dependent on the company could face bankruptcy. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms.

          <p>A verdict is anticipated in the Paris corruption trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is accused of illegally accepting campaign funds from the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, faces a potential prison sentence of up to seven years if convicted. The prosecution's case alleges that he received millions in cash to help rehabilitate Gadhafi's international image. The trial has been marked by dramatic turns, including the recent death of the key accuser, and is the latest in a series of legal challenges for the former president.</p>

          <p>The Australian horror film 'Together' has faced significant backlash from Chinese audiences after it was discovered that an unauthorized edit had digitally altered a gay couple into a heterosexual one for its screenings in China. Viewers noticed the change, along with other censorship of nude scenes, and criticized the distortion of the film's plot and disrespect toward the actors. The movie's global distributor, Neon, has since condemned the edit made by its Chinese counterpart and demanded that distribution of the altered version cease. The incident highlights the ongoing and increasingly sophisticated censorship of LGBTQ+ content within China.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from clinching the National League West title after a resilient 5-4 extra-innings victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. In an unconventional but effective strategy, starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw both made successful scoreless relief appearances to support a struggling bullpen. Despite blowing a three-run lead in the eighth inning, the team rallied, with Tommy Edman delivering the go-ahead RBI single in the eleventh. The game showcased the team's adaptability and fighting spirit, relying on improvisation to grind out a crucial late-season win.</p>

          <p>Recent discussions about forming a NATO-style defense alliance among Islamic and Arab nations have intensified following an unprecedented Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar. The attack has reportedly shaken assumptions in Gulf states about the reliability of U.S. security guarantees, prompting a push for greater strategic autonomy. While a formal 'Islamic NATO' is considered unrealistic by experts, there is growing momentum for enhanced regional security cooperation, particularly a '6+2' format involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council states plus Turkey and Egypt.

The strikes, which the Trump administration justifies as necessary to stop fentanyl flow, have reportedly killed 17 people.
