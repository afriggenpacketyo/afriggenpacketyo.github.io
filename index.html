          <p>Elon Musk is escalating his opposition to a major tax and domestic policy bill backed by former President Trump, threatening to fund primary challenges against Republicans who vote for it. Musk criticized the legislation for its spending levels and its projected $5 trillion increase to the national debt, vowing to unseat its supporters. He also floated the idea of forming a new political party. The conflict prompted a response from Trump, who highlighted the federal subsidies Musk's companies have received over the years.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old former teacher at a Michigan charter school, Jocelyn Sanroman, has been charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct. The charges stem from an alleged sexual relationship with a 16-year-old male student in 2023. Authorities were alerted after Sanroman allegedly confided in a coworker, who then reported the information to the police. The local prosecutor emphasized the severe breach of trust and praised the colleague for reporting the situation, noting that such actions are critical for keeping schools safe.</p>

Dozens of Labour lawmakers have opposed planned cuts to disability benefits, forcing the government to offer concessions to avoid a parliamentary defeat. Despite having a large majority, the internal conflict highlights deep divisions over the government's economic agenda as it struggles with high inflation and low growth.

          <p>The Trump administration has moved to freeze an estimated $6.8 billion in federal education funds that Congress had already appropriated for the current fiscal year. The move halts money intended for teacher training, after-school programs, and support for English learners and students from migrant families, with California being one of the hardest-hit states. State education leaders have condemned the action as illegal and warned that it will cause immediate harm to students and disrupt programs that are already underway.</p>

          <p>A group of six Republican state legislators in California has sent a letter to former President Trump, urging his administration to focus immigration enforcement on violent criminals rather than ordinary workers. The lawmakers argue that recent sweeping ICE raids are creating widespread fear, disrupting communities, and causing labor shortages in critical industries like construction and hospitality. They are asking for a more targeted approach to avoid these unintended consequences and also called for streamlining legal guest worker programs.</p>
