          <p>Prominent money manager Howard Rubin was arrested on charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts over a ten-year period. The indictment alleges that Rubin, with the help of his former assistant, operated a trafficking network and engaged in non-consensual and brutalizing acts in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse. This criminal indictment follows a 2022 civil verdict where Rubin was found liable for sex trafficking six women and ordered to pay millions in damages. Prosecutors are seeking to have him held without bail due to the danger he poses to the community.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that Shane Tamura, responsible for the deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting in July, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). The diagnosis was made by the New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner following an analysis of his brain tissue. Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing CTE and asked for his brain to be studied, believing the NFL had concealed the dangers of head injuries. While experts caution that CTE does not explain his violent actions, the finding highlights the potential for the disease in non-professional athletes.</p>

          <p>A branch of the National Archives improperly released a mostly unredacted version of Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to a political ally of her opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The disclosed file contained sensitive personal information, including her Social Security number, home addresses, and performance evaluations, in a potential violation of the Privacy Act. The National Personnel Records Center acknowledged the egregious error, stating a technician failed to follow standard procedures, and has since apologized to the congresswoman. The incident has intensified the political race, with Sherrill accusing her opponents of illegally weaponizing her records.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has announced major changes to eligibility requirements for commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) for non-domiciled individuals, following a deadly crash in Florida. The new rules mandate stricter criteria, including an employment-based visa and a federal immigration status check, to prevent what Secretary Sean Duffy called a direct threat to public safety. The department's audit found significant non-compliance in several states, with California being singled out for issuing licenses to ineligible drivers. California has been given 30 days to comply or risk losing nearly $160 million in federal funding.</p>

          <p>Newly released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein include the names of Elon Musk and Prince Andrew. An entry in Epstein's schedule from 2014 mentions a potential visit by Musk to Epstein's private island, six years after Epstein was a registered sex offender. The files also list Prince Andrew as a passenger on Epstein's private jet in 2000, alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These records, released by the House Oversight Committee, add to the growing list of prominent individuals connected to the disgraced financier, whose associates continue to face public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who defied the party line by voting with the SNP to scrap the two-child benefit cap shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. Their return comes as the Labour government faces increasing internal and external pressure to abolish the controversial policy. Recently, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson signaled a potential shift, stating that removing the cap is now "on the table."</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Timeline and Consequences of Late Credit Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:17:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card delinquencies rise amid economic pressures, understanding the consequences of late payments is crucial for consumers. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most card issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major threshold is at 30 days past due, when the late payment is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging one's credit score. After 60 days, penalty interest rates may be applied, and by 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts often begin, highlighting the importance of proactive communication with lenders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that accusing critics of hypocrisy is a common but flawed tactic used to deflect from principled debates about free speech. It contends that both the political right and left use this strategy to justify their own illiberal actions, suggesting their opponents were already engaging in censorship or "cancel culture." The author asserts that this approach wrongly focuses on judging people rather than evaluating the core idea of free expression. Ultimately, the piece concludes that while avoiding hypocrisy is important, relying solely on such accusations indicates a lack of genuine principles regarding liberal values.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent member of the Black Liberation Army, has died in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 78. Born JoAnne Byron, she became a significant figure in Black nationalist movements before being convicted in 1977 for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper. Two years later, she escaped from prison and was eventually granted political asylum in Cuba, where she lived for decades as a fugitive from U.S. justice. To her supporters, Shakur was a symbol of resistance against systemic racism, while law enforcement considered her a domestic terrorist.</p>

Human Rights Watch noted the festival coincides with the anniversary of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder and urged performers to use their platform to advocate for detained Saudi dissidents.

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a $150,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased, making it a more affordable option for homeowners. For a 10-year term, the average monthly payment is now around $1,847, while a 15-year term costs about $1,452. These figures represent a modest saving of approximately $16 per month compared to rates earlier in the year. While the savings are not dramatic, potential future rate cuts could further enhance the appeal of using home equity for large borrowing needs. (not investment advice)</p>

Local officials, including the Islington Council leader and the area's MP, strongly condemned the incident as a "despicable and cowardly attack." Police are searching for one suspect and have stated that attempts to incite hatred and violence have no place in their community.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered numerous generals, admirals, and their staff from around the world to attend a meeting in Quantico, Virginia, next week. The gathering is considered rare, if not unprecedented, due to its size, in-person requirement, and short notice. The Pentagon has not provided details about the agenda, but the meeting comes as Hegseth has publicly stated his intention to review and potentially cut the number of four-star positions in the military. Other speculation suggests he may be rolling out the new National Defense Strategy.</p>

          <p>The "rule of thirds" is a retirement income strategy gaining traction among those concerned about outliving their savings. It involves converting one-third of one's retirement portfolio into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the savings can then be invested for growth, used for discretionary spending, or kept as a reserve for unexpected costs. This approach aims to create a balanced financial foundation by blending the security of a pension-like income stream with the flexibility and growth potential of market investments.

          <p>This article, written by a veteran Pentagon correspondent, critiques the new, restrictive press accreditation rules imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The policy requires journalists to sign a 17-page agreement that appears to limit news-gathering and could penalize the publication of unapproved, even if unclassified, information. The author argues that these changes break with decades of precedent under both Democratic and Republican administrations, which recognized the press's role in ensuring public accountability. The piece warns that reducing media access will ultimately harm the American people by limiting their knowledge of the military's actions.</p>

Immigration attorneys report that the new price point makes it highly competitive with other countries' "golden visa" programs and has already attracted inquiries from high-net-worth families.
