          <p>A perilous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy resulted in the deaths of at least three migrants, including two children aged 3 and 4. The German aid organization RESQSHIP reported that the migrants were aboard a frail boat whose engine failed shortly after departing from western Libya. The survivors, numbering 59, were rescued and brought to Lampedusa, Italy, while the deceased were handed over to authorities. The Mediterranean route has become increasingly deadly, with almost 25,000 migrants having died or gone missing since 2014 while attempting to reach Europe from North Africa.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a cease-fire after a four-day conflict involving drones, missiles, and intense shelling, with President Trump announcing U.S. mediation efforts. Pakistan praised the American role, while India avoided mentioning it, preferring to frame the truce as a bilateral agreement to avoid appearing pressured. An Indian official said India stuck to its message of responding to every Pakistani attack with a counterattack. Celebrations erupted in both countries, though uncertainty remains regarding the cease-fire's sustainability due to lingering tensions over the Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United has put their Champions League qualification hopes in jeopardy, placing immense pressure on their final two games. Nicolas Jackson's reckless red card for striking Sven Botman not only left Chelsea short-handed but also means he will miss the pivotal final games. Coach Enzo Maresca's future hinges on whether Chelsea can secure a Champions League spot, as winning the Europa Conference League alone may not be enough to satisfy the club's ambitions. The article highlights the team's poor away form and Jackson's costly indiscipline as factors contributing to their precarious position.</p>
