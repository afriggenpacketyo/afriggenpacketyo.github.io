          <p>An attack occurred at a "Run For Their Lives" event in Boulder, Colorado, organized to raise awareness for Israeli hostages held in Gaza. An incendiary device was reportedly thrown at walkers, resulting in multiple injuries, some potentially life-threatening, and prompting a large police response. The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential terror attack, with a suspect taken into custody and authorities evacuating several blocks of Pearl Street Mall. The Jewish community in Boulder expressed sadness and heartbreak, emphasizing the importance of community safety and offering support to those affected, while Colorado's Governor Jared Polis condemned the heinous act of terror. The optimism score for this event is low due to the act of violence. </p>

          <p>Exit polls in Poland's presidential election indicate a close race between conservative historian Karol Nawrocki and Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. Initial exit polls showed Trzaskowski with a narrow lead, but a second poll reversed the results, putting Nawrocki slightly ahead. The official result is expected to be published on Monday morning, and both candidates have addressed their supporters, with Trzaskowski claiming victory and Nawrocki urging his supporters to remain hopeful. The outcome of the election could significantly impact Poland's political landscape, particularly regarding the pro-EU coalition government's ability to implement key campaign promises. The uncertainty of the election outcome creates some anxiety. </p>

          <p>The UK plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of a major defense review aimed at enhancing warfighting readiness. The review also includes a £15 billion investment in the UK's nuclear warhead program and a commitment to build six new munitions factories. Additional measures involve developing up to 7,000 long-range weapons, establishing a cyber and electromagnetic command, and allocating funds for military housing repairs. The construction of new submarines is expected to support 30,000 jobs, apprenticeships, and graduate roles, strengthening the UK's defense posture and contributing to NATO's security.
