        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's government borrowing figures for April have surpassed expectations, reaching £20.2bn, which is £1bn higher than the same period last year. Experts warn that this increase raises the likelihood of Chancellor Rachel Reeves implementing tax increases in the autumn to meet spending and borrowing rules. Weaker economic growth forecasts and potential increases in spending on winter fuel payments and defense further exacerbate the pressure on government finances. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones defends the government's decisions to stabilize public finances, citing interest rate cuts as a benefit for businesses and individuals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violated a previous court order by deporting eight migrants convicted of violent crimes to South Sudan without adequate due process. Judge Brian Murphy criticized the government's understanding of "meaningful opportunity" and outlined requirements for conducting interviews with the detainees to assess their fear of being deported to South Sudan. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's ruling "deranged," while attorneys for the deported men expressed concerns about access to counsel and interpreters in South Sudan. The judge ordered that the migrants must have access to lawyers, interpreters, and technology during the interviews, even if it means renting a room at a Holiday Inn.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa's attempt to reset relations with President Trump in an Oval Office meeting backfired when Trump focused on claims of white genocide. Trump showed a montage of clips featuring a South African politician calling for the killing of Afrikaners and got golfer Retief Goosen to reveal his family uses an electric fence for protection. Despite Ramaphosa's efforts to steer the conversation towards trade and economic ties, Trump framed the meeting on his terms, creating more pressure on South Africa to address Trump's accusations of racism against white people. Senator Chris Van Hollen warned that isolating South Africa could damage American interests and cede leadership to China.</p>

          <p>The article discusses President Trump's plan to install a new missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," to protect the U.S. from aerial and outer space threats. The system, estimated to cost $175 billion, is intended to be completed by January 2029. Critics have raised concerns about the enormous costs and unrealistic timeframe, while China has accused Trump of undermining global strategic balance. The system is said to be modeled after Israel's Iron Dome, but designed to defend against intercontinental missiles.</p>

          <p>The Enhanced Games, an event dubbed "Olympics on Drugs," has claimed that one of its athletes, Greek swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev, broke a world record in the 50-meters freestyle. The claim is controversial due to the lack of independent adjudication, the use of non-standard equipment, and the absence of doping control. The Enhanced Games promote the use of performance-enhancing drugs and have drawn criticism from sports and medical communities, who warn of the health risks and ethical concerns.</p>

The legal action was brought by two Chagossian women who would like to return to live on the islands.</p>
