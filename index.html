          <p>Kohl's shares experienced a significant surge, climbing over 20% after the retailer announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's projections. Despite an overall decline in sales, the company's improved financial outlook included a narrowed full-year sales guidance and an adjusted earnings per share forecast, reflecting a cautious but positive trajectory. This performance is notable given recent leadership challenges and a history of slumping revenues, with the company having seen three CEOs in as many years. The retailer is actively pursuing a turnaround strategy, which involves expanding departments like petites and fine jewelry, focusing on exclusive merchandise, and enhancing promotions, alongside the successful integration of Sephora shops into all its locations, aiming to drive customer engagement and long-term growth and improve its market value.

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) suspended over 20 employees who signed an open letter, known as the "Katrina Declaration," criticizing the Trump administration's changes to the agency. The letter, signed by nearly 200 current and former staff, argued that recent reforms risked undoing years of progress made since Hurricane Katrina, specifically citing the appointment of unqualified leaders and cuts to grants for disaster mitigation. FEMA, however, defended its actions, stating the suspensions were administrative and not punitive, while accusing the signatories of being "bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency" and resisting necessary reforms. This incident underscores a significant internal conflict regarding the agency's operational philosophy and political influence, as the Trump administration has previously suggested fundamentally reforming or even "getting rid of FEMA."</p>

          <p>Natalia Nagovitsyna, a Russian climber, is now presumed dead after search efforts on Kyrgyzstan's 24,406-foot Victory Peak yielded no signs of life. Nagovitsyna had broken her leg and was stranded at an altitude of approximately 23,000 feet for over two weeks, enduring extreme summer temperatures below -20C and severe winds. Multiple rescue attempts were unsuccessful, with one leading to the death of an Italian climber and another helicopter crash. Officials cited the combination of extreme weather, the area's specifics, and the high altitude, from which no one has ever been evacuated, as factors in the grim conclusion. This tragic incident underscores the profound risks and inherent dangers associated with high-altitude mountaineering.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand during the fiscal second quarter, with sales declining by 5% and comparable sales by 11%. Despite this, the company's overall performance was bolstered by a significant 19% surge in its Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter net sales growth. This strong showing enabled Abercrombie to narrowly exceed Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings, prompting an upward revision of its full-year sales and earnings per share guidance. The retailer is actively pursuing strategies to stimulate growth, including expanding into new categories like dresses and athleisure, focusing on international expansion, and engaging in high-profile partnerships such as becoming the NFL's first "official fashion partner," aiming to remain relevant with consumers.

          <p>Human smuggling networks are becoming increasingly sophisticated along the U.S. northern border, as evidenced by a recent interception of 44 migrants in a U-Haul near Vermont. Immigration attorney Peter Lumaj explains that smugglers are adapting to enforcement pressures along the southern border and exploiting state and local sanctuary policies, which inadvertently create "shopping grounds" for migrants seeking the most favorable conditions. He warns that such policies, like expanded protections for undocumented immigrants in Connecticut, undermine federal law and entice more arrivals, with smugglers leveraging GPS and social media to coordinate routes. Lumaj also highlights the distinction between smuggling and trafficking, noting the latter often involves exploitation, particularly of single men and underage girls, underscoring the severe human cost of these operations.</p>

          <p>Renowned mathematician Terence Tao, often hailed as the "Mozart of maths," is contemplating a potential departure from the United States to Hong Kong or mainland China, citing concerns over funding cuts implemented by the Trump administration. The University of California, Los Angeles professor described the current situation as "very fluid and unstable," marking it as the most uncertain period in the last three decades for scientific endeavors. His decision, he stated, largely depends on whether the administration significantly changes its course regarding support for research. This situation underscores a broader apprehension within the scientific community about the effects of geopolitical tensions and government policies on academic freedom and the future of scientific research in the U.S.</p>

          <p>U.S. mortgage demand demonstrated minimal movement last week, with total application volume decreasing by a slight 0.5%, mirroring the stability in interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances edged up to 6.69%. Although applications to refinance a home loan fell by 4%, applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose by 2%, marking the strongest week for purchase demand in a month, albeit from a low baseline. An MBA economist suggested that prospective buyers are becoming less sensitive to current rates, encouraged by increasing inventory and moderating home-price growth in various regions. This article also briefly notes President Trump's firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the potential for a successor to support more aggressive interest rate cuts.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by University of California, Berkeley economists reveals that the wealthiest Americans, specifically those on the Forbes 400 list, paid an average effective tax rate of 24% between 2018 and 2020, significantly lower than the 30% paid by other U.S. taxpayers. This discrepancy is largely due to capital gains and business income being taxed at lower rates than traditional earned income, allowing billionaires to minimize their tax burden, especially by not realizing gains on unsold assets. The article notes that President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have further reduced tax rates for the richest. The economists, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, advocate for a wealth tax to address widening inequality, arguing that current tax structures, while progressive for most, fail to adequately tax the ultra-rich.

          <p>Reform UK's plan to tackle "uncontrolled illegal migration" by deporting 500,000-600,000 people within five years faces significant questions regarding its achievability. The party proposes building secure facilities for 24,000 deportees monthly, far exceeding current government capabilities and requiring massive infrastructure investment estimated at £12 billion. The plan also involves "cutting edge data fusion" and "mandatory biometric capture" during police encounters, which could conflict with UK data protection laws and constitutional principles regarding the right to be heard. Furthermore, the proposal to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and other treaties could jeopardize the Good Friday Agreement and trade relations with the EU, while the offer of £2,500 for voluntary departures is less than existing schemes.</p>

          <p>As energy prices are set to rise again in October, increasing a typical household's annual bill by about £35, this article outlines four key strategies for consumers to manage costs. It advises considering fixed-rate energy deals, which are currently 15-17% cheaper than variable rates, but cautions to check for exit fees. Paying by direct debit is recommended for accessing better deals and ensuring accurate billing with smart meters. The article also highlights available financial support, such as the £150 Warm Home Discount for means-tested benefits recipients and hardship grants from suppliers, while warning against scams. Finally, it suggests practical energy-saving measures at home, like turning down flow rates on boilers, using efficient cooking methods, and washing clothes at lower temperatures.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the "Science of Siblings" series, delving into the unique inheritance practice of "chiro bash," or junior right, prevalent in Pakistan's mountainous Chitral district, where the youngest son inherits the family home. This tradition, which ensures parents receive care in their old age and maintains family roots in the village, contrasts sharply with the Western practice of primogeniture. While older siblings are often supported in establishing their own independent lives, the system can still generate family friction, with the youngest sometimes burdened or older siblings feeling overlooked. However, the article notes that cultural shifts, increasing educational opportunities, and the rising precedence of Shariah-based inheritance laws are gradually eroding the practice, indicating its uncertain future in modern times.</p>

          <p>St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Willson Contreras has been suspended for six games by Major League Baseball following an on-field altercation with umpires. The incident occurred in the seventh inning of a game against Pittsburgh when Contreras, after striking out, argued with the home plate umpire, then threw his bat, which inadvertently hit his hitting coach, and tossed a bucket of bubble gum from the dugout. Contreras stated he did not understand the ejection and denied saying anything disrespectful, though crew chief Jordan Baker cited "vulgar stuff" and contact with the umpire. The 33-year-old, a three-time All-Star, is appealing the suspension and an undisclosed fine, as his team navigates a tight National League wildcard race.</p>

          <p>Scottish Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) Graham Simpson has officially defected to the Reform UK party, making the announcement alongside leader Nigel Farage. Simpson, who described his departure from the Conservatives as "an enormous wrench," becomes Reform's only current MSP and the second to leave the Scottish Tory group within a week. His move is interpreted as an effort to help shape a new political force and potentially improve his re-election prospects in next year's Holyrood election, given the challenging political landscape for the Conservatives. The defection aligns with Reform UK's intensified focus on immigration, with Farage recently unveiling an ambitious plan to deport 600,000 migrants over five years, sparking debate on its feasibility and implications.</p>

This "diplomatic yellow card" is unprecedented in U.S.-Danish relations, intensifying after President Trump's repeated expressions of interest in annexing Greenland and his administration's criticism of Denmark's investment there.

          <p>President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, based on unproven mortgage fraud allegations, is widely viewed as a direct challenge to the central bank's crucial independence. This article critically observes that, unlike previous instances, financial markets have shown a surprisingly muted reaction to Trump's aggressive maneuver, despite warnings from experts about potential long-term risks. Concerns include the possibility of rampant inflation and permanently elevated borrowing costs if the Fed's monetary policy becomes politically influenced, ultimately eroding confidence in the institution and the U.S. dollar's global standing. The article concludes that the defense of the Fed's autonomy ultimately rests with the courts, Congress, and the electorate, rather than relying on market intervention. (not investment advice)</p>

This growing sentiment aligns with the increased support for the far-right anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD). Refugees frequently encounter discrimination, especially in housing and employment, with men in eastern Germany facing particular obstacles. Despite these negative experiences, a remarkable 98% of surveyed refugees aspire to German citizenship, leading to a sharp increase in naturalizations and pending applications.

Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun, asserted that China's nuclear capabilities are not comparable to those of the U.S. and Russia, which together hold nearly 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. China maintains its nuclear forces at the "minimum level required for national security" and explicitly states it does not engage in an arms race. This rejection highlights China's consistent stance that the nations with the largest nuclear arsenals should fulfill their primary responsibility for disarmament, further complicating global arms control efforts.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households are facing a 2% increase in their energy bills starting in October, following the latest adjustment to the price cap by energy regulator Ofgem. This change will push the typical annual household bill up by £35, reaching £1,755, signaling another winter of elevated energy costs for consumers. The rise is primarily driven by increased costs in wholesale energy markets and higher expenses associated with energy transmission, such as managing grid capacity and activating gas-fired power plants. While campaigners express concern about the ongoing struggle with energy debt for many families, the article notes that extra support measures, including a £150 Warm Home Discount for eligible individuals, will be implemented, funded by a slight rise in standing charges across all billpayers.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency review into a 2024 school stabbing in Ammanford, Wales, where a 13-year-old girl injured two teachers and a pupil, has highlighted missed opportunities for intervention. The report found the girl, later sentenced to 15 years for attempted murder, had a disturbing fascination with weapons, war memorabilia, and figures like Hitler, and had previously been found with a knife and a BB gun at school. It concluded that she would have benefited from "targeted help" if information regarding her mental health challenges, troubled childhood, and bullying concerns had been fully shared and assessed. However, offers of counseling and early help assessments were declined by her father, and a referral to the Prevent anti-terrorism program was not pursued, underscoring systemic communication gaps.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Meituan announced a severe financial downturn, with its total operating profit plummeting by 98% to 226.4 million yuan, and net profit dropping significantly from 11.4 billion yuan to 365.3 million yuan year-on-year. The company attributed this sharp decline primarily to "irrational competition" within the instant delivery market, which has ignited an intense price war. This competitive environment led to a substantial 75.6% decrease in the operating profit of its local commerce segment, coupled with a 27% increase in the cost of revenue, largely due to higher courier incentives, and a 51.8% surge in selling and marketing expenses. These disappointing financial results prompted a 3% dip in Meituan's Hong Kong-listed shares even before the official publication. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York-listed shares of Canada Goose surged over 7.6% in premarket trading following reports that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the winter-clothing maker private.

Bain Capital, advised by Goldman Sachs, is currently awaiting more offers before making a decision. This potential deal highlights a significant shift for the company, whose valuation has dropped considerably from its 2018 peak of $7.7 billion, yet still represents substantial returns for Bain since acquiring control in 2013.

This discovery is a significant development for the Kizamu Kai group, which has been investigating the mine's history and searching for victims' remains since 1991, underscoring Japan's extensive use of Korean laborers during World War II. The recovery occurs amid improving diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea, though the Japanese government has historically shown reluctance to fully address wartime atrocities or fund such sensitive searches.

          <p>Domestic violence has been identified as the leading cause of homicide in Utah, responsible for over a third of the 137 homicides recorded between July 2023 and January 2025, according to an analysis of FBI and state data. The majority of perpetrators were men, and victims, including family members, were almost evenly split by sex. This alarming statistic emerges as domestic violence response centers experience a surge in referrals due to a new lethality assessment law, while simultaneously enduring significant cuts to federal funding for crime victims under the Trump administration. Advocates from the Utah Domestic Violence Coalition warn that these funding reductions are particularly devastating for rural and underserved communities, pushing already strained service agencies to a critical tipping point and exacerbating the crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Roth IRA conversions, a strategy often used by investors to reduce lifetime tax burdens, could inadvertently impact the eligibility for the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction for some high earners. This article explains that President Trump's "big beautiful bill" temporarily increased the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 for 2025, but this benefit begins to decrease once modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $500,000, phasing out completely at $600,000. Converting pretax funds to a Roth IRA generates additional taxable income in the year of conversion, potentially pushing taxpayers into this MAGI phaseout range. This creates what some tax experts term a "SALT torpedo," resulting in an artificially higher tax rate of 45.5% within those income thresholds, underscoring the complex interplay of tax strategies and new legislation.

          <p>The Trump administration's "war on DEI" (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) is significantly threatening the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, a crucial federally backed lending program. This article highlights that most of the $324 million allocated by Congress for the fund has been frozen by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which criticizes CDFIs as "anti-white" and aligned with radical DEI agendas. This move creates a standoff between the White House and a bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans from Trump-friendly states, who advocate for the fund's release, noting its disproportionate benefit to rural areas and its ability to leverage private investment. The situation underscores a conflict between the administration's ideological push and its stated commitment to supporting "forgotten communities," potentially crippling small lenders vital for economic development in underserved regions.

He pleaded not guilty and was released on $75,000 bail, now facing a potential five-year prison sentence if convicted, and ordered to attend an outpatient drug rehabilitation program.

          <p>This article explores the complex relationship between antidepressants and chronic pain, noting that approximately 20% of adults globally experience chronic pain, often impacting their mental health. While antidepressants are frequently prescribed for chronic pain, a review of 176 trials by the University of Southampton and Cochrane found limited reliable evidence for their efficacy, with only duloxetine showing short-term effectiveness and little data on long-term side effects. The review highlights that amitriptyline, a commonly prescribed antidepressant for pain, lacked sufficient trial data for reliability. The article emphasizes that individual experiences vary, and while some may find relief, the broader scientific evidence is inconclusive, suggesting alternative strategies like engaging in joyful activities may also help manage chronic pain.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is vigorously challenging President Trump's attempt to remove her from the board, a move he announced via Truth Social, citing unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook, who made history as the first African American Fed governor after her 2022 appointment by President Biden, has a term slated to end in 2038. Trump accuses her of falsifying documents related to two primary residences, though she has not been charged with any crime. Legal experts and the Fed itself emphasize the high bar for a president to remove a governor "for cause," underscoring the vital safeguard of the central bank's independence in setting monetary policy. This unprecedented political interference has sparked outcry from Democrats and raises significant constitutional questions. (not investment advice)</p>
