          <p>In Cameroon, 92-year-old President Paul Biya is seeking an eighth term after 43 years in power, exemplifying a trend of gerontocracy across Africa. This article highlights the irony of older rulers governing the world's youngest continent, where the median age is just 19. Other long-serving, elderly leaders in nations like Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe are also profiled. The situation is causing significant frustration, sparking a rise in youth-led protests, dubbed "Gen Z" movements, which are challenging the established political order.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion occurred at Accurate Energetic Systems, a military explosives facility in Tennessee, resulting in multiple fatalities and leaving 18 people unaccounted for. The blast completely destroyed one of the buildings on the campus, with the local sheriff describing the scene as one of the most devastating in his career. Federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, are investigating the cause of the explosion. The site remains unstable, with officials warning of potential secondary explosions, complicating search and rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>A drone strike on a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, Sudan, has killed dozens of people, including many children, women, and elderly individuals. Local activists attributed the attack to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been besieging the city for 17 months. El-Fasher is the last Sudanese army stronghold in the Darfur region, and its potential fall could allow the RSF to control the entire territory. The UN has warned that continued strikes on civilian areas may constitute war crimes amid a deepening humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" analyzed the recently brokered peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, attributing its success largely to the diplomatic pressure exerted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Panelists argued that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose political career is built on understanding American politics, ultimately yielded to this pressure because he fundamentally needs U.S. support. The discussion highlighted this dynamic as the critical turning point that led to the historic deal to end the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for former U.S. President Joe Biden has confirmed that he is undergoing radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. The 82-year-old is also receiving hormone treatment, with the radiation therapy expected to last for five weeks. This development follows his diagnosis in May with an aggressive form of the disease that had metastasized to his bones. Biden, who has long advocated for cancer research, left office as the oldest serving president in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown continues with no end in sight as Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, refuse to approve funding without key concessions on healthcare and other priorities. Republicans have expressed outrage at the Democratic strategy, accusing them of holding the government hostage. The standoff has escalated as the White House began following through on threats to fire thousands of federal workers, deepening the impact on the nation and intensifying the political battle in Washington.</p>

          <h2>Fox News Host Jesse Watters Criticized for Speculating About Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Sex Life</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary piece condemns Fox News host Jesse Watters for his on-air remarks about White House adviser Stephen Miller and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Watters repeatedly praised Miller as a "sexual matador" before baselessly claiming that Ocasio-Cortez "wants to sleep with" him. The author argues that this bizarre commentary was a defensive reaction to AOC mocking Miller's height and suggests that ridicule is a potent weapon against the thin-skinned nature of many MAGA figures.</p>

          <p>Archbishop Gregory Aymond of New Orleans has testified under oath for the first time in the archdiocese's ongoing bankruptcy case. The confidential deposition is a significant development in the proceedings, which involve a proposed $230 million settlement with survivors of clergy abuse. The archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2020, a move that effectively halted dozens of pending sexual abuse lawsuits and prevented the archbishop's testimony until now.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht in connection with the Pacific Palisades fire, the most destructive in Los Angeles history, which killed 12 people and destroyed over 6,800 structures. Federal investigators revealed disturbing digital evidence, including prompts the suspect allegedly gave to ChatGPT months before the fire to generate dystopian images of a burning city. This evidence points to what prosecutors describe as a single person's recklessness leading to catastrophic loss.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Pro-Worker Rhetoric Clashes with Policies Amid Shutdown</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that while Donald Trump cultivates a pro-worker image, his administration's policies often have the opposite effect, as highlighted by the mass firings of federal employees during the current government shutdown. Critics point to actions such as widespread tariffs, which raise consumer costs, and mass deportations as policies that ultimately harm the economic reality of American workers. The article suggests a significant disconnect between the administration's populist rhetoric and its tangible impact on the labor force.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a poignant personal essay, a Palestinian-American writer reflects on the concept of "disenfranchised grief" following the death of her grandmother. She describes feeling a profound sense of guilt for mourning a personal loss while simultaneously witnessing the immense and relentless suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, which is being broadcast to the world. The writer explores the cruel calculus of comparing personal sorrow to mass atrocity, where the simple act of grieving can feel like a betrayal.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the popular "no regrets" philosophy, framing regret as an inevitable and potentially useful byproduct of free will. Instead of avoiding or wallowing in feelings of disappointment and guilt over past decisions, it suggests there is value in examining them. By doing so, individuals can learn important lessons about their values and desires, transforming a painful look at the past into a constructive tool for self-awareness in the present.</p>

          <h2>Labour's Deputy Leadership Race Seen as a Referendum on Keir Starmer's Leadership</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 08:51:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing contest for the UK Labour Party's deputy leadership position is being widely interpreted as an indirect verdict on Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The race between Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson is giving party members a platform to express their discontent with the government's performance and its current standing in the polls. With Powell, who was recently sacked from the cabinet, seen as the favorite, the outcome could signal significant dissatisfaction with Starmer's leadership from within the party's ranks.</p>
