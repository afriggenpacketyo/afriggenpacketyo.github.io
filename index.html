          <p>A law enforcement officer and an undocumented immigrant were injured during a targeted traffic stop in Los Angeles when officers opened fire. According to a DHS official, the immigrant allegedly rammed a law enforcement vehicle, prompting officers to fire in defense, striking him in the elbow. A U.S. marshal was also hit in the hand by a ricochet bullet, and both individuals were hospitalized for their injuries. The DHS stated the immigrant had previously escaped custody and that resisting arrest endangers everyone involved.</p>

President Trump confirmed the project, which he says is funded by $250 million in private donations from business and tech companies, will not cost taxpayers. The addition is intended to host large events and state visits, with a capacity of nearly 1,000 people. Despite initial claims that it would not interfere with the existing structure, work is visibly underway to alter the historic building.</p>

          <p>The upcoming September consumer price index (CPI) report is being met with skepticism from some financial market observers due to concerns about data integrity. The ongoing government shutdown has raised questions about the Bureau of Labor Statistics' ability to collect complete and accurate data with reduced staffing. This scrutiny adds to existing criticism of the BLS's methods and recent data revisions, leading some analysts to caution against placing too much emphasis on this single report. Economists expect the data to show an annual inflation rate of 3.1%, which would likely influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is demanding $230 million in compensation from the Department of Justice for criminal investigations conducted after his first term. The claims, filed through an administrative process, relate to the probe into Russian election interference and the investigation into his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. This unusual situation could see a settlement approved by his own second-term appointees, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as his defense attorney. Trump has publicly acknowledged the awkwardness of effectively suing his own government while in office.</p>

          <p>A major Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that took numerous global services offline has renewed concerns about the world's dependence on a few dominant US tech firms. The incident, originating from Amazon's Virginia operations, impacted vital UK services like banking and government platforms, highlighting the "nested dependency" of the digital economy. Experts note that while using hyperscalers like AWS and Microsoft Azure offers economies of scale, it also creates concentrated risk. The event has prompted calls from regulators and industry advisors for greater competition and data resilience standards to prevent such widespread disruptions.</p>

          <p>A new study by the advocacy group Jobs for the Future reveals that 60% of American workers are in jobs that fail to meet "quality" standards. The research defines a quality job based on five key indicators: financial well-being, safe workplace culture, growth opportunities, employee agency, and stable work structure. According to the survey, many workers report financial struggles and unpredictable schedules, and a quarter see no path for advancement. The findings suggest that while official labor statistics may show high employment, they don't capture the full picture of job satisfaction and stability for the majority of the workforce.</p>

          <p>The priceless crown jewels stolen from the Louvre museum were not covered by private insurance, as confirmed by France's Ministry of Culture. Under French law, collections in national museums are considered state property, and the state acts as its own insurer unless items are loaned out. This means neither the museum nor the government will receive an insurance payout to cover the estimated $102 million loss. This policy highlights a unique approach to insuring national treasures, where the financial risk of such a heist is borne directly by the state rather than a private company.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska is cautioning the Trump administration that its proposal to import beef from Argentina would hurt American cattle ranchers without effectively lowering consumer prices. President Trump suggested the plan as a way to combat soaring U.S. beef costs, but Fischer argues it would undermine the domestic agriculture industry, which is already struggling. She urged the administration to focus on trade deals that benefit American producers rather than imports that could pull the rug out from under them. The proposal is part of a broader U.S. financial assistance package to Argentina, a close ally of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A third survivor has resigned from the advisory panel for the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, citing feelings that the process is "scripted and predetermined." The survivor, known as Elizabeth, expressed concern that their voices were being used to legitimize decisions that had already been made, particularly regarding the inquiry's scope. This follows the resignations of two other survivors who raised concerns about the potential appointment of chairs with backgrounds in policing or social work. The departures highlight growing frustration and a lack of trust in the government's handling of the sensitive and long-delayed investigation.</p>

          <p>The recent high-profile robbery at the Louvre museum is evoking memories of the "Pink Panthers," an infamous international network of jewel thieves responsible for over $500 million in heists. While there is no evidence linking the gang to the Louvre theft, the brazen, meticulously planned nature of the crime mirrors their signature style. The Pink Panthers, primarily from Eastern Europe, were known for their military-style precision, quick execution, and elaborate escapes, targeting high-value locations across Europe and Asia for nearly two decades. The comparison highlights the professional caliber of the Louvre thieves and the significant challenge law enforcement faces in recovering the stolen national treasures.</p>

          <p>China's commerce minister has accepted an invitation for urgent talks in Brussels to address escalating trade tensions with the European Union. The meeting will focus on China's recent move to tighten export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are critical for the EU's high-tech manufacturing industries. Another key issue is the fallout from the Netherlands' decision to effectively take control of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia due to national security concerns. The EU's trade chief described China's restrictions as "unjustified and harmful" and is seeking immediate solutions to prevent further disruption to critical supply chains.</p>

          <p>Lauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, has declared that the market is currently in an artificial intelligence bubble that is destined to burst. She argues that the trillions of dollars being earmarked for AI-related capital expenditures by major tech companies are not justified by projected profits, creating a significant mismatch. Wolfe compares the current enthusiasm to the dot-com era, warning that many investors will lose money when the correction occurs. She advises that the prudent strategy is not to short the bubble, but to invest in undervalued sectors that are being overlooked. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review a case, Trump v. Illinois, that could significantly expand the U.S. president's power to deploy the National Guard for domestic law enforcement. The case stems from President Trump's attempt to use federalized troops to manage protests outside an Illinois immigration facility, a move blocked by lower courts. The Trump administration argues that the president has exclusive and unreviewable authority to decide when to federalize the Guard to execute federal laws. Critics fear that a ruling in Trump's favor could grant unchecked power to use the military to suppress dissent or interfere in elections.</p>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, called Mango House, has developed a successful and self-sustaining business model by primarily serving refugee and immigrant patients on Medicaid. Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic operates on a walk-in basis and has implemented numerous efficiencies, such as eliminating nurses and streamlining paperwork, to maximize patient volume while keeping costs low. By mastering the Medicaid billing system and choosing to see most other patients for free, the clinic avoids the complexities of private insurance. This unique approach challenges the conventional wisdom that Medicaid is an unprofitable payer and offers a model for providing accessible care to vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv is experiencing a total blackout after a "massive" overnight assault by Russian missiles and drones targeted its energy infrastructure. The attack, which also killed four people in the surrounding region, is part of Russia's escalating campaign against civilian and energy facilities across Ukraine. Authorities report that the strikes left hundreds of thousands without power and have also disrupted water supplies. This intensifying bombardment raises concerns about Ukraine's energy resilience and its ability to maintain essential services as winter approaches, with replacement equipment for the damaged grid being scarce.</p>

Silver futures also tumbled more than 7%, marking the most significant drop since 2021 and halting a recent, powerful rally in precious metals. The sell-off was attributed to easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and technical indicators suggesting the metals were overbought. Despite the plunge, some analysts view it as a temporary correction, maintaining a bullish long-term outlook for gold due to persistent inflation and geopolitical uncertainty.

This follows a previous bankruptcy and sale of the UK business earlier in the year, highlighting severe financial struggles amid intense competition and shifting consumer habits.

          <p>Israel is implementing new rules that threaten to de-register major international nongovernmental aid organizations (INGOs), severely impacting their ability to operate in Gaza and the West Bank. According to aid officials, the new registration process includes ideological criteria and requires approval from a committee that includes Israel's Ministry for Combating Antisemitism. Several large INGOs, including the Norwegian Refugee Council, have had their applications rejected or stalled, preventing them from sending staff and supplies to the famine-stricken regions of Gaza. This move follows Israel's ban on the main UN aid agency, UNRWA, and is seen as a way to control and restrict the flow of humanitarian assistance.</p>
