        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) released its annual allergy report, identifying the most challenging cities for seasonal allergy sufferers, with Wichita, Kansas, topping the list for the third consecutive year. The report considers tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use, and the availability of allergists. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing, which is highest in the mornings and late afternoons. She also advises consulting a doctor to differentiate between allergy symptoms and those of colds or viruses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Chinese electric vehicle (EV) exports to the United Kingdom have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports are experiencing a significant surge, nearly 600% in the first quarter of the year. This trend is driven by affordability, as one Londoner mentioned choosing a Chinese EV due to Tesla's higher price. Unlike the European Union, the UK only applies a standard 10% import tariff to Chinese EVs, fostering a more competitive market. In March alone, China's hybrid EV exports to the UK skyrocketed by 1,849% year-on-year, reaching 3,898 units.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net profit, amounting to $26 billion, due to reduced crude prices and production. The company's free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, reflecting continuing strain on its balance sheet amid global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty. Aramco reduced its performance-linked dividend payout for the fourth quarter of 2024 and repeated the reduced figure for the first quarter of 2025, although its base dividend increased. CEO Amin Nasser highlighted the importance of disciplined capital planning during volatile times, with banks and energy agencies downgrading oil price outlooks for the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems and are held to unrealistic standards of perfection. She suggests that being flawed is an important part of motherhood, as it teaches children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that they are already doing enough, and she emphasizes the importance of give and take in close relationships, advocating for mothers to prioritize their own well-being as well.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the US has remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but still below the 7.09% rate from a year ago. Meanwhile, the rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and increasing home prices continue to present affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster start to the spring home buying season.</p>

          <p>Germany's newly elected Chancellor Friedrich Merz has appointed three individuals directly from the business sector to top cabinet positions, sparking accusations of "lobbyism." Critics point to the new minister of economic affairs' background as a managing director of an energy association and the culture commissioner's ties to a media group hosting networking events for business and political leaders. While experts acknowledge the value of expertise from outside politics, they raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the limited regulations governing lobbying in Germany. The article details the existing rules, loopholes, and ongoing debates surrounding lobbying transparency and accountability.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of new sanctions, President Vladimir Putin called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia to be held in Turkey. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, during a joint visit to Ukraine, said that Russia would face “new and massive” sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. Putin, however, brushed aside that demand, indicating Russia wouldn’t stop fighting before the negotiations on May 15, if they happen.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva arrived in China for a state visit, coinciding with Beijing's condemnation of "bullying" of Latin America and unilateral sanctions against countries in the region. Lula stated his intention to establish new partnerships and sign cooperation agreements across multiple areas. China, Brazil's largest trading partner since 2009, is also discussing key infrastructure projects, including a railway linking Brazil to a megaport in Peru. This visit occurs amid rising Chinese imports of Brazilian agricultural products, potentially reducing reliance on US imports due to escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's USAID cuts are severely impacting healthcare in Africa, leading to medication shortages, program cancellations, and potential loss of life. HIV patients are losing access to medication, tuberculosis screenings are being halted, and nutrition centers are closing, exacerbating malnutrition among children. The cuts have particularly affected the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, potentially reversing years of progress. While some African countries are attempting to fill the funding gaps, experts fear the long-term consequences of reduced aid and the potential for disease resurgence.</p>

          <p>President Trump described the first day of trade talks between US and Chinese officials in Switzerland as "very good," claiming a "total reset" in relations after months of escalating trade tensions. The US has imposed tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliation from China with 125% levies on some US goods. The meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng aims to de-escalate the trade war. While Washington insists on Chinese concessions for tariff reduction, Beijing emphasizes the need for the US to ease tariffs.</p>

Labour MP Rachel Taylor accuses them of political maneuvering, while the council maintains that its crews have collected significantly more waste despite a reduced team.

          <p>A report by ODI Global reveals that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa amounted to US$66 billion. Africa has also become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, with exports surging 153% from 2020 to 2024, driven by rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. This shift aligns with global trends showing China's energy investment moving away from fossil fuels.</p>

Despite a ceasefire agreement, the writer reflects on the fortitude of the people along the Line of Control, those Kashmiris who live their whole lives in the shadow of danger and carry on nonetheless.</p>
