          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has claimed that a boat recently bombed by the U.S. in the Caribbean was carrying Colombian citizens, an allegation the White House has labeled as baseless. The U.S. has conducted several strikes in the region, stating they are targeting narco-traffickers, but has faced criticism for a lack of transparency and potential breaches of international law. The statement from Petro escalates diplomatic tensions, framing the U.S. actions as aggression against Latin America. This conflict occurs as the U.S. Senate narrowly rejected a measure to require congressional approval for such military actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of households in England are set to face higher water bills after the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) permitted five water companies to implement larger price increases than previously allowed by the regulator Ofwat. The companies, including Anglian and Southern Water, argued the extra funds are necessary for crucial infrastructure improvements. The decision allows for an average additional increase of about 3%, or £12 per year, on top of the already planned 36% rise over five years. This comes as water companies face pressure to address pollution issues and as consumer groups warn of the strain on household budgets.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is moving forward, with an Israeli official indicating that the first group of 20 living hostages could be released as early as Sunday or Monday. The agreement has been welcomed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who hopes it will lead to a permanent political solution. However, the deal faces internal opposition within Israel's government, as far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has announced he will vote against it. This highlights the delicate political balance Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must navigate to secure the return of the hostages.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition has presented a comprehensive package of reforms after marathon negotiations, revealing underlying tensions between the partner parties. Led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the agreement includes tighter restrictions on social welfare payments, changes to the pension system, and new subsidies for electric vehicles to counter competition from China. The reforms, particularly the welfare changes, reportedly faced significant opposition from the center-left SPD.

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy has overtaken coal as the world's primary source of electricity, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember. In the first half of 2025, renewables like solar, wind, and hydro accounted for 34.3% of global consumption, narrowly surpassing coal's 33.1%. This shift was largely driven by rapid adoption in populous developing countries, particularly China. While this marks a significant milestone in the global energy transition, challenges remain as rising electricity demand, partly fueled by AI data centers, tests the capacity of new clean energy infrastructure to keep pace.</p>

She is requesting all records identifying who authorized the monitoring and the full data file collected on her.

The case centers on a majority-Black congressional district in Louisiana, with challengers arguing that its creation was an unconstitutional use of race.

          <p>A growing number of first responders are turning to ketamine-assisted psychotherapy to treat severe depression and PTSD resulting from high-trauma careers. The treatment, which combines low doses of the hallucinogenic drug with therapy, can help individuals process deeply buried traumatic memories. While practitioners report significant success, the approach faces major obstacles, including a widely unregulated market, high costs often not covered by insurance, and a lingering stigma associated with the drug. Despite these challenges, many police officers and firefighters find it to be a uniquely effective tool when traditional therapies have failed.</p>

The survey also underscores a deepening partisan divide on health matters, where political affiliation increasingly shapes beliefs about scientific information. For example, a majority of Republicans believe President Trump's false claims about a link between Tylenol and autism, while a similar majority of Democrats reject them.

Retired military leaders worry that using citizen-soldiers for these tasks is a misuse of a critical resource that could negatively impact recruitment, retention, and public trust in the institution.

          <p>France is in the midst of a political crisis as President Emmanuel Macron has 48 hours to appoint a new prime minister after the previous government collapsed. The nation has been gripped by political deadlock for months, with successive minority governments failing to command a stable majority in parliament. The central challenge for any new prime minister will be to negotiate a state budget and avoid further no-confidence votes, with Macron's unpopular pension reform remaining a major point of contention. Both the far-right and far-left are capitalizing on the instability by calling for new parliamentary elections.</p>

          <p>China has significantly tightened its control over the global rare earths market by implementing new export restrictions that now cover not only the raw minerals but also related technologies for extraction and processing. Under the new rules, foreign entities will need a license from Beijing to export products containing even small amounts of Chinese rare earths. The measures explicitly target the misuse of these materials in foreign military applications and are being implemented just weeks before a potential meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, signaling Beijing's intent to use its supply chain dominance as geopolitical leverage.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England have joined a growing chorus of financial institutions warning of a potential stock market bubble fueled by investor euphoria around artificial intelligence. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva advised investors to "buckle up" for increased uncertainty, pointing to stretched market valuations as a worrying sign. Similarly, the Bank of England noted that the risk of a "sharp market correction" has increased, particularly for AI-focused tech firms whose high valuations may not be sustained if AI adoption disappoints.

          <p>Top European officials, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, are warning that Russia is actively waging "hybrid warfare" against the European Union. This form of conflict blends conventional military actions with irregular, subversive tactics designed to destabilize the bloc while maintaining a degree of deniability. Recent examples cited include airspace violations by fighter jets and drones, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure like airports, and the sabotage of undersea cables. These incidents are viewed not as random acts but as part of a concerted pattern of aggression to sow division and weaken Europe.</p>

          <p>Russia's state-owned nuclear energy company, Rosatom, is reportedly preparing to restart the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility, which has been under Russian occupation since early in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This development raises significant international safety concerns, as the plant is located in an active conflict zone and has been disconnected from the power grid for over a week. In related news, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on Serbia's primary oil supplier, which is majority-owned by Russia's Gazprom Neft, continuing economic pressure on Moscow and its partners.</p>

          <p>Catherine, the Princess of Wales, has warned that the overuse of smartphones and other digital devices is creating an "epidemic of disconnection" that harms family life. In a new essay, she argues that while technology promises to keep people connected, it often has the opposite effect, causing individuals to be "physically present but mentally absent." The princess expressed particular concern for children, who are growing up in a world immersed in technology and may be less equipped to form the warm, meaningful relationships essential for a healthy life. Her comments are part of her ongoing campaign focused on early childhood development.</p>
