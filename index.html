          <p>David Gergen, a prominent figure in American politics who advised four presidents from both parties, has passed away at the age of 83. Known for his bipartisan approach and influential career in government, media, and academia, he served in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton administrations. Gergen was famous for crafting the line "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential debate. He later founded the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard's Kennedy School, leaving a legacy of promoting collaborative and moral leadership.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated the Boston Red Sox's eight-game winning streak, attributing their success to a recent visit to the White House. In a post on Truth Social, Trump noted, "They haven’t lost since they saw me in the Oval." The impromptu visit occurred on July 3 while the team was in Washington, D.C., for a series. The article also revisits manager Alex Cora's past decision to skip a White House visit in 2019 to protest the federal government's response to Hurricane Maria in his native Puerto Rico.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The events, which celebrate Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage, took place in 18 locations including Belfast, Coleraine, and Keady. Officials and participants described the day as peaceful and celebratory, with large crowds and sunny weather contributing to a positive atmosphere. The article notes the event passed largely without issue, even at historically sensitive locations like Ardoyne in north Belfast.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snap a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. Pitching three scoreless innings, Ohtani struck out four batters and allowed only one hit, setting a positive tone for the team. While still on a limited workload following Tommy John surgery, his contribution was pivotal before bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan took over to secure the win. Ohtani's effective return to the mound provides a much-needed boost for the Dodgers.</p>

In a social media post, Trump labeled O'Donnell a "threat to humanity" and suggested she should not be allowed to return. Legal experts note that the president has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, a principle upheld by a 1967 Supreme Court ruling.

          <h2>Federal Reserve Defends Renovation Project Amid Attacks from Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is subtly pushing back against escalating criticism from the Trump administration by defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project. The central bank updated its website's FAQ page to counter claims from officials like OMB Director Russell Vought, who called the project an "ostentatious overhaul." The Fed clarified that the renovation preserves historic buildings, is funded by its own earnings rather than taxpayers, and that cost increases are due to unforeseen conditions. This defense comes as the administration intensifies its campaign against Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police across the United Kingdom have arrested 71 people at demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester were primarily for suspicion of showing support for a banned group, which is now a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The proscription followed a series of direct-action events by the group targeting arms companies involved with Israel. Critics, including the protest organizers, argue the government is misusing terror legislation and infringing on the right to protest.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek expressed her own surprise after winning her first Wimbledon title, a victory few had predicted on what was considered her weakest surface. The 24-year-old, known as the "Queen of Clay," secured her sixth Grand Slam with a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win, stating the achievement felt "surreal." The article attributes her success to improved movement on grass and a stronger mental game, having had more time to prepare after an earlier-than-usual exit from the French Open. This victory solidifies her status as one of tennis's elite players, having now won major titles on all three surfaces.</p>

The lightning-sparked blaze remains 0% contained, forcing the evacuation of the park's North Rim and the nearby community of Jacob Lake. Dangerous fire conditions are being fueled by high temperatures, strong winds, and dry vegetation, with an extreme heat warning in effect for the area. This fire, along with a second nearby blaze, has prompted officials to advise against hiking in the Grand Canyon.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the fatal Air India crash has led an aviation analyst to believe a chip malfunction may have been the cause, rather than pilot error. The report indicated the Boeing 787's engine fuel cutoff switches moved simultaneously, starving the engines of fuel. Analyst Marco Chan points to a prior service bulletin from the engine manufacturer regarding a flawed chip that could cause signal loss, leading to an unintended fuel cutoff. He argues that the design of the switches makes it highly unlikely for pilots to activate them accidentally.</p>

          <p>An Arizona resident has died from pneumonic plague, marking the first fatal case of the disease in Coconino County in over 15 years. Pneumonic plague is the most serious and rarest form of the disease, caused by the same bacterium responsible for the "Black Death." Health officials stated that the risk to the general public remains low and that the disease, while severe, is treatable with modern antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that an average of seven human plague cases are reported annually in the United States.</p>

          <p>A new report co-authored by the UK government's anti-Semitism adviser has concluded that anti-Jewish prejudice has been normalized across British society, including in professions, cultural life, and public services. The commission found pervasive anti-Semitism in the NHS, universities, and the arts, with Jewish people feeling merely "tolerated rather than respected." The report makes several recommendations, including officially recognizing Judaism as an ethnicity to better tackle racism and overhauling the policing of anti-Semitic hate crimes. The findings highlight a societal failure to protect the Jewish community.</p>
