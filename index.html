          <h2>US Weather Forecasting Capabilities Threatened by Budget Cuts and Staffing Shortages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 15:41:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US weather forecasting system, run by NOAA, is facing significant budget and staffing cuts that could degrade the accuracy of weather predictions. These cuts have already resulted in the loss of at least 2,000 workers and potential reductions in weather balloon launches and equipment maintenance. The National Weather Service, crucial for issuing timely emergency alerts, is also contending with understaffing, with 30 out of 122 forecast offices lacking a chief meteorologist. With extreme weather events becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, these cuts pose a serious risk to public safety and economic planning, impacting sectors like air travel, farming, and energy production. Optimism is tempered by the fact that there have been recent government cuts.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), was fired by President Trump after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency. Trumka argues that his dismissal is illegal and plans to challenge it in court, fearing that DOGE's involvement would undermine the CPSC's ability to ensure product safety. Consumer Reports has condemned the firings and called for the commissioners' reinstatement, emphasizing the importance of an independent product safety watchdog.

          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a court ruling that favored Epic in a contempt ruling.

          <p>Despite strong first-quarter results from tech giants like Meta and Alphabet, signs of strain are emerging in the digital advertising market due to President Trump's trade war. Meta and Alphabet reported slower ad sales in Asia, while Snap withdrew its second-quarter guidance due to economic uncertainty. Smaller firms like Reddit, Snap and Pinterest posted first-quarter sales that topped Wall Street projections. The shift in ad spending reflects concerns about the global economy and the impact of tariffs on businesses, particularly those reliant on international trade.</p>

          <p>With gold prices soaring, investors may find it challenging to enter the market, but there are still options to consider. One-gram gold bars offer a lower entry point, while gold ETFs allow investment in fractions of an ounce. Fractional gold coins provide physical ownership at a more accessible price. While considering these options, it's important to remember traditional gold investing advice of limiting it to 10% or less of your portfolio. These strategies enable investors to benefit from gold's traditional hedges against inflation and portfolio diversification without paying today's high prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the main commuter rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area, was forced to shut down all trains for several hours due to a computer networking problem. The outage, which affected all 50 stations, caused major disruptions for commuters, who sought alternative transportation options. BART has struggled to regain ridership since the Covid-19 pandemic, and this incident further complicates its efforts to attract passengers. Traffic was heavy on the Bay Bridge, and other transit systems, such as the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency and the San Francisco Bay Ferry, worked to accommodate the displaced BART riders.</p>
