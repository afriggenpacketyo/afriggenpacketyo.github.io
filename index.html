He noted the staffing shortages faced by the Capitol Police prior to the January 6th attack and the ongoing efforts to recruit and hire officers, and the budget request for 2026 is nearly $1 billion to bolster security and investigations.

The opening stand between Jones and Beaumont was England's fifth-highest partnership in women's ODI history. The win showcased England's improved approach to 50-over cricket under their new coach.</p>

Investors and union members are seeking clarity on the structure of the deal, which Trump described as a "partnership" that would keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a $14 billion investment by Nippon. The deal is structured as a "merger" in which it will become a "wholly owned subsidiary" of Nippon Steel North America but continue to operate as separate company, and it is expected to close its acquisition of U.S. Steel at $55 per share.</p>
