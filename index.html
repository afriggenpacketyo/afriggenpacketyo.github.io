            <h2>US Government Plans Military Deportation of Venezuelan Migrants</h2>

            <p>The ACLU reports that the US government is planning an imminent military deportation flight under the Alien Enemies Act, targeting Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas. Lawyers claim their clients are at "imminent risk" of being deported to El Salvador, arguing the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a "hybrid criminal state" invading the US. The ACLU submitted a document they say their clients received notifying them of their removal from the U.S. under the AEA. This move follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to resume such deportations but requiring due process, which the ACLU argues is not being provided in these cases.</p>

            <p>Britain's Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of 'sex' under the Equality Act of 2010 is binary, referring to biological sex as either male or female. The ruling clarifies that the terms 'man,' 'woman,' and 'sex' refer to biological sex within the context of anti-discrimination law, particularly concerning single-sex services. While emphasizing protections for transgender individuals, the court's decision acknowledges the importance of biological sex in specific contexts such as domestic violence shelters and forensic examinations. The ruling aims to balance the rights and protections of both biological females and transgender individuals.</p>

            <p>As Iran and the US prepare for a second round of nuclear talks in Rome, hopes for de-escalation are tempered by military threats and mixed messages. President Trump has reminded Tehran of its options: a deal or war. Iran insists it returned to the table not out of fear, but because the US limited its demands strictly to nuclear issues. The talks occur amid a flurry of diplomatic activity, including a visit by Saudi Arabia's Defence Minister to Tehran and Iran's Foreign Minister delivering a letter from Khamenei to Putin. The atmosphere is one of distrust, given Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is conditioning federal taxpayer grants to elite universities like Harvard and Columbia on compliance with civil rights laws, seeking to recalibrate the relationship between taxpayers and universities. The administration argues that universities, which have benefited from taxpayer largesse, are no longer contributing to the common good due to cultural Marxist indoctrination and suppression of diverse perspectives. The move is seen as a response to universities' alleged discrimination against applicants and students based on race, ethnicity, or religion.</p>

A memo states that providers must have private workspaces that foster confidential relationships with veterans.

The VA is also facing scrutiny for potential job cuts and their impact on veterans' care. This adjustment was made following reports and outcry from lawmakers.</p>

            <p>Layoffs at the FDA could compromise the safety of the food and drug supply, as cuts to support staff hinder inspectors' ability to travel and conduct factory inspections. Although inspectors themselves were spared, the loss of support staff could slow down or even cancel critical inspections of facilities producing baby formula, eye drops, and generic drugs. These inspections are vital for ensuring quality control, especially in countries with lax regulations. Some inspectors are canceling their trips because of the staff cuts.</p>
