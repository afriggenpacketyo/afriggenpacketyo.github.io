          <p>Australia has announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September at the United Nations General Assembly, aligning with recent moves by other Western countries. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated the decision is aimed at promoting a two-state solution to end the cycle of violence in the Middle East. This recognition is contingent upon receiving commitments from the Palestinian Authority that Hamas will not be involved in any future state. The move comes amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza and increasing international pressure on Israel.</p>

          <p>Federal agents were deployed across Washington D.C. following President Trump's social media declarations of a major crackdown on crime and homelessness. Trump vowed to immediately clear homeless encampments and warned of a more aggressive approach to law enforcement, despite official data indicating a 30-year low in violent crime for the city. The article notes the visible presence of federal officers was less dramatic than the president's rhetoric suggested. It also includes perspectives from homeless residents who expressed fear and uncertainty about their future.</p>

          <p>A recent article compiles a list of 19 widely-believed historical falsehoods, drawing from a popular online discussion. The debunked myths include the notion that Vikings wore horned helmets, that Napoleon Bonaparte was unusually short, and that George Washington had wooden dentures. Other corrected misconceptions involve the belief that people in the Middle Ages had very short lifespans and that Marie Antoinette actually said, "Let them eat cake." The piece highlights how these inaccuracies persist in popular culture despite historical evidence to the contrary.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to a deal with the US government to pay 15% of their revenue from specific semiconductor sales in China. This arrangement is part of a broader agreement to secure export licenses for advanced AI chips, such as Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted from the Chinese market due to national security concerns. Analysts describe the move as unprecedented, highlighting the significant financial and strategic challenges tech companies face amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. This development occurs as the two countries show signs of easing trade frictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two blind women traveling together on a Southwest Airlines flight from New Orleans to Orlando found themselves as the only passengers after a nearly five-hour delay. They allege the airline failed to communicate that most other passengers had been moved to an earlier flight departing from a different gate, effectively leaving them behind. The women are calling for improved communication protocols for passengers with disabilities, as mandated by the Air Carrier Access Act. Southwest Airlines disputed the claim that the customers were "forgotten" and offered each a $100 travel voucher for the delay.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its policy to deport more foreign criminals before their appeals can be heard by adding 15 new countries to the program. This "deport now, appeal later" scheme, which now includes nations like Canada, India, and Australia, aims to fast-track removals and prevent offenders from using the legal system to delay deportation. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the measure is intended to stop the manipulation of the immigration system.

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of road safety laws in England and Wales, which could see drivers over 70 banned if they fail compulsory eye tests. Under the proposed changes, elderly motorists would need to pass an eye test every three years to renew their license. The new strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalties for passengers who do not wear seatbelts. These measures follow a coroner's report calling for action to prevent deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of the "music" of black holes, describing the phenomenon of gravitational waves emitted as they form and stabilize. When a new black hole is created, for instance from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in spacetime quickly settles into a mathematically perfect shape defined only by its mass and spin. During this brief stabilization period, the black hole "rings out" with pure gravitational waves, a process likened to a form of cosmic music. This event provides a unique window into the fundamental properties of these enigmatic objects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (about US$501) annually for each child under the age of three. An analysis in the article suggests the policy's impact will vary significantly by region, potentially providing a greater economic boost to poorer, rural areas. In provinces like Gansu, the subsidy represents a substantial portion of the average resident's income, whereas in affluent cities like Shanghai, its effect is minimal. This disparity means the program is more likely to stimulate consumption and modestly influence birth rates in less affluent parts of the country. (not investment advice)</p>

Al Jazeera and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) contested this, stating that Israel has a pattern of killing journalists and subsequently accusing them of terrorism without providing sufficient evidence.

For Rose, the win marks his 12th PGA Tour title and a gratifying return to form after a recent dry spell.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures aimed at boosting employment for newly qualified nurses and midwives within England's National Health Service (NHS). The plan seeks to cut red tape and simplify regulations, allowing hospital trusts to hire graduates more easily to address a surplus of trained professionals. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the news as a positive step for graduates facing job uncertainty, they also raised concerns. Questions remain about how these new positions will be funded, as NHS trusts are already operating under significant financial pressure.</p>

          <p>The gunman who killed a police officer during an attack at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta had reportedly become fixated on a distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. Authorities identified the suspect, who also died during the incident, and noted he had previously blamed the vaccine for personal health issues. A union representing CDC employees stated the attack was not random and called on federal officials to condemn vaccine misinformation, which they argue fuels a climate of hostility and puts scientists at risk.</p>

          <p>In a preseason matchup, the Los Angeles Chargers defeated the New Orleans Saints 27-13, offering key insights into the team's depth. Quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance, using both his arm and legs to lead scoring drives, seemingly closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Another standout was undrafted rookie defensive back Eric Rogers, who made a compelling case for a roster spot by securing two interceptions, one of which he returned 55 yards for a touchdown. The game provided valuable evaluation time for the team's rookies and backups.</p>

          <p>A rapidly growing wildfire in western Colorado, now ranked as one of the largest in the state's history, has forced the evacuation of a prison. All 179 inmates at the Rifle Correctional Center were safely relocated as a precautionary measure as the Lee Fire spread to over 167 square miles across two counties. More than a thousand firefighters are currently battling the blaze, which is being fueled by gusty winds and dry conditions. Officials have issued air quality warnings due to heavy smoke, and some mountain communities remain under evacuation orders.</p>

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a surprising link between nose-picking and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The research found that damaging the internal nasal tissue can create a pathway for certain bacteria to travel up the olfactory nerve and into the brain. In the mice, this bacterial invasion triggered a response where the brain deposited amyloid-beta protein, a key feature associated with Alzheimer's. While the findings are preliminary and require human studies for confirmation, researchers suggest it highlights a potential environmental risk factor for the neurodegenerative condition.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders are forcefully condemning a Republican-led push for mid-decade redistricting in Texas, labeling the effort as "cheating" and a threat to democracy. The controversy has escalated as Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the new congressional maps, which could significantly favor the GOP in upcoming elections. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return. The heated political battle highlights the intense national fight over gerrymandering and its impact on control of Congress.</p>
