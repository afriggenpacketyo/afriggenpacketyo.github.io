          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has drawn sharp criticism from Poland and Baltic states after suggesting their opposition to an EU-Russia summit in 2021 hindered diplomatic efforts before the Ukraine invasion. Merkel, reflecting on her final months in office, stated that countries like Poland feared a lack of a common EU policy towards Russia, a claim that Latvian and Estonian officials have called "outrageous" and "wrong." Conversely, her comments were praised by the Kremlin, which asserted that the EU is "held hostage" by the policies of these states, highlighting ongoing divisions in European approaches to Russia.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Transport forecasts a record 2.4 billion journeys will be made during the eight-day "golden week" holiday period, marking a 6.2% increase from the previous year. This surge in travel is being accommodated by a significant increase in services, with the national railway operator adding over 1,880 additional trains to manage the high demand. Popular routes, such as those connecting Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Beijing, are experiencing rapid ticket sales, indicating a robust rebound in domestic tourism and travel activity across the country.</p>

          <p>Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch is set to announce a new economic "golden rule" aimed at cutting both government borrowing and taxes. The proposed policy would mandate that half of all savings from future government efficiencies be used to reduce the national deficit, with the other half funding economy-growing measures like tax cuts. This move is positioned as a return to fiscal responsibility, contrasting with the Labour government's policies, which Badenoch will criticize as a "borrowing and tax doom loop." The plan aims to rebuild the party's economic credibility following recent electoral defeats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's cricket team is facing uncertainty over the fitness of its captain, Pat Cummins, ahead of the upcoming Ashes series against England. Recent media reports suggested Cummins could miss the entire series due to a back stress injury that has not fully healed, though the team has not made an official decision. Cummins, who has a history of back problems, is currently in rehabilitation, and his potential absence would be a significant blow to Australia's bowling attack. If he is unable to play, Scott Boland would likely replace him, with Steve Smith taking over captaincy duties.</p>

          <p>All 580 hikers and over 300 support personnel who were stranded on Mount Everest by severe snowstorms have been successfully rescued, according to Chinese state media. The groups were trapped at high altitudes after heavy snowfall during China's "Golden Week" holiday crushed tents and made trails impassable. Rescue operations brought the climbers and their guides to a secure location on the Tibetan Plateau for their return journeys.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has declared that Europe is facing a coherent and escalating campaign of hybrid warfare, citing recent drone incidents and airspace violations.

While not exclusively blaming Russia, von der Leyen emphasized that Moscow's aim is to sow division. She urged a new mindset that goes beyond traditional defense, calling for unity, deterrence, and resolve to counter these threats.</p>

Experts suggest the symbol resonates with Gen Z activists because the series' protagonists stand for freedom, individual choice, and challenging corrupt authority.

          <p>France is facing renewed political instability following the resignation of its fifth prime minister in under two years, raising alarms in Brussels about the country's fiscal health. The ongoing political deadlock complicates efforts to address France's significant budget deficit and debt pile, which both substantially exceed EU limits. The country has been placed under the EU's "excessive deficit procedure" and must present a plan for consolidation. Economists warn that without a stable government, meaningful fiscal reforms are unlikely, potentially leading to further credit rating downgrades and continued budget slippage.

Despite months of requests, government witness statements did not meet this threshold.

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is causing a rise in flight cancellations and delays nationwide as air traffic controller shortages impact airport towers and control facilities. Controllers, who are deemed essential and are working without pay, have seen an increase in sick calls, leading to critically low staffing levels. Airports in Nashville, Dallas, Chicago, and Burbank have experienced significant delays, with some towers forced to temporarily close. The Transportation Secretary acknowledged the financial strain on controllers, expressing concern that they might be taking second jobs like driving for Uber to make ends meet.</p>

          <p>The government of Chad has ended its 15-year partnership with African Parks, a conservation organization that has the Duke of Sussex on its board. Chad's environment ministry accused the charity of failing to curb poaching, displaying an arrogant attitude, and not cooperating fully with authorities while managing two of the country's protected wildlife reserves. This decision is another blow to the organization, which recently admitted to abuses by its employees in a park it manages in the Republic of Congo. African Parks stated it is in talks with the ministry to understand the decision.</p>

          <p>A multi-story building undergoing renovation in Madrid, Spain, has partially collapsed, resulting in the deaths of four construction workers. Emergency services recovered the bodies of the victims, identified as workers from Mali, Guinea, and Ecuador, from the rubble. At least three other people were injured in the incident, which occurred while the building was being converted into a four-star hotel. Witnesses reported hearing a loud bang that sounded "like a bomb" before the structure gave way. Madrid's Judicial Police are now investigating the cause of the fatal workplace accident.</p>

          <h2>New Kidney Transplant Method Using Blood Type Conversion Shows Promise</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully demonstrated a new technique that could significantly expand the pool of available organs for kidney transplants by converting their blood type. The method uses enzymes to change the blood type of a donor kidney, which was then transplanted into a recipient and functioned for two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. Published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, this breakthrough offers hope for reducing long organ waiting lists and addressing inequities in organ allocation. The team noted that this approach could make more efficient use of the human organ pool while other solutions remain years away.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 members of the Texas National Guard have begun arriving in Illinois as part of a federal deployment to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. The move has been met with strong opposition from state and local leaders, who have called it a "political theater" and an "aggressive overreach" by the Trump administration. The City of Chicago and the State of Illinois have filed a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment, with a court hearing scheduled for Thursday. This novel situation marks a rare instance of one state's National Guard being federalized and sent to another.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has intensified into a Category 2 storm in the Pacific Ocean off the western coast of Mexico.

A tropical storm watch is in effect for the region, and forecasters warn of potential flash flooding and dangerous, life-threatening surf conditions. Moisture from Priscilla may also lead to a risk of heavy rainfall and flash floods in the U.S. Desert Southwest later in the week.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has clarified his decision-making regarding the use of relief pitcher Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the NLDS. Roberts initially used Blake Treinen in a save situation to give Sasaki, who recently returned from injury, an extra day of rest. The plan nearly backfired as Treinen allowed two runs, forcing Sasaki to enter the game to secure the final out anyway. Moving forward, Roberts confirmed Sasaki is the primary closing option but emphasized the team must carefully manage the workload of the young pitcher, who has never before pitched in a relief role.</p>

          <p>Residents of a Portland apartment complex located opposite a federal ICE facility describe living in a "war zone" due to nightly clashes between protesters and federal agents. The unrest has put the city in the national spotlight, with President Trump threatening to deploy the National Guard, a move temporarily halted by a federal judge. Those living in the area report constant exposure to tear gas inside their homes and confrontations with protesters. While many Portlanders view Trump's rhetoric as hyperbole, for residents at the epicenter of the conflict, the violence and disruption are a daily reality.</p>

In Virginia, the ad targets Winsome Earle-Sears, while the New Jersey ad takes aim at Jack Ciattarelli.
