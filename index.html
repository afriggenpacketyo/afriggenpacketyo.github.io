            <p>Yi Shouliang, a senior scientist formerly with the U.S. Department of Energy and an adjunct professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has returned to China to take a position at Sichuan University. This decision follows escalating Sino-US tensions and involves Yi dissolving his commercial ventures in the US. During his time at NETL, Yi's research focused on developing novel membranes and adsorption materials for the Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) programme and water management initiatives. The circumstances surrounding his departure remain undisclosed, raising questions amid ongoing geopolitical dynamics.</p>

            <p>Prosecutors and defense attorneys presented closing arguments in the bribery trial of Nadine Menendez, accused of helping broker deals that leveraged her husband's, former Sen. Bob Menendez's, influence in exchange for personal enrichment. Prosecutors portrayed Nadine as a "partner in crime," alleging she facilitated schemes involving a Halal certifier, a state-level criminal case, and aid to the Egyptian government, receiving cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in return. The defense argued that the government's definitions of "official acts" and "quid pro quo" were overly broad and questioned the credibility of a key witness. The jury will begin deliberations following instructions from the judge.</p>

            <p>A report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China's 'Made in China 2025' plan, aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in technology, missed several key targets while intensifying global trade tensions. While China exceeded expectations in domestic auto production, it lagged in aerospace, high-end robotics, and manufacturing value-added growth. The plan, intended as a multi-decade strategy, has led to overcapacity and security concerns, with the electric car race sparking price wars and losses for many automakers. The U.S. has responded with export restrictions and incentives for domestic manufacturing, prompting China to focus on home-grown development efforts.</p>

            <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vowed to veto all bills amid a standoff with the Republican-controlled Legislature over funding for the state's Division of Developmental Disabilities. Hobbs demands a bipartisan compromise guaranteeing funding for the agency, which supports nearly 60,000 people with disabilities. Republicans seek to establish guardrails for the program before approving funding, while Democrats prioritize funding first and reforms later. The governor claims Republicans are using the crisis for political leverage, willing to veto even supported legislation until a compromise is reached.</p>

            <p>New research suggests that the treasure ship fleets of explorer Zheng He during China's Ming dynasty may have played a role in spreading brown rats around the world. Ancient silk paintings dating to this era provide clues about the domestication of these rodents. The artwork, depicting domesticated brown rats with coat color variation, could be the earliest evidence of such domestication, predating known records in Japan by over two centuries. The researchers suggest that domesticated brown rats may have stowed away on Zheng He's ships, leading to their global distribution.</p>

            <p>Students and parents described the fear and confusion that spread during the Florida State University campus shooting. Students sheltering in place shared their experiences of barricading doors and fleeing to safety, while parents anxiously waited for updates. The confusion was compounded by misinformation circulating on social media. For one family, the event brought back painful memories of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, as their son had been present at both incidents.</p>

            <p>The U.S. government is implementing port fees on Chinese ships to revive domestic shipbuilding and challenge China's dominance. The fees will be based on cargo weight, container count, or vehicle numbers, starting in 180 days and increasing over three years. Exemptions exist for empty vessels carrying bulk exports and ships moving goods between American ports and Caribbean islands. Experts warn the measures could further disrupt global trade amid existing tariff policies, potentially raising prices for U.S. consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK, dubbed a "Trump-fest," could be beneficial for the strained special relationship between the two countries. The visit, scheduled for September, is seen as a chance to strengthen diplomatic ties despite Trump's controversial policies. The British government hopes that its "state visit trump card" and Trump's fondness for the Royal Family will provide vital diplomatic leverage. The visit comes at a time when Trump's positions on various issues are increasingly at odds with America's allies.</p>

            <p>Ukraine has announced the signing of an outline for a minerals deal with the US, paving the way for an "economic partnership agreement" and an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction. The move aims to grant the US access to Ukraine's critical minerals, as well as oil and gas resources. The deal was nearly derailed by a heated clash between President Zelensky and President Trump, but negotiations have since resumed. The final agreement is expected to be completed soon, with the investment fund managed jointly by Kyiv and Washington.</p>

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele posted images of the meeting but implied Abrego Garcia would remain in custody. Van Hollen had been denied entry into a high-security prison earlier in the day while trying to check on Garcia's well-being. The meeting highlights the ongoing legal and political controversy surrounding Garcia's deportation, which the Trump administration has called an "administrative error."</p>
