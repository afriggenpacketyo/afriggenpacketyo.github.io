          <p>SK Hynix reported a substantial increase in quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose by 42%, and operating profit surged by 158% year-on-year, however, the company cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties and U.S. tariff policies potentially impacting demand in the second half of the year. Despite these concerns, SK Hynix anticipates continued spending by Big Tech on AI and expansion of the AI ecosystem, fueled by open-source models and sovereign AI projects, will continue to drive memory demand. The company highlighted DeepSeek's open-source R1 reasoning model as an example of a catalyst for AI development.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive actions aimed at higher education and K-12 schools, focusing on college accreditation and school discipline. One action targets college accreditors, accusing them of imposing discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-based standards, while another aims to ensure school discipline policies are based on objective behavior rather than DEI. The executive actions also warn that federal grants for universities could be revoked if they fail to fully disclose foreign funding, alleging that some institutions have routinely violated existing laws. The measures seek to roll back Biden administration policies, bolster workforce training, and improve AI education in schools.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control over Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations. Trump asserted that a deal to end the war was "very close" but Zelenskyy's stance prolongs the conflict, while Vice-President Vance outlined a US vision for a deal involving territorial concessions from both sides. Ukraine has consistently rejected giving up Crimea, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, and Trump stated he wants the war to end without favoring either side. Meanwhile, talks between officials from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the US aimed at securing a ceasefire were downgraded after the US pulled out key envoys.</p>

          <p>Trading Standards officers in England have seized over six million illegal vaping products in the past three years as they prepare for a ban on single-use disposable vapes. These illicit vapes often have tank sizes exceeding the legal limit, higher nicotine strengths, or lack proper labeling, posing health risks to consumers. The crackdown reveals sophisticated networks involved in the illegal trade, which also includes modern day slavery, trafficking, and drug supply. From June 1, it will be illegal for businesses in the UK to sell, supply, or possess single-use vapes for sale, with penalties ranging from on-the-spot fines to imprisonment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has been steadily declining during his first three months in office, according to a New York Times polling average. His approval rating has fallen to approximately 45%, down from 52% shortly after he assumed office, with about half of the country now disapproving of his performance. While it is typical for American presidents to experience a decrease in support over time, Trump's approval has been dropping slightly faster than that of his predecessors. He began his term with the second-lowest approval rating for a president in modern history, only surpassed by his own initial term.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the Justice Department is cutting millions in wasteful grants, including $2 million for "national listening sessions" and $695,000 for a study on police LGBTQ liaison services. Additionally, $250,000 allocated for a grant to provide gender-affirming care, including housing in gender-appropriate facilities, for incarcerated transgender individuals will be eliminated. These cuts are part of a broader effort by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to reduce wasteful spending and downsize the federal government. DOGE also worked with the U.S. National Science Foundation to cancel 402 diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) grants, saving $233 million.</p>

          <p>President Trump will travel to Michigan next week to celebrate his first 100 days in office with a rally in Macomb County, a key automotive hub north of Detroit. This marks his first rally since returning to the White House and his first official trip outside personal weekend excursions, aside from visiting disaster zones in North Carolina and California. The visit follows meetings with Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, with whom Trump hopes to find common ground, particularly regarding Selfridge Air National Guard Base.

          <p>A feature article highlights the treatment of visa overstayers in Japan, who are often treated like common criminals, with over 90% of deportations in 2024 being due to overstaying. Gunma Prefecture has a high ratio of foreign crime offenses, with about half the arrests being undocumented individuals, primarily seeking employment. While cracking down on overstays aligns with the law, some question whether it's appropriate to treat those who overstay due to unavoidable circumstances as criminals. There's a growing international movement to use more neutral terms like "irregular" or "undocumented" immigrants to protect the human rights of foreign workers, but Japan has seen little progress in revising its language.</p>

The order directs the Department of Education to recognize new accreditors and hold existing ones accountable for failing to meet federal criteria. Trump also signed an order requiring universities to fully disclose foreign gifts, warning that federal grants could be revoked for non-compliance, and specifically called out Harvard University for alleged violations. The executive orders come amid escalating tensions between the administration and Harvard, which has rejected demands to change policies and leadership.</p>

          <p>A fossil discovery in northeastern China has revealed a complex prehistoric food chain, featuring a dinosaur species that consumed a mammal, which itself may have preyed on dinosaurs. The fossilized remains of Huadanosaurus sinensis, a newly identified theropod dinosaur, were found with two small mammals inside its stomach cavity. One of the mammals was a gobiconodontid, a group known to feast on small dinosaurs. This discovery highlights a predator-prey dynamic between dinosaurs and mammals 125 million years ago, creating an ecological loop where dinosaurs preyed on mammal predators.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, warns that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients. The report cites medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention, and rude behavior as common problems associated with fatigued staff, and highlights examples of mistakes made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs. Factors contributing to staff fatigue include shift work, long hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities, and financial pressures. The watchdog urges the government and NHS England to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions to raise awareness.</p>

          <p>Water companies in the UK have acknowledged that their current system of self-monitoring sewage pollution is damaging public trust and propose a new, third-party monitoring system. This recommendation is part of a submission to the UK government's independent review of the water sector. The industry body, Water UK, stated that they never requested self-monitoring, which was introduced in 2009 to reduce the administrative burden on the Environment Agency (EA). The National Audit Office (NAO) has questioned the ability of the EA to take on any new monitoring due to limited oversight and capacity.</p>
