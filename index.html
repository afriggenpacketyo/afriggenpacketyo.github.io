        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A French court found Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally party, guilty of embezzling European Union funds.  The conviction carries a four-year prison sentence (partially suspended and served with an electronic tag), a significant fine, and a five-year ban from holding public office, effectively ending her presidential ambitions for 2027.  The judge cited the risk of re-offending and potential public disorder as reasons for the immediate ban.  The ruling is likely to significantly impact French politics, given Le Pen's recent poll numbers. A slight bias towards portraying Le Pen negatively might be present in the article's tone.</p>
