          <p>A two-year-old boy was rescued from a luggage screening area at Newark Liberty International Airport after being swept away by a passenger luggage drop-off conveyor belt while his mother was speaking with a JetBlue agent. Port Authority Police Department officers entered the conveyor system and located the child before he reached an x-ray machine. The toddler's grandfather expressed gratitude to the officers, confirming the boy and his mother were unharmed. The airport had recently reopened a runway ahead of schedule, improving operations after previous delays and air traffic control issues. Optimism remains high that airport operations will continue smoothly in the future.</p>

          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for a new attack on Russia's Kerch Strait Bridge, which links occupied Crimea to Russia, stating that the underwater supports of the piers were severely damaged. This attack follows drone strikes on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Simultaneously, Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian cities resulted in casualties and injuries, with President Zelenskyy condemning the strikes as deliberate attacks on civilians. Despite ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks, Zelenskyy asserts that Putin has no genuine interest in peace, demanding global pressure to achieve a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has sparked anger as it is classified as an England and Wales project, despite no tracks being laid in Wales. This classification means Wales will not benefit from extra cash through the Barnett Formula, leading to accusations that Wales is being denied funding for its own rail network. Politicians and rail unions are calling for a rethink, arguing that the current system disadvantages Wales and undermines trust. The UK government maintains that its rail network enhancements pipeline is funding projects in Wales, but critics argue this is insufficient.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after her disappearance from Praia da Luz in 2007. The search is focused on 21 different plots of land between the resort where Madeleine went missing and where the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, was staying at the time. BrÃ¼ckner, a German national, is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate sexual assault case and is suspected of Madeleine's murder, though he denies any involvement. The search, expected to continue until Friday, aims to uncover any new evidence related to the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While transitioning away from fossil fuels is crucial, addressing food production is equally vital for meeting climate goals. Agriculture's expansive footprint drives deforestation, water shortages, and biodiversity loss, necessitating a shift towards producing more food with less land. This requires dietary changes, such as reducing beef consumption, and innovative agricultural practices, including genetic manipulation and bio-fertilizers. Despite progress, food and climate solutions lag behind energy solutions, demanding increased investment and a reevaluation of agricultural approaches to sustainably feed the growing population.</p>

          <p>Millennials are entering midlife facing different challenges than previous generations, including economic instability and a hyper-awareness of mental health. Unlike the traditional midlife crisis stereotype involving sports cars and abandoning family, millennials are more focused on finding opportunities for personal growth, such as new careers or fitness journeys. Many feel a sense of wistfulness and a longing for stability, but they are also more equipped to handle these challenges in healthy ways. External factors like the economy and societal expectations contribute to this unique experience, leading millennials to redefine what it means to navigate midlife.</p>

The court dismissed these arguments, stating that the party did not sufficiently substantiate the possibility of a violation of its rights.

          <h2>Trump Administration Employs Colorado Attack to Promote Deportation Agenda</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is using the immigration status of the suspect in the Colorado attack on an Israeli hostage rally to push its deportation agenda. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who overstayed his tourist visa, allegedly targeted Zionists in the attack, prompting calls from right-wing figures for increased deportations. This response contrasts with reactions to attacks against Palestinians and Muslims in the U.S., and the administration has previously used support for Palestinians to justify deportations. The incident underscores the intersection of anti-Israel sentiment and immigration policy in the current political climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As privatization accelerates, power, governance, law, security, rights, and wealth are increasingly decentralized and held in private hands, resembling feudalism. Examples include the rise of private cryptocurrencies undermining control of the money supply, private military companies replacing standing armies, and private security guards outnumbering police officers. This trend erodes transparency, disregards individual rights, and concentrates power among a small group of wealthy barons, relegating the population to a modern form of serfdom. The consequences often reveal themselves slowly and come down to fine print, leading to diffuse, unstable, and unpredictable governance.</p>

          <p>Geert Wilders, the far-right leader in the Netherlands, has withdrawn his party from the government, causing the governing coalition to collapse after less than a year. The move was triggered by a dispute over immigration policies, with Wilders seeking stricter asylum measures. His former coalition partners accused him of engineering the crisis, leading to shock and anger among political leaders. The collapse will likely lead to snap elections, with Wilders expected to campaign on the issue of asylum.</p>

Sancho moved to Stamford Bridge on loan last summer after his relationship with former United manager Erik ten Hag broke down.

Chelsea had agreed an obligation to buy Sancho for a fee of about 25m if they finished higher than 14th in the Premier League, which they did - or pay to get out of the deal.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has lowered its global economic growth outlook for 2025 due to tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The OECD projects worldwide growth to slow to 2.9%, down from a previous forecast of 3.1%, citing a significant rise in trade barriers. The group also slashed the outlook for the US economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and warned that the US was at risk from rising inflation. The OECD trimmed its expectations for UK growth this year to 1.3% from 1.4% as well, citing elevated uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

While manufacturing is a tradable sector with local multipliers, economists disagree on its potential for widespread prosperity. Proponents argue that manufacturing is a more likely option for struggling communities than attracting tech or finance, while skeptics point to automation and the sector's limited size. Trade policies, such as tariffs, have also been questioned for their effectiveness in revitalizing manufacturing and reducing regional inequality.</p>
