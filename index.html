          <h2>Governors Walz and Moore Advocate for a More Assertive Democratic Party</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Wes Moore of Maryland called for a more forceful Democratic party at Jim Clyburn's annual Fish Fry in South Carolina. Both governors emphasized the importance of building coalitions and engaging with diverse constituencies to win back lost American voters. Walz urged Democrats to compete in every district and for every school board seat, while Moore stressed the need to deliver a tangible alternative to Trump's policies. Neither governor indicated any intention to run for president in 2028, focusing instead on the immediate political battles of 2025. Clyburn praised both Walz and Moore as great leaders but deferred to their individual plans regarding future political ambitions. The event served as a platform for potential Democratic rising stars to connect with influential party members and donors. Optimism surrounds the party's potential for future success with strong leadership. </p>

          <p>A sperm donor in Europe, used to conceive at least 67 pregnancies, carried a rare cancer-causing mutation, TP53, resulting in Li-Fraumeni syndrome in 10 children. The European Sperm Bank confirmed the variant was present but was not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008. The variant was undetectable through standard screening, and the donor is currently healthy. Dr. Edwige Kasper presented the case at the European Society of Human Genetics' annual conference, advocating for a European limit on births per donor. The European Sperm Bank emphasized that donor-assisted reproduction remains a safer alternative than natural conception, but welcomes dialogue on an internationally binding family limit. </p>

          <p>Memory cafes are providing camaraderie and support for people with dementia and their caregivers, offering a social outlet and respite from the challenges of the condition. These cafes, which number over 600 in the U.S., provide a relaxed environment for socializing, activities, and mutual support. The gatherings help combat social isolation, which is common after a dementia diagnosis, and ease the stress on caregivers. As federal health funding faces potential cuts, memory cafe organizers believe their services will become even more vital. The cafes are relatively inexpensive to run and offer a valuable resource for a growing population affected by memory loss. </p>

          <p>Meta plans to automate up to 90% of privacy and integrity reviews for new features on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, replacing human evaluators with AI. This shift aims to accelerate product development but raises concerns about potential risks to user privacy and safety. Former Meta employees fear that AI may not adequately address complex issues related to privacy, youth risk, and the spread of harmful content. While Meta claims human expertise will still be used for complex cases, critics worry that engineers may not prioritize privacy and safety. The changes reflect a broader trend at Meta toward faster product updates and less content moderation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts are raising concerns about the validity of President Trump's agreements with law firms, suggesting they resemble deals made 'with a gun to the head.' The White House claims these firms committed to $1 billion in pro bono services to avoid investigations and maintain federal access. However, critics argue that the agreements lack a genuine 'meeting of the minds' and may be considered coercion, especially after executive orders were deemed unconstitutional by multiple judges. Some firms that challenged Trump's actions in court have found success and attracted new clients, while others that settled face potential legal and ethical liabilities. The situation has sparked debate about the legal profession's integrity and the rule of law. </p>

          <p>An NPR producer and a group of friends have been recreating the reality TV show 'Survivor' every year since 2022. What started as a pandemic binge-watching hobby has evolved into a highly anticipated annual event, complete with challenges, tribal councils, and strategic gameplay. The friends spend months planning the challenges and twists, mirroring the show's format of 'Outwit, Outplay, Outlast'. This year's event in Collegeville, PA, involved a gauntlet of challenges, including a Crisco Watermelon wrestling match. The weekend is described as anxiety-inducing but also the highlight of the year, fostering camaraderie and shared experiences among friends. The tradition culminates in the passing of the torch to the next pair of 'Jeffs' who will plan the following year's game. </p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence by 2034, with the government's strategic defence review outlining priorities for future military and security spending. The review, based on the assumption of reaching the 3% target, warns of emerging threats from drones and artificial intelligence. It recommends deploying digital experts alongside troops to counter enemy drones and manage future unmanned weapons. The review identifies Russia as an immediate threat and China as a sophisticated challenge, while also addressing Iran and North Korea as regional disruptors. The government plans to invest over Â£1.5 billion in improving military housing as part of this commitment. </p>

The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. The project, initially conceived in 1990, involved constructing nearly 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions. Despite criticisms about the project's cost and duration, Welsh ministers assert that the upgrade will significantly benefit communities across the region. The completion marks the end of frequent tailbacks and serious crashes, providing a direct route between Swansea and Monmouthshire. </p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit two solo home runs as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied to defeat the New York Yankees 8-5 in their series opener. Ohtani's first home run answered Aaron Judge's opening homer, while his second sparked a four-run sixth inning, turning a 5-2 deficit into a 6-5 lead. This was Ohtani's second two-homer game of the season, bringing his May total to 15 home runs and his season total to a major league-leading 22. Andy Pages added two insurance runs in the seventh inning, securing the win for the Dodgers. Ohtani credited his rhythm with his new lifestyle, including the recent birth of his daughter. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government's release of cheaper stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has begun, drawing consumers to stores. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice at 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out within 30 minutes of opening. This initiative aims to alleviate the impact of soaring rice prices on households. The government is selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022, hoping direct sales will more effectively curb prices. </p>

Ukraine has sent its proposals to Russia, reaffirming its 'readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire.' The first round of talks in Istanbul two weeks prior yielded no breakthrough, aside from a prisoner of war swap.

          <p>German-Greek relations are facing a crisis due to differing refugee policies, as Germany seeks to send asylum seekers back to Greece, a move opposed by Athens. Greece desires more EU support for border protection and a migration agreement with Libya. While both countries aim to curb irregular immigration, their geographical positions lead to conflicting interests. Germany's intention to deport migrants already registered in Greece is causing friction, especially after a German court ruled that migrants do not face extreme hardships in Greece. Greece is reluctant to accept a large influx of returnees, seeking instead to manage immigration flows through agreements with countries like Libya. </p>

The administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose blanket tariffs has been questioned, leading to legal battles.

Despite these challenges, the administration remains determined to pursue its economic agenda, though the legal and economic obstacles continue to mount.
