          <p>Supported housing, crucial for vulnerable individuals living independently, faces a crisis with service closures and a shortfall of 325,000 places. An open letter to Prime Minister Starmer, signed by over 170 organizations, cites council funding cuts and rising costs as primary causes. The National Housing Federation warns that more providers may close without increased government funding. The letter requests long-term funding of at least £1.6bn per year and inclusion of supported homes in government housing plans. The government acknowledges the vital role of supported housing and is putting £2bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27.</p>

This potential move would disregard the official "Crimea Declaration" issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, which pledged non-recognition until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored.</p>

          <p>Despite deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv and resistance from both sides, President Trump maintains that Ukraine peace talks are making "a lot of progress." He issued a rare public rebuke of Putin but indicated no immediate penalties. The Trump administration is pushing for a settlement that would recognize Russian control over seized Ukrainian land, a proposal that has been met with resistance from Ukrainian leaders. The administration is seeking a negotiated settlement before the 100th day of Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Humanities is supporting President Trump's National Garden of American Heroes with a grant program to commission statues. The garden will feature life-size renderings of 250 individuals who contributed to American culture, science, and politics. Artists, who must be American citizens, can submit preliminary concepts for statues made of marble, granite, bronze, copper, or brass. The statues must depict figures from a list that includes traditional heroes and figures like Walt Whitman, Kobe Bryant, and Julia Child.</p>
