          <h2>GOP Faces Internal Division Over Releasing Jeffrey Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 20:39:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant political rift is emerging within the Republican party over the release of federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Representative Thomas Massie is forcefully advocating for a House vote to declassify the documents, warning that blocking the vote could become a political liability for the GOP in the upcoming midterm elections. In contrast, House Speaker Mike Johnson has criticized the push as "reckless," citing concerns about protecting innocent victims, an argument Massie dismisses as a diversion. This internal conflict highlights a divide between party leadership and a faction demanding greater transparency on the controversial matter.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major new contract to supply semiconductors valued at approximately $16.5 billion, causing its shares to rise over 2% in early trading. The South Korean technology giant did not disclose the name of the other party involved in the substantial deal. This positive development comes as the company prepares to release its second-quarter earnings, where it anticipates a significant profit decline. The new contract provides a welcome boost amid struggles to compete with rivals in the booming artificial intelligence chip market.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Police Department station in Pacoima was temporarily evacuated after a couple brought in military-grade explosive devices they had found while cleaning a deceased relative's home. The department's bomb squad was called to the scene and used a robot to assess the ordnances before deeming them safe to transport. The explosives were then moved to a secure facility for collection by the U.S. military. This incident occurred less than two weeks after an explosion killed three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives, adding to regional tensions surrounding dangerous materials.</p>

          <p>My Chemical Romance performed their iconic 2006 album "The Black Parade" in its entirety to a sold-out crowd at Dodger Stadium, marking a new career peak for the influential emo band. The concert review highlights the group's enduring appeal, attributing it to their theatricality, frank lyrical themes, and influence on a new generation of artists. The performance featured elaborate staging, including a satirical narrative about a fictional dictator, but the core of the show's success was the power of the songs themselves. The band also played a selection of other hits, reaffirming their powerful connection with their dedicated fanbase.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France, cementing his status among the sport's legends. Despite treacherous, rainy conditions and having already effectively secured the overall victory, Pogačar launched a characteristic attack in the final stage in Paris. Although he did not win the stage itself, which went to Belgian rider Wout van Aert, his aggressive style was a testament to his competitive spirit. The 26-year-old finished the grueling three-week race significantly ahead of his main rival, two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard, who placed second overall.</p>

          <p>Several Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a significant increase in demand for their "citizenship by investment" (CBI) programs, largely driven by wealthy Americans. For an investment starting around $200,000 in real estate, individuals can obtain a passport offering visa-free travel to numerous countries, including the UK and Europe's Schengen area. Political instability, gun violence, and tax benefits are cited as key motivators for US citizens seeking a second passport as an "insurance policy."

As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in US energy products and investing $600 billion in the US over three years. While European leaders expressed relief at achieving stability, the deal creates a new tariff reality that is higher than pre-Trump levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for stricter regulation of dog rescue organizations amid growing concerns over pets imported into the UK. The charity warns that many dogs, often from Eastern Europe, are being sold online with minimal vetting, leading to serious issues for new owners, including aggressive behavior and infectious diseases. A particular concern is the rise in Brucella canis, a disease transmissible to humans, which has seen a dramatic increase in cases.

          <p>England has won Euro 2025, becoming the first nation since Germany in 2013 to retain the women's European title. Their path to victory was dramatic, with all three knockout matches going to extra time and two being decided by penalty shootouts. Captain Leah Williamson stated that while the team "rode their luck," they were deserving champions, not lucky ones, highlighting their fighting spirit. Manager Sarina Wiegman's side demonstrated remarkable resilience, often coming from behind and utilizing impactful substitutes to secure victory against world champions Spain in the final.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the surprising drop in Honeywell's stock price following an earnings report that beat expectations and raised guidance. The author explores several potential reasons for the sell-off, including the complexities of the company's planned three-way split, a perceived lack of data center exposure, and general market impatience. Despite the negative market reaction, the author expresses strong conviction in the company's long-term value, citing its strong position in aerospace and industrial automation. The plan is to view the price drop as a buying opportunity rather than a sign of fundamental weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man has been charged with terrorism and assault with intent to murder following a mass stabbing at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, that injured 11 people. The victims, ranging in age from 21 to 84, all survived the attack. Investigators stated the stabbings appeared to be random and a motive is still undetermined, but the terrorism charge was applied because the mass nature of the violence was intended to instill fear in the broader community. The suspect was confronted by armed citizens in the parking lot, who prevented him from fleeing before police arrived.</p>

Ang reflects on how this foundational effort created generations of China experts who were crucial for navigating the complex relationship. The article suggests that a current drop in Americans studying in China and a shift in focus are contributing to a knowledge gap at a critical time.</p>

          <p>The latest adaptation of Marvel's first family, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," has debuted with a strong opening weekend, earning an estimated $118 million at the North American box office. This figure marks the fourth-largest domestic opening of the year and the biggest for a Marvel film since last summer's "Deadpool & Wolverine." The film, which is set in a retro-futuristic 1960s, also grossed $100 million internationally for a worldwide total of $218 million. The success, alongside that of "Superman," is seen by analysts as evidence that superhero fatigue is not a factor for well-made films.</p>

The leaders will also discuss the situation in Gaza, where the UK is walking a diplomatic line between its European allies, who are taking a more critical stance on Israel, and the US.

          <p>The newly announced trade deal between the US and the European Union is being analyzed as a strategic victory for both sides, providing stability and averting a costly trade war. The agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on EU goods, is seen as a way for President Trump to demonstrate his deal-making prowess and for the EU to avoid a threatened 30% rate. This breakthrough is particularly timely as it strengthens the US position ahead of critical trade negotiations with China. The deal rebalances the trade relationship and includes significant EU investment commitments in the US. (not investment advice)</p>
