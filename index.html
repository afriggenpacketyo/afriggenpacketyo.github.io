          <p>Canada Goose shares experienced a significant increase after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' predictions, although the company has withdrawn its fiscal 2026 guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainties. The luxury retailer is refraining from providing a financial outlook for fiscal 2026, citing dynamic consumer spending patterns influenced by the unpredictable global trade environment. Despite the uncertainty, Canada Goose remains confident in its brand strength, solid financial position, and adaptability to changing conditions. The article notes that the majority of Canada Goose's production is compliant with trade agreements, minimizing the impact of potential tariffs.</p>

          <p>According to The New York Times, tax cuts pushed by President Trump are amplifying debt and deficit concerns among bond investors, influencing interest rates on various debts. Investors were already uneasy about Trump's tariff policies, and the proposed tax cuts without spending reductions have intensified bond market volatility. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, warned that Treasury market volatility could increase economic uncertainty. Concerns are rising that the tax bill will increase the federal deficit, leading to more borrowing and potentially higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a dark past marked by kidnappings, airstrikes, and violence during Syria's war, the joyous scenes of Kurdish people dancing and celebrating offer a sense of resilience. Many Kurds, who had fled or celebrated Nowruz in secret under repressive rule, are now returning home and openly celebrating their culture.</p>
