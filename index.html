          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 15:48:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven primarily by large power companies rather than rooftop installations. This growth is attributed to streamlined state regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and favorable economics, making solar a cheaper alternative to natural gas. Despite this progress, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to decrease residential solar installations. The state's ability to maintain this momentum will depend on grid upgrades and navigating a shifting political landscape without consistent policy support.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone has defended his team following sharp criticism from former players Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. The legends questioned the team's accountability and pointed to repeated mental errors during recent games. Boone acknowledged the fairness of the criticism when the team underperforms but insisted that accountability measures are handled internally, away from public view. He maintained confidence in his players and stated it is the team's responsibility to change the negative narrative through better performance on the field.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to impose prison sentences of up to five years for people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal crossings into the UK. The move aims to combat the online promotion of dangerous journeys across the English Channel, which a record 25,000 people have undertaken this year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the government is determined to stop criminals who exploit migrants for profit. The Labour government is also planning an overhaul of the asylum appeals process to manage the increasing number of arrivals.</p>

          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the state and New York on Saturday night.

          <p>Brooklyn Nets player Michael Porter Jr. was filmed in New York City attempting to give cash to a homeless man he saw eating discarded food from a trash can. In the video, the man angrily shoos Porter away. After Porter discreetly left the money near the man's belongings, the man found the cash and threw it away, rejecting the gesture a second time. The encounter, which left Porter taken aback, sparked discussions on social media about the complexities of homelessness, mental health, and dignity.</p>

          <p>Following a week of disappointing economic news, including a weak jobs report and ongoing trade tensions, Trump administration officials appeared on Sunday political shows to defend the president's policies. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, citing "real concerns" about data reliability and extreme revisions. They also maintained that the administration's tariff strategies were set and would ultimately benefit the U.S. economy, despite criticism from economists and former officials.

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, after being struck by a boat on Saturday. The collision reportedly caused the vessel to nearly capsize and threw a passenger overboard, who is believed to be unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was observed resting on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions, crews will tow the carcass to a nearby state park on Monday to perform a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death.</p>

          <p>A self-imposed Friday deadline for a new U.S.-Canada trade agreement has passed without a deal, leaving businesses facing continued uncertainty from a six-month tariff war. While Canada now faces a 35% U.S. tariff rate, nearly 90% of its exports are exempt under the existing USMCA free trade agreement, providing a buffer. The Trump administration has linked tariffs to non-trade issues like drug trafficking and foreign policy, while Canada has responded with its own counter-tariffs. Negotiators from both sides state talks will continue, but a quick resolution appears unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

The shipper groups argue that the deal to create the first coast-to-coast freight rail operator would dangerously consolidate the industry, leading to increased prices and reduced service standards. The merger has also faced opposition from major rail unions and politicians, who fear it will threaten jobs and create a powerful monopoly over the nation's infrastructure.

In her statement, McEntarfer praised the dedicated civil servants at the BLS for their vital work in measuring the economy. Her firing was criticized by her predecessor, William Beach, who called the move groundless and a dangerous precedent that undermines the agency's mission.</p>
