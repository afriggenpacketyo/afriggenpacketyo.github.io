          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, there's been a surge in remembrance policy initiatives. These initiatives aim to recognize and symbolically heal historical injustices, including posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing returnees from Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt." While these symbolic gestures have gained momentum, they contrast with the ongoing failure to address structural reforms. Some experts see this willingness to take historical responsibility as social maturity, while others view it as easier than passing structural reforms.</p>

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly 50% of Americans are making a significant Social Security mistake by not saving enough for retirement. According to Ramsey's research, many people are facing dire retirement prospects and will need to continue working instead of enjoying their dream vacations. He recommends creating a saving benchmark of at least 15% of gross income to secure a more comfortable retirement. Social Security benefits typically replace just 40% of pre-retirement income, which is often insufficient for a comfortable retirement (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Klamath River, once dammed, has been reborn, offering new opportunities for recreation and renewal after the removal of four hydroelectric dams. The restoration marks the end of a decades-long campaign led by tribes and environmental groups. The process involves facilitating recreation, returning land to Indigenous people, and reconnecting people to the landscapes.

          <p>Slate Auto, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is building what it hopes will be America's newest automaker. The company is producing more than 70 vehicles for internal testing and certification. The vehicles are two-seat, two-door electric pickup trucks that can be converted to different body styles of SUVs. The vehicles feature simplified manufacturing and lower costs, two areas where other EV startups have failed. The company expects to begin deliveries by the end of next year.</p>
