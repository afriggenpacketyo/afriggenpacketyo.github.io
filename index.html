          <h2>RFK Jr. Unveils Plan to Phase Out Artificial Food Dyes in the US by End of Next Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 22:57:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the US food supply by the end of next year, contingent on voluntary removal by food companies. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with the food industry to eliminate six others commonly used in cereals, ice cream, and snacks. While the International Association of Color Manufacturers questioned the timeline, the Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would work with the administration, citing the difficulty of navigating differing state laws. The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has led to mandatory evacuations in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township. The fire, which began at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has spread across 8,500 acres and is 10% contained, threatening approximately 1,320 structures and forcing the evacuation of 3,000 people. Several road closures are in effect, including portions of the Garden State Parkway and Route 532, and over 25,000 customers experienced power outages due to the fire. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, and officials are urging people not to fly drones in the area.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government measures in the UK will grant police chiefs the authority to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, aiming to restore public confidence in policing. This change follows an independent report on the Sarah Everard murder case, which highlighted the need for stricter vetting procedures. The reforms make passing background checks a legal requirement for all serving officers, addressing situations where officers who fail vetting checks remain on full pay despite not being able to perform public-facing roles. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized that only officers meeting the highest standards should wear the uniform.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previous criticisms and market concerns. Trump added that he would like Powell to be "a little more active" in cutting interest rates, following rate reductions by the Federal Reserve late last year. His remarks come after speculation that Trump was considering sacking Powell, which had previously sparked market volatility. Trump also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, indicating a willingness to negotiate and reduce tariffs if a deal is reached.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-backed energy firms may need to renegotiate long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts with US providers if the US-China trade war continues, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Trade flows of US LNG to China have halted since February, when Beijing retaliated against US tariffs by imposing duties on the fuel, which have since increased to at least 140%. Although the US supplied a small percentage of China's total LNG imports, Chinese buyers hold numerous long-term procurement contracts with US producers. Most of the LNG expected to be delivered this year could be resold to other markets in the short term.</p>

With exports to the US likely to be affected by higher tariffs, producers will need to cultivate non-US markets.

          <p>A Los Angeles pawn shop owner, Glenn Steven Bednarsh, has been charged with knowingly buying a stolen Andy Warhol trial proof depicting Vladimir Lenin and attempting to sell it to a Dallas-based auction house. The artwork, valued at $175,000, was stolen in 2021. Bednarsh is charged with conspiracy and interstate transportation of stolen goods. Brian Alec Light, who assisted Bednarsh in the attempted sale, pleaded guilty to one count of interstate transportation of stolen goods.

          <p>The L.A.

The decision stems from concerns about enclosure size and the health of elephants, as well as the infeasibility of creating a larger social herd at the L.A. Zoo. While the zoo defends the quality of care provided, animal welfare organizations argue that the elephants would be better off in a sanctuary. Billy and Tina will join five other Asian elephants at the Tulsa Zoo.</p>

A woman tossed in a ditch, unlike the others, adds to the mystery. Analysis suggests the individuals came from various parts of Wales and possibly southwest England, and that their diets were consistent and carb-heavy with no fish.</p>
