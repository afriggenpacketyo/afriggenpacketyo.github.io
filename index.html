          <h2>Mastercard Faces Potential Payouts to Consumers After Unfair Fees Ruling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 16:41:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent court ruling has determined that Mastercard administered unfair fees to shoppers over a 15-year period, potentially entitling millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (or Scotland) to compensation of up to Â£70 each. The legal case, initiated by a former financial ombudsman, argued that these fees led to higher prices for consumers. The total settlement is valued at Â£200 million, with half specifically allocated for consumers who have until the end of the year to file their claims. This decision aims to provide a 'fair and just outcome' for those affected by the historic overcharges.</p>

          <p>The European Union has agreed to lift its remaining economic sanctions on Syria, joining the United States in an effort to aid the country's recovery after years of war and political upheaval. EU officials hope this move will help rebuild Syria and foster stability, although some policymakers remain wary of the new government's direction.

          <p>The body of Dustin Valencia, a 43-year-old father of five, was recovered from Lake Lanier in Georgia after he went missing during a kayaking trip.

Despite these limitations, the approval is considered a win for Novavax, triggering a $175 million milestone payment from Sanofi, with whom they have a licensing deal.

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall 'mega-tsunami' could potentially devastate parts of America's West Coast if a major earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, which could trigger a tsunami with waves reaching extreme heights. Cities like Seattle and Portland could face catastrophic damage, with coastal land potentially sinking by as much as 6.5 feet. Unlike gradual climate events, this earthquake and subsequent tsunami would occur rapidly, leaving little time for adaptation or mitigation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval rating has slightly decreased to 42%, matching his lowest level of the term, as Americans express concern over his handling of the US economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Despite this dip, Trump's popularity remains higher than his first term and exceeds that of his predecessor, Joe Biden, during the second half of his term. While 39% of respondents approved of Trump's economic management, 33% supported his handling of the cost of living. Economists anticipate potential inflation increases due to tariffs, impacting consumer prices and business profits.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is implementing a new policy for COVID-19 vaccines, prioritizing immunizations for individuals at high risk of serious complications while potentially limiting access for others. This strategy involves continuing the current vaccine approval process for those aged 65 and older and younger individuals with health problems. However, the FDA will now require vaccine manufacturers to conduct additional large studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for children and younger healthy adults. This move has sparked debate, with some experts supporting the clarity of the guidelines and others expressing concerns about limiting vaccine availability and undermining public trust.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent complaint that Walmart should not blame tariffs for potential price increases has sparked debate among economists. While mainstream economists argue that companies generally pass along tariff costs to consumers, populist thinkers suggest that companies have more pricing power than acknowledged. Some argue that large companies like Walmart could absorb some of the tariff costs or find alternative supply sources to avoid raising prices. Others contend that companies exploit inflation concerns to manipulate prices, particularly in markets with limited competition.</p>

The eggs, belonging to the Pacific white skate, were found in waters previously thought too cold to sustain life.

The main nursery is estimated to house 2.6 million eggs that take up to 10 years to incubate, showcasing a unique adaptation to the deep-sea environment.</p>

          <p>The recent controversy over Joe Biden's health, including his prostate cancer diagnosis, is not unprecedented, as history reveals numerous instances of presidents concealing or downplaying their health issues. Examples include Franklin Delano Roosevelt's concealed disability and Grover Cleveland's secret tumor removal. The publication of 'Original Sin,' detailing efforts to hide Biden's decline, has reignited concerns about transparency. While compassion is warranted, skepticism is legitimate, given the history of presidential health secrecy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores three potentially surprising aspects of debt relief. First, being behind on payments can sometimes help you qualify for debt forgiveness, as it demonstrates an inability to pay. Second, smaller debt amounts, such as $5,000, may also qualify for certain relief options like credit card debt forgiveness. Finally, taking out another loan, specifically a debt consolidation loan, can be advantageous by consolidating debt at a lower interest rate and streamlining the payoff process. Understanding these features can help borrowers develop a more effective debt relief strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt forgiveness, while offering a path to becoming debt-free, generally hurts your credit score. Settling a debt for less than the full amount owed is typically reported as 'settled' rather than 'paid in full,' which can negatively impact your credit history. Additionally, stopping payments while negotiating debt forgiveness can lead to late payments and charge-offs, further damaging your score. While debt forgiveness remains on your credit report for seven years, its impact lessens over time as you rebuild your credit. The decision to pursue debt forgiveness depends on your financial situation and goals.</p>

          <p>The Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill that aims to regulate certain cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. The bill establishes rules for stablecoin issuers, mandating that they hold a reserve of assets to back the cryptocurrency and prioritize repayment to coin holders in the event of bankruptcy. Supporters believe the measure will protect consumers and set industry standards, while critics argue that it fails to adequately address conflict-of-interest concerns, particularly those raised by Trump's ventures in stablecoins.</p>
