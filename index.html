          <p>Lieutenant General He Lei, former vice-president of the People’s Liberation Army Academy of Military Sciences, recently asserted that mainland China possesses sufficient conventional weapons to "resolve the Taiwan issue" by force, should non-peaceful means become necessary. He stressed the importance of achieving "maximum victory at minimal cost and with the fewest casualties," prioritizing joint operations and comprehensive combat capabilities over a direct weapon-for-weapon comparison. This statement, made to Phoenix Television, suggests a strategic confidence in China's military capacity for a potential conflict. The article emphasizes a shift in rhetoric, downplaying the need for extensive high-end weapons in such a scenario.</p>

          <p>Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei announced new AI computing systems, including the "Atlas 950 SuperCluster," utilizing its in-house Ascend chips, as it steps up pressure on U.S. rival Nvidia. This move aims to counter U.S. sanctions by grouping large numbers of less efficient, homegrown chips to achieve superior computing capabilities. Huawei claims its forthcoming Atlas 950 supernode will deliver 6.7 times more computing power than Nvidia's NVL144 system and surpass Elon Musk's xAI Colossus supercomputer.

          <p>The UK government plans to appeal a High Court ruling that temporarily blocked the deportation of an Eritrean man to France under a new "one in, one out" migrant deal. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood vowed to fight "vexatious, last-minute claims," after the man argued he was a victim of modern slavery hours before his flight. The Home Office is reviewing the Modern Slavery Act, arguing that such delays undermine efforts to deter deadly small boat crossings. This article highlights the ongoing legal and political challenges facing the UK's migration policies, including concerns about the scheme's viability.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has paused approvals for remote work accommodations for its disabled employees, according to their union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). This follows an updated Department of Health and Human Services policy that no longer explicitly includes telework as a reasonable accommodation. The union states that this lack of clarity has caused confusion and concern among hundreds of disabled staff members, many of whom rely on these arrangements. This article highlights a potential rollback of accessibility for federal workers.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the deep divisions and escalating anger in America following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, questioning the country's ability to overcome this "spiral of hatred." It argues that political and media incentives often reward extreme rhetoric, hindering reconciliation efforts, and that social media acts as a unique exacerbating factor. While acknowledging historical periods of violence, the piece suggests that absent strong leadership committed to reconciliation, the nation risks further weakening due to internal divisions. The article provides a bleak outlook on the current political climate.</p>

Experts forecast a smaller rate cut from the People's Bank of China this year, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap and ease capital outflow pressures, thereby lending support to the yuan.
