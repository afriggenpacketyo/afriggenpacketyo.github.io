          <p>Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have agreed to enhance cybersecurity cooperation following Japan's enactment of a law permitting government monitoring of online communications due to escalating cyber threats. The agreement occurred during talks in Singapore. Nakatani did not clarify whether Hegseth requested Japan to increase its defense spending, while President Trump views the security treaty with Japan as unfair. This collaboration underscores the growing importance of cybersecurity in international relations and defense strategies, especially as digital threats become more sophisticated and frequent. The development is crucial for maintaining stability and security in the digital realm. </p>

          <p>A PLA major general, Hu Gangfeng, leading the Chinese delegation at the Shangri-La Dialogue, criticized the United States for destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region after US defense chief Pete Hegseth called for collective deterrence against Chinese aggression. Hu stated that Hegseth's address contained groundless accusations against China, stirring up trouble and inciting confrontation. Hegseth had warned of a possibly imminent risk that the People's Liberation Army would take over Taiwan by force. Hu Gangfeng countered that some countries are promoting exclusive circles and increasing their military presence, opposing the use of Asia-Pacific waters for seeking hegemony. </p>
