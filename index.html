        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a dip after reports surfaced that the company's board is initiating a search for a new CEO to succeed Elon Musk. This move follows a noticeable decline in Tesla's sales and profits, with first-quarter results falling short of expectations. Musk's reputation has also been impacted due to his involvement in the White House, where he has been working with U.S. President Donald Trump to downsize the federal government. Musk plans to dedicate a limited amount of time, about "a day or two per week," to the Department of Government Efficiency starting in May.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a Stoke-on-Trent firm renowned for its vibrant depictions of animals and geometric patterns, has ceased trading after more than 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The company's directors attributed the closure to rising costs and declining sales. Moorcroft's history dates back to 1897, with its current site established in 1913, receiving early support from Liberty of London. The closure marks another blow to the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, following the recent collapse of Royal Stafford and other firms in the sector.</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), a move seen as an attempt to improve relations with the EU amidst global uncertainties caused by U.S. tariffs. The sanctions, initially imposed in 2021, targeted MEPs accused of spreading disinformation about human rights in Xinjiang. While this action may ease travel for MEPs to China, the EU maintains its sanctions on Chinese officials over Xinjiang and insists it will continue to address human rights concerns, with little prospect of reviving a frozen investment deal.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk argue that the U.S. military lacks the necessary resources to sustain a major war, possessing advanced equipment but insufficient quantities of ships, ammunition, and personnel. They point to the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen as examples of the demands of modern warfare, highlighting the need for increased investment in active service members, ammunition, and new ships and aircraft. The authors caution against prioritizing small quantities of expensive, cutting-edge weapons over producing enough firepower for a prolonged conflict, emphasizing the need for both advanced systems and volume munitions.</p>

This increase does not include additional costs such as payments to ousted federal workers and rehiring expenses.

          <p>A "baby hatch" at San-ikukai Hospital in Tokyo has been utilized for the first time since its opening on March 31, offering a safe and anonymous option for distressed parents to leave infants they cannot care for. This makes it the second medical institution in Japan to provide such a service, following Jikei Hospital in Kumamoto Prefecture. The Tokyo hospital aims to be "the last line of defense" for protecting babies' lives, addressing the increasing number of women facing unplanned pregnancies and isolated births, offering a "confidential birth" system.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris returned to the public stage, delivering a speech where she criticized President Trump's policies, specifically labeling his trade war as the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history." Harris stated that the tariffs have negatively impacted workers and businesses, leading to layoffs and investment pauses. She also addressed Trump's immigration policies, stating that it is not acceptable to detain or disappear American citizens without due process. The former vice president concluded by urging Americans to "stand together" and "gear up for the hard work ahead."</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reflects on the changing dynamics in Asia, where the United States' withdrawal from aid and democratic ideals is creating opportunities for China to expand its influence. While American ideals still resonate, the dismantling of American aid programs and the back-and-forth on tariffs are perceived as another form of withdrawal. The author shares anecdotes from Myanmar and Cambodia, illustrating how China is filling the void left by the U.S., while also acknowledging the enduring appeal of American culture and values.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers' season concluded with a disappointing first-round playoff loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, with Rudy Gobert dominating Game 5. Despite midseason roster changes, the Lakers struggled to overcome the Timberwolves' cohesive team play and defensive strength. The Timberwolves' victory highlighted the Lakers' inability to capitalize on key moments and the superior toughness of their opponents. As a result, the Lakers' season ended in a 103-96 defeat, marking their first loss in a first-round series as a No. 3 or higher seed.</p>

          <p>Several major European automakers, including Stellantis and Mercedes, have withdrawn or reduced their full-year financial guidance, citing uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. These tariffs, including a 25% levy on automotive imports into the U.S., are impacting profitability and making it difficult for automakers to make long-term investment decisions. While Trump's recent move to ease car tariffs provides some relief, analysts warn that the ongoing volatility in trade policies will continue to create challenges for the industry.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Glasgow University have confirmed the increasing presence of mosquitoes in Scotland, with over 20 different species now identified, including some as far north as Shetland. This is attributed to citizen science project, Mosquito Scotland, that has seen the submission of over 700 potential sightings and photos. Researchers found that the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people. While most often spotted in woodland areas, they are often found inland in the biggest cities.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The BOJ now expects the Japanese economy to grow by only 0.5 percent, a significant downgrade from its previous forecast of 1.1 percent. This decision comes as President Trump's tariff threats weigh on economic prospects around the world, complicating the central bank's efforts to revert to more conventional monetary policies. The central bank also decided to keep interest rates steady.</p>
