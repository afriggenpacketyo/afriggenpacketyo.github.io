        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant wildfire has forced the closure of all tourist hiking trails on Mount Vesuvius near Naples, Italy. Firefighting efforts are extensive, involving twelve ground teams and six Canadair aircraft to combat the blaze, which has consumed over 1,200 acres within the national park. The smoke is visible from the historic Pompeii archaeological site, which remains open, but the fire poses a threat to the region's well-known vineyards and farms. This incident is part of a broader trend of severe wildfires across Europe, exacerbated by record-breaking summer heatwaves linked to climate change, with similar large-scale fires recently occurring in Spain and France.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is contemplating the imposition of new tariffs on Chinese imports as a punitive measure for China's continued purchasing of Russian oil. Vice President J.D. Vance confirmed that President Trump is reviewing this option but has not yet made a final decision, acknowledging the complexity of the U.S.-China relationship. This potential action follows a similar move against India, where Trump invoked emergency presidential powers to place tariffs on goods from countries importing Russian oil. The policy is part of a broader strategy to increase pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine, a conflict Trump has pledged to resolve.</p>

          <p>Health experts and social media users are raising alarms about the 'Feel Free' tonic and other products containing kratom, a substance with opioid-like effects that is sold in stores nationwide. The FDA warns that kratom is often used to self-treat conditions like pain and anxiety but can be highly addictive, a concern echoed by addiction specialists who have treated patients for dependency. The company behind Feel Free, Botanic Tonics, recently settled a class-action lawsuit for failing to warn about kratom's dangers, though it did not admit wrongdoing. This comes as the FDA moves to control a concentrated byproduct of the kratom plant due to its potential for abuse.</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following accusations of cultural appropriation over a shoe he designed in collaboration with Adidas Originals. The 'Oaxaca Slip-On' was inspired by traditional Mexican huaraches but was reportedly manufactured in China without consulting or crediting the Indigenous Oaxacan communities who originated the design. The controversy drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, prompting both Chavarria and Adidas to apologize publicly and remove promotional images. Adidas has stated its commitment to engaging in a respectful dialogue with the Yalálag community to repair the damage caused by the oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC report details an escalating campaign by Israeli settlers to displace Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, a situation that has intensified since the Hamas attacks of October 2023. Settler violence has sharply increased, with UN data showing an average of four attacks per day, and human rights groups accuse Israeli forces of failing to protect Palestinians and sometimes participating in the attacks. Settler leaders, now influential within the Israeli government, view this period as an opportunity to expand Jewish settlements and extinguish hopes for a Palestinian state. This push is transforming the landscape and deepening the long-standing conflict over land and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, an expert on modern Chinese history at Harvard Kennedy School, emphasizes that World War II was a pivotal yet often underestimated event in shaping contemporary China. He argues that the widespread destruction of infrastructure during Japan's invasion forced the nation to essentially rebuild from scratch after the war. Mitter suggests that this historical context informs China's modern perspective, highlighting that the country's current interests are best served by maintaining peace and stability throughout the Asia-Pacific region. This viewpoint underscores the long-term consequences of the conflict on China's political and societal development.</p>

          <p>Bobby Whitlock, the soulful keyboardist and singer-songwriter who co-founded the influential blues-rock band Derek and the Dominos with Eric Clapton, has died at age 77. Whitlock was a key creative force on the band's landmark 1970 album, "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs," co-writing half of its tracks, including "Bell Bottom Blues." He began his career as a session musician at Stax Records before joining Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, where he connected with Clapton and George Harrison. After the Dominos disbanded, he released several solo albums and continued to collaborate with his wife, CoCo Carmel.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war in Ukraine, a coalition of European leaders has issued a joint statement demanding Ukraine's inclusion in the negotiations. Leaders from France, Germany, Poland, the U.K., and the European Commission emphasized that any path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's direct involvement. While they welcomed diplomatic efforts to "stop the killing," they stressed the need for a solution that includes robust security guarantees for Ukraine. It remains unclear if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who supports the peace efforts, will attend the summit.</p>

          <p>The man who opened fire at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer before dying himself, had become fixated on his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines, according to authorities. The suspect, Patrick Joseph White, allegedly blamed the vaccine for causing him depression and suicidal thoughts. Before the shooting, he had attempted to enter the CDC campus but was denied entry by guards. The union representing CDC employees has since demanded that federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, stating that it has fueled a climate of hostility that puts scientists and public health workers at risk.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned offensive to take control of Gaza City, calling it the "best way" to end the war, despite facing strong condemnation at the UN Security Council. Several member nations, including the UK and France, warned the plan could violate international law and further endanger hostages. Netanyahu countered by claiming hostages were being deliberately starved by Hamas and denied that Israel was responsible for the hunger crisis in Gaza. He also outlined a three-step plan to increase aid, while thousands of protesters in Israel demonstrated against the government's plan, fearing for the safety of the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. Advocates and lawmakers attribute the ongoing problem to ineffective enforcement by the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), which a recent state audit criticized for failing to take adequate action. Many farmworkers, a large number of whom are undocumented, are reluctant to report unsafe conditions for fear of retaliation. As climate change brings more intense heatwaves, these workers face greater risks than ever.</p>

Some protesters expressed anger at the UK government's conditional plan to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a "reward for Hamas." The march occurred amid a large security presence, with Jewish groups reporting a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents in Britain since the conflict began.</p>

Abbott stated he will call continuous 30-day special legislative sessions and have the absent Democrats arrested upon their return to Texas. The contentious plan, prompted by Donald Trump, aims to create five new Republican-leaning congressional seats, a move critical to the GOP's chances of retaining its narrow House majority. Democratic governors in states where the lawmakers have sought refuge have vowed to support them, intensifying the partisan battle.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing turmoil over its process for approving drugs for rare diseases, highlighted by the recent case of Sarepta Therapeutics. In 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Sarepta's expensive gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, despite internal concerns about limited clinical data. However, the recent deaths of three patients from acute liver failure prompted the FDA to suspend the drug's distribution, causing the company's stock to plummet. This incident underscores the profound dilemmas the agency navigates between providing hope for patients with few options and ensuring drug safety and efficacy.</p>
