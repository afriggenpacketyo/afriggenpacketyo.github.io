          <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant drop following reports of a Justice Department criminal investigation into its Medicare Advantage business, focusing on potential Medicare fraud. The Wall Street Journal cited sources familiar with the matter, though UnitedHealth Group denies receiving notification of the probe, calling the reporting "deeply irresponsible" and defending the integrity of its Medicare Advantage program. This follows a prior civil investigation into the company's diagnosis practices. Amidst these challenges, CEO Andrew Witty unexpectedly stepped down, replaced by Stephen Hemsley, impacting the company's market capitalization. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor asserted that President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship "violates four Supreme Court precedents" during arguments before the court. Justice Elena Kagan questioned the practicality of the order, suggesting it could require individual lawsuits from every affected person to challenge its legality. The executive order, which reinterprets the 14th Amendment, denies automatic U.S. citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their mother is unlawfully present or temporarily in the country and the father is not a citizen or lawful resident. This case has significant implications, potentially affecting numerous lawsuits challenging White House actions.</p>

          <p>Following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, Syrian business owners express renewed optimism as President Trump announces the end of U.S. sanctions on Syria. These sanctions, dating back to the 1970s, were intended to pressure the Assad regime but have severely impacted the Syrian economy, leaving most of the population in poverty. While some Western governments eased restrictions earlier, the Trump administration had set conditions for their removal, including assurances regarding Iran's influence and the protection of minorities. Syrian business leaders are now planning to return and contribute to rebuilding the country, contingent on the actual lifting of sanctions and the restoration of economic stability.</p>

          <p>Many homeowners are finding their home equity "trapped" due to elevated interest rates and stricter lending requirements. While home values have increased, accessing that equity is challenging. Experts suggest exploring alternative borrowing options like HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) or home equity loans, which allow homeowners to tap into equity without refinancing their existing mortgage. Improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history can also improve access to home equity borrowing products, enabling homeowners to leverage their built-in wealth.

Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of reach, with the cities facing the worst affordability gaps often located in regions with restrictive zoning and permitting regulations.

          <p>President Trump's denouncement of Western intervention and nation-building during a speech in Saudi Arabia drew applause from the audience, but also skepticism from some observers. Trump declared that the U.S. would no longer lecture other nations on how to live, appealing to long-standing grievances in the Middle East. While some welcomed his message of sovereignty, others expressed concerns about the potential impact on human rights and the implications of aligning with authoritarian leaders. Trump's visit to the region included meetings with controversial figures and discussions on business deals and diplomatic initiatives.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Speaking at a research conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return, citing the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks. He cautioned that policy changes could create a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation. Though he did not mention President Trump's tariffs, Powell has noted the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation.</p>

          <p>Scientists have unraveled the decades-long mystery behind ginger cats' distinctive coloring, discovering that they are missing a section of their genetic code. This missing code affects the ARHGAP36 gene, which regulates skin, eye, and fur tone production, leading to lighter colors. The research, funded by cat lovers, also explains why ginger cats are predominantly male, as the gene is carried on the X chromosome. The scientists hope that solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange colored cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.</p>

          <p>A debate is brewing in Washington over so-called 'debanking,' the practice of financial institutions closing accounts or denying services based on political positions or perceived risks. While there is a degree of political agreement that debanking is a problem, there are no easy answers or consensus on what constitutes the issue. Critics argue that it's politically motivated discrimination, while banks maintain they are simply managing risk and running a profitable business. The Trump administration is considering measures to address the concerns, including a potential executive order and revisiting fair access rules for banks.</p>
