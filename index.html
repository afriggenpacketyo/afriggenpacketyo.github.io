            <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, is on trial in Arizona for conspiring to kill her fourth husband. Representing herself, Daybell argued that the 2019 shooting of Charles Vallow was a "tragic family event," not a premeditated murder. Prosecutors countered that the shooting was a ploy to obtain Vallow's $1 million life insurance policy and to be with Chad Daybell, invoking twisted religious beliefs to justify the act. The jury is currently deliberating the verdict after hearing closing arguments from both sides.</p>
