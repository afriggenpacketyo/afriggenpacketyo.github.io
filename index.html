          <p>An Israeli airstrike struck the Holy Family Church, the only Catholic church in the Gaza Strip, killing three people and wounding ten others, including the parish priest. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the targeting of a sacred place and innocent civilians. In response to the incident, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that "stray ammunition" had hit the church by accident and expressed deep regret, promising a transparent investigation into the tragic event. The strike drew international condemnation, including from Pope Leo XIV and Italy's prime minister.</p>

          <p>This article details President Trump's persistent criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, primarily concerning the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. It explains the core functions of the Federal Reserve, its dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices, and the established independence that shields it from direct political influence. The piece also explores the legal and political complexities surrounding the president's suggestions of firing Powell, a move considered legally untested and potentially disruptive to financial markets.

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for an end to the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, describing the legal proceedings as an "unjust" political attack. Bolsonaro is facing an investigation over an alleged coup attempt following his 2022 election loss. The statement of support comes as Trump threatens significant tariffs on Brazilian goods and as U.S. officials reportedly consider sanctions against the Brazilian Supreme Court justice overseeing the case. This intervention highlights the continued political alliance between the two conservative leaders.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed its previous ban, granting marketing authorization for Juul's tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes. The agency concluded that the company's studies demonstrated its products could be a less harmful alternative for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision comes after years of controversy and legal battles blaming Juul for fueling the teenage vaping crisis. While Juul's CEO hailed it as a milestone, anti-tobacco advocates criticized the move as a step backward for public health.</p>

The move is framed as a political win for Trump, aligning with the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, despite its limited actual health benefits.</p>

Scientists will carefully melt the cylinder, which was drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, to study the ancient dust, ash, and air bubbles trapped inside. This material holds vital information about Earth's climate during a period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition.

          <p>In this personal opinion piece, an international health worker recounts the harrowing experiences of treating children in Gaza, describing the situation not as a war but as a massacre. The author highlights the profound heroism of local Palestinian healthcare staff who continue to work daily despite losing their own homes and families and facing immense personal risk. The article contrasts their sacrifice with the temporary assignments of international staff and makes an urgent plea for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the blockade to save innocent lives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the reasons behind the soaring price of beef in the U.S., which has reached record highs this summer. The primary driver is a shrinking national cattle herd, now at its lowest level since 1951, due to factors like prolonged drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices. Additional pressures on supply include a halt on cattle imports from Mexico due to a pest outbreak and the potential impact of widespread tariffs, suggesting consumers should not expect significant price relief soon.

If the judge accepts the recommendation, Hankison would serve no additional time, as the memo requests credit for time already served.

CVI occurs when damaged valves in leg veins have difficulty returning blood to the heart, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like swelling, varicose veins, and skin discoloration. According to medical experts, the condition is common, affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population, and is typically managed with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle changes to improve circulation.</p>
