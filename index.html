          <p>In a recent group interview for their upcoming film "After the Hunt," actress Julia Roberts shared that she was surprisingly "scared" and intimidated before her first meeting with co-star Chloë Sevigny. Roberts recounted the moment at her home, where she, along with other cast and crew, awaited Sevigny's arrival for a rehearsal, admitting her nervousness to those present. Sevigny, in contrast, expressed feeling an immediate closeness to Roberts and praised her generosity during the production, even watching several of Roberts' classic films on the flight home because she missed her. The film centers on a college professor caught in the middle of a sexual assault accusation involving a student and a colleague.</p>

          <p>This article provides a profile of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA, who was recently killed. It details his rise from a community college dropout to a major influencer in the MAGA movement, known for his combative debate style on college campuses which built him a massive social media following. The profile covers his close relationship with Donald Trump, his controversial statements on race and social issues, and his deeply held Christian faith that informed his political views. The piece also touches on his family life and the legacy he leaves behind, with his wife Erika now leading Turning Point USA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its conflict with California, New York, and Illinois over their "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The agency sent letters demanding the states comply with ICE detainers, which request local jails to hold undocumented individuals for federal custody. After the states refused, the DHS threatened to involve the Department of Justice to sue the states and potentially block federal funding. State officials argue that ICE detainers are non-binding requests and that compliance could lead to legal liability and erode community trust, setting the stage for a significant federal-state legal battle.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, has been arrested following a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. Police reported that at least three bullets were fired into the building's lobby on Friday afternoon, though no injuries occurred as the building was occupied at the time. The incident took place a day after protests were held outside the station regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. While a motive is still under investigation and no direct link has been confirmed, the event has been condemned by journalism organizations as an act of violence against the media and the community.</p>

          <p>While deadly flash flooding in the Southwest has recently subsided, forecasters warn that another wave of monsoonal moisture could bring renewed flood risks to Southern California and Arizona this week. Recent floods in the region proved fatal, with a two-year-old child being swept away in Barstow, California. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to intensify and is expected to become the second hurricane of the season.

          <p>Mary "Maggie" Cleary has been named the new acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the abrupt resignation of her predecessor, Erik Siebert. Siebert's departure came amid reports of pressure from the Trump administration to press criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is being investigated for mortgage fraud. President Trump publicly confirmed he wanted Siebert out, creating turmoil within the office. Cleary, a conservative lawyer who previously wrote about being wrongly targeted in the January 6 investigation, now takes over the high-profile office responsible for the sensitive probe into James.</p>

          <p>An armed man was arrested at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the site of an upcoming memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individual, identified as 42-year-old Joshua Runkles, was allegedly impersonating a law enforcement officer and carrying a weapon in a prohibited area. According to the Secret Service, agents approached the man after he exhibited suspicious behavior, at which point he claimed to be an officer. The incident has heightened security concerns for the memorial, which is already operating under a high-level security designation, and an investigation into the man's motives is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Dutch police deployed tear gas and water cannons against violent anti-immigration protesters in The Hague, resulting in 30 arrests and injuries to two officers. Approximately 1,500 demonstrators blocked a major highway, with some throwing rocks and setting a police car on fire. The protest, organized by a right-wing activist demanding stricter migration policies, drew condemnation from Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders, who called the violence "utterly unacceptable." The unrest highlights the deep political divisions over immigration in the Netherlands, an issue that caused the collapse of the previous government coalition in June.</p>

          <p>A growing number of university students in the UK are taking on significant part-time work and long commutes because their government maintenance loans are insufficient to cover basic living expenses. This article highlights the personal stories of students juggling demanding jobs, such as working 30-hour weeks in fast food, or commuting for hours from their family homes to afford their education. Recent studies indicate that the maximum maintenance loan covers only about half of the necessary costs for a minimum standard of living. This financial pressure forces students to make sacrifices that can impact their studies, social lives, and opportunities for career-related internships.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a popular supplement known for enhancing athletic performance and muscle growth, is now being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, including alleviating "brain fog." This article examines the growing body of research suggesting that creatine, which helps cells produce energy, may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. While thousands of studies have validated its effects on physical strength, its impact on the brain is less established but promising, particularly for individuals under stress or with dietary deficiencies. Experts note that while more research is needed, the supplement could potentially help mitigate cognitive symptoms associated with conditions like perimenopause or sleep deprivation.</p>

While successive governments previously held that recognition should be part of a final peace process, the Starmer administration acted due to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the perceived threat to a two-state solution. The article analyzes the complex motivations behind the move, including intense pressure from within the Labour Party and international momentum from allies like France and Canada.

The remarks from the former Milwaukee archbishop drew significant outrage on social media, with critics pointing to Kirk's divisive rhetoric and Dolan's own controversial history, including his handling of clergy sexual abuse cases.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant advance for fusion energy research, scientists have for the first time observed diamond capsules undergoing shock-induced amorphization, a process where their atomic structure collapses under extreme pressure. By firing powerful lasers at the diamonds, researchers simulated the conditions needed for nuclear fusion, gaining crucial insights into how material flaws can lead to asymmetrical implosions that hinder energy release. This better understanding of how diamonds behave under immense pressure could help scientists create more stable and efficient fusion reactions. The discovery marks a key step toward harnessing fusion as a clean, nearly limitless energy source, which could reduce global reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills designed to protect immigrants from the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement tactics. The centerpiece of the legislation is a first-in-the-nation law banning federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty, a direct response to recent raids by masked federal agents. Other new laws will limit immigration agents' access to nonpublic areas of schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and require schools to notify families of any enforcement activity on campus. Newsom framed the laws as a necessary pushback against what he termed the administration's "secret police" and authoritarian methods.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force has flown its first air defense mission over Poland as part of a broader NATO response to recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. RAF Typhoon fighter jets were deployed on Friday night for the patrol, which the UK Defence Secretary described as a "clear signal" that NATO airspace will be defended. The mission, dubbed "Eastern Sentry," was initiated after 19 Russian drones entered Polish airspace on a single day, escalating tensions along NATO's eastern flank. The incursions have been part of a pattern of Russian violations of NATO members' airspace, including recent incidents over Romania and Estonia.</p>

          <p>Russia unleashed a massive aerial assault across Ukraine, launching over 600 drones and missiles against multiple regions, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. The strikes targeted critical infrastructure, residential areas, and civilian enterprises in cities including Dnipro, Mykolaiv, and Kharkiv, killing at least three people and injuring dozens. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as a deliberate strategy of terror, not military necessity. While Ukraine reported that its air defenses intercepted most of the projectiles, Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed all its designated targets were hit.

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has denied that the Trump administration pressured ABC to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, despite public threats from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to review the network's broadcast license. Kimmel's show was pulled indefinitely after he made a remark linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. Leavitt claimed the decision was made solely by ABC executives because Kimmel "chose to knowingly lie." The suspension has ignited a fierce debate over free speech and "cancel culture," drawing criticism from figures like former President Obama and even some Republicans who found the FCC's actions to be an overreach of government power.</p>

          <p>At their party conference, the UK's Liberal Democrats made a conspicuous effort to embrace patriotic symbols, aiming to reclaim them from nationalist and far-right groups. Former leader Tim Farron delivered a rousing speech, draping himself in a Blackburn Rovers football flag and urging members to wave the nation's flags with pride. The move represents a strategic shift for the party, which has historically shied away from overt displays of nationalism. Party leader Sir Ed Davey also participated, leading a marching band through Bournemouth in a deliberately patriotic stunt, as the party seeks to position itself as the true voice of British values against rivals like Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are asking a judge to bar federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. They argue that public statements from Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Trump, along with a highly publicized "perp walk," have fatally prejudiced the case against their client. The defense claims the decision to pursue capital punishment was political and has tainted the legal process. This legal challenge in federal court follows a victory in state court where terrorism charges against Mangione were dismissed, though he still faces a state murder charge.</p>
