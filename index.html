          <p>President Trump's recent remarks calling for a swift end to the war in Gaza signal a growing impatience even within Israel's closest allies. This shift comes after months of increasing international criticism of Israel's actions, with partners like the United States, Britain, and France becoming more willing to exert overt pressure. Germany and Italy have also voiced strong disapproval of Israel's expanded attacks, reflecting a significant change in tone from traditionally steadfast supporters. These developments highlight Israel's increasing diplomatic isolation as key allies begin to question the proportionality and goals of its military operations in Gaza. The article emphasizes that despite continued practical support, such as military aid, these countries are losing patience with Prime Minister Netanyahu's handling of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his myth-shattering war documentaries, has passed away at the age of 97. His most famous work, ‚ÄúThe Sorrow and the Pity,‚Äù challenged the prevailing narrative of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation of World War II. Through incisive interviews with ordinary citizens, the film exposed the complexities of collaboration and indifference in wartime Clermont-Ferrand. The documentary sparked controversy and was initially banned from French television, but it ultimately paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of France's wartime history. Ophuls also directed ‚ÄúH√¥tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie,‚Äù earning him an Oscar.</p>

          <p>Military veterans who served at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base (K2) in Uzbekistan are struggling to receive adequate medical care and recognition for toxic exposures they faced during their service. The base, used for U.S. operations in Afghanistan after 9/11, contained yellowcake uranium, jet fuel, and other volatile chemicals, creating a highly toxic environment. Veterans have reported rare cancers, reproductive issues, and unexplained deaths, but the VA's initial studies are considered insufficient by some. Lawmakers are pushing for a new epidemiological study to address the blind spots in current research and ensure that K2 veterans receive the care they deserve.
