            <p>Carly Jones, a disabled advocate and MBE recipient, is pushing for greater recognition of disabled individuals within the UK's honours system. She highlights the need for more nominations from diverse backgrounds and challenges the perception that the honours system is only for the elite. Jones also serves on one of the honours committees, emphasizing the importance of ensuring awards reflect genuine contributions and hard work, not just wealth. The Cabinet Office reports an increase in awards given to people with disabilities, but acknowledges there's still work to be done to achieve full representation.</p>

            <p>A US court has denied the government's motion for an emergency stay in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, a man wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court strongly criticized the government's assertion of a right to deport residents without due process and stash them away in foreign prisons, calling it a violation of American liberties. The court emphasized that the government must actively facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, as ordered by the Supreme Court, and not simply remove domestic barriers. The ruling highlights the importance of respecting the rule of law and the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

The ACLU claims these men are being labeled as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and face deportation, despite a previous Supreme Court ruling requiring adequate notice and a chance to argue their case in court.

            <p>Apple's extensive supply chain in China, where most of its products are manufactured, is facing increasing scrutiny due to ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. While Apple secured tariff exemptions in the past, the Trump administration's renewed focus on encouraging domestic manufacturing poses a challenge. Moving production out of China is difficult due to the country's established infrastructure and skilled workforce. Despite exploring diversification to countries like Vietnam and India, China remains a critical part of Apple's global operations.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security is ending humanitarian parole for Afghan nationals, affecting approximately 9,000 individuals, including hundreds of Christian converts. These faith leaders propose a 90-day pause on deportations and a "vetted exemptions list" to prioritize those most at risk. They argue that deporting these individuals would violate American values and international law, which prohibits returning people to countries where they face likely torture or death.</p>

Ackman's Pershing Square built a 4.1% position as of the end of 2024 and has significantly increased the position — to 19.8% — through shares and swaps, becoming Hertz's second-largest shareholder. West stated that Ackman's investment is a testament to the progress and relentless effort of the Hertz team. Ackman's investment firm received an exemption from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delay the filing of the position until Wednesday, which allowed it to accumulate substantially more shares.

            <p>Canadian voters shared their perspectives on the recent leaders' debates, with opinions varying across different candidates. Some voters found Liberal leader Mark Carney to be a refreshing and business-like presence, while others felt Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre was the clear winner. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was seen as desperate by some, while Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet impressed a few voters from western Canada. Many voters emphasized the importance of a strong Canada in the face of foreign influence.</p>

            <p>Vox discusses the Trump administration's escalating conflict with the judicial branch over the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. Despite a Supreme Court ruling requiring the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, it has not complied. The administration claims the courts cannot compel President Donald Trump to request El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia. The article highlights that the administration has two options: either do more to bring Abrego Garcia back or continue to defy court orders, with the White House indicating Abrego Garcia will "never" return.</p>

            <p>The Australian government has been shooting koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park due to starvation and injuries following a massive bushfire. This controversial program is intended to end the koalas' suffering, but some advocates argue that logging, development, and climate change have destroyed much of their habitat. This situation highlights the difficult choices wildlife agencies face due to increasing severity of bushfires and other extreme weather events. Experts are also skeptical that shooting the animals from helicopters is the best approach.</p>

            <p>An Italian appeals court upheld life sentences for a Pakistani couple convicted of murdering their 18-year-old daughter, Saman Abbas, in an honor killing. Saman was killed after she refused an arranged marriage. The court case became a symbol of the brutal mistreatment of immigrant women who rebel against inflexible family rules. The court also sentenced to life in prison two cousins who had been previously cleared by a lower court. Saman Abbas' body was dug up in November 2022 in an abandoned farmhouse near the fields where her father worked in northern Italy.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced that it took a step toward making thousands of federal workers easier to fire by stripping them of civil service protections and reclassifying them as "at-will" employees. The new proposed "Schedule Policy/Career" classification will affect about 50,000 federal workers, or about 2% of the workforce, according to the White House. The workers "are not required to personally or politically support the President, but must faithfully implement the law and the administration's policies," the White House added.</p>

            <p>The CDC has scaled back its plan to assist Texas schools in curbing measles outbreaks due to staff layoffs, according to an agency employee. The agency had considered expanding its hospital assessment service to schools to identify ventilation and air filtration errors that could facilitate the virus's spread. However, with many staff facing layoffs, including those with expertise in ventilation and contamination, agency officials decided to scrap the plan. One expert found issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is advancing efforts to make it easier to fire some federal workers by reclassifying them as "at-will" employees. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposed a rule to reclassify tens of thousands of career civil servants, removing civil service protections and making them easier to fire. The White House argues that the proposed rule would address "unaccountable, policy-determining federal employees who put their own interests ahead of the American people's." The American Federation of Government Employees has sued the administration to protect civil service workers.</p>
