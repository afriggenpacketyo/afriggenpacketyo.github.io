        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce the United Kingdom's formal recognition of a Palestinian state, representing a significant shift in British foreign policy. The decision follows a deadline given to Israel to agree to a ceasefire and commit to a two-state solution, amid concerns over worsening conditions in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements. This move has drawn criticism from the Israeli government and some Conservative figures, who argue it rewards terrorism, while many other nations have already taken or pledged a similar step. The policy change reflects growing pressure within the Labour Party for a stronger stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law, the "No Secret Police Act," which bans most on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks. The legislation is a direct response to recent immigration enforcement operations in which federal agents wore face coverings, a practice state officials have described as intimidating. While proponents argue the law increases transparency and public trust, federal officials have criticized it as dangerous to officers and have stated they will not comply. The new law also includes protections for students and patients from immigration enforcement actions at schools and hospitals.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Tampa International Airport discovered a human skull and other bones inside a passenger's luggage during a routine check. The traveler, who was initially flagged for undeclared cigars and prohibited plants, claimed the remains were intended for ritualistic use. Officials stated the bones posed a serious health risk and were subsequently destroyed, highlighting the unpredictable nature of customs inspections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains strict regulations for importing human remains, typically requiring a death certificate and other official documentation to prevent potential health hazards.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force has conducted its first NATO air defense mission over Poland in response to recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. RAF Typhoon jets were deployed as part of the military alliance's "Eastern Sentry" mission to bolster its eastern flank and send a clear message that NATO airspace will be defended. Tensions have escalated after Russia repeatedly violated the airspace of NATO members, including Poland, Romania, and Estonia, this month. The mission follows Poland's decision to shoot down three of 19 Russian drones that entered its airspace on a single day, an event its prime minister called the closest the region has been to open conflict since World War II.</p>

This is not the first time such relics from the war have been found in the city, which was occupied by Japanese forces and targeted by U.S. air raids during the conflict.</p>

          <p>ABC has suspended its late-night program "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely following remarks Kimmel made connecting the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The suspension followed significant pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who threatened to review ABC's broadcast license over what he called "truly sick" comments. The White House denied direct involvement in the network's decision, attributing it to Kimmel's choice to "knowingly lie" to his audience.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program heavily utilized by the technology and finance sectors to employ highly skilled foreign workers. The move, which does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, has caused significant disruption, with major companies like Amazon and Microsoft advising their affected employees to remain in or return to the U.S. immediately. Foreign governments, particularly India, which accounts for over 70% of H-1B recipients, have expressed concern over the "humanitarian consequences" for families.

He argued that these symbols should belong to everyone and not be co-opted by those who seek to divide society. This new strategy aims to position the party as the true patriots in contrast to figures like Nigel Farage, whom they have dubbed a "plastic patriot."</p>

The defense claims these actions, along with a highly publicized "perp walk," have violated Mangione's constitutional rights and tainted the legal proceedings. This move comes after a state judge recently threw out terrorism charges against Mangione, though he still faces murder charges in both state and federal court.</p>

          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a significant red flag in a romantic relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem over time. In her book "Love by Design," she explains that disrespect can manifest in various ways, from small acts like one partner consistently walking ahead of the other to larger issues like devaluing a partner's priorities or identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that respect is a fundamental ingredient for a lasting relationship, as people enter partnerships to feel seen and valued. She advises addressing these behaviors directly to see if change is possible.</p>

          <p>Top Democratic leaders Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries have formally requested a meeting with President Trump to negotiate a solution to avoid a government shutdown. With a funding deadline of September 30 approaching, both parties are blaming each other for the impasse. A short-term Republican spending bill passed the House but failed in the Senate, as did a competing Democratic bill. In their letter, Schumer and Jeffries accused GOP leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan talks, stating that Republicans will bear responsibility for a shutdown if one occurs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois that their refusal to cooperate with federal immigration detainers could lead to lawsuits and funding cuts. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding the states comply with requests to hold undocumented immigrants for federal custody, a practice these states have limited through legislation. The states argue that detainers are requests, not mandates, and that compliance could lead to legal liability and erode trust with local communities. The Trump administration contends these policies release dangerous individuals and obstruct federal enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly used its "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of special powers granted to the White House following the company's acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. The national-security agreement tied to the takeover gives the government veto power over strategic decisions like plant closures. After an intervention from the Commerce Secretary, U.S. Steel reversed its decision and confirmed the facility will remain operational. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese research institute claims to have developed a sophisticated AI-driven system capable of detecting even the stealthiest submarines with 95% accuracy in simulations. The technology reportedly synthesizes data from multiple sources, such as sonar buoys and water temperature, to create a real-time underwater map and provide simple action points for military personnel. While the development could potentially challenge existing naval strategies and the nuclear triad, some Western military experts express skepticism. They note that while AI can enhance submarine hunting, the complexity of the underwater environment and the ongoing arms race in naval technology make implementation difficult.</p>

A recent home defeat to Crystal Palace has intensified scrutiny on Potter, whose team has won just six of the 25 matches since he took charge in January. Sources indicate that the club has already begun identifying potential replacements, including Nuno Espirito Santo and Gary O'Neil, with a short-term return for former manager Slaven Bilic also being discussed. Despite the uncertainty, Potter stated after the latest loss that he believes he still has the support of the club's board.</p>

The memo from the recently renamed Department of War also limits journalists' movements within the building, requiring escorts in most areas.
