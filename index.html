          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK includes high-level talks and royal pageantry. After spending time with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, Trump is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at his country estate, Chequers. The visit, which is unusual for a second-term president, also coincides with the announcement of £150 billion in new U.S. investment in the UK, although it has drawn protests in London and Windsor. The agenda covers diplomatic meetings, a business reception, and a joint news conference before the Trumps return to the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks employees in Illinois, Colorado, and California have initiated legal action against the company, alleging its new dress code violates state laws. The lawsuits claim that the stricter policy, which requires specific solid black shirts and other attire, forces workers to incur personal expenses without reimbursement. While Starbucks states it provided two free shirts to employees, workers argue the cost of a new wardrobe is a significant burden. The legal challenges, supported by the Starbucks Workers United union, seek damages and highlight ongoing labor tensions at the coffee chain.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported that its once-daily oral version of semaglutide, known as the "Wegovy pill," demonstrated significant weight loss in a late-stage trial. The results showed an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks, comparable to its popular Wegovy injection, with a similar safety profile. This development positions the company to offer patients a choice between an injectable and a tablet, potentially increasing accessibility for those averse to needles. The pill is currently under review by the U.S. FDA, with a decision expected later this year amid growing competition in the oral obesity drug market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced its intention to appeal a High Court decision that blocked the deportation of an Eritrean migrant to France. The deportation was part of a "one in, one out" agreement between the two countries aimed at curbing small boat crossings. The man's removal was halted after he made a last-minute claim of being a victim of modern slavery, a move Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood described as an attempt to frustrate the system. The legal challenge raises questions about the viability of the new deportation scheme, which is a key policy for the current government.</p>

          <p>During a regional security conference, China's defense minister, Dong Jun, issued a strong warning against what he termed Western "bullying" and hegemonic actions. Without naming specific countries, he criticized military alliances as exclusive groups serving selfish interests and urged regional nations to cooperate in defending the post-war international order. His remarks, which appeared to be a veiled critique of the United States and its allies, were reportedly met with agreement from some Southeast Asian defense chiefs.

          <p>A recent study on public sentiment in Germany reveals that the rising cost of living is the primary fear among its citizens for the 15th time. Despite a slight decrease in overall anxiety compared to previous crisis years, concerns about inflation, housing affordability, and potential tax increases remain high. The survey also highlighted worries about the influx of refugees and growing dissatisfaction with the country's political leadership. Interestingly, fears related to climate change and societal division have lessened, suggesting a normalization of crisis and conflict in the public consciousness.</p>

          <p>The independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve is under increasing pressure from the Trump administration, raising concerns about political interference in monetary policy. President Trump has openly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and has successfully appointed a White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, to the Fed's board of governors. In his first vote, Miran dissented in favor of a larger interest rate cut, aligning with the president's public demands. This dynamic, coupled with Trump's efforts to remove another governor, is testing the central bank's long-standing tradition of operating free from short-term political interests.

The national beef cattle herd is at its smallest size in 75 years, a result of past droughts and high operational costs that discourage ranchers from expanding. While ranchers are currently seeing high profits, restaurants and grocery stores are passing the increased costs on to consumers. Recent data suggests that shoppers are finally beginning to resist the high prices, with spending on ground beef plateauing for the first time in years. (not investment advice)</p>

The move, supported by the state's Republican governor but not the city's Democratic mayor, is raising concerns among legal experts about the normalization of using military forces for domestic law enforcement. While the White House cites the need to restore public safety, critics argue that National Guard troops are not trained for community policing and that such deployments test the limits of presidential power. The action is part of a broader pattern of federal intervention in cities, particularly those led by Democrats.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, state-run media and influencers from Russia, China, and Iran have attempted to exploit the event to sow division and push their own narratives. According to disinformation experts, these campaigns have blamed Ukraine or Israel for the killing or used it to portray the U.S. as unstable. However, analysis suggests these foreign efforts have gained little traction among American audiences, as the domestic discourse surrounding the event is already highly polarized and dominant. Experts warn that while foreign influence was minimal in this case, the U.S. is less equipped than before to monitor such campaigns due to the dismantling of relevant government task forces.</p>

          <p>The motive behind the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk appears more complex than a simple political disagreement, with evidence pointing to the suspect's deep immersion in online and gaming culture. Prosecutors suggest 22-year-old Tyler Robinson was angered by Kirk's anti-trans rhetoric, but engravings on the bullet casings contained obscure internet memes and video game references. Researchers of online extremism argue this indicates a "performative" act of violence, designed to generate discourse and emulate other high-profile shooters, rather than signal a coherent political ideology. The FBI's investigation is ongoing, trying to decipher the mix of personal grievance and online cultural signals.</p>

          <p>A former high-ranking Chinese military official, Lieutenant General He Lei, has stated that mainland China would not need its most advanced weaponry to take control of Taiwan by force. He asserted that the People's Liberation Army's conventional weapons would be sufficient if a "non-peaceful" resolution became necessary. The retired general emphasized the PLA's focus on joint operations and overall combat capabilities rather than one-to-one weapon matchups. His comments serve as another stark reminder of Beijing's readiness to use military force to achieve its goal of unification with Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has announced a new generation of AI computing systems powered by its homegrown Ascend chips, directly challenging U.S. competitor Nvidia. The company plans to launch its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, which will group over 500,000 chips to achieve massive computing power. This strategy allows Huawei to overcome U.S. sanctions that restrict its access to the most advanced single semiconductors by networking large quantities of its own less-advanced chips. Huawei claims its new systems will surpass Nvidia's forthcoming products in computing power, highlighting China's push for self-reliance in critical technologies.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, journalist Emma Brockes reflects on the changing political landscape in Britain, drawing parallels between the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party and the MAGA movement in the United States. Writing as someone who moved from the U.S. to the UK, she notes the shocking speed at which a similar brand of right-wing populism has gained traction. The article, framed by President Trump's current state visit, explores how both movements have harnessed public anger and disappointment with the political establishment. It questions whether Britain, once seen as a refuge from Trump-style politics, is now heading down a similar path.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Delaware have successfully created a synthetic version of a molecule found in guava plants that has shown potential in fighting liver cancer. The natural compound, present in the fruit's leaves and bark, possesses anti-cancer properties, but sourcing it from the plant is not scalable for medical treatments. By developing a "recipe" to replicate the molecule from widely available chemicals, the scientists have paved the way for further research and the potential development of new, more effective cancer therapies. The team is now collaborating with the National Cancer Institute to explore the molecule's effectiveness against other types of cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Germany's IW economic institute reveals that the United States has become more dependent on imports from the European Union than from China. The EU surpassed China both in the total value of imports and in the number of product categories where it is the dominant supplier. U.S. dependence on the EU has grown significantly over the last 15 years, while its reliance on China has decreased, indicating a de-risking process. The findings suggest the EU may have more leverage in trade negotiations with Washington than is commonly assumed, as many of these European goods would be difficult for the U.S. to replace in the short term.</p>

Mas'ud's defense is asking a U.S. federal court to suppress this alleged confession as evidence in his upcoming trial.
