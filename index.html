        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 23-year-old man, Anthony Thomas Reyes, was apprehended by the Secret Service and Palm Beach Police after attempting to scale the wall at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Reyes reportedly told law enforcement he intended to "spread the gospel" to Trump and marry his teenage granddaughter, Kai. This incident marks Reyes's second attempt to illegally enter Mar-a-Lago, having been previously arrested for trespassing during the New Year's holiday. He was initially held on a $1,000 bond, which was subsequently raised to $50,000, and federal charges may follow, although Trump was in Washington, D.C., at the time of the incident. The article details the Secret Service's response and previous trespassing incidents at Mar-a-Lago. </p>

          <p>An elderly man, Bhim Kohli, who was racially abused before being fatally attacked, had reported a racist incident to police weeks prior. Kohli witnessed an assault on another Asian man near his home in Leicestershire, where two boys racially abused the man and threw a rock at him. Prior to Kohli's death, the girl convicted of his manslaughter was present while other children threw apples at him. The BBC learned that in July, Kohli had stones thrown at him, was spat at, and racially abused by a group of children after he told them to get off his neighbor's garage roof. The victim of the August assault reported feeling unsafe and expressed concern for his elderly parents, who also live in the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from right-wing figures, despite being a conservative appointee of President Trump. The criticism stems from several votes where she sided with liberal justices or Chief Justice John Roberts, including cases involving foreign aid, sentencing delays, and Venezuelan detainees. Some Trump allies, like Laura Loomer, have accused Trump of elevating Barrett as a "DEI Hire," while others, like Steve Bannon, have criticized her perceived expressions towards Trump. Despite the criticism, Trump has publicly defended Barrett, though sources indicate he has privately expressed frustration with his Supreme Court picks, feeling they could be more supportive of his agenda. </p>

The removal followed an incident where William Shaheen was flagged because his travel companion was listed by the FBI as a "known or suspected terrorist". A spokesperson for Senator Shaheen stated she contacted TSA after her husband was subjected to extensive searches and was unaware of the preferential treatment. </p>

          <p>An innovative "ice battery" system is being used to cool buildings and lower energy costs, with the Eleven Madison skyscraper in Manhattan utilizing this technology. The system freezes water at night when electricity costs are low, and then uses the ice to cool the building during the day, potentially reducing cooling costs by up to 40%. This approach addresses the issue of peak energy demand during hot days, when air conditioning significantly strains the power grid. Scientists are also exploring new materials that require less energy to store coolness, aiming to make the system more efficient and accessible for residential use.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has introduced the Strong Borders Act, a bill aimed at curbing organized crime and enhancing the integrity of the immigration system. The bill proposes restrictions on asylum claims, potentially barring those in Canada for over a year from filing. The legislation would also give police more power to monitor the US border and expand the government's ability to open mail in criminal investigations. Critics argue that the bill infringes on civil liberties and reflects increasing pressure to restrict immigration amid strained public services and a housing crisis.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old Mexican girl has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the U.S. and continue receiving life-saving medical care. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security granted the girl and her mother humanitarian parole for one year, reversing an earlier decision to revoke their status. The girl has been receiving treatment for short bowel syndrome since arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023. The treatment, which is unavailable in Mexico, requires 14 hours a day of intravenous nutrition.</p>
