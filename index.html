        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critically examines Ruben Amorim's tactical approach at Manchester United, following their recent Carabao Cup loss. It highlights the team's difficulty in translating his positional 5-2-3 system, which relies on overloads and specific passing patterns, into consistent success on the pitch. The analysis points out that the rigid system struggles against man-to-man marking and limits individual expression, while also noting midfield vulnerabilities. The article suggests Amorim's game model may require adaptation for the Premier League's higher standard, despite its success with Sporting's superior players.</p>

          <p>North Korea has significantly increased its imports of Chinese wine, becoming the second-largest buyer by volume in the first seven months of 2025. This surge, more than double the previous year's volume, highlights North Korea's reliance on China for alcoholic beverages due to its isolated status and international sanctions. While the United Nations bans luxury goods, alcohol is not included in the restrictions, allowing this trade to flourish. The article indicates a growing trend in North Korean consumption of Chinese wine, reflecting unique trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Three individuals have died in eastern Indonesia after protesters set fire to a council building amidst nationwide demonstrations. These protests were sparked by the death of Affan Kurniawan, a 21-year-old ride-sharing driver run over by a police vehicle during earlier wage-related demonstrations in Jakarta. The unrest, involving violent clashes and tear gas, presents a significant challenge for President Prabowo Subianto, who has offered condolences and promised a thorough investigation. Police have also arrested officers and issued apologies, as thousands attended Kurniawan's funeral, demanding justice.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men aged 18-22 to leave the country freely, aiming to provide educational and employment opportunities abroad for future national development. Previously, men 18-60 were restricted from leaving due to conscription concerns, though the draft primarily targeted those 25 and older. While the government hopes this will encourage young Ukrainians to maintain ties and eventually return, some demographers fear it will lead to further emigration, exacerbating existing demographic challenges. This policy shift reflects a complex balance between wartime needs and long-term national growth.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic, at 38, defeated Cameron Norrie in a challenging four-set match to reach the US Open fourth round, becoming the oldest man to do so since 1991. The 24-time Grand Slam champion, who also tied Roger Federer's record for most major fourth-round appearances, struggled with a lower back injury during the match, requiring a medical timeout. Despite these physical issues and a six-week absence from the tour, Djokovic showcased his resilience and strong serving to overcome Norrie, expressing hope that his performance indicates he can still compete at the highest level.</p>

This defeat snapped their four-game winning streak, highlighting persistent offensive struggles despite entering a seemingly easier part of their schedule.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump earlier this year are not legally permissible, exceeding his power under federal economic emergency laws. The ruling, while not immediately blocking the tariffs, is a significant blow to Trump's trade strategy. The court stated that the right to levy tariffs is a "core Congressional power" and that the IEEPA statute does not grant the president unlimited authority for such actions. The Trump administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Borges, the Chief Data Officer at the Social Security Administration (SSA), has resigned, citing "constructive discharge" days after filing a whistleblower complaint. He alleged that Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees uploaded the entire country's Social Security information to a "vulnerable cloud environment." The SSA refuted the claim, stating the data was "walled off" from the internet and not compromised. Borges claims he faced retaliation for raising concerns internally, describing a hostile work environment and a culture of fear under new leadership.</p>

Many fires occur in "Range Danger Areas," where unexploded ordnance from past training, including World War II, hinders firefighting efforts. Locals express concerns about pollution and environmental impact, urging the MoD to restrict live fire training during dry months and clear old munitions.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. The unanimous panel upheld a lower court ruling, finding the administration likely overstepped its authority. The court emphasized TPS was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This decision offers a reprieve for many Venezuelans, though the Department of Homeland Security plans to appeal, condemning the ruling as "obstruction from unelected activist judges."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has cut $4.9 billion in congressionally-approved foreign aid funding, announcing he would "put AMERICA FIRST!" This was achieved through a "pocket rescission," a rarely used procedure that bypasses Congress by letting funds expire before lawmakers can act. The move, primarily impacting USAID projects, has drawn strong opposition from Democrats and some Republicans, who deem it illegal and a potential catalyst for a federal shutdown. Critics argue this action undermines Congress's power of the purse and global humanitarian efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New investigations by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation suggest that former McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser, a figure immortalized by the "Walking Tall" movie, killed his wife Pauline in 1967. Authorities found inconsistencies in Pusser's original account, concluding Pauline was likely shot outside the car and placed inside, and that Pusser's own injury was self-inflicted. Evidence also points to Pauline being a victim of domestic violence. This finding challenges a long-held narrative, providing closure for Pauline's family and ensuring truth prevails even decades later.</p>
