          <p>Charlie Javice, founder of the fintech startup Frank, has been sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. The bank acquired Frank in 2021 for $175 million based on Javice's false claims of having millions of customers, when in reality there were fewer than 300,000. Javice expressed remorse in court, while prosecutors highlighted the crime's greed-driven nature, contrasting it with the Theranos fraud case. The incident proved embarrassing for JPMorgan, which failed to verify customer numbers before the acquisition.</p>

          <p>Mayor Eric Adams' decision to suspend his re-election campaign has intensified the New York City mayoral race, now framed as a two-person contest between Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, the leading Democratic candidate, criticized Cuomo's 'record of disgrace,' particularly regarding past cuts to a rental assistance program. Cuomo's campaign accused Mamdani of lying and avoiding his own controversial stances. The shift has prompted Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to remain in the race, while Donald Trump also weighed in, criticizing Mamdani's 'communist' promises.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has strengthened to a powerful Category 4 storm, with its center located southwest of Bermuda, moving northwest. Forecasters predict it will bring dangerous surf and life-threatening rip current conditions to much of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Bermuda, where tropical storm conditions are possible by Tuesday. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, with gradual weakening expected after Tuesday.</p>

Today, lyrical 'rap battles' between Famo musicians escalate into real-world violence and turf wars, leading Lesotho's government to ban some groups and prohibit media reporting.

          <p>Individuals aged 55 can generally purchase annuities, which are insurance contracts providing guaranteed income streams, offering a flexible option for retirement planning. Most at this age opt for deferred annuities, allowing for tax-deferred growth before income payments begin, potentially securing better rates due to a longer investment horizon. However, annuities are illiquid, often carrying surrender penalties for early withdrawals, which could limit financial flexibility for unexpected expenses.

This is not the first time Trump has floated such a measure, which has been met with skepticism and no clear details on implementation. California Governor Gavin Newsom responded by highlighting the state's efforts to boost its film and TV tax credit program, contrasting it with Trump's tariff idea. Congressional representatives from California also voiced support for a federal film tax incentive, warning that tariffs could have damaging consequences and increase consumer costs.</p>

The suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, drove his vehicle into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, opened fire, and then set the building ablaze, killing four and injuring eight before being shot dead by police. Over 100 victims and witnesses have been interviewed, and multiple state and federal agencies are assisting the investigation to determine a motive.

          <p>America's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is sinking deeper into debt, facing over $22.5 billion in liabilities after a year of devastating floods. The program, which is often the only affordable option for homeowners in flood-prone areas, is constrained by congressional mandates to provide widespread access and keep rates affordable, making it fiscally unsustainable. Critics argue NFIP creates a moral hazard, encouraging people to remain in high-risk zones, and that its flood maps are outdated, failing to account for climate change. Efforts to reform the system, like Risk Rating 2.0, have led to higher premiums and dropped coverage, leaving many uninsured.</p>

          <p>Medicare Advantage enrollment is projected to fall for the first time in nearly two decades in 2026, with an estimated 34 million seniors, down from 35 million this year. This decline is attributed to health insurers cutting back on unprofitable plans and exiting some markets due to higher-than-expected medical costs and new regulations. While the average monthly premium is forecast to decrease, many large insurer plans may see higher prices, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums. Seniors are advised to carefully shop around during open enrollment, as many plans are being decommissioned or have reduced broker commissions. (not investment advice)</p>
