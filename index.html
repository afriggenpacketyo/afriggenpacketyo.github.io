        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article explores the alarming rate of suicide among police officers, which exceeds deaths in the line of duty, focusing on the story of Matthew Hunter, a Des Moines officer who spiraled after his best friend and fellow officer, Joe Morgan, died by suicide. The article delves into the culture of silence surrounding mental health within law enforcement, the cumulative impact of trauma, and the challenges officers face in seeking help. It also examines the legislative efforts to recognize suicide as a line-of-duty death, enabling families to receive benefits, and the struggle to change perceptions within police departments. Hunter's personal journey of grief, PTSD, and eventual termination underscores the urgent need for better mental health support for those who serve.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first deal since the implementation of 'reciprocal' tariffs. The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on UK imports but adjusts tariffs on UK autos, allowing 100,000 vehicles to be imported annually at a 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing a 25% rate. The deal also aims to create new export opportunities for U.S. farmers and streamline customs procedures. Some experts downplayed the deal's impact, noting that this approach may not be replicable with countries having larger trade surpluses with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a growing rebellion from Labour MPs regarding proposed welfare cuts aimed at saving £5 billion annually by 2030. Forty-two MPs expressed concerns about the cuts' impact on disabled individuals and their families, urging a delay until assessments on employment and health are published. The MPs argue that the cuts represent a significant attack on the welfare state, affecting millions of disadvantaged people. The debate occurs ahead of a vote on legislation implementing the cuts next month, with some MPs considering abstaining or making themselves scarce during the vote.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that economists are adjusting their forecasts for interest rate cuts due to President Trump’s tariffs, which raise concerns about inflation and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need to assess the impact of trade policies before making any decisions on interest rates. Economists now anticipate the Fed to potentially restart rate cuts in September, with some even suggesting a later start date or a larger-than-usual cut to bolster the economy. The article also mentions Trump's criticism of Powell and the administration's efforts to finalize trade deals and tax cuts.</p>

          <p>U.S. intelligence agencies have increased their focus on Greenland following President Trump’s interest in acquiring the island and Vice President Vance’s visit to a U.S. military base there. This increased scrutiny has led to a growing number of intelligence reports about Greenland being circulated within the executive branch and Congress. Some reports focus on Russian and Chinese interests in the island, which holds strategic importance in the Arctic Circle and possesses significant rare earth mineral deposits. The intelligence work primarily relies on open-source information, with no major reallocation of intelligence assets anticipated.</p>

          <p>Olympic champion Sue Bird has been named the managing director of the U.S. women’s basketball national team, marking a significant shift in how the organization selects its roster and coaching staff. Bird will be responsible for assembling the team, similar to the role held by Grant Hill on the men's side. Her term will last four years, aligning with the Olympic cycle, and the change aims to provide a long-term vision for the program. Before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the Americans will participate in the FIBA World Cup in Germany next year, with the first qualifying event in November.</p>

This announcement comes after Governor Brian Kemp declined to run. Carter's campaign is expected to focus on his support for President Trump and cultural issues, positioning himself as a "MAGA warrior" against Ossoff. Ossoff, who unseated a Republican in 2021, faces a tough re-election in a state that has recently leaned Republican, making this race a key target for the GOP.</p>

Despite this increase, Gates noted that philanthropy cannot compensate for the multibillion-dollar cuts in foreign aid by wealthy countries.

Programs dedicated to injury prevention, sexual health, and workplace hazard reduction have been decimated or eliminated.

          <p>A House of Lords committee heard that home working has led to a bigger decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside London. Urban economist Paul Swinney stated that while pub spending data suggests post-work drinks have shifted from Friday to Thursday in London, this trend is not seen in other large British cities. Spending in bars outside London is more likely to shift into the weekend, and the decline in city-center spending has not been matched by an increase for high streets outside urban centers. The data shows that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay argues that the United States has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where the cost of opposing the government has risen markedly. The authors assert that the Trump administration has weaponized government agencies and taken punitive actions against critics, raising the cost of opposition for a wide range of Americans. This includes investigations, lawsuits, tax audits, and threats against individuals and organizations that challenge the administration's policies. The authors argue that a collective defense of democracy is essential to reverse this trend.</p>
