          <p>Sean Combs' ex-girlfriend, identified as Jane in court, testified about her emotional reaction to Cassie's 2023 lawsuit against Combs. Jane stated she cried for three days after reading the lawsuit, which detailed allegations of drug-fueled sexual encounters, because it mirrored her own experiences with Combs. She read a text message she sent to Combs expressing her distress and feeling as though she was reliving her own trauma. The article highlights the impact of Cassie's lawsuit on others who claim to have experienced similar situations with Combs, as Jane's testimony supports the claims made in the lawsuit and provides additional context to the allegations against Combs.

          <p>President Trump said he would support arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. This statement came as Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a lawsuit against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for deploying the National Guard to address protests related to immigration enforcement actions. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Trump's decision to federalize the California National Guard without the governor's request, which they argue is an abuse of presidential authority. The article highlights the escalating conflict between the Trump administration and California officials regarding immigration enforcement and the use of federal resources, as well as the legal and political ramifications of these actions. The situation underscores the deep divisions between the federal government and state governments on immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond announced that the state will retry Richard Glossip for the 1997 murder of Barry Van Treese, but will not seek the death penalty. This decision follows the Supreme Court's granting of a new trial due to violations of Glossip's due process rights. Drummond stated that the prosecution will instead seek a life sentence, as Justin Sneed, who confessed to the murder and implicated Glossip, is already serving a life sentence without parole. The case has drawn significant attention due to concerns about prosecutorial misconduct and the reliability of Sneed's testimony, which were key factors in the Supreme Court's decision. The article underscores the complexities and ethical considerations in capital punishment cases, especially when questions of fairness and evidence arise.</p>
