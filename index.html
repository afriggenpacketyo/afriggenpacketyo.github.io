          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 104 deaths, with a significant number of victims being children and counselors at summer camps along the Guadalupe River. Camp Mystic, a girls' camp in Kerr County, suffered numerous fatalities, and search and rescue operations are ongoing for several missing individuals. The disaster has sparked a political debate, with Senator Ted Cruz defending the response timeline and the White House pushing back against claims that federal budget cuts to weather services played a role. The National Weather Service maintains that adequate warnings were issued hours before the flooding occurred.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed the implementation of widespread tariff increases but has issued new warnings to 14 countries, setting an August 1 deadline for new rates. Japan and South Korea face a potential 25% tariff, while other nations like Thailand, South Africa, and Indonesia have been notified of levies ranging from 25% to 40%. President Trump indicated the new deadline is firm but left the door open for negotiations, a move some economists see as a tactic to leverage trade talks. The policy aims to protect American industries, but critics warn it could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility more than three weeks after a violent home invasion. Hoffman was shot nine times, and his wife, Yvette, was shot eight times while reportedly shielding their daughter. The attack is believed to be part of a series of politically motivated shootings that also resulted in the deaths of state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband. The alleged perpetrator, Vance Boelter, is in custody facing multiple federal and state charges, including murder, and could face the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes. According to an internal memo, the change is being rolled out at major airports and is expected to be implemented nationwide soon, aiming to speed up the screening process. This shift brings the general security line policy in line with the existing rules for TSA PreCheck members. Passengers who trigger alarms at security scanners will still be required to remove their footwear for additional inspection. The original mandate was established in 2006, years after the attempted 'shoe bomber' incident.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking gene therapy has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with some participants regaining significant hearing within weeks of a single injection. The study, published in Nature Medicine, focused on individuals with hearing loss caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene. Researchers delivered a healthy copy of the gene into the inner ear, which restored the production of a key protein for transmitting sound signals to the brain. The treatment proved safe and effective, particularly in children, with one seven-year-old girl recovering nearly all of her hearing, offering hope for future genetic deafness treatments.</p>

The study identifies driver distraction as a major contributor, with a majority of drivers admitting to using phones or programming GPS while in parking lots.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to permanently amend its rules to protect tenants from 'renovictions,' where landlords evict renters under the guise of substantial remodels to bring in new tenants at higher rents. The new ordinance will prevent landlords from using renovations as a 'just cause' for eviction unless they have an official order from a government agency citing housing code violations. The city is also developing rules to ensure landlords provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for displaced tenants during legitimate, necessary remodels. This move aims to close a loophole that tenant rights groups say has been widely exploited.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic Texas floods that killed over 100 people were caused by a confluence of geographical and meteorological factors that created a '100-year flood' event. The region's dry, packed soil and steep topography are naturally prone to rapid runoff, and this was exacerbated by a slow-moving weather system carrying immense moisture from a tropical system in the Gulf. This combination resulted in the Guadalupe River rising an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night.

          <p>Following the recovery of seven bodies from an exploded fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, families and community members have begun to identify the victims. Among the deceased are brothers Jesus and Jhony Ramos, and their stepbrother Joel “Junior” Melendez. Jesus Ramos, an expectant father, was reportedly working his first day on the job when the deadly blast occurred. The warehouse, managed by Devastating Pyrotechnics, was the site of a massive explosion and subsequent fire last week. Grieving families are now seeking answers and justice as authorities continue their investigation into the unpermitted operation.</p>

          <p>This commentary article argues that the Trump administration's priorities, as reflected in recent actions and its new budget bill, are dangerously misplaced. The author criticizes the focus on immigration enforcement, such as the deployment of federal agents to Los Angeles's MacArthur Park, as political theater that terrorizes communities. This is contrasted with significant budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health and weather forecasting agencies like NOAA, even as the nation faces growing threats from pandemics and climate-driven disasters. The author contends that these policies reflect a denial of scientific reality in favor of a fear-mongering political agenda.</p>

          <p>The remnants of Tropical Depression Chantal caused severe flash flooding in North Carolina, leading to the death of an 83-year-old woman whose vehicle was swept away in high water. The storm system prompted dozens of water rescues and voluntary evacuations across several counties, with some areas experiencing near-record river crests. In Chapel Hill, residents were trapped in their apartments by rising floodwaters, and businesses suffered significant damage. The storm system is now moving northeast over Virginia and is expected to continue bringing heavy rainfall to the Mid-Atlantic region, with flood watches in effect for multiple states.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned its controversial plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force (RIF) that could have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in August. The VA now states that a department-wide RIF is 'off the table,' as hiring freezes, retirements, and normal attrition are on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year. The initial plan, which aimed to cut staffing to 2019 levels, had drawn sharp criticism. While the VA secretary framed the change as a result of improved efficiency, critics argue it reflects an unsustainable rate of employee departures.</p>

          <p>Beijing has activated a new civilian flight path, W121, which runs close to the median line of the Taiwan Strait, a move made without consulting Taipei that has raised alarms in Taiwan. This is the last of three branches off the main M503 route established in 2015. At its nearest point, the route is just 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial maritime boundary. China's Civil Aviation Administration stated the adjustment is a technical measure to ease air traffic congestion. However, Taipei views the unilateral action as a potential security risk and a further erosion of the tacit agreements governing the sensitive airspace.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has officially concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. The review also found no evidence of a so-called 'client list' or any credible proof that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals, debunking widespread conspiracy theories. While confirming that Epstein victimized over 1,000 individuals, investigators stated they found no basis for pursuing charges against uncharged third parties. The findings were released in a memo, with the White House stating it is committed to transparency but will not release graphic material.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to the All-Star team for the 11th time in his career, this time as a 'Legend Pick' by the MLB Commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his career accomplishments, came as a complete surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery. While acknowledging he didn't 'deserve' the selection based on his 2025 performance, Kershaw called it a 'tremendous honor' and expressed gratitude for the recognition.

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on purchase of 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, a decision influenced by the changing realities of the modern battlefield. A South Korean lawmaker cited the vulnerability of traditional helicopters to advanced air defenses and low-cost drones, as demonstrated in the war in Ukraine, as a key reason for the cancellation. The funds will instead be redirected toward investing in more modern capabilities like drones and smart systems. The move reflects a global debate about the survivability and cost-effectiveness of attack helicopters in an era of proliferating threats. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision comes as a relief to participants, but the mayor and organizers still face potential investigation. The event drew a record crowd in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.</p>

          <p>The chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales has issued a stark warning that an overwhelming influx of smuggled drugs is destabilizing the prison system and undermining rehabilitation efforts. A new annual report highlights how criminal gangs use drones and other methods to supply contraband to inmates, fueling criminality inside prisons. The report links the problem to overcrowding and staffing shortages, which leave prisoners with little purposeful activity, leading them to use drugs out of boredom. The watchdog called the failure to control the drug trade a serious issue that needs to be addressed at the highest levels of government.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a key provision of the recently signed 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which sought to bar federal Medicaid funds from going to organizations that provide abortion services. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit arguing the provision unconstitutionally singled them out to penalize them for legally providing abortion care. The group, which serves over a million Medicaid patients, warned that losing this funding would have devastating effects on their ability to provide non-abortion health services.</p>
