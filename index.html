          <p>DeFi Development, a company focused on accumulating Solana, is launching a global franchise model named the DFDV Treasury Accelerator. This initiative allows international partners to operate their own Solana treasuries with support from DeFi Development, which in turn receives an equity stake. The strategy, backed by investors like Pantera Capital, evolves the MicroStrategy playbook by combining validator infrastructure and capital markets innovation. The company aims to reach one SOL token per share by 2028, reflecting a growing trend of firms adopting crypto treasury strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man was killed and fourteen others, including a seven-year-old, were injured after a lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey. The incident occurred during a children's competition, with witnesses describing the earth exploding without prior warning of a storm. The deceased, 61-year-old Robert Montgomery, was a volunteer club member who was attempting to help children at the event. This marks the third serious lightning-related incident in the Tri-State Area in the past month, a rare occurrence despite the low odds.</p>

          <p>An apparent Israeli military raid on the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza City has resulted in the deaths of two people and multiple injuries, including the parish priest. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem confirmed the casualties, condemning the targeting of innocent civilians, a sentiment echoed by Pope Leo XIV and Italy's Prime Minister. The church was sheltering hundreds of displaced individuals, including both Christians and Muslims. The Israel Defense Forces stated it is reviewing the circumstances of the incident and regrets any harm caused to civilians or religious sites.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a rescissions package cutting $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, primarily targeting foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The bill, a priority for the Trump administration's spending reduction efforts, passed on a narrow 51-48 vote. An amendment to preserve funding for the PEPFAR HIV/Aids program was successful, but efforts to protect other aid and public media funds failed. The legislation now returns to the House of Representatives for a final vote, where its passage is uncertain due to the changes made. (not investment advice)</p>

While the exact dates of the PLA exercises were not specified, their announcement aligns with increased military activity monitored by Taipei.

          <p>A fact-check by DW has determined that claims circulating on social media that sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer are false. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this association. The rising incidence of skin cancer globally is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and the historical use of less effective sunscreens, not the use of modern protective products. While countries like Australia and the U.S. have high skin cancer rates and sunscreen sales, experts state there is no valid data directly linking sunscreen use to a higher prevalence of the disease.</p>

Scientists recommend a multi-faceted approach to combat this, including creating physical distance from the phone, reducing notifications, and using self-control apps. Therapies like CBT and mindfulness, along with replacing screen time with exercise or nature, are also proven effective in addressing the root causes of the addiction.</p>

The President believes this policy is harming the economy, while the Fed remains cautious due to the potential inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. Although a Supreme Court ruling protects the Fed's unique structure, legal experts note the President could potentially fire Powell with a legitimate cause. However, the public pressure itself is seen as already damaging the Federal Reserve's traditional independence from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare in Britain has climbed to £1,076 per child, with some regions seeing price hikes of up to 13% from last year. According to the charity Coram, the increase is driven by high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run programs. Many working families struggle with these costs, especially since Universal Credit childcare benefits are paid in arrears, requiring significant upfront payments. The lack of sufficient places, particularly for older children and those with special needs, further exacerbates the financial strain on parents.</p>

This mid-decade redistricting is a risky strategy, as it would require spreading Republican voters more thinly, potentially making their existing districts more competitive. Critics argue the move would further dilute the voting power of non-white communities, which accounted for 95% of the state's recent population growth, and likely face legal challenges for racial discrimination. The justification for the special session has also been questioned, as it contradicts previous sworn testimony from state officials.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Supreme Court Justices Use Dissents to Signal a Crisis of Legitimacy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the dissenting opinions from the Supreme Court's liberal justices—Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—are increasingly signaling that the conservative majority is no longer bound by traditional legal rules. Their dissents highlight the majority's allegedly shoddy reasoning, complicity in wrongdoing, and disregard for real-world consequences. By doing so, the liberal wing is not just disagreeing on legal interpretation but screaming that the fundamental game of constitutional law has changed. These writings serve as a warning to the public about a court they see as unbound by precedent and law.</p>

          <p>Despite an appearance of strength abroad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is unraveling domestically and now operates as a de facto minority in parliament. His coalition has fractured over two key issues: military draft exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox community and the pursuit of a cease-fire deal in Gaza. Both policies are opposed by his key far-right and ultra-Orthodox partners, respectively, whose support is essential for his political survival. With his government unable to legislate and new elections likely, Netanyahu is playing for time, hoping to navigate the parliamentary recess to find a solution.</p>

          <p>An article from Vox analyzes the resurgence of foldable smartphones, like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Flip series, as a meaningful evolution in a stagnant hardware market. While early models were flawed, the latest iterations are becoming appealing alternatives to the standard smartphone slab. These devices offer adaptability, with smaller outer screens for quick tasks and larger inner screens for immersive use, evoking nostalgia for the more compact flip phones of the past. This innovation suggests the smartphone will remain a central gadget for the foreseeable future, bridging the gap before potential replacements like AR glasses become mainstream.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, identified as the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, has sold for a record $5.3 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The rock, known as NWA 16788, was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 and is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, and this specimen is 70% larger than any other known fragment on Earth.

          <p>An analysis explains that despite widespread public and political calls to "release the Epstein Files," a full disclosure is highly improbable due to long-standing Department of Justice policy. This policy generally prevents the release of closed investigative files to protect individuals who were not charged with a crime. Attorney General Pam Bondi's contradictory statements on the matter have fueled confusion and conspiracy theories. The recent DOJ memo stating there is no "client list" and that the case is closed suggests the administration is reverting to this policy, leaving public demands for transparency unsatisfied.</p>

The backlash from his supporters stems from the administration's announcement that no "client list" exists, which contradicted earlier statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi.

          <p>An analysis from Vox suggests that the Trump administration's Department of Justice is shifting its focus away from prosecuting white-collar and corporate crime, unless it involves political opponents or fits a specific narrative. Since Trump took office, federal prosecutions of white-collar crime have declined, and the administration has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This approach, combined with high-profile pardons for financial fraudsters, signals a more business-friendly and less punitive stance on corporate corruption. Critics worry this creates an environment where such crimes are implicitly tolerated, especially for those allied with the administration.</p>
