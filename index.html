          <p>Li Licheng, an 84-year-old power grid engineering expert and academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, has signed a contract with Beijing Interstellor Human Spaceflight Technology to book a seat on a space tourism voyage scheduled for 2028. Li, a leading figure in China's electricity industry, plans to make three space trips, one per year, stating that he will only be 89 years old after the third trip. This event challenges the conventional perception of age limitations for space travel and highlights China's growing ambitions in commercial spaceflight. </p>

          <p>China has refuted Japan's assertion that a Chinese coast guard helicopter violated its airspace near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Instead, China alleges that a Japanese civilian aircraft intruded into the airspace, prompting a protest from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Japan, however, maintains its claim that the Chinese helicopter entered its airspace, leading to a strong demand for preventive measures. This incident underscores the ongoing territorial dispute between China and Japan over the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan but claimed by China, further straining relations between the two countries. </p>

          <p>This poem, titled "Good Lord, These Muscadines," reflects on the complexities of intimacy and connection, using the image of muscadine grapes as a central metaphor. The speaker expresses a sense of inadequacy in conveying their feelings, preferring subtext over direct expression. The poem touches on themes of shared experiences, unspoken confessions, and the tension between longing and contentment. Ultimately, it suggests a shift from the belief that longing is the only song to an appreciation of the present moment, with all its imperfections and glut.</p>

          <p>Friends of Raquel Marie Morales, whose remains were discovered in a Surprise, Arizona landfill, reveal a history of childhood sexual assault, bullying, and mental health struggles. Prison records confirm her father, Theodore Lee Ramsey, began serving a 25-year sentence for sexual conduct with a minor shortly before her remains were found. Morales, described as a "sweet girl who made bad choices," had confided in friends about the abuse and had a history of running away with troubled individuals, further compounding her difficult life. The cause of death is still under investigation. </p>

          <p>Despite emerging warning signs that Donald Trump’s tariffs are destabilizing the U.S. economy, Republican leaders in Congress are actively working to protect his signature trade policy. They are thwarting attempts to repeal the tariffs, citing a master strategy behind the policy that will ultimately benefit America. This defense comes amid data showing the U.S. economy contracted, a consequence economists attribute to the trade policies. While Democrats criticize the tariffs and predict economic recession, Republicans are standing firm, emphasizing the importance of renegotiating trade policies with other countries. </p>
