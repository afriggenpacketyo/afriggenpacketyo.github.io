        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has defended its increased oil trade with Russia, stating it was a national necessity after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. New Delhi pointed out that the U.S. and EU, who are criticizing India, also maintain significant trade with Moscow, making the targeting of India seem unjustified. This response follows former President Trump's threats to impose substantially higher tariffs on Indian goods, accusing the nation of profiting from discounted Russian oil. India noted that the U.S. had previously encouraged these imports to stabilize global energy markets.</p>

          <p>A federal court ruling has prompted U.S. border agents to stop deportations under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had previously allowed for the summary deportation of migrants entering the country illegally, a measure credited by the administration for a significant drop in border crossings. While an appeals court affirmed the president's power to pause asylum access, it upheld protections for migrants facing torture or persecution if returned home. This directive effectively reopens the asylum system, though migrants will likely remain in detention while their claims are processed.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. This move follows claims by President Trump and his allies that the probe was a politically motivated conspiracy to undermine his presidency. The order stems from a referral by the Director of National Intelligence, who alleged the Obama administration politicized intelligence to falsely link Trump to Russia. It remains unclear what specific charges could be pursued or who might be targeted in the proceedings.</p>

          <p>A helicopter crew conducted a dramatic rescue of two hikers stranded on a secluded beach at Point Reyes National Seashore in California. The pair became trapped near a hazardous area known as Elephant Rock when the rising tide cut off their only exit route. Lacking safe access by land or sea, emergency services dispatched a helicopter to hoist the hikers to safety using a 100-foot line and a harness. No injuries were reported, and officials used the incident to remind visitors of the coastline's dangers and the importance of checking tide charts.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has authorized the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who fled to prevent a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional redistricting plan. By leaving the state, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum, effectively halting proceedings on a map that would create five new GOP-leaning districts. House Speaker Dustin Burrows condemned the move as a dereliction of duty, while Democrats argue their actions are a constitutionally protected tool to fight against what they call authoritarian tactics and gerrymandering. The standoff escalates a significant political battle with national implications.</p>

          <p>Glass House Brands, a major California cannabis company, has announced significant changes to its labor practices following a large-scale ICE raid that resulted in one worker's death and over 360 detentions. The company terminated its relationship with the farm labor contractors involved and hired a consulting firm led by a former ICE director to improve employment eligibility verification. The raid had targeted alleged child labor and criminal activity, though the company denies its direct employees were involved. The incident has sent shockwaves through the legal cannabis industry, highlighting ongoing conflicts with federal law.</p>

Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles stated the decision was based on securing the best capability, emphasizing the stealthy, next-generation vessel's advanced missile systems. This move is part of Australia's broader military restructuring to counter China's expansion and aims to more than double its fleet of major warships.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. The lawsuit claimed that UPS discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. Officials noted that UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities.

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, leading to a higher likelihood of spotting the large, fuzzy spiders as males leave their burrows in search of mates. This period, lasting from August to December, makes the otherwise secretive creatures highly visible, especially at dusk in chaparral, desert, and mountain areas. Experts note that while their appearance can be intimidating, native U.S. tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Their primary defense involves flicking irritant hairs, which can cause a rash but pose no serious threat.</p>

          <p>A nationwide shortage of volunteer firefighters is putting a strain on emergency services, particularly in smaller communities that rely on them. With nearly 70% of U.S. fire crews composed of volunteers, their declining numbers—down over 20% since 1985—could force more towns to transition to costly paid departments. The number of emergency calls has tripled in the same period, leading to burnout among remaining volunteers.

Trump lauded the campaign on social media, calling it the "HOTTEST" ad and contrasting it with what he termed "woke" advertising by other brands.

          <p>A report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) indicates that a military blockade by Beijing would severely strain Taiwan's critical resources.

However, the report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for China, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States.

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45-49 is leading to more diagnoses at an early, more treatable stage. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening rates in this demographic increased by 62% between 2019 and 2023. This corresponds with a sharp increase in the incidence of early-stage cancer detection.

          <p>Firefighters on the Hawaiian island of Maui have been battling a brush fire burning in Ka'anapali. The blaze ignited near an old warehouse, prompting the closure of a major highway as crews worked to control its spread. Officials reported that the fire was slowly being contained, though smoke continued to impact the area. The incident occurred just a few miles north of Lahaina, the town devastated by one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history nearly two years ago. The cause of the new fire is currently under investigation as crews remain on alert.</p>

          <p>An Australian politician, Gareth Ward, is fighting from his jail cell to remain a member of the New South Wales state parliament after being convicted of sexual assault. Ward, who was found guilty of assaulting two men, has refused to resign and plans to appeal his conviction, prompting his lawyers to seek a court injunction to block his expulsion. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns has called the situation "unconscionable," urging Ward to step down as the government moves to force him out. The case has sparked outrage, with critics highlighting that taxpayers are still paying his salary.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean “Diddy” Combs’ motion for release on bail, ordering that the music producer remain in custody at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center until his sentencing in October. The judge ruled that Combs failed to demonstrate he was not a flight risk or a danger. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges, though he was cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking, and faces up to 10 years in prison for each count. His legal team had argued for his release, citing ongoing threats of violence at the notorious facility.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that the stock market's recent rebound is primarily driven by the strong earnings and performance of major technology companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Despite a weak labor report and concerns over potential tariffs, the market showed significant resilience, with the Nasdaq experiencing a notable surge. Cramer highlighted that these tech giants, which he calls "nation states," possess immense cash reserves, diverse revenue streams, and tight expense controls, making them incredibly robust investments that are difficult to bet against in the current economic climate (not investment advice).</p>

Unseasonably dry vegetation in Southern California has fueled several large blazes, including the ongoing 65,000-acre Gifford fire.
