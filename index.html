          <p>The Trump administration's policies are causing cracks in the relationship between the US and its European allies.  The lack of mention of Europe in statements regarding the Ukraine conflict and the imposition of reciprocal tariffs highlight these concerns.

          <p>Experts argue that the US's approach to competing with China in Southeast Asia needs to shift from a focus on geopolitical swing states to a focus on swing sectors.  The current strategy, which emphasizes security alliances and engagement with regional institutions, has had limited success in less developed, non-ally nations.  The US should leverage its advantages in service and high-tech industries to counter China's influence.</p>
