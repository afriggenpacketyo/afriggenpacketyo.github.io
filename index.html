          <p>On the second day of his state visit to the U.K., President Donald Trump met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss pressing global issues, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The visit combined high-level politics with royal pageantry, including a formal farewell from King Charles III at Windsor Castle and a state banquet attended by tech and business leaders. While the leaders focused on reinforcing the U.S.-U.K. special relationship, the visit was also marked by large-scale protests in central London against the president's policies. The discussions aimed to address ongoing international crises and reaffirm transatlantic alliances during a period of significant geopolitical instability.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to drop in premarket trading. While same-store sales grew, particularly at its flagship chains, the company's fine-dining segment showed some weakness. Despite the earnings miss, Darden raised its full-year sales growth forecast, buoyed by its recent acquisition of the Chuy's Tex Mex chain. The results indicate strong performance in its casual dining sector, which helps to offset challenges in other areas of its diverse restaurant portfolio.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted to hold its key interest rate steady at 4%, citing the need to manage persistent inflationary pressures. The 7-2 vote saw two members favor a rate cut, indicating a division on the future path of monetary policy. The central bank is balancing sticky inflation against a weak economic growth outlook and an uncertain jobs market, with a potential rate cut in November hanging in the balance. Additionally, the bank announced it would slow the pace of selling U.K. government bonds, a process known as quantitative tightening.</p>

          <p>ABC has pulled "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely after the host made controversial comments linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The decision followed a threat from the FCC Chairman, a Trump appointee, who suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk. The suspension ignited a fierce debate about free speech and corporate accountability, with President Trump praising the move while Hollywood unions and Democratic lawmakers condemned it as an act of censorship and an abuse of governmental power.</p>

          <h2>The Risks and Rewards of Using AI Chatbots like ChatGPT for Medical Information</h2>

          <p>This article explores the growing trend of people, and even some doctors, using AI chatbots for medical advice, highlighting both potential benefits and significant dangers. While AI can sometimes identify rare conditions missed by physicians, it can also "hallucinate" and provide dangerously incorrect information, as in one case where it recommended a toxic pool cleaner as a salt substitute. Experts advise extreme caution, suggesting chatbots are better used for understanding existing diagnoses or formulating questions for a human doctor, rather than for self-diagnosis. The piece emphasizes that patient privacy is also a concern, as these platforms are not HIPAA-compliant.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have arrested three people in Essex on suspicion of assisting a foreign intelligence service, which has been identified as Russia. The arrests were made under the National Security Act of 2023 following searches at two separate addresses in the Grays area. The head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command noted an increasing number of people in the UK being recruited by foreign intelligence services. These specific arrests are reportedly not linked to a recent case involving two British men recruited by the Russian Wagner mercenary group.</p>

This move follows the recent resignation of senior health officials and is seen by public health experts as a continuation of the committee's shift away from established scientific consensus. The new composition raises concerns that upcoming votes on COVID-19, MMRV, and Hepatitis B vaccines could lead to restricted access and undermine long-standing public health efforts to control infectious diseases.</p>

          <p>This analysis of the U.S. Men's National Soccer Team argues against the recent wave of criticism, suggesting that coach Mauricio Pochettino's experimental approach is building necessary depth ahead of the World Cup. While results in friendly matches have been inconsistent, Pochettino has used the opportunity to introduce new players and tactics, fostering a more competitive and hungry team culture. The article posits that the team's ultimate success will depend more on player health and good fortune at tournament time than on pre-World Cup friendly outcomes, making a case for patience.</p>

          <p>A new event called "Phasmagorica," held at L.A.'s historic Heritage Square Museum, offers attendees an immersive séance experience designed as "art." Created by magician BC Smith, the event guides small groups through the history of American spiritualism before leaving them alone in a darkened tent to commune with spirits using tools like a pendulum and spirit board. Smith, a self-described "hopeful skeptic," aims to create a personal space for exploration rather than a theatrical performance, tapping into a modern search for connection and meaning in an unconventional setting.</p>

          <p>After ten months of contract negotiations, Loyola Marymount University has abruptly rescinded its recognition of the faculty union representing nearly 400 non-tenure-track educators. The university invoked its constitutionally protected religious exemption from federal labor laws, a move the union, SEIU Local 721, has called illegal union-busting and plans to challenge. University administrators claim the union's financial proposals were untenable and that the decision was necessary to protect LMU's Catholic mission, while faculty members protested the sudden reversal as an attack on workers' rights.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's proposal to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, while concerning, provides a more accurate reflection of the nation's military activities. The author suggests the term "defense" has been used as a euphemism to justify continuous warfare and ballooning budgets since it was adopted in 1949. A "Department of War" would be more historically continuous with the original 1789 department and could foster a more transparent debate about the true cost and purpose of U.S. military power globally.</p>
