          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has refused to comply with a French criminal investigation's demand for user data, labeling the probe as "politically-motivated" and an attempt to curtail free speech. The investigation, initiated in January, concerns allegations of algorithmic manipulation and fraudulent data extraction for foreign interference. X Corp. stated it denies the allegations and believes the investigation distorts French law to serve a political agenda. The company also raised concerns about the impartiality of the experts assigned to review its algorithm, citing their public hostility towards the platform.</p>

          <p>At least nine individuals were fatally shot while playing pool at a bar in a tourist city in southwestern Ecuador, an attack carried out by a group of armed men. This massacre is part of a larger wave of violence sweeping the nation, which has seen its homicide rate soar due to the growing influence of transnational drug cartels. The incident highlights the country's severe security crisis, which persists despite the recent recapture and extradition of major drug lord Adolfo Macías, alias "Fito." Authorities are investigating the shooting amid ongoing efforts to quell widespread gang violence.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a potential collision with a military aircraft, reportedly a B-52, during its landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed the 76 passengers that air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport, had not warned them about the converging aircraft. The pilot's quick thinking averted a potential disaster, earning applause from passengers after he calmly explained the situation. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the near-miss incident to determine how it occurred.</p>

          <p>A new study has quantified the immense value of global emergency vaccine stockpiles for diseases like cholera, Ebola, and meningitis, finding they have averted approximately 6 million cases and 300,000 deaths. These stockpiles, funded by organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, provide a rapid response to outbreaks that would otherwise be impossible given long vaccine manufacturing times. The research highlights over $32 billion in economic benefits, though this figure is considered a significant underestimate. These findings arrive at a critical time, as global health funding faces major cuts, raising concerns about the future of these life-saving programs.</p>

The piece further speculates on ongoing investigations into the fictional former president's mental acuity and use of an autopen for official signatures.

          <p>Harvard University is in federal court arguing that the Trump administration illegally cut $2.6 billion in federal funding as a retaliatory measure. The university's lawsuit claims the cuts were a response to Harvard rejecting demands from a federal antisemitism task force, which it deemed an overreach into its academic autonomy. The administration froze and later terminated numerous research grants, citing a clause that allows cancellation if they no longer align with government policy. Harvard contends these actions jeopardize vital medical and scientific research and are an attempt to micromanage the institution, while the administration denies retaliation.</p>

Critics, including Democratic representatives, have labeled the move a form of "election theft" that exploits a state law allowing for mid-census redistricting. The plan, supported by President Trump, aims to shore up Republican control of Congress by diluting Democratic-leaning urban areas.

          <p>Following Scottie Scheffler's commanding victory at The Open, this article posits that Rory McIlroy's next great challenge is to overcome the world's number one player. Despite a successful season that included winning the Masters to complete the career Grand Slam, McIlroy remains a distant second to Scheffler in the world rankings. The analysis draws parallels between Scheffler's current dominance and McIlroy's own surge between 2011 and 2014. While McIlroy is now considered an all-time great, the article suggests that the drive to topple the seemingly unbeatable Scheffler will provide his motivation moving forward.</p>

          <p>Residents of two 160-flat apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are being forced to leave their homes after the buildings were deemed unsafe by firefighters, despite £1 million being spent on repairs. The former council blocks, sold as "luxury" apartments, suffer from serious fire safety deficiencies, and a prohibition notice now makes it illegal to live there. Flat owners describe "years of hell," paying escalating service charges for deteriorating conditions and incomplete repairs under a series of management companies. The situation highlights what the local MP calls a "broken leasehold system," leaving residents financially ruined and homeless.</p>

          <p>As hot weather in Shasta County, California, increases sightings of the native Northern Pacific rattlesnake, wildlife experts are providing safety advice for residents. Rattlesnakes are generally not aggressive and will retreat if given space, but they may strike if they feel threatened or provoked. To avoid encounters, people should clear debris from their property, remove food sources that attract rodents, and be cautious on trails. If a bite does occur, victims should seek immediate medical attention, stay calm, and elevate the bite area, without attempting outdated remedies like cutting or sucking the wound.</p>

By enabling this setting, users can apply end-to-end encryption to most of their iCloud data, including photos, notes, and voice memos. This means that not even Apple or law enforcement can access the scrambled data without the user's unique recovery key or a designated recovery contact. While not a default setting, activating it provides a crucial layer of privacy against data breaches, government requests, and other potential intrusions.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Chief Justice John Roberts has been instrumental in constitutionally legitimizing the Trump administration's broad exercise of executive power. The article points to key Supreme Court decisions, often authored by Roberts himself, that have upheld actions like the "Muslim ban" and bolstered the president's authority to fire executive branch officials. This jurisprudence, rooted in the "unitary-executive theory," has reshaped the American presidency into a more powerful, less accountable institution. The author contends that Trump's actions are not a distortion but a realization of the Roberts Court's vision of the presidency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has removed all past National Climate Assessment reports from the federal government's website, following the earlier dismissal of all 400 experts working on the next edition. This action is described by watchdog groups as the most significant loss of public climate information to date, erasing a key resource used by policymakers and the public to understand climate change impacts. The move is part of a broader pattern of suppressing climate science, including cutting research funding and halting data collection, which critics call a strategy of "denial by erasure" to undermine climate policy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly favored tariffs over traditional sanctions as its primary tool for exerting economic and political pressure on other nations. This article analyzes the strategy, noting that tariffs offer direct, unilateral control without congressional approval and generate revenue, unlike sanctions. President Trump has used the threat of steep duties on major trading partners like China, Canada, and the EU to address not only trade deficits but also non-trade issues like immigration and foreign policy alignment. Critics warn this unpredictable "tariff tango" approach destabilizes global trade and blurs the lines between economic policy and punitive action.</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated the airline is considering increasing the bonus paid to staff for intercepting passengers with oversized baggage. Currently, employees receive about €1.50 per bag, a practice intended to enforce the airline's strict luggage rules and prevent boarding delays. O'Leary defended the policy, noting that over 99% of passengers comply and that limited cabin space necessitates aggressive enforcement. The discussion comes as the budget airline reported a more than doubling of its quarterly profits, driven by a strong Easter season and a 21% rise in average fares.</p>

As a result, Stellantis reported that its shipments to North America fell by 25% in the second quarter compared to the previous year.

The company has struggled with changing consumer tastes and increased competition from private-label brands.
