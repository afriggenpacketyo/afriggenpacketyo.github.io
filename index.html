        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides timely advice for homeowners considering home equity loans ahead of the Federal Reserve's anticipated October rate cut. It explains that while mortgage and HELOC rates are currently low, locking in a fixed-rate home equity loan now might prevent benefiting from further reductions. Conversely, a variable-rate Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) could see rates drop post-Fed meeting, offering more flexibility. The article highlights that HELOCs are generally more affordable but involve rate volatility, urging borrowers to carefully compare both options based on their individual financial goals and risk tolerance. This guidance is crucial for navigating an evolving interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reportedly demanded a significant $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for its criminal investigations against him following his first term. This article, citing The New York Times, details that Trump submitted administrative claims, which often precede lawsuits, related to probes into 2016 election interference and his retention of classified documents. He publicly acknowledged these claims, humorously noting the perceived conflict of suing himself as president. The situation underscores the persistent legal and political battles surrounding his tenure and subsequent investigations, with potential implications for the DOJ and his administration, including the involvement of appointees like Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.</p>

Lastly, single-purpose reverse mortgages are the most affordable, designed for specific needs like property taxes or home repairs.

          <p>A new study by Jobs for the Future indicates that a majority of American workers, specifically six in ten, do not hold "quality jobs," which are defined by essential factors like fair pay, stable schedules, opportunities for career growth, employee agency, and a respectful workplace culture. This article highlights that despite strong employment figures, 60% of workers report their positions fall short of these standards, with many experiencing financial struggles or unpredictable work hours. The research, conducted in partnership with Gallup, suggests that official labor statistics fail to fully capture the nuances of job quality. These findings underscore a significant disparity between job availability and the provision of truly supportive and beneficial employment.</p>

          <p>A Colombian court has acquitted former President Alvaro Uribe of bribery during criminal proceedings, overturning his prior conviction for witness tampering and procedural fraud. This article from DW reports that the Bogota High Court determined the charges were not proven "beyond reasonable doubt," citing "methodological errors, fallacies of interpretation and biased evaluation of evidence" in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served as president from 2002 to 2010, had faced accusations of bribing right-wing paramilitaries to conceal his alleged connections to these groups. His acquittal occurs amidst a broader diplomatic rift between the U.S. and Colombia, further complicating regional political dynamics.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether the window for opening a lucrative $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account is rapidly closing, given the Federal Reserve's ongoing rate cuts. It explains that while competitive rates around 4% or higher are still available, they are increasingly rare and primarily offered by online banks, a significant shift from recent years. With two more Fed rate cuts widely anticipated in the final months of 2025, the opportunity to lock in substantial fixed returns is diminishing. The article advises prompt action to secure current rates, emphasizing that CDs still offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts, an advantage that may not reappear for years.

          <p>Jewellery stolen from the Louvre museum in a daring daylight robbery has been officially valued at 88 million euros ($102 million), according to a French public prosecutor. This BBC article reports that while the monetary sum is extraordinary, the greater loss is to France's invaluable historical heritage, as the stolen items include significant pieces from Napoleonic eras. Four masked thieves executed the heist in under eight minutes, utilizing power tools and a mechanical lift to gain access. The audacious robbery has raised serious questions about the museum's security vulnerabilities, prompting authorities to implement tightened measures across the country's cultural institutions in response to the "terrible image" it projected.</p>

          <p>A criminologist predicts that French authorities will likely apprehend the thieves responsible for the audacious Louvre crown jewel robbery, but the national treasures themselves are probably lost forever. This CBS News article highlights that significant DNA evidence was left at the scene, including on a dropped tiara, and police recovered tools used in the heist like a crane lift and power saw. While professional criminals may be identifiable through police databases, the expert suggests the jewels will likely be broken up and sold on the black market, rendering their recovery improbable. The theft, the most spectacular since the Mona Lisa in 1911, has exposed serious security flaws at the world-renowned museum.</p>

The article highlights the significant variation in median incomes across states and their periodic updates.

The revisions include reinstating an earlier deadline for larger companies to comply by the end of 2025, while smaller firms retain their 2026 deadline. Additionally, a requirement for companies purchasing, processing, and selling such items to submit deforestation statements has been removed, limiting the measure to importers.</p>
