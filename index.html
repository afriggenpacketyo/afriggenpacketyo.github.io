          <p>Japan's economy demonstrated surprising resilience by expanding 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations despite facing significant trade headwinds from the United States. This growth occurred even as key exports, particularly in the vital automobile sector, experienced sharp declines due to newly imposed tariffs. While the Bank of Japan has slightly upgraded its annual growth forecast, it remains cautious, warning that global trade policies could negatively impact overseas economies and domestic corporate profits in the future. The data reflects a complex economic picture where domestic strength is currently offsetting international trade challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

The storm is currently moving westward and is expected to intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands this weekend. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain, prompting authorities to issue tropical storm watches throughout the northern Leeward Islands. The storm has already caused significant damage and fatalities in Cabo Verde, highlighting its potential danger as it continues to develop over the ocean.</p>

Manziel, a Texas A&M alumnus, humorously stated his hope that Manning performs poorly during the annual rivalry game between the two schools, known as "The Lone Star Showdown." He acknowledged the immense pressure and high expectations on Manning but praised his talent and family support system. Manziel advised Manning to remain a strong leader and navigate the inevitable adversity of playing in the highly competitive SEC conference, drawing from his own experiences.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of failing to implement adequate safety measures to protect its young users from sexual predators. Attorney General Liz Murrill alleges that Roblox prioritizes user growth and profits over child safety, creating an environment where harmful content and predators can flourish. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges and public criticisms against the company for its safety protocols. While Roblox maintains it has a zero-tolerance policy for child exploitation and has been implementing new AI detection systems, the lawsuit argues its age verification processes remain insufficient.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that two-thirds of Americans believe expectations for tipping have significantly increased in recent years, with few viewing this trend positively. The survey highlights a divide in perception, where some see tipping as a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, while others view it as an obligatory added cost. This sentiment aligns with broader public concern over rising prices and costs of living across various income levels. The poll suggests that the expansion of tipping culture into more service areas is contributing to financial fatigue among consumers who are already feeling squeezed by inflation.</p>

The campaign will feature content creators providing guidance, such as consulting a UK doctor beforehand and avoiding package deals that include surgery. The effort aims to protect patients from botched procedures and reduce the financial burden on the National Health Service, which often has to correct medical errors from overseas.</p>

          <p>A man was struck and killed by a car on the 210 Freeway in Monrovia, California, while attempting to flee an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a nearby Home Depot. According to the city manager, federal agents were conducting an enforcement operation at the location, which caused several workers to scatter. The deceased individual ran from the store onto the freeway, where the fatal collision occurred. This incident has raised concerns among immigration advocates, drawing parallels to another recent death during a raid in Ventura County and highlighting the dangerous consequences of such enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Four years after making a groundbreaking shift to a fully plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing meat and fish. Chef Daniel Humm, who had previously championed the move as an ethical and creative necessity, cited business reasons for the reversal, including a decline in private-event bookings and wine sales. The decision reflects a broader trend of flagging sales for plant-based meat alternatives and underscores the persistent consumer demand for traditional luxury ingredients in fine dining. This pivot has sparked a debate about the sustainability of high-end vegan cuisine and the challenges of aligning culinary revolution with commercial viability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has blocked two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities by threatening to withhold federal funding. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education acted unlawfully by issuing guidance that equated DEI initiatives with illegal race-based discrimination without following proper procedural requirements. The memos had expanded a 2023 Supreme Court ruling on college admissions to cover all aspects of education, causing widespread confusion and fear among educators.

          <p>Nearly two years into the conflict with Hamas, Israeli society is experiencing profound internal divisions over the war in Gaza, a stark contrast to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's calls for unity. Fault lines have emerged between secular and religious groups, as well as between those prioritizing the return of hostages and those demanding a total military victory. While a majority of Jewish Israelis appear untroubled by Palestinian suffering, a growing minority is protesting the humanitarian crisis. This societal fragmentation is compounded by political pressure from ultranationalist coalition partners, creating a complex and volatile environment as the government navigates the prolonged conflict.</p>

The meeting, also attended by former Attorney General Eric Holder, highlighted a coordinated Democratic strategy to counter Republican efforts to redraw congressional maps in their favor.

          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, they approach the talks with distinct and contrasting objectives regarding the war in Ukraine. Putin seeks international recognition and validation that Western efforts to isolate Russia have failed, alongside the solidification of territorial gains in Ukraine. Conversely, Trump is driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker, aiming to broker a deal to end the conflict, a promise from his presidential campaign. The meeting's location in Alaska holds symbolic weight for both sides, but the fundamental differences in their goals create significant uncertainty about any potential breakthrough.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the state will proceed with a plan to hold a special election on redrawing its congressional maps, a direct countermeasure to Republican redistricting efforts in Texas. The proposal, called the "Election Rigging Response Act," would ask voters to approve new district lines designed to favor Democrats, potentially neutralizing GOP gains elsewhere and impacting control of the U.S. House. The move temporarily overrides the state's independent redistricting commission, a decision Newsom justifies as a necessary response to protect democracy from partisan gerrymandering. The announcement was notably marked by the conspicuous presence of federal Border Patrol agents outside the venue.</p>

Former officials describe Putin as meticulously prepared and dominant in conversation, often using sarcasm that can be lost in translation. In contrast, Trump is seen as more spontaneous and reliant on personal relationships, an approach Putin may seek to exploit.

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped significantly after the company issued a disappointing financial forecast for the upcoming quarter, citing macroeconomic and policy uncertainties. The company's outlook for both earnings and revenue fell short of analyst expectations, with CEO Gary Dickerson specifically noting that its business in China is being impacted by the uncertain environment. The firm assumes that none of its pending export license applications with the U.S. government will be approved in the next quarter, contributing to an expected decline in revenue. The weak guidance overshadowed a third-quarter performance that otherwise beat estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

Officers allegedly found alprazolam (Xanax) and suspected fentanyl in Rodriguez's vehicle, leading to his arrest. Rodriguez has disputed the charges from his previous arrest in March, claiming the drugs belonged to someone else and alleging misconduct by the arresting officer.</p>

After a judge temporarily halted the deportation, the government agreed to move the woman to regular immigration court proceedings where she can plead her case.

          <p>Gregory Rodriguez, a former correctional officer at California's largest women's prison, has been sentenced to 224 years in prison after being convicted of more than 60 charges for sexually abusing nine incarcerated women. The case exposed a systemic crisis of sexual misconduct within the state's prison system, revealing that Rodriguez targeted vulnerable women for nearly a decade. Survivors testified that he used his authority to coerce them into sexual acts, sometimes in areas without camera surveillance. The severe sentence marks a rare instance of a prison guard facing significant criminal consequences for on-duty sexual assault, a crime advocates say is chronically under-prosecuted.</p>
