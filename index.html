          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul met with his Israeli counterpart Gideon Saar in Berlin, reiterating Germany's commitment to Israel's defense while also expressing concerns about the situation in Gaza. Wadephul urged Israel to allow unrestricted humanitarian aid into Gaza, citing international law, and criticized the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Germany considers illegal. Despite these criticisms, Wadephul affirmed that Germany would continue to supply arms to Israel, emphasizing Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas. The ministers also commemorated the victims of the Holocaust, underscoring Germany's commitment to fighting antisemitism and ensuring Israel's security. Optimism score will be gauged based on the relative nature of an ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call to discuss trade relations between the two countries, according to Chinese officials.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who claimed she was a victim of reverse discrimination after being denied a promotion because she is straight. The court overturned a lower court's decision that had required Ames to meet a higher burden of proof, stating that the "background circumstances" requirement was inconsistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This ruling makes it easier to pursue reverse discrimination claims in several states, as Ames alleged she was passed over for a promotion in favor of a gay woman and subsequently demoted and replaced by a gay man. The decision clarifies the standard for reverse discrimination cases and potentially impacts DEI programs.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields fell after the latest weekly jobless claims came in higher than expected, with first-time filings reaching 247,000, exceeding the Dow Jones estimate of 236,000. The 2-year yield decreased by more than 1 basis point to 3.864%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by more than 2 basis points to 4.343%. This decline follows a previous day of sharp decreases due to disappointing U.S. data, including weaker-than-expected services sector activity and private sector payrolls.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously blocked a lawsuit filed by the Mexican government against major U.S. gun manufacturers, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which shields gunmakers from civil suits. Mexico argued that the gun manufacturers knowingly aided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to straw purchasers who then trafficked them to drug cartels. The court, however, found that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers aided and abetted the illegal sales. This decision is a significant win for the firearms industry and limits the ability of foreign governments to hold U.S. companies liable for the misuse of their products.</p>

It also partially suspends entry for travelers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariff proposals could significantly increase the price of goods like clothing and shoes, particularly those imported from China and Vietnam. A retail consultancy group, AlixPartners, estimates that a 30% tariff on Chinese-made goods could raise prices by about 19%, while a 145% tariff could cause a spike of roughly 90%. Similarly, tariffs on Vietnamese goods could lead to price increases of around 8% to 35%, depending on the tariff level. While retailers may try to offset some of these costs, the levies could still take a major toll on U.S. households (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Controversy surrounding a speech given by a Chinese Harvard graduate has ignited discussions about the Chinese publicâ€™s disillusionment with elite education and growing anger at class rigidity. While the graduate's success was initially praised, it soon faced criticism from social media users questioning whether her privileged background represented the broader Chinese student population. Academics suggest this reflects increasing recognition that educational competition is ultimately a competition of family finances and social capital. The controversy underscores deeper societal tensions and the growing awareness of inequality in access to educational resources.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's immigration crackdown is targeting unaccompanied minors and their caregivers, leading to increased fear and chaos within immigrant families. New policies expedite the removal of these children, strip them of legal representation, and impose strict restrictions on who can take custody of them. Some children are being used as "bait" to arrest and deport the adults around them, creating a climate of terror. Advocates and lawyers say these changes represent a new strategy to instill fear and disrupt families, with children experiencing emotional distress, sleep deprivation, and difficulty participating in legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Right-wing populist networks in Central Europe are gaining momentum, bolstered by Donald Trump's reelection and recent electoral successes. These groups are working together to spread their narratives and build an international alliance, often criticizing the EU and promoting national sovereignty. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been instrumental in creating a hub for right-wing populists, using institutions funded by the Hungarian government to spread their message across Europe and beyond. These networks aim to halt EU efforts to stop Orban's assault on Hungary's democracy and influence political change on a European scale.</p>

          <p>President Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday amidst an ongoing dispute over a temporary deal to ease tariffs between the U.S. and China. The call was made at Mr. Trump's request, according to the Chinese Embassy in Washington. Under a May 12 truce, the U.S. reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, while China reduced levies on American imports, but talks have since stalled. Trump accused China of violating the deal by withholding certain products, while China claims the U.S. is undermining progress with new export control guidelines and visa restrictions.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, a drug commonly referred to as the abortion pill. This review comes amid concerns raised by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims the pill harms women, though experts have questioned the report's methodology and conclusions. While the FDA has previously affirmed the drug's safety and effectiveness, this new review raises questions about potential changes to access to mifepristone. The drug has been used by millions of women in the U.S. since its approval in 2000.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a 25-basis-point interest rate trim, lowering its inflation expectations due to a stronger euro and lower energy costs. Euro zone inflation fell below the ECB's 2% target in May, hitting 1.9%, leading the ECB to anticipate an average inflation rate of 2% in 2025. While the ECB left its growth forecast for 2025 unchanged at 0.9%, President Lagarde noted that the outlook for euro area inflation is more uncertain than usual. This decision comes at a critical time for the euro zone economy, with businesses and policymakers facing increasing uncertainty due to rising geopolitical tensions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to mitigate a labor shortage in China in the long run, but its near-term impact on deflationary pressures is debated. Morgan Stanley analysts suggest that AI could exacerbate deflation by disrupting the employment market, as labor displacement effects may dominate initially. However, Standard Chartered economist Ding Shuang argues that AI will not be a primary driver of deflation, citing overcapacity in some industries and sluggish domestic demand as the main causes. Ding advocates for developing AI as a strategically important industry despite deflation concerns.</p>
