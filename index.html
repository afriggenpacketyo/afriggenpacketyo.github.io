          <p>A passenger train has derailed in southern Denmark after colliding with a slurry tanker, resulting in the death of a 60-year-old woman and injuring 27 others. The crash occurred near the German border, involving a train carrying 106 people, including a group of schoolchildren who were not seriously harmed. Authorities are using a crane to search the wreckage for any additional victims, while two of the five seriously injured individuals remain in critical condition. The incident has prompted the national rail operator to suspend services on the affected line indefinitely.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a significant engine test for its Long March-10 rocket, a key component of its plan to land astronauts on the moon by 2030. The test confirmed that the 21 YF-100K engines can operate in sync, providing crucial data for the superheavy launcher's development. Standing 92 meters tall, the rocket is designed to deliver a 27-tonne payload to a trans-lunar orbit. The mission plan involves two separate Long March-10 launches to send the Mengzhou spacecraft and Lanyue lander into lunar orbit for a rendezvous.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska has concluded without a definitive agreement on the war in Ukraine. Trump described the discussions as "productive" and noted progress on several points, while Putin called the talks a "starting point" and proposed a future meeting in Moscow. The summit, Putin's first visit to the U.S. in a decade, raised concerns in Ukraine, which was not included in the discussions. Both leaders gave brief statements but took no questions, leaving the specific outcomes of their lengthy conversation unclear.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the dynamic between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin during their Alaska summit, portraying it as a moment of validation for the American president. The author notes Putin's public endorsement of Trump's claims about the 2020 election and the origins of the Ukraine war, suggesting the Russian leader effectively catered to Trump's perspectives. The piece describes the meeting's optics, from the red-carpet welcome to the private ride in the presidential limousine, as a significant diplomatic victory for Putin. It frames the summit not as a traditional negotiation but as a performance of mutual admiration between two authoritarian-leaning figures.</p>

          <p>The recent summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska yielded several notable outcomes despite not producing a ceasefire in Ukraine. A key takeaway was Putin's successful return to the world stage, marked by a warm welcome on U.S. soil. The meeting also highlighted that Putin's core demands for ending the war, which amount to Ukrainian capitulation, remain unchanged. Observers noted the vagueness of the leaders' concluding statements, with Trump not mentioning Ukraine at all and offering no specifics on the "great progress" he claimed was made. Putin's invitation for a future meeting in Moscow suggests a continuation of this bilateral dialogue.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is implementing a new policy that tightens residency requirements for nationals from mainland China, a move described by critics as an "attack" on cross-strait spouses. The proposed amendment requires applicants to provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. The administration of President Lai Ching-te justifies the change by citing growing national security threats from Beijing, including infiltration and economic coercion. This policy represents a significant shift in cross-strait governance, aimed at eliminating dual-status ambiguities that Taipei views as a potential security vulnerability.</p>

          <p>Following a legal challenge from Washington, D.C. officials, the Trump administration has retracted its decision to replace the city's police chief, Pamela Smith. The reversal came after a federal judge indicated that while the president can request services from the city's police, the law does not grant the administration full operational control. The lawsuit was filed after the administration attempted to install a federal official to oversee the Metropolitan Police Department during a declared crime crackdown. This agreement resolves the immediate command dispute, though legal arguments over other aspects of the federal intervention are expected to continue.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a plan to redraw the state's congressional district maps in an effort to gain up to five additional U.S. House seats. This move is positioned as a direct response to a similar Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas aimed at solidifying GOP control. The proposal would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. If passed, the new map would significantly alter several GOP-held districts to favor Democratic candidates, potentially reshaping California's congressional delegation and influencing the balance of power in Washington.</p>
