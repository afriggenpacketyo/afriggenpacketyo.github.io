          <h2>Trump Administration Supports Dismissal of Lawsuit Seeking to Restrict Abortion Pill Access</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:24:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration, echoing the Biden administration's earlier stance, has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit aimed at restricting access to mifepristone, an abortion pill. The Justice Department argues that the case, brought by conservative attorneys general, lacks the legal standing to be heard in the Texas federal district court where it was filed. The lawsuit seeks to reverse regulatory changes made by the FDA that expanded access to mifepristone, including telemedicine prescriptions and mail delivery. This marks the first time the Trump administration has weighed in on the case, aligning with the previous administration's view that the lawsuit's venue is inappropriate.</p>

          <p>A second individual, Rickey White, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection to the death of Telemundo sports reporter Adan Manzano, who was found dead in his hotel room in New Orleans after covering the Super Bowl. Manzano's death was attributed to the toxic effects of Xanax and alcohol. White's alleged accomplice, Danette Colbert, was previously charged with second-degree murder and other charges. Police investigations revealed that Colbert and White met Manzano in the French Quarter before returning to his hotel, where Colbert was the last person seen with him. Colbert is also suspected of involvement in other drugging and robbery incidents in New Orleans and Las Vegas.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Israel's plans for a "forceful entry to Gaza" to seize territory and relocate Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas for hostage release and destroy infrastructure. This escalation follows stalled cease-fire talks and humanitarian aid restrictions, which the U.N. has labeled "catastrophic." Meanwhile, the Trump administration is offering undocumented immigrants $1,000 and a flight home for voluntary self-deportation, alongside exploring deportation agreements with Rwanda. This initiative aims to ramp up deportations in a cost-effective manner. The article also notes that the U.S. tents erected at GuantÃ¡namo Bay have not held any migrants.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismantled the migrant tent camp at GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, just three months after its establishment, despite initial plans to house up to 30,000 migrants. The operation, which never expanded to its intended capacity, housed only 32 migrants at the time of dismantling, far fewer than envisioned. The decision to remove the tents indicates a shift in plans, with the Defense and Homeland Security Departments now focusing on housing dozens of ICE detainees rather than thousands. The tents and equipment have been inventoried for possible future use, and the operation has faced criticism for its high costs and questionable legal authority.</p>

          <p>Several individuals are actively resisting the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into their lives and businesses, citing concerns ranging from environmental impact to the erosion of critical thinking skills. Florence Achery, owner of Yoga Retreats & More, emphasizes the contradiction between AI's soulless nature and her business's focus on human connection, as well as the environmental cost of running AI data centers. Sierra Hansen, working in public affairs, worries that AI is hindering our ability to problem-solve independently. However, some, like Jackie Adams in digital marketing, have had to adopt AI due to budget cuts and job requirements, finding that it can elevate their work. The article concludes that the moment to fully opt out of AI has passed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will block new federal grants to Harvard University, citing concerns over antisemitism, affirmative action policies, and a lack of "viewpoint diversity" among faculty. Education Secretary Linda McMahon criticized Harvard for "disastrous mismanagement" and accused the university of betraying its ideals. This action follows Harvard's lawsuit challenging the government's earlier decision to cut research funding. The administration's move signals a shift towards a more deliberate approach to restricting funding, which could be more difficult for universities to contest in court.</p>

          <p>American public support for Israel is waning, with a recent Gallup survey showing the lowest level of support in 25 years, while sympathy for Palestinians is at an all-time high. This shift is largely driven by Democrats and younger voters, influenced by events such as the Hamas attacks and Israel's military response in Gaza. While the US has historically been Israel's strongest ally, these changing sentiments raise questions about the future of US policy and the extent of its support. The article explores the historical context of the US-Israel relationship, noting the role of shared cultural connections and the impact of key events like the 1967 war.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that receiving a shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The study, which examined over 1 million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of such events in those who received the vaccine. The protective effect was particularly pronounced in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. The researchers propose that preventing shingles through vaccination may reduce blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation, which can contribute to heart disease.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, despite beating Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The automaker anticipates offsetting $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions, but cites potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and future tariffs as reasons for pulling its guidance. The tariff impact is less than that expected by General Motors, as Ford imports fewer vehicles. The automotive industry is currently grappling with 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and non-USMCA compliant auto parts.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 profit forecast, citing the Trump administrationâ€™s tariff policies, which are expected to lower its profit by about $1.5 billion. The company also reported a sharp drop in profits for the first three months of the year, attributing it to lower vehicle sales due to paused production and changes aimed at reducing inventories. While Ford is less affected by the tariffs than other automakers, the company cited the potential for supply chain disruptions and retaliatory tariffs as reasons for its decision. The company previously expected earnings for 2025 to be $7 billion to $8.5 billion.</p>

          <p>California's tourism industry reached a new record in 2024, but Governor Gavin Newsom warns that the state expects a decline in visitation and international tourism due to President Trump's tariffs, creating a "Trump Slump." Local businesses have reported a downturn due to uncertainty surrounding trade and the stock market. The state is launching marketing plans to invite Canadians back after a drop in figures. The governor is suing the Trump administration, challenging the president's authority to levy international tariffs without congressional approval, because it will affect the state budget.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is facing scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to communicate strategic information to a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. This practice, known as "red-boxing," involves posting detailed instructions for outside groups to follow, circumventing rules that prohibit direct coordination. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has issued a warning about the new rules targeting red-boxing, and one of Cuomo's opponents has requested an investigation. Cuomo's campaign denies any wrongdoing, arguing that there is no evidence the super PAC acted on the information.</p>
