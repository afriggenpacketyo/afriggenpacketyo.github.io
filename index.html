          <p>Manchester United's pursuit of Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has hit another obstacle, as their second bid for the player has been rejected. This development indicates Brentford's firm stance on retaining the key attacker, who has been instrumental to their performance. The rejection forces Manchester United to reconsider their transfer strategy as they aim to strengthen their offensive lineup ahead of the new season. The ongoing negotiations highlight the competitive nature of the current transfer market and Brentford's determination to hold onto their valuable assets despite interest from top clubs.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new record high, continuing a period of significant gains as investors looked past concerns regarding international trade disputes and conflict in the Middle East. The market briefly dipped following news of the U.S. ending trade talks with Canada but quickly recovered, demonstrating strong underlying confidence. Analysts suggest this optimism is fueled by a dialed-back tariff posture in other areas and data indicating a healthy economy, with inflation remaining near its lowest level since 2021.

          <p>The U.S. has abruptly terminated all trade discussions with Canada, a move President Trump announced in response to a new Canadian tax targeting large technology companies. The 3% digital services tax, which Canada enacted last year, is set to affect major American firms and has been a significant point of contention between the two nations. President Trump has threatened to announce new tariffs on Canadian goods within a week, escalating trade tensions that have already seen levies imposed by both countries.

          <p>Tensions flared during the seventh inning of a game between the Miami Marlins and San Francisco Giants, leading to both benches clearing onto the field. The incident began after Giants first baseman Wilmer Flores argued a check-swing strikeout call, prompting Marlins pitcher Cade Gibson to confront him verbally. Although no physical altercations occurred, the moment highlighted the game's contentious atmosphere, which included an earlier hit-by-pitch and the ejection of the Marlins' manager. The Marlins ultimately won the game 12-5, completing a three-game sweep of the Giants.</p>

          <p>The UK government has softened its travel advice for Israel, shifting from a warning against all travel to advising against all but essential travel for most of the country. This change follows a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran and the reopening of Israeli airspace, which has increased the availability of commercial flights. The Foreign Office announced that a final evacuation flight for British nationals is scheduled for Sunday, as demand has decreased. Despite the eased restrictions, the government acknowledges the situation remains fragile and will keep its travel guidance under continuous review.</p>

Her song, "Take A Sexy Picture Of Me," went viral and was written in response to nasty comments about her physical appearance following a festival performance last year. While she is glad the song resonates with many people who have had similar experiences, she finds it sad that the theme is so relatable.</p>

The movie, which premiered at Sundance, follows an intersex Latine sex worker in New Jersey who dreams of escaping a life of crime and violence. Gallo, a multitalented artist, uses the film to delve into themes of identity, trauma, and the search for freedom, drawing from their own life as a first-generation Salvadoran-American and intersex individual. The film aims to bring visibility to intersex stories, which Gallo notes are often ignored in broader conversations about gender and in anti-trans legislation.</p>

Analysts attribute the surge to the passage of the GENIUS Act, which provides a federal framework for stablecoins, and the strong market performance of its partner Circle.

          <p>President Trump suggested that the early July deadline for reinstating widespread tariffs on numerous countries is not fixed and could be extended or shortened. This flexibility applies to the executive order from April, which temporarily reduced tariffs to 10% for 90 days, with the original, higher rates set to return on July 8. Despite the looming deadline, the administration has only secured limited trade agreements with China and the UK, far short of the scores of deals initially anticipated. The potential return of high tariffs risks a repeat of the global economic volatility seen when they were first announced. (not investment advice)</p>

Some, like former national security adviser John Bolton, advocate for continued pressure and eventual regime change as the only path to peace. Others, including a former Iranian official, argue the attacks were counterproductive and that direct U.S.-Iran negotiations are now essential. Analysts also debate the impact on Iran's capabilities, the boundaries of international law, and whether the strikes will force Iran toward diplomacy or further entrenchment.</p>

The authors contend that such practices undermine public trust, create safety risks by making it difficult to distinguish officers from impostors, and erode law enforcement legitimacy. They assert that transparency and accountability, signified by identifiable uniforms and badges, are fundamental to policing in a democratic society.

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that limits the ability of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his executive orders, specifically one aimed at ending birthright citizenship. While the 6-3 ruling did not address the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, it curbed a judicial tool frequently used to halt administration policies. Trump hailed the decision as a 'monumental win' that restores presidential power, while critics, including Democratic leaders, described it as a dangerous step toward authoritarianism that weakens judicial checks and balances.

          <p>Recent studies suggest that entry-level jobs, typically held by young university graduates, are the most threatened by advancements in artificial intelligence. Tasks involving routine data analysis, common for new entrants to the workforce, can now often be performed more efficiently by AI, leading to a potential unemployment crisis for this demographic. According to one survey, 63% of executives believe AI will eliminate these entry-level positions. Experts, including Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu, advise young people to focus on developing highly specific skills and maintaining flexibility to adapt to evolving technology, thereby becoming partners to AI rather than victims of it.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the use of universal injunctions, a legal tool that allows a single federal judge to block a government policy nationwide. The decision came in a case challenging President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but the court focused on the scope of judicial power rather than the order's legality. This ruling is a victory for the administration, as it curtails a mechanism frequently used to halt its policies. Legal experts suggest that going forward, opponents of executive actions will likely shift their strategy toward class-action lawsuits to achieve broad relief against federal policies.</p>

          <p>The Archbishop of Wales, Andrew John, has announced his immediate retirement from the role, following a period of significant turmoil within his Bangor diocese. His resignation comes after reports revealed governance and safeguarding weaknesses at Bangor Cathedral, including mentions of a 'culture in which sexual boundaries seemed blurred' and excessive alcohol consumption. While there is no suggestion of personal misconduct by the archbishop, he faced calls to resign and apologized for letting the community down. The Church in Wales's board of trustees reportedly declared no confidence in the diocese's leadership prior to his announcement.</p>

          <p>This article looks back at the remarkable 1996 event at the Brookfield Zoo when a female gorilla named Binti Jua rescued a 3-year-old boy who fell into her enclosure. After the boy fell 24 feet and was knocked unconscious, the 8-year-old gorilla gently picked him up, cradled him, and carried him to a service door for zookeepers. The incident garnered international praise and highlighted the gorilla's protective, maternal instincts. Binti Jua, whose name means 'daughter of sunshine,' became a celebrated hero and still lives at the zoo today, having recently celebrated her 37th birthday.</p>
