          <p>An undocumented Honduran immigrant in Florida is facing a $1.82 million fine from ICE for failing to leave the U.S. after a 2005 removal order. The woman, a mother of three U.S. citizen children, was fined $500 for each day she remained in the country since the order was issued. Her attorney is appealing the fine, arguing that the woman was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart. The attorney also notes an uptick in ICE issuing fines to clients who remain in the country illegally, but this is the first million-dollar civil fine she has seen.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. Domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6% and offsetting some of the negative impact. Experts suggest that while the weak yen provided a competitive advantage, it was overshadowed by China's machinery and tool exports. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current interest rates until more economic certainty emerges amidst ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S.</p>

Comey said he opposed violence and didn't realize the numbers could be associated with violence. The Secret Service is taking the rhetoric seriously and is investigating the matter.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing the world’s fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections estimating up to 115 million cases by 2050. In 1990, the country had about 4 million patients with dementia, a number that rose to 17 million by 2021. This increase is attributed to the country's rapidly aging population, posing significant challenges. The incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of dementia cases have doubled globally between 1990 and 2021, but over the same period the number of cases rose threefold in China.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is facing challenges due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Fisherman Brand Little is using a high-tech system with remote-controlled pop-up devices to retrieve his catch with less rope, allowing him to fish when others cannot. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the crab season to protect the whales. The experimental pop-up gear has critics among some fishermen who say it shouldn't be used due to the cost of the new devices, and they claim that their margins are already too thin.</p>

The cases before the court stem from the president’s January executive order that would deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren’t citizens or permanent residents.
