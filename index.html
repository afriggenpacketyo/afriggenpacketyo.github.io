The Association of School and College Leaders acknowledges the potential time-saving benefits but emphasizes unresolved issues. The article indicates that while AI should only be used for low-stakes marking, teachers can use AI to write routine letters to parents.</p>

          <p>President Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 additional National Guard troops to Los Angeles, prompting a lawsuit from California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom criticized the deployment as unnecessary and politically motivated, alleging the first 2,000 troops were left without adequate supplies. The ACLU condemned the mobilization of Marines, questioning their training for policing protests while respecting constitutional rights. Trump responded by suggesting he would support arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement, further escalating the conflict.</p>

          <p>California filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the deployment of the state's National Guard to Los Angeles, calling it an "unprecedented power grab." The lawsuit argues that President Trump bypassed Governor Gavin Newsom by placing the troops under federal control without permission. Attorneys for the state contend that the law cited by the Trump administration does not apply to the protests in Los Angeles. The lawsuit also states that the use of National Guard forces has stoked "fear and terror" and "heightened tensions with protesters and residents."</p>

The water industry is reportedly concerned that farmers may stop accepting the sludge, leading to lobbying efforts and contingency plans.

          <p>A small marble sculpture initially believed to be a copy of Auguste Rodin's "Despair" has been confirmed as an authentic work by the artist and sold for nearly $1 million at auction. The sculpture, which had disappeared after being sold in 1906, was authenticated by the Comite Rodin after a six-week investigation. The owners' despair turned to delight when their piece, thought to be a copy, was recognized as the real thing.</p>

While Chinese stocks trade at a valuation in line with the past decade, weaker corporate earnings due to the economic slowdown make it crucial to carefully select stocks and sectors. The aggregate annual expected return of Chinese stocks under JPMorgan's coverage is about 10%, lower than the historic average.
