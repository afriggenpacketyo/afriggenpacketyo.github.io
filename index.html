          <p>A brief power outage at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for 60 to 90 seconds, preventing controllers from communicating with aircraft. The FAA halted departures, and several controllers took medical leave due to the traumatic experience. United Airlines canceled 35 daily round-trip flights to ease congestion. The facility where controllers work the airspace around Newark airport is located in Philadelphia and was already short air traffic controllers, which has forced airlines to delay flights for hours over the last eight days. </p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. beat first-quarter expectations but suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs.

Ford cited potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and future tariffs as reasons for pulling the guidance. Without the tariffs, Ford was tracking toward its initial guidance, including adjusted EBIT of $7 billion to $8.5 billion. </p>

          <p>TeleMessage, a communications app used by Mike Waltz, suspended services following a reported hack that exposed potentially sensitive messages. Smarsh, which runs the app, is investigating the security incident. Waltz was ousted the following day and Trump named his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to take on Waltzâ€™s job on an interim basis. Concerns over the security of Waltzâ€™s communications were heightened after reports of a hacker breaking into TeleMessageâ€™s back-end infrastructure. </p>
