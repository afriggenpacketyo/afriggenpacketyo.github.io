        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration publicly criticized former First Lady Hillary Clinton, reigniting a 2001 controversy where she was accused of improperly taking White House furniture, which she later returned, attributing it to a "cataloging error." This attack followed Clinton's strong public opposition to President Trump's plans for a privately-funded, 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House, which she characterized as "destroying" the public's property. Conservatives seized on her past actions to undermine her criticism of Trump's project, highlighting the irony. President Trump had recently announced the commencement of the ballroom's construction, asserting it would restore the White House's glory for Americans at no taxpayer cost, a sentiment echoed by his administration.</p>

          <p>A nationwide manhunt has been launched in the UK for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been jailed for 12 months after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and another woman in Epping, Essex, with the attacks previously sparking widespread protests and leading to a five-year sexual harm prevention order. He was intended for transfer to an immigration detention center pending deportation, rather than release. The Prison Service has initiated an urgent investigation into this critical error, with an officer removed from duties, while Justice Secretary David Lammy expressed his outrage, emphasizing the priority of public protection and the need for Kebatu's immediate recapture and deportation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Selected Letters of John Updike," an extensive new compendium, vividly illustrates the profound and often indistinguishable link between the acclaimed American novelist's writing life and his personal experiences. Spanning nearly seven decades, the letters reveal Updike's meticulous approach to collecting details for his craft, whether directly for works like the Rabbit tetralogy or indirectly through his relationships. His correspondence is presented as witty, earnest, and occasionally controversial, offering deep insights into his views on women, his marriages, and his persistent efforts to be published by The New Yorker despite numerous rejections. Ultimately, the article portrays Updike as a figure driven by immense ambition and playfulness, who remained a devoted reader throughout his life, seeing writing as his ultimate vocation.</p>

          <h2>Retail Leaders Anticipate Cautious Holiday Spending and Earlier Promotions Two Months Before Christmas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 12:57:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With two months remaining until Christmas, retail leaders are actively preparing for a more cautious consumer environment by launching earlier holiday promotions and marketing campaigns. Companies such as Kohl's and Academy Sports are initiating their festive season efforts sooner than usual, aiming to attract discerning shoppers who are keen to find the best deals. Executives observe a clear "bifurcation" in consumer spending patterns, where lower-income households are experiencing significant budget pressures, yet they anticipate a degree of resilience during crucial shopping events. Retailers are strategically adjusting their discount approaches and emphasizing private-label brands to deliver perceived value.

          <p>General Motors has laid off over 200 salaried employees, predominantly Computer-Aided Design (CAD) engineers at its global tech campus in metro Detroit, as part of its continuous efforts to reevaluate businesses and reduce costs to boost profits. The automaker stated it is restructuring its design engineering team to enhance core architectural design engineering capabilities, leading to the elimination of these roles due to "business conditions." These job cuts represent a small fraction of GM's salaried workforce but extend a pattern of white-collar reductions in the U.S. This development comes shortly after electric vehicle maker Rivian also reduced its workforce and despite GM raising its 2025 financial guidance and experiencing significant stock gains this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant tax change for 2025 dictates that certain non-spouse heirs, including adult children, of inherited individual retirement accounts must commence taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) while liquidating the account over a 10-year period. This new IRS regulation aims to clarify previous ambiguities surrounding inherited IRA withdrawals. Non-compliance could lead to a substantial IRS penalty of up to 25% on the under-withdrawn amount, although this fee may be reduced to 10% or entirely waived if corrected within two years with a reasonable explanation. Financial experts strongly recommend that heirs engage in thoughtful tax planning, considering earlier withdrawals during periods of lower income to optimize their tax bracket and avoid a large tax burden in the final year.

          <p>Scientists are intensely researching how certain dangerous viruses, including Ebola, Zika, and measles, can evade the human immune system by hiding in "sanctuary sites" like the eyes and testes. These areas are protected from immune response, allowing viral RNA to linger undetected, even after a person appears to have recovered. The hidden virus can later reactivate, re-sickening the host or transmitting to others through bodily fluids, as seen in a sexually transmitted Ebola case in Liberia. Researchers are now focused on developing small-molecule drugs, like remdesivir, that can penetrate these barriers and fully eliminate the virus from survivors, while also addressing the associated stigma.</p>

          <p>Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is actively campaigning for the permanent abolition of daylight saving time (DST) across the European Union by 2026, reigniting a long-standing debate. Sanchez contends that the practice of changing clocks twice a year offers minimal energy savings and has detrimental effects on people's health and overall well-being. Although an 2018 EU Commission survey revealed that 85% of Europeans favored ending DST, the initiative stalled due to member states' inability to agree on a permanent time setting. The European Commission has acknowledged the ongoing deadlock and committed to conducting further detailed studies to inform a future decision, with a goal to finally end the seasonal time changes.</p>

This case represents the first convictions under the UK's National Security Act 2023. Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb characterized the incident as a "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage" orchestrated by the Russian state, with UK security officials underscoring the serious national security threat posed by Russia's use of online recruitment for criminal operations.</p>

Unlike wagers on game outcomes, prop bets on individual player statistics are easily manipulated by athletes, as demonstrated by recent NBA and MLB incidents. A new FBI investigation involving an NBA player, former player, and alleged Mafia ties underscores the pervasive nature of the problem.

Historically considered an inflation hedge, gold's relationship with rising prices is not always direct, as its value is also swayed by central bank decisions, global demand, and investor sentiment. The article advises new investors against relying solely on gold for inflation protection, suggesting it serves best as a portfolio diversifier, typically comprising 5-10% of total investments. Future inflationary pressures and falling real yields could potentially drive gold prices higher, but short-term swings necessitate a cautious, dollar-cost averaging approach.

          <p>Prince Andrew's ceremonial banner, emblazoned with his coat of arms and symbolizing his membership in the prestigious Order of the Garter, has been taken down from St George's Chapel within Windsor Castle. This removal occurs in the wake of his recent decision to relinquish his Garter membership and discontinue the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York. These actions were prompted by the posthumous publication of Virginia Giuffre's memoir, which reignited allegations of sexual assault against the prince, claims he vehemently denies. Andrew is now under mounting pressure to surrender additional privileges, such as the formal removal of his remaining titles and his residency at Royal Lodge. Furthermore, the Metropolitan Police are actively investigating reports that he attempted to obtain personal information about Ms. Giuffre via his police protection detail.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen has incurred a significant setback for the World Series as key left-handed reliever Alex Vesia was officially excluded from the roster due to a "deeply personal family matter." Vesia, who has been a trusted arm for the team, particularly from the left side, is not anticipated to rejoin the series, as the option of placing him on the Family Medical Emergency List for a potential later return was not exercised. In response to his absence, the Dodgers have bolstered their relief corps by adding hard-throwing right-handers Edgardo Henriquez and Will Klein. This roster adjustment represents a considerable challenge for the team's pitching strategy, especially considering Vesia's crucial role in high-leverage situations throughout the postseason.</p>

The driver of the truck was wounded in the stomach and is currently being held for a mental health evaluation, after initially fleeing the scene and then returning. This dramatic incident unfolded amidst a day-long standoff between demonstrators and officers, which persisted despite President Trump's earlier announcement that a planned immigration surge in San Francisco had been called off.

          <p>Federal workers across the nation, encompassing both furloughed employees and essential staff compelled to work without pay, are experiencing severe financial hardship and profound uncertainty as the government shutdown extends into its 24th day. Essential employees, such as Social Security Administration representative Jill Hornick, are grappling with the absence of paychecks, ineligibility for unemployment benefits, and the persistent burden of daily living expenses like fuel and childcare. Many are resorting to drastic measures, including eliminating all "nonessential spending" and seeking leniency from mortgage lenders and other creditors. The prolonged political impasse is significantly eroding the long-held perception of government jobs as "safe" and forcing countless families to "hunker down" and meticulously conserve every penny, vividly illustrating the profound personal impact of Washington's stalemate.</p>

Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also came in softer than anticipated at 3.0% annually.

          <p>Alabama's execution of Anthony Boyd via nitrogen hypoxia, a method previously presented as humane, has been described as "spectacularly brutal," with reports indicating Boyd gasped for air over 200 times and took more than 30 minutes to die. This incident, following other deeply troubled nitrogen suffocations, intensifies serious concerns regarding the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Boyd, who consistently asserted his innocence and chaired a prisoner-led advocacy group for death penalty abolition, had presciently criticized courts for prioritizing "killing machines" over justice. Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan had dissented from his final appeal, powerfully articulating the inherent torture of such an execution. The article concludes that the pursuit of a humane execution method is fundamentally absurd, suggesting that judicial indifference may lead to further suffering.</p>

Collins had explicitly informed police in December 2023, prior to the charges being filed, that he was unable to use the term "enemy." While Conservative leaders attribute the case's failure to the current Labour government, Labour officials contend that the newly published evidence validates their consistent position that the government's official stance at the time of the alleged offenses was the pertinent factor.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has officially announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will result in an average increase of approximately $56 per month for Social Security retirement benefits starting in January.

However, for many who heavily depend on these payments, the size of the COLA may not entirely alleviate the ongoing challenges posed by higher prices. The 2026 COLA is consistent with expert projections and represents a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025.

However, lenders may exhibit reluctance to fully pass on these modest 25-basis-point cuts if inflationary pressures continue or intensify. Prospective homebuyers and current owners considering refinancing are encouraged to secure a mortgage now if current rates are within their budget.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have unveiled astonishing and wide-ranging allegations in a significant NBA gambling scandal, detailing sophisticated high-tech cheating methods, deep connections to organized crime, and the illicit use of insider information to manipulate bets. The charges implicate a current Portland Trail Blazers coach, a retired NBA player, and three New York Mafia families, who allegedly rigged underground poker games using advanced devices such as poker chip trays capable of secretly reading cards and glasses that could detect special markings. Furthermore, NBA figures are accused of exchanging non-public information, including player injury statuses or intentions to exit games early, enabling gamblers to place lucrative prop bets. This scandal exposes extensive corruption, extending beyond individual player performance manipulation to encompass organized crime and the exploitation of confidential knowledge for substantial financial gain.</p>
