          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration's intention to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, citing concerns about antisemitism and discrimination on campus. This action escalates Trump's ongoing campaign against elite schools, which involves threats to withhold federal research grants unless significant changes are made to grant the administration more oversight. The administration had previously frozen $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard, leading to a lawsuit by the university, which called the government's actions "unprecedented and improper." The decision to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status is expected to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Legal experts and former prosecutors are raising concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleging that it has become President Trump's "personal law firm." Critics claim Bondi and top DoJ lawyers have halted major prosecutions, forced out lawyers who didn't meet Maga litmus tests, and investigated Democratic fundraising vehicles at Trump's direction. The transformation of the DoJ has prioritized personal loyalty to Trump, damaging the rule of law and provoking rebukes from courts. Bondi has also echoed Trump's rhetoric against judges who rule against his administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The article discusses Canada's struggle to maintain its progressive image in the face of rising populism and political shifts. It highlights how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's commitment to the country's myth of tolerance and progressivism has been challenged by domestic and foreign policy decisions. The article suggests that Canada's negotiated past and branded present are increasingly at odds, particularly with the rise of figures like Pierre Poilievre, whose rhetoric echoes that of Donald Trump. The author argues that Canada must confront the truth about its moral rot and stop lying to itself if it wants to hold onto its sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's recent comments regarding potential trade talks with the United States are aimed at increasing pressure on Washington, not signaling a softening of Beijing's stance. China has stated that the U.S. should remove tariffs imposed on Chinese goods to demonstrate sincerity, which analysts interpret as a condition for any trade discussions. Despite acknowledging U.S. overtures for talks, Beijing remains in no rush to engage, placing the onus on the U.S. to address its trade practices.</p>

          <p>Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has reported that global press freedoms are at an "all-time low" in 2025, with a notable deterioration in the United States under President Donald Trump. The report indicates that over half the world's population lives in countries with a "very serious" situation regarding press freedom. RSF criticizes the Trump administration for weaponizing institutions, cutting support for independent media, and sidelining reporters, including defunding public news outlets like NPR and PBS. Europe remains the safest place for journalists, although Germany has fallen in the rankings due to an increasingly hostile environment for media professionals.</p>

While describing the talks as positive, Ishiba acknowledged remaining gaps between the two nations and emphasized the need for both sides to exert maximum effort. Japan seeks exemption from higher tariffs on car imports and a review of President Trump's tariff policy, while the U.S. is pushing for greater access to Japan's auto and farm sectors. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato suggested that Japan could use its holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a bargaining chip.</p>

          <p>A Chinese businessman at the Canton Fair expressed his frustration with President Trump's tariffs, arguing that they unfairly punish China for its manufacturing prowess. He believes the tariffs are not about bringing manufacturing back to America but about suppressing China's ability to produce affordable goods. The businessman reports a significant drop in U.S. orders due to the tariffs, which have reached 145% on all Chinese imports. While acknowledging the potential for tough times ahead, he expressed confidence in the resilience of the Chinese people.</p>

          <p>Following a better-than-expected jobs report for April, President Donald Trump renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Trump argued that there is no inflation and the Fed should lower its rate to spur growth. This marks a continuation of Trump's efforts to influence the central bank's decision-making, although he has recently scaled back his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump's message contrasts with his response to news of the U.S. economy contracting, for which he blamed former President Joe Biden.</p>

Temu has announced it will stop shipping low-cost items from China directly to US consumers, and Shein has reportedly started increasing prices.

          <p>A ship carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza was damaged by explosions off the coast of Malta, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. The group, which challenges Israel’s blockade of Gaza, reported that the ship, called the Conscience, was struck by armed drones, causing a fire and breach in the hull. The crew remained on board, and a tug vessel helped extinguish the blaze. The Israeli military has blocked past attempts by pro-Palestinian activists to bring aid to Gaza, and the Freedom Flotilla Coalition has called on the international community to condemn the attack.</p>

          <p>Novartis AG has agreed to acquire U.S. biotech firm Regulus Therapeutics Inc. in a deal valued at up to $1.7 billion. The Swiss company will pay $7 a share in cash up-front, totaling $800 million, and Regulus Therapeutics shareholders will receive a contingent value right for an additional $900 million if regulatory approval is secured for farabursen, a treatment for ADPKD. Novartis is seeking deals to boost sales beyond 2025, and the acquisition will help bring farabursen to market. The deal has been approved by both boards and is expected to close in the second half of 2025.</p>

The report comes amid an uncertain economic climate due to Trump's tariffs, but traders have pushed out expectations for an interest rate cut until July.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is bracing for President Trump's tariffs to negatively impact growth while potentially stoking inflation, which is keeping interest rate cuts at bay for the time being. A solid labor market has allowed the Fed to hold off on interest rate cuts, but Trump's tariffs risk upending that. The central bank is now assessing whether the surge in consumer prices will be temporary or lead to persistently higher inflation. The latest jobs report is welcome news for officials, but they will need to see clear evidence that the economy is weakening before restarting interest rate cuts.</p>

The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.

The court upheld a previous ruling that allowed the British government to scale back his tax-funded close protection detail after he stepped down as a working member of the royal family. Harry argued that private bodyguards are insufficient to protect him and his family, but the court found that his "sense of grievance" did not translate into a legal argument for challenging the previous decision.</p>
