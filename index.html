          <p>Headlines across UK newspapers are dominated by reactions to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spending Review, with varying perspectives on its impact. Some papers warn of impending tax increases to fund the NHS and other initiatives, while others criticize the review as a reckless spending spree that will burden future generations. The NHS, defense, and education are highlighted as major beneficiaries, though some departments face budget cuts, and some reports suggest the police and armed forces are being sacrificed. Overall, the Spending Review is seen as a rejection of austerity, but concerns remain about its long-term sustainability and potential consequences for public services. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended a performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center, facing a mix of cheers and boos from the audience against a backdrop of protests in Los Angeles. The appearance, intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, was met with irony given the musical's themes of revolution and authoritarianism. Trump's presence at the Kennedy Center, which he recently took control of, also drew attention to falling ticket sales and performer cancellations. The event was marked by cultural ignorance from some of Trump's allies and served as a surreal combination of theatre and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>A former Mace B cruise missile launch site in Onna, Okinawa, has been reopened to the public, revealing a dark legacy of the Cold War era. The site, one of four constructed during the U.S. military occupation, highlights the deployment of nuclear weapons on the island despite anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan. The missiles stationed there had the capability to strike China and parts of the Soviet Union, underscoring the tensions of the time.

          <p>Japan continues to lag behind other G7 nations in gender equality, ranking 118th out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap report by the World Economic Forum. While there was some improvement in women's economic participation, Japan's low ranking in political empowerment, due to limited female representation in government, contributed to its overall poor performance. The report estimates that it will take 123 years to achieve full gender parity globally. The report highlights the slow progress Japan has made in narrowing the gender gap since the report's inception.</p>

However, some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget cuts. The government hopes that increased spending in key areas will reassure voters, but many departments will have to manage with tight day-to-day spending allocations.</p>
