          <p>Axel Rudakubana, the 18-year-old convicted of murdering three young girls in Southport, is under investigation for allegedly attacking a prison officer by throwing boiling water over them. The officer was hospitalized as a precaution and later discharged. This incident has heightened concerns about prison officer safety, especially following a similar attack by the Manchester Arena bomber. Data indicates that assaults on prison staff in England and Wales are at a decade-high, prompting the Justice Secretary to consider measures like tasers and body armor. Rudakubana is serving a minimum sentence of 52 years for his crimes.</p>

          <p>The leaders of France, Germany, Britain, and Poland made a joint visit to Kyiv to demonstrate European unity and support for Ukraine, urging Russia to agree to a 30-day cease-fire. This marks the first time these four nations have traveled together to Ukrainian soil, and the first visit for the new German chancellor. The leaders voiced support for President Trump's call for a cease-fire and plan to hold a virtual meeting with other Western heads of government to discuss a "coalition of the willing" to secure Ukraine. Discussions include the possibility of deploying Western forces to Ukraine to help regenerate Ukraine's armed forces after any peace deal and strengthen confidence in any future peace.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has implemented a strategy to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how, using economic warfare tactics such as export controls and antimonopoly laws. China has ramped up exports and deepened its position as the worldâ€™s leading manufacturing base, directing the central bank to lend nearly $2 trillion to industrial borrowers. This strategy allows China to retaliate against countries imposing tariffs by restricting critical mineral and magnet exports. While China still relies on the West for advanced technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain is redefining its relationship with the world and challenging U.S. supremacy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and cut tens of thousands of federal jobs, stating that the overhaul was not authorized by Congress. The judge sided with unions, non-profits, and local governments who filed a lawsuit, imposing a 14-day pause on the layoffs. The ruling emphasizes that while the President can seek changes to executive branch agencies, it must be done lawfully and with Congressional approval. The administration's plans, led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed to eliminate duplicate roles and automate tasks.</p>

          <p>China's top security officials have called for the country's security and law enforcement apparatus to "shoulder their responsibility with passion" due to increasing external tensions impacting internal stability. A top official emphasized the need for fairness, justice, peace, and security, requiring improvements in work discipline, coordination, and ability within the political and legal team. The Chinese law enforcement system is ordered to swear "absolute loyalty" to the Communist Party and President Xi Jinping, ensuring adherence to party decisions and prohibitions. This comes as the country faces new changes in international and domestic situations, making the task of maintaining national security more challenging.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, it has been adrift in space for 53 years. The spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and cloaked in a protective heat shield, was designed to survive a plunge through the Venusian atmosphere, meaning it has a good chance of surviving re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. While the exact landing location is unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are meeting with Chinese officials in Geneva to de-escalate trade tensions. The goal is to reduce tariffs imposed by both countries, which have disrupted trade and negatively impacted financial markets. President Trump has suggested lowering tariffs to 80%, but prospects for a major breakthrough remain uncertain. The talks aim to find a way to scale back tariffs and relieve pressure on companies dependent on U.S.-China trade.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is expected to introduce new measures aimed at reducing UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The proposals may include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, restricting visa applications from nationalities with high overstay rates, and extending the waiting period for migrants to apply for permanent residency. Additionally, the white paper is likely to include stricter English language requirements for immigrants and highlight new rules for recruiting international care workers. The government is also reviewing how the "right to a family life" is applied in immigration cases.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors released records detailing key moments in a corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, including a warrant to search a phone for evidence of fraud related to his mayoral campaigns. However, the Trump administration ordered the case to be abandoned, leading to criticism of a potential quid pro quo involving the dismissal of charges in exchange for help with immigration policies. The documents reveal an investigation focused on the mayor's fundraising and connections to Turkey, including allegations of obstruction and witness tampering. Ultimately, the charges against Adams were dismissed, but the case highlighted the complexities of political investigations and executive power.</p>

The restraining order affects 20 federal agencies, including OMB, SSA, and the departments of State, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. This halts the administration's efforts to cut bureaucratic bloat, which federal unions and Democratic lawmakers view as disruptive to public services.</p>
