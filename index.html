          <p>A lightning-sparked wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, is rapidly spreading near Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, having burned over 10,900 acres. The blaze has forced the evacuation of residents and visitors from the park's North Rim, which is now closed. Officials report the fire is zero percent contained, with dangerous conditions fueled by extreme heat and high winds. The wildfire threat is widespread, with other fires also causing evacuations in nearby Colorado, highlighting a challenging period for fire crews in the region.</p>

Using a new "Frequently Asked Questions" page, the central bank refutes claims of extravagance, such as the construction of new VIP dining rooms. The response comes after officials like OMB Director Russell Vought attacked the project's cost overruns and features. The Fed clarifies that cost increases are due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos and design changes, and notes the project is self-funded, not taxpayer-funded. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Arizona resident has died from pneumonic plague, marking the first fatal case in Coconino County since 2007. Health officials stated that the risk to the general public remains low. Pneumonic plague is the most severe form of the disease, caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium, but it is now rare and treatable with modern antibiotics. Officials are reminding the public of preventative measures, such as avoiding contact with dead animals and using insect repellent to protect against infected fleas, which can transmit the disease.</p>

Key themes supporting market optimism include the administration's deregulatory stance, which fosters M&A activity, and its relatively hands-off approach to the rapidly growing artificial intelligence sector.

The suspect, identified as Giuseppe Palermo, was apprehended in Bogota and is accused of overseeing large cocaine shipments from Latin America to Europe. Palermo was wanted under an Interpol red notice and is believed to be a key figure in controlling trafficking routes for the secretive criminal organization. The 'ndrangheta is considered one of the world's most influential crime syndicates, particularly in the global cocaine trade.</p>

          <p>Two fathers have initiated legal steps to challenge the UK government's guidance on smartphone use in schools, arguing for a complete ban. They contend that the current policy, which lets headteachers decide, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harms like cyberbullying and exposure to explicit content. The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, signaling their intent to seek a judicial review. The Department for Education responded that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides further protections.</p>

          <p>The New Hollywood String Quartet is holding its annual summer festival to celebrate its 25th anniversary and pay tribute to its namesake, the original Hollywood String Quartet of the 1940s and 50s. The festival features performances of repertoire made famous by the original group, which was composed of top studio musicians who balanced film work with classical performance. The event, introduced by conductor Leonard Slatkin, son of the original quartet's founders, celebrates a legacy of genre-busting musicianship that helped establish Los Angeles as a serious center for classical music.</p>

          <p>The initial investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed a perplexing detail: both engine fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff. This action starved the engines of fuel, leading to a total loss of power and the subsequent crash that killed 260 people. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so. Investigators are now focused on why this critical action, normally performed only after landing, occurred during ascent.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched another large-scale aerial assault on Ukraine, firing hundreds of drones and dozens of cruise missiles overnight into Saturday. The attacks, part of an intensifying bombing campaign, killed at least six people and wounded many more in several regions, including Chernivtsi, Lviv, and Kharkiv. Ukrainian air defense successfully intercepted a significant number of the projectiles. The long-range strikes coincide with a renewed Russian push along the front line, where Ukrainian forces are facing immense pressure from the sustained offensive.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has begun a major workforce reduction, laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan. The cuts are part of a larger plan to reduce the domestic workforce by about 15% and eliminate or merge numerous offices, including those focused on human rights, refugees, and foreign assistance. The Trump administration asserts the changes are necessary to streamline bureaucracy and improve efficiency. Critics, including Democratic senators and employee associations, argue the layoffs will weaken American diplomacy and national security.</p>

According to sources, the firings are part of a broader purge of officials associated with the probes, which has caused alarm among career employees at the Department of Justice. The move is seen by some as part of an effort by the administration to address what it calls the "weaponization of government."
