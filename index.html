          <p>President Trump approved plans for a potential attack on Iran, but has not yet decided whether to execute them, pending possible negotiations with Tehran regarding its nuclear program. Sources indicate Trump prefers to delay a final decision, leaving room for diplomatic resolutions. Iran has asserted it will not negotiate under duress and will respond to any threats. The U.S. has reportedly assisted Israel in intercepting Iranian missiles, and Iran has prepared missiles targeting U.S. bases in the Middle East, should the U.S. join Israel's offensive. The situation remains tense, with Trump stating his patience is wearing thin, but he is open to a deal to end Iran's nuclear program. </p>

          <p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will discontinue the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's specialized support for LGBTQ+ youth in July. SAMHSA stated that the decision aims to focus on serving all help seekers, rather than siloing LGBTQ+ youth services, and that all callers will continue to receive compassionate and culturally competent crisis counseling. The Trevor Project, which supported the specialized program, criticized the decision, noting that it will eliminate life-saving services for over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people. Studies indicate that LGBTQ+ youth experience higher rates of mental health challenges and suicidal thoughts compared to their peers. </p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals that official U.S. records significantly underestimate mortality and life expectancy disparities for Native Americans. The research found that the life expectancy of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations is 6.5 years lower than the national average, a figure nearly three times greater than reported by the CDC. Racial misclassification, where AI/AN deaths are incorrectly recorded as "White," contributes to skewed statistics. The study underscores the need for accurate data collection and targeted interventions to address health disparities in AI/AN communities. </p>

          <p>A disagreement has surfaced between President Trump and his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. Gabbard maintains that U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon, while Trump asserts that Iran is "very close" to having one. This divergence highlights a growing rift within Trump's "America First" movement over whether the U.S. should intervene in the Israel-Iran conflict. The situation echoes the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq War, where intelligence findings were used to justify military action. </p>

He promoted false hopes that clients' sentences would be reduced when it was highly unlikely. Spolin persuaded inmates' families to pay fees of up to $30,000 for services that had little to no chance of freeing them. </p>
