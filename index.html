        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led a high-profile civil fraud case against the former president, has been criminally indicted by a federal grand jury. The charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, allege bank fraud and making false statements related to a mortgage loan for a property in Norfolk. James and her supporters have condemned the indictment as a politically motivated act of retribution, pointing to the president's public calls for her prosecution and the appointment of his former personal attorney to oversee the case. The charges carry a potential sentence of up to 30 years in prison per count if she is convicted.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois for 14 days. The ruling came after state and local leaders, including the governor and Chicago's mayor, filed a lawsuit objecting to the deployment as unconstitutional and unnecessary. U.S. District Judge April Perry cited a lack of credible evidence for an organized rebellion and found the Department of Homeland Security's assessment unreliable. The judge stated that deploying troops, who are not trained for law enforcement, would likely escalate tensions rather than restore order in the community.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured their spot in the National League Championship Series with a dramatic 2-1 walk-off win against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4. The game, an intense pitchers' duel that extended into the 11th inning, ended on a critical throwing error by Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering. With the bases loaded, Kerkering fielded a dribbler but his errant throw home allowed the winning run to score, concluding the series 3-1 in favor of the Dodgers. The victory was the culmination of a tense game featuring strong starting pitching and key relief appearances from both teams.</p>

          <p>Shares for South Korean semiconductor giants SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics surged to record highs, with SK Hynix jumping 10% and Samsung rising nearly 6%. This significant market rally is attributed to a series of deals in the artificial intelligence sector, including a potential partnership between OpenAI and AMD, which has boosted investor confidence in chip manufacturers. The positive momentum was also supported by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's recent comments confirming strong demand and the company's involvement in funding AI startups. The gains highlight the immense impact of the AI boom on the global technology and financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Liberty guard Natasha Cloud has warned that the WNBA's edge in social activism is declining, contrasting the current climate with the pivotal 2020 season. She recalled how players in the bio-secure bubble used their platform to protest social injustice and claimed their collective voice helped to "save democracy" during a turbulent year. Cloud expressed concern that in the last few years, the league's players have become less vocal, potentially to protect their careers and families.

          <p>In Virginia's sole gubernatorial debate, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger engaged in a fiery exchange on several contentious topics. Earle-Sears aggressively questioned Spanberger's stance on recent violent political rhetoric from a fellow Democrat, while also pressing her on cultural issues like transgender students in sports. Spanberger sought to strike a bipartisan tone, denouncing all political violence and criticizing the ongoing federal government shutdown's impact on Virginia's large population of federal employees. The debate highlighted deep stylistic and policy divisions ahead of an election often seen as a national bellwether.</p>

          <p>Maine's term-limited Democratic Governor, Janet Mills, is expected to announce her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, challenging longtime Republican incumbent Susan Collins. This move sets the stage for one of the most anticipated and crucial races in the upcoming midterm elections, with significant implications for the Senate's party balance. Mills, a top recruit for national Democrats, gained prominence for her public disagreements with President Trump. Her entry into the race could provide Democrats a key opportunity to flip a Republican-held seat in a state that has been trending Democratic in recent presidential elections.</p>

Although the powerful Motion Picture Association opposed the measure, it passed with unanimous support.

          <p>The United States is sending approximately 200 military personnel to Israel to support and monitor the newly approved ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. According to senior U.S. officials, these troops will establish a civil-military coordination center to oversee the agreement and facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid, as well as logistical and security assistance into Gaza. The officials emphasized that no U.S. troops will be deployed inside Gaza itself. This deployment is part of a multinational effort that will also include partner nations to help ensure compliance with the peace deal and support the transition to a civilian government.</p>

          <p>At the authorization of Governor Bill Lee, 150 members of the Tennessee National Guard will mobilize in Memphis to support a multi-agency anti-crime task force. This state-sanctioned deployment contrasts with federally directed deployments in other cities like Chicago, which have faced legal challenges from local officials. The guardsmen in Memphis will not be on patrol or making arrests but will provide support to existing partnerships between federal agencies and local police. The task force's priorities include enforcing violent crime and federal immigration laws, reflecting the administration's broader strategy of using citizen-soldiers in major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Drake against Universal Music Group concerning the release of Kendrick Lamar's diss track, "Not Like Us." Drake had alleged that the song, which accused him of predatory behavior, was defamatory and endangered his life, and that UMG's promotion of it was meant to devalue his own music. However, U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled that a "reasonable listener" would not interpret the lyrics as objective facts, given the context of a highly publicized rap battle. A spokesperson for Drake has stated that the rapper plans to appeal the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a series of new animal welfare laws aimed at restricting deceptive puppy sales and increasing protections for buyers. The legislation, prompted by a news investigation, bans online marketplaces where dogs are sold by brokers and voids contracts that require nonrefundable deposits. Another law mandates that pet sellers share health certificates with state authorities for public access, increasing transparency about a puppy's origin. These measures are designed to close loopholes that allowed out-of-state commercial breeders, or puppy mills, to sell animals through resellers who often posed as small, local operators.</p>

          <p>The ASEAN+3 group, comprising ten Southeast Asian nations plus China, Japan, and South Korea, demonstrated solid economic growth in the first half of 2025, according to a new report. The Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) revised its growth projection for 2025 upward to 4.1%, citing better-than-expected performance despite global headwinds. However, AMRO's chief economist warned against complacency, emphasizing that unpredictable trade policy shifts, particularly from the United States, still pose a high risk to the region's economic stability. The U.S. has imposed significant tariffs on many of the group's member countries.</p>

          <p>Firefighters and waste management experts are warning of a dangerous trend of fires in trash bins, garbage trucks, and recycling facilities caused by improperly discarded vaping devices. The lithium-ion batteries in these devices can easily ignite, leading to a significant increase in fires, with July marking the highest number of incidents since tracking began in 2016. This "vape effect" poses a serious safety risk to workers and disrupts waste collection services. Officials are urging the public to dispose of vapes and other battery-containing electronics at designated drop-off locations rather than in regular trash or recycling bins.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's controversial deployment of the National Guard in Democratic-led cities is facing critical legal tests in federal courts. In Chicago, a judge temporarily blocked the deployment, questioning the credibility of the government's justification, while a court in Portland, Oregon, is also hearing arguments against the move. Local leaders in both cities have sued, arguing that the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement without state consent is unconstitutional. The White House has defended the deployments as a necessary measure to protect federal agents and property amid ongoing protests and immigration enforcement operations.</p>
