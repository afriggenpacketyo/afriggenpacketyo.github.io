          <h2>UK Government Eases Sanctions on Syrian Entities to Aid Reconstruction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 13:18:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has lifted asset freezes on Syrian government bodies, including the defense and interior ministries, aiming to stimulate investment and rebuild Syria's economy following the overthrow of President Assad. While sanctions on individuals involved in repressing civilians and the Captagon trade remain, the move seeks to encourage the return of Syrian refugees and foster stability. The Foreign Office emphasized its commitment to supporting a political transition in Syria, including human rights protection and humanitarian aid access. This decision aligns with similar actions by the EU and the US to gradually ease sanctions imposed after the 2011 crackdown on pro-democracy protests.</p>

          <p>Orders for durable goods in the U.S. experienced a significant surge of 9.2% in March, driven by companies accelerating purchases ahead of anticipated tariffs. The increase was particularly notable in transportation equipment, including a 139% rise in nondefense aircraft and parts, as well as autos and appliances. While the report indicates a pull-forward effect due to tariff threats, a Federal Reserve report showed broader apprehension about economic conditions. Despite stable jobless claims, the burst in durable goods orders may not reflect the long-term economic environment.</p>

The settlement pertains to individuals who entered the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and sought asylum. The administration argued the deportation was justified under the Alien Enemies Act due to Cristian's alleged gang affiliation and a cocaine possession conviction, but the judge called the deportation a "breach of contract".</p>
