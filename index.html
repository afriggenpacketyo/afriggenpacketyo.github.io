          <p>The U.S. labor market remained stable in May, with employers adding 139,000 jobs, exceeding economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% for the third consecutive month. While job growth was slightly weaker compared to previous months, the data suggests the job market is holding up despite concerns about the impact of tariffs, particularly in healthcare, leisure, and hospitality industries. Experts caution that economic challenges may still lie ahead, and the Federal Reserve is likely to remain cautious about interest rate cuts given these mixed signals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China has authorized a limited number of export licenses for rare earth minerals and magnets, which are essential components in various industries. Despite this move, supplies of these critical materials remain scarce, causing concern for factories in Western countries that are facing potential shortages. The move comes amid ongoing trade tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities that have highlighted the importance of diversifying sources for these strategic resources.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to arm clans in Gaza who oppose Hamas has drawn criticism and concern, with opponents warning of potential repercussions. Former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman likened the armed groups to ISIS, raising fears that the weapons could be turned against Israel. Netanyahu defended the move as a way to save the lives of Israeli forces, while Hamas condemned the arming of what they consider "mercenary gangs." The situation has sparked debate over the long-term consequences and the potential for destabilizing the region further.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow it to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education and laying off over 1,000 employees. This request follows a lower court's decision to block the administration's actions, arguing that the reduction in force was an attempt to unilaterally close the department, violating the separation of powers. The Justice Department argues that the district court is overstepping its authority by interfering with the Executive Branch's management decisions. The administration aims to transfer the department's functions to other agencies, such as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

          <p>The Freedom of the Press Foundation, supported by prominent lawyers, is pressuring Paramount Global to abandon settlement talks with President Trump regarding his $20 billion lawsuit against CBS and "60 Minutes." The lawsuit, considered frivolous by First Amendment experts, stems from the news division's coverage of Trump. Concerns arise that a settlement could compromise CBS News' credibility to gain favor with the Trump administration for FCC approval of Paramount's sale to Skydance Media. Legal experts argue a settlement could violate fiduciary duties to shareholders and federal anti-bribery statutes.</p>

          <p>A review reveals the California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, operates with significant secrecy compared to other insurers. The plan doesn't publicly disclose basic financial data, and its board meetings, minutes, audits, and reports are kept secret. This lack of transparency raises concerns as new rules mean all property insurance holders now cover the FAIR Plan's debts. The FAIR Plan recently collected $1 billion from member companies, half of which can be passed to ratepayers, prompting calls for greater accountability and openness.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio's absence from preparations for the call between President Trump and President Xi, as well as subsequent trade talk announcements, has raised questions about his influence on US-China relations. Trump described the call as "very positive" and named Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer as future negotiators. This shift, driven by economic pragmatism and Trump's deal-making preference, suggests a diminished role for Rubio, who has previously been a vocal critic of China. The focus on trade talks signals a prioritization of economic issues in the bilateral relationship.</p>

The ban is also seen as alienating allies and undermining the U.S.'s reputation on the global stage. The policy is part of a broader effort to restrict immigration and appeal to Trump's conservative base.</p>
