          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals a rise in Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet approval rating to 37%, up from 31.7% in May.  This increase is largely attributed to public support for a revised farming policy aimed at boosting rice production to address record-high prices and shortages.  However, a significant portion of respondents still deem the government's response to rising rice prices as insufficient. The improved rating precedes the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>
