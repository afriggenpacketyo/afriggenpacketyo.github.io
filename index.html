            <p>China's C909 passenger jet is expanding its reach in Southeast Asia, with VietJet commencing commercial operations using two of the aircraft. This move makes Vietnam the third Southeast Asian nation to adopt the Chinese-made planes, following Indonesia and Laos. The jets, leased from Chengdu Airlines, will operate on domestic routes within Vietnam, enhancing VietJet Air's fleet capacity and supporting the country's growing air transport market. This expansion follows Vietnamese regulatory reforms allowing airlines to import aircraft certified by various countries, broadening the scope beyond the US and EU.</p>

            <p>Two people died in Moore, Oklahoma, after heavy rainfall caused severe flooding that swept vehicles off the road. The victims, an adult female and a 12-year-old child, were found outside one of the submerged vehicles after a search and rescue operation. The flooding occurred as more than 30 million Americans were under alert for severe weather over Easter weekend, with several states in the Heartland experiencing tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds, prompting officials to urge residents to stay home.</p>

            <p>While tongue-scraping is a practice aimed at improving dental hygiene, some experts are warning of potential heart health risks associated with it. Dr. Bradley Serwer cautions that tongue-scraping can cause macroscopic cuts on the tongue, potentially introducing bacteria into the bloodstream and increasing the risk of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. It's advised to practice gentle tongue-scraping in moderation, as overdoing it can lower nitric oxide levels, which are important for heart health, and it should not be a substitute for brushing and flossing.</p>

            <p>A Texas Easter tradition involves making and breaking cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, which has been a part of Texan Easter celebrations since the state was part of Mexico. For Denise Solis, the tradition is a powerful connection to her late mother. Cascarones are a symbol of rebirth, and breaking them over each other's heads brings joy and laughter. Solis now carries on this tradition with her own child, and hiding the cascarones in the backyard, and watching her son and his friends cover each other in confetti, she feels the love and connection to her mother.</p>

            <p>China is taking a more active role in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, a departure from its usual non-interference policy in African affairs. Beijing, through its UN ambassador, has directly urged Kigali to cease its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC. This shift is driven by China's need to protect its significant mining interests in the region and maintain relationships with both countries, demonstrating a nuanced approach to balancing its economic and diplomatic objectives.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to American consumers for packages worth over $800 due to increased red tape at customs following the introduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to multi-day delays for shipments. While business-to-business shipments will still proceed, the White House is set to clamp down further on low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, impacting companies like Shein and Temu, who have warned of potential price increases. The measures are aimed at addressing illicit substances and deceptive shipping practices, particularly concerning synthetic opioids.</p>

            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Trump's demands for Harvard to reorganize its governance and hire faculty to ensure viewpoint diversity are a form of political bullying. The author argues that Trump's demands are a form of social engineering that conservatives normally denounce, suggesting that the person best qualified for a job should get it. He suggests that the solutions proffered, often threaten to make the problem worse, and what is needed is to rethink what is meant by social and political engagement.</p>

The decision to list in New York was driven by higher valuation and the growing popularity of Japanese culture, boosted by inbound tourism and the yen's depreciation.</p>
