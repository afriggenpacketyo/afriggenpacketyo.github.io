          <p>Prominent human microbiome scientist Wang Leyao has announced her departure from a beleaguered U.S. government agency to take on a senior research fellow position in China at the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (Smart). Previously an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and an NIH climate and health scholar, her move underscores the growing challenges within the U.S. medical research landscape. The NIH, in particular, has been plagued by controversy, funding reductions, and policy alterations since the start of President Donald Trump's second term, leaving a significant number of researchers uncertain about their future. This transition could signal broader implications for scientific talent mobility between the two nations amidst differing research environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has delivered a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration policies by blocking the nationwide expansion of fast-track deportations, citing critical due process concerns. The ruling halts a directive that sought to apply expedited removal procedures to migrants anywhere in the U.S. and to those who had arrived within the last two years, a substantial broadening from its previous scope at border areas. This decision, which the Department of Homeland Security vows to appeal, severely curtails the administration's ability to quickly deport individuals without allowing them access to an immigration judge. The court emphasized that while the expedited removal statute is not inherently unconstitutional, its application to a large population in the country's interior necessitates robust due process protections that the current procedures lack.</p>

          <p>Twenty-four-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic secured his spot in the US Open last 16, overcoming Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match despite battling a lower back injury. Djokovic, seeking a record 25th major title, required medical attention early on but demonstrated his resilience and skill to win 6-4 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-3. Norrie, who has consistently fallen to the Serb, expressed a touch of overconfidence after an early break in the third set, which Djokovic quickly countered. For Norrie, this defeat still marks a positive trajectory in his career, having made significant progress after a challenging start to the year due to injury.</p>

          <p>South Korea has officially indicted its former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, on a range of serious charges including bribery and stock manipulation, with alleged criminal proceeds exceeding 1 billion won (about $720,000). The indictment details a stock manipulation scheme between 2010 and 2012, alongside accusations of conspiring with her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, to illicitly obtain opinion poll data. Furthermore, Kim is implicated in receiving bribes from the Unification Church in exchange for support. These charges are part of a broader crackdown on corruption following Yoon's impeachment and arrest earlier this year for an attempted martial law bid, highlighting a turbulent political landscape in the country.</p>

Regional Governor Sergiy Lysak confirmed the widespread assault, urging residents to immediately seek shelter, following reports of two fatalities from Russian attacks the previous day. While Dnipropetrovsk had largely avoided the heaviest fighting since Russia's February 2022 invasion, Russian troops were confirmed to have entered the region earlier this week, signaling a potential shift in the conflict's intensity. This renewed aggression highlights the ongoing human cost of the war, even amidst international diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire and peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>China has voiced strong opposition to Japan's anticipated deployment of the U.S.-made Typhon intermediate-range missile system during upcoming joint military exercises with the United States. Beijing's foreign ministry warned that such a deployment would significantly undermine the legitimate security interests of other nations, urging Japan and the U.S. to refrain from introducing the system. Analysts interpret this move as a strategic message aimed at Beijing, especially concerning potential conflicts over Taiwan, highlighting escalating tensions in the region. The system is expected to be temporarily deployed at the U.S. Iwakuni base in September before its withdrawal, but China views it as a serious provocation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated a Justice Department paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making a vulgar gesture and disparaging comments towards National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. The dismissal, confirmed by DOJ spokespersons, emphasized that a lack of support for law enforcement is incompatible with the department's values. This incident unfolds against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's controversial deployments of National Guard and federal agents to major cities like Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, and threats to extend such actions to Chicago, all under the premise of addressing crime. The swift firing highlights the administration's zero-tolerance policy regarding perceived disrespect towards military personnel engaged in these domestic operations.</p>

          <p>California and Texas are at the forefront of an escalating national battle over congressional redistricting, a process traditionally occurring once a decade after the U.S. Census. Texas Republicans initiated the mid-decade redrawing to add five more Republican-leaning seats, prompting California Democrats to respond by voting to redraw their maps to boost Democratic representation. Missouri has since joined, with its governor calling a special session to add a Republican seat, following President Trump's call for loyal statehouses to secure Republican control of Congress. This political arms race, often involving gerrymandering, aims to influence the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of next year's midterm elections, with Democrats needing only three seats to flip the chamber.</p>

Despite his distinguished military service, which earned him a Navy Cross and other honors, Cunningham's subsequent eight-term career as a U.S. Congressman ended in profound disgrace. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to accepting $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors in exchange for government contracts, leading to the largest bribery scandal in congressional history at the time and an eight-year prison sentence.

Repairs, totaling approximately $7.9 million, involved installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and advanced drainage systems.

          <p>Rapper Cardi B testified in Los Angeles, denying she attacked a security guard who is suing her for assault, leading to viral moments from the civil trial. Cardi B stated the guard invaded her privacy by filming and revealing her pregnancy, escalating to a verbal altercation but not a physical one. The plaintiff claims Cardi B cut her cheek with a fingernail, causing a 'hyper-sensitive' scar. Cross-examination saw lawyers questioning Cardi B about her wigs and nails, drawing amusement and online debate about potential racist or misogynistic undertones. The trial, expected to conclude next week, highlights the public fascination with celebrity court proceedings.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has vehemently opposed President Trump's reported plan to deploy military forces to Chicago, labeling it an 'invasion' and asserting Trump has motives beyond crime reduction. Pritzker stated there has been no communication from the Trump administration regarding such a deployment, which would echo similar actions in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. The governor suggested Trump's gambit might aim to 'stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections,' calling it an 'attack on the American people.' The White House, however, criticized Pritzker for deflecting from Chicago's crime rate, highlighting escalating tensions between federal and state authorities.</p>

This special election initiative seeks to redraw districts to send more Democrats to Congress, countering President Trump's agenda and Republican gains in other states. Opponents, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and wealthy donors, have already booked over $10 million in airtime, while supporters are aggressively securing their own ad slots. The campaign highlights a national 'redistricting arms race' where states are mid-decade attempting to reshape electoral maps for partisan advantage, potentially determining control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funding, informing House Speaker Mike Johnson that funds for 15 international programs would be withheld. This action, justified by the White House as 'putting AMERICA FIRST!', utilized a rarely used 'pocket rescission' procedure, bypassing congressional approval by letting funds expire before lawmakers could act. Democrats and some Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins, have condemned the move as illegal and an 'apparent attempt to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval,' raising concerns about a potential federal shutdown. The cuts largely target USAID funding and peacekeeping missions, drawing criticism from the United Nations. (not investment advice)</p>

The Power2 charity, which runs the 16-week scheme, believes giving disengaged teenagers responsibility for younger children in a controlled setting fosters accountability and positive role modeling.

          <p>New findings from a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation re-examination suggest that Buford Pusser, the late sheriff who inspired the 'Walking Tall' movies, killed his wife Pauline in 1967, contrary to his long-standing account of her murder by his enemies. Prosecutors state there's enough evidence to indict Pusser if he were alive, also uncovering signs of domestic violence. Inconsistencies between Pusser's story and physical evidence, including blood spatter and the nature of his own wound, led investigators to conclude Pauline was likely shot outside the car and placed inside. This revelation aims to provide closure to Pauline's family, challenging a decades-old narrative.</p>

          <p>CVS and Walgreens are now limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines in several states, requiring prescriptions or not offering them at all, to comply with state guidelines tied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approvals. While the FDA has approved Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax vaccines for seniors and those with health conditions, state-specific laws are creating varied access. For instance, CVS cannot vaccinate even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico. This regulatory complexity means vaccine availability for younger children is also narrowing, with the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations now differing from U.S. government advice, creating confusion for the public.</p>

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine, published in JAMA Network Open, indicates that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently prescribed medication too quickly. The research, which analyzed health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children, found that about 68% received medication before age seven, with 42% prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Clinical guidelines recommend starting with 'behavioral intervention' for young children due to concerns about side effects like irritability and the high likelihood of treatment failure. Researchers emphasize the need for further investigation into the appropriateness of early medication, advocating for non-pharmacological strategies first.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has significantly challenged President Trump's trade policy, ruling that he overstepped his authority by imposing sweeping import taxes on numerous countries under national emergency declarations. The 7-4 decision largely upheld a lower court's finding that these tariffs exceeded the president's power under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). While the ruling doesn't immediately strike down the tariffs, it allows the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This setback could undermine a key pillar of Trump's negotiating strategy and potentially require the U.S. Treasury to refund billions in collected import taxes, raising concerns about future trade policy and economic stability.

California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, condemned the move as 'erratic, vindictive political impulses' that endanger Harris, especially as she embarks on a book tour.
