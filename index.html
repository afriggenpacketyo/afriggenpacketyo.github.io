          <p>President Donald Trump delivered remarks after the White House revealed Saudi Arabia's commitment to invest $600 billion in various deals with the United States, following Trump's visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A significant agreement is a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, providing Saudi Arabia with advanced warfighting equipment and services from numerous U.S. defense firms, almost doubling Saudi Arabia's 2025 defense budget. The deals highlight the strengthening economic ties between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with the defense agreement poised to significantly bolster the Saudi military's capabilities.

          <p>General Motors is set to introduce a new EV battery technology, lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells, aimed at reducing costs and improving the profitability of its electric SUVs and trucks. GM plans to use the new batteries in full-size electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ starting in 2028. These batteries utilize more abundant and cheaper minerals like manganese, reducing the reliance on cobalt and nickel. GM anticipates being the first to market with this technology, which promises to deliver premium range and performance at a more affordable cost.</p>

          <p>Democrats are preparing to place holds on President Trump's Department of Justice nominees, raising concerns about reports that Trump plans to accept an airplane from Qatar for use as Air Force One. Senator Jeanne Shaheen indicated that holds would be placed until the attorney general provides answers regarding the plane. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to announce the Democrats' intention to implement these holds, representing a largely symbolic move to express their disapproval.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, who served almost 38 years for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. The Criminal Cases Review Commission referred Sullivan's case after fresh testing revealed a DNA profile pointing to an unknown attacker in semen samples from the crime scene. Sullivan, now 68, expressed that he was "not angry, I'm not bitter" and that "the truth shall set you free". Merseyside Police has reopened the investigation into Sindall's murder, but searches of the national DNA database have not yielded any matches.</p>

          <p>A trade truce between the U.S. and China was reached as President Donald Trump's tariffs negatively impacted North American and Asian manufacturing. Data from the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index indicates a steep decline in purchasing activity in April following a rush to stockpile supplies. Despite the pause in tariffs, concerns remain among U.S. manufacturers about long-term risks associated with China. The GEP data also reveals an increase in spare capacity across Asian supply chains, while Europe shows signs of industrial recovery.</p>

According to the FTC, businesses selling live-event tickets or short-term lodging must prominently show the total cost upfront, including "all charges or fees the business knows about and can calculate," before asking for payment. The rule aims to provide transparency and fairness, but does not cap or regulate the fees companies can charge.</p>

          <p>A tariff truce between the U.S. and China provides some relief to businesses but also prolongs economic uncertainty. Beginning May 14, the U.S. will reduce its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will lower its tariff on American goods to 10%. The 30% tariff is not permanent and will be reevaluated in 90 days, with the potential for further price hikes. The truce is expected to improve consumer confidence and reduce the odds of a U.S. recession, but companies still face challenges in planning for the future.</p>
