          <p>The Israel Defense Forces reported missile launches from Iran, following earlier U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of aerial attacks that started with Israel's strike on Iran's nuclear program. Iran carried out a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, with no reported casualties. Trump stated that the ceasefire would commence soon, but Iranian officials provided a less definitive statement on the agreement, stating that Iran had stopped its strikes on Israel but that there was no 'agreement' on any ceasefire. The United States struck three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program over the weekend.</p>

Investigators discovered that two dogs died from heatstroke, one from blunt-force trauma, and others had pending necropsies. The couple is accused of animal cruelty and destruction of evidence, with Sit facing 30 counts and Liu facing four; they remain in custody with bail set at $550,000 each. The K9 Academy, operated by Sit, offered training programs ranging from $999 to $3,999, and authorities believe there may be additional victims.</p>

This development followed Iranian missile strikes on a U.S. base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties or damage, and Trump had warned of an overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks on U.S. interests.</p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures to the eastern United States this week, with the National Weather Service describing it as "the first significant heat wave this season." People from the Midwest to the East Coast are advised to prepare for extreme heat through at least Wednesday, with potential risks for those without adequate cooling and hydration. Over 150 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, and including heat advisories, the total number affected is about 200 million. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a heat dome, and experts warn that the initial heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous as the body has not yet adjusted.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in New York are concluding their case in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs. Combs is accused of using his influence to facilitate sexual assault and conceal his crimes, charges he denies despite admitting to domestic violence. Key witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura (Cassie), testified about alleged abuse and coercion, supported by surveillance video and witness accounts. The prosecution aims to prove Combs ran a ‚Äúcriminal enterprise‚Äù to enable his actions, but jurors must weigh conflicting evidence, including loving messages sent by alleged victims, and the defense is expected to present its case briefly.</p>

          <p>China has increased its control over rare earth exports, leading to global shortages, but it has also become reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar. Myanmar accounted for approximately 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year, with a high concentration of heavy rare earth elements. This reliance has strengthened China's dominant position, giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain. China has effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar, leading to environmental and human rights abuses.</p>
