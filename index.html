          <p>A US air strike on a detention center for African migrants in Houthi-controlled Yemen has reportedly killed at least 68 people and injured 47, according to Houthi-run media. The strike, which targeted a center in Saada province, follows an intensification of the US air campaign against the Houthis. US Central Command stated that the strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders, while Houthi authorities report dozens of civilian casualties. The incident raises concerns about the impact of the conflict on vulnerable migrant populations in the region. (optimism score: 5)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that increased infrastructure spending in Germany will not be enough to counteract the negative effects of U.S. tariffs on the euro zone's economic growth.

While Germany's infrastructure spending bill, enabled by exemptions to debt rules, will provide a slight offset, the IMF believes that trade tensions will continue to weigh on the economic outlook.

          <p>Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines is causing carriers to reroute flights, increasing flight times and costs for some routes linking India to Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Some flights may require refueling stops or cancellations, with IndiGo temporarily suspending flights to Almaty and Tashkent. The closure follows heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, but experts believe it is more symbolic than majorly disruptive and unlikely to significantly increase airfares.
