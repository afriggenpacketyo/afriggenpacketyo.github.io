          <p>A shooting at a high school in Graz, Austria, resulted in the deaths of at least ten people, including students and one adult. Police reported that the shooter also died, though the circumstances of their death remain unclear. Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker called it a "national tragedy" and announced three days of national mourning, with flags at half-staff and a national minute of silence planned. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed grief, noting the symbolism of schools as places of youth and hope. Firearms violence is rare in Austria, where gun ownership is tightly regulated. The article highlights Austria's strict gun control laws, detailing the types of weapons that are prohibited and the permits required for owning certain firearms. The optimism score reflects the tragic nature of the event. </p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution released a statement affirming its independence after President Trump announced the firing of National Portrait Gallery head Kim Sajet. The statement, issued after a Board of Regents meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Chief Justice John Roberts, emphasized that personnel decisions are made by the Secretary, with oversight from the Board. This comes after Trump's announcement that he fired Sajet, describing her as a partisan supporter of DEI, which he deemed inappropriate for her position. The museum also addressed concerns about biased content, directing museum directors to ensure unbiased content and report back to the Board. The article provides context about Trump's executive order placing Vance in charge of removing "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian. The optimism score reflects the effort to maintain nonpartisanship. </p>

          <p>A rancher in Leon County, Texas, was airlifted to a hospital after being attacked by a cow, with another person taken by ambulance. Emergency Management officials reported the incident on Facebook, noting the rancher was injured by what they called "an unhappy cow." The article draws a parallel to a previous incident where an Irish man was killed by a rooster with a history of attacking people. This prior incident involved Jasper Kraus, who was attacked by a Brahma chicken that had previously attacked a child, resulting in his death from a wound to his leg. The optimism score is influenced by the severity of the injuries and the unexpected nature of the animal attack. </p>

          <p>The Department of the Interior is requiring the National Park Service (NPS) to post signage at all sites, encouraging visitors to provide feedback on information they feel negatively portrays American history or landscapes.

The signage will include QR codes and other methods for public feedback, with parks also reviewing public-facing content for disparaging portrayals. The review extends to other Department of the Interior groups, excluding Native American lands unless within NPS sites. The optimism score reflects concerns about potential historical revisionism. </p>

The defense team challenged her claims, highlighting loving messages she sent to Combs and her apparent willingness to engage in his sexual fantasies. Jane also testified that she believed Combs was "polyamorous" and that she was jealous of his relationships with other women.

The sanctions, part of a joint move with other nations, include travel bans and asset freezes. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar criticized the decision as "outrageous." Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have also been criticized for their stance on the war in Gaza, opposing aid and calling for Palestinian resettlement outside the territory.
