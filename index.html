          <p>Mhairi Black, the former deputy leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at Westminster, has officially left the party. Black, who became the UK's youngest MP in centuries when elected at age 20, cited disagreements with the party's direction, particularly its stances on transgender rights and the conflict in Palestine. She stated there were too many instances where she disagreed with party strategy, feeling the SNP had "capitulated" on issues important to her. While she remains a strong supporter of Scottish independence, she expressed that she is "done with party politics" for now and feels the party needs to change significantly.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Donald Trump's visit to his Trump International Golf Links in Scotland, local sentiment remains deeply divided. While the resort employs over 80 people and is seen by some as a fantastic addition from a golf perspective, many residents and activists express strong opposition. Neighbors who refused to sell their land during the course's development resent the disruption to the natural landscape and Trump's past behavior. Activists are planning protests, citing that his policies are at odds with Scottish values, and polls indicate a high disapproval rating for him in the country. The visit highlights the ongoing tension between his business interests and his political persona.</p>

          <p>Four Venezuelan men, deported from the United States, have returned home after being held for months in El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (Cecot). They allege they were subjected to severe physical and psychological abuse, including beatings and being forced to eat with their hands, describing the experience as "hell." The men were deported from the U.S. under allegations of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which they deny, claiming they were targeted due to their tattoos. Their release was part of a prisoner exchange involving the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador, which saw 252 Venezuelans freed from the facility.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Hulk Hogan, former WWE broadcaster Jonathan Coachman reminisced about the legendary "Icon vs. Icon" match between Hogan and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson at WrestleMania X8 in 2002. Coachman described the atmosphere as one of the most amazing moments of his career, highlighting how the wrestlers had to improvise and change the match's structure mid-performance. The Toronto crowd unexpectedly cheered for Hogan, who was scripted as the villain, and booed The Rock, forcing the two to communicate in the ring to adjust their roles. This adaptability and the crowd's electric response solidified the match as a pinnacle moment in professional wrestling history.</p>

          <p>France has announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September, becoming the first G7 nation to do so. The decision has been strongly condemned by Israel and the United States, who argue it legitimizes Hamas, but praised by the Palestinian Authority and other nations like Spain. Currently, at least 139 of the 193 UN member states recognize Palestine, with most Western powers maintaining that recognition should only come as part of a comprehensive peace agreement. The move signals a potential shift in European policy, though key allies like Germany have stated they have no immediate plans to follow suit.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike over pay, prompting Health Secretary Wes Streeting to warn of a challenging period for the National Health Service (NHS). While senior doctors are providing cover, the walkout is expected to cause significant disruption, though the NHS aims to maintain more non-urgent services than in previous strikes. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that doctors' pay has effectively fallen by a fifth since 2008 when accounting for inflation, despite recent raises. The government maintains that pay is not open for further negotiation, leading to a stalemate as over a million appointments have already been canceled due to industrial action since March 2023.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a move that legally allows her to serve in the role in an acting capacity. This decision came after a federal district court in New Jersey appointed Habba's deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position as Habba's initial 120-day interim term was expiring. Attorney General Pam Bondi sharply criticized the court's move and removed Grace from her deputy role. By pulling the official nomination, the administration sidesteps a federal law that would have prevented Habba from serving as an acting officer while her nomination was pending before the Senate.</p>

          <p>An intense heat dome that has been affecting the central United States is now moving east, bringing extreme temperatures to the East Coast. Over 100 million people are currently under heat alerts, with forecasters predicting temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average and feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas. In the Midwest's Corn Belt, the heat is exacerbated by "corn sweat," a process where vast amounts of water vapor are released from cornfields, increasing humidity and making the heat feel even more oppressive. This phenomenon can add up to 10 degrees to the heat index, intensifying the already dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite recent turmoil, such as the controversy over the Jeffrey Epstein files and declining poll numbers on key issues, Donald Trump's hold on power is not solely dependent on public approval. The author suggests that while these events may indicate cracks in the MAGA coalition, tyrants historically maintain power through intimidation, control of institutions, and suppressing dissent, rather than popular support. The piece points to the administration's aggressive deportation campaigns and efforts to pressure election officials as evidence of this approach. It concludes that while Trump is not invincible, resistance requires active, organized opposition to challenge his authority beyond just tracking approval ratings.</p>

          <p>Several Democratic members of Congress are pressing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for information regarding the practice of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks and using unmarked vehicles during operations. In a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers argue that this practice erodes public trust, violates due process, and makes it difficult to distinguish legitimate officers from criminals impersonating them. The letter cites instances where criminals have posed as ICE agents to commit crimes, warning that the anonymity of actual agents creates a roadmap for exploitation. This push is part of a broader effort to require federal immigration officers to display clear identification during arrests.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new Arctic strategy, which includes a nearly $9 billion investment in icebreakers, is intensifying geopolitical focus on the region. In response, Chinese scholars argue that China must capitalize on the increasingly navigable Northern Sea Route (NSR) as a new pathway to counter U.S. influence. The NSR offers a shorter, more cost-effective shipping passage between Asia and Europe compared to traditional routes. As climate change makes the Arctic more accessible, Beijing views the development of this "Polar Silk Road" as a strategic opportunity to enhance its economic and geopolitical standing, challenging Washington's aim to control the "frozen frontier."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision not to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein has created a significant rift among the president's online supporters in conspiratorial communities. While some loyalists defend the decision, trusting in Trump's strategy, many others are expressing frustration and demanding full transparency, a call Trump himself endorsed during his campaign. This internal conflict is visible on pro-Trump message boards and social media, where influencers who once championed the cause are now on the defensive. The episode highlights a rare instance of a wedge being driven between Trump and his most ardent followers, who are struggling to reconcile their support with the administration's perceived lack of transparency.</p>

The aid provided is critically insufficient, pushing Gaza towards famine, with reports of infants and the elderly dying from malnutrition.

He had become lost after a night out and was attempting a 14-hour walk back to his accommodation with little phone battery. Friends stated he had consumed drugs and alcohol.

          <p>Manchester City has agreed to a £27 million deal to re-sign goalkeeper James Trafford from Burnley, just two years after he left the club. The 22-year-old City academy graduate had a standout season with Burnley, helping them secure promotion to the Premier League. Manchester City activated a matching rights clause in his contract after Newcastle submitted a £27 million bid, and Trafford chose to return to his former club. He is expected to sign a five-year contract and will compete with Ederson and Stefan Ortega for the starting goalkeeper position, creating a selection dilemma for manager Pep Guardiola.</p>

          <p>Following France's announcement that it will recognize Palestinian statehood, Germany has clarified that it has no similar plans in the short term. The German government stated its conviction that a negotiated two-state solution is the only path to lasting peace, viewing formal recognition as a final step in that process. Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has accused Israel of deliberately using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. A separate USAID analysis reportedly found no evidence to support claims that Hamas has been systematically stealing humanitarian aid, a justification used for the controversial new private aid distribution system.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years into the war, the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is catastrophic, with official figures reporting over 58,000 Palestinian deaths, though some studies suggest the true toll could be much higher. The entire population of over 2 million is facing acute food insecurity, with the UN reporting that nearly one in three people go days without eating. Medical infrastructure has collapsed, with no hospitals fully functional and most lacking electricity or water. The trickle of aid entering the territory is a small fraction of what is needed, leading to daily deaths from starvation, particularly among children.</p>

The deal will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and alcohol, with 99% of Indian goods shipped to the UK eventually becoming tariff-free. Key provisions include halving the 150% tariff on UK scotch whisky and lowering car duties. The agreement, one of India's first with an advanced economy, is seen as a strategic win for both nations, providing leverage in other ongoing trade negotiations, particularly with the United States.</p>

This new system offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining specific food items on prescription from a pharmacy. The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving people more choice and dignity when shopping. A pilot program provided participants with £42 every three months, which they found helpful but said only "scratches the surface" of the high cost of a gluten-free diet.

          <p>Under the Make America Healthy Again movement, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is successfully pushing the food industry to eliminate artificial dyes. The U.S. dairy industry recently pledged to remove artificial colors from ice cream by 2028, following similar commitments from giants like Nestle and Kraft Heinz. Kennedy argues these dyes, found in 19% of food products, are linked to health issues like cancer and hyperactivity. While public health advocates generally support the move, food manufacturers face challenges in switching to less stable and potentially scarce natural colorings, and some worry that American consumers may reject the duller hues of the reformulated products.</p>

          <p>PayZen, an AI-backed company, is purchasing medical debt from hospitals and offering patients interest-free payment plans of up to five years. The company's CEO argues this model addresses the healthcare affordability crisis, which is expected to worsen under new federal cuts that could leave 17 million people uninsured. PayZen buys debt from hospitals at a discount and collects the full value from patients, while also charging hospitals a platform fee. Consumer advocates raise concerns about a lack of transparency, as patients are unaware their debt was bought for a fraction of its value, and question whether low-income patients are being steered away from charity care.</p>

This decline follows a significant spike in violent crime that began in 2020. Crime analyst Jeff Asher suggests 2025 could see the lowest murder rate since the FBI began keeping reliable records in 1960. Cities like Baltimore have seen success with "focused deterrence" strategies, combining law enforcement with social support for high-risk individuals. Experts suggest a massive influx of federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act, used for everything from violence reduction groups to renovating parks, has contributed to the nationwide trend.</p>

          <p>This article explains the science behind sunscreen and addresses growing safety concerns. Sunscreens work by using either organic (carbon-based) chemical filters that absorb UV radiation or mineral (inorganic) filters like zinc oxide that physically block it. While essential for preventing skin cancer, some long-approved chemical ingredients have been detected in the bloodstream, raising questions about their long-term effects, though scientists stress that the dose makes the poison. Experts warn against do-it-yourself sunscreens and mixing different products, which can reduce effectiveness. The future of sun protection may lie in new, plant-based compounds that mimic nature's own UV-protective mechanisms.</p>

          <p>In response to a severe housing crisis exacerbated by the 2023 Lahaina wildfire, the Maui County Council has passed a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals. The legislation closes a loophole that allowed condos in apartment-zoned areas to be rented to tourists, mandating they be used for long-term housing instead. Proponents, including Mayor Richard Bissen, see it as a critical step to prioritize housing for local residents, predicting it will add over 6,000 units to the housing stock. Opponents argue it will harm the local economy and that the converted units will still be unaffordable for many residents.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, despite increasing public pressure from President Donald Trump, who is demanding sharp cuts to spur economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that rate cuts would likely have occurred already if not for the inflation risks posed by the administration's tariff agenda. The current federal funds rate remains between 4.25% and 4.5%, and futures markets show almost no chance of a cut at the upcoming meeting. A stable Fed rate means that borrowing costs for consumers on products like credit cards and auto loans are unlikely to decrease soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A record-breaking heatwave is scorching Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, an unprecedented event for the region inside the Arctic Circle. The extreme heat is causing concern for the local tourism industry, which is built around a winter identity, and for the health of reindeer, which are fleeing to roads to escape insects. Scientists attribute the exceptional weather to climate change, noting that the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. While this specific heatwave has a direct meteorological cause, its intensity and duration are seen as a clear fingerprint of global warming.</p>
