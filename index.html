        <h2>Analysis of claims about the US Department of Education's performance and role</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-14 21:14:25 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>This article examines three claims made about the US Department of Education (DOE), focusing on spending versus educational outcomes, the role of state and local education agencies, and DOE employee work habits.  It refutes claims that the US ranks last in education while spending the most per pupil, showing that the US's spending is high but not the highest, and its educational rankings are mixed.  The article clarifies that the DOE primarily administers funds and enforces non-discrimination laws, not directly setting curriculum or teaching.  Finally, it counters claims of widespread DOE employee absenteeism with anecdotal evidence of dedicated employees affected by recent layoffs.</p>

        <p>This article discusses the internal debate within the Democratic Party regarding the potential consequences of a government shutdown.
