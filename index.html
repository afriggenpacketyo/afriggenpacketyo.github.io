        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged former FBI Director James Comey with perjury and obstruction of justice related to his 2020 testimony before a Senate committee. The indictment stems from questions about his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference, specifically regarding alleged leaks to the media. The charges, filed just before the statute of limitations expired, have intensified political divisions, with former President Trump celebrating the indictment while critics accuse the administration of weaponizing the justice system. Comey maintains his innocence and intends to fight the charges in court.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than $220 million worth of cocaine during multiple interceptions in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Operations in August and September resulted in the capture of several drug-smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America. The crew of the Cutter Midgett offloaded over 21,000 pounds of cocaine in San Diego, while the Cutter Diligence offloaded another 8,700 pounds in Florida. The Coast Guard released an image of one alleged drug boat on fire, stating it is standard procedure to sink such vessels after seizing narcotics to prevent maritime hazards.</p>

Arriving as the U.S. team was trailing in the morning matches, the president was greeted with chants of "U-S-A" from the crowd. He briefly met with golfers Bryson DeChambeau and Ben Griffin on the first tee. An avid golfer himself, Trump has remained engaged with the sport, and his presence was seen by some players as a morale boost for the U.S. team.</p>

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people at the NFL's headquarters, had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). This finding aligns with a note found on Tamura, in which he blamed the NFL for concealing the dangers of brain injuries to players and requested his brain be studied. The victims of the shooting included a security guard, a police officer, a Blackstone executive, and a management company employee. Tamura died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene of the attack.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned a large number of generals, admirals, and their staff from around the world for an unusual, short-notice meeting at Quantico, Virginia. The purpose of the rare gathering has not been publicly disclosed, leading to speculation about its agenda. Hegseth has previously expressed intentions to reduce the number of high-ranking general and flag officers by 20%, questioning if all 44 current four-star positions are necessary for warfighting success. Other theories suggest the meeting could be to roll out the new National Defense Strategy, which is expected to emphasize homeland defense.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for certain 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, a sign of returning regulatory confidence. This authority was revoked in 2019 for the MAX and 2022 for the 787 following fatal crashes and production defects, respectively. Under the new arrangement, the FAA and Boeing will issue the safety certifications on alternating weeks. The regulator stated the decision follows a thorough review of Boeing's production quality and will allow FAA inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance, though production caps on the MAX remain in place.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has announced plans to introduce a mandatory digital ID system to prove an individual's right to work. The government argues the scheme will make it more difficult to work illegally, thereby securing borders, while also offering citizens a more convenient way to access services. The plan has drawn criticism from opposition parties, who argue it will not stop illegal immigration and raises concerns about data security and civil liberties. The new digital ID will be held on phones, and a public consultation on its implementation is planned for later this year.</p>

          <p>A retirement income strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional methods like the 4% withdrawal rule. The approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or kept liquid for unexpected costs. This strategy aims to balance financial security with flexibility, providing a stable income floor that may reduce stress during market volatility and allow for more confident spending in retirement.

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced a new 17-page agreement that significantly restricts journalists' access and news-gathering activities within the building, a departure from decades of established practice. Under the new rules, reporters must not publish unclassified information unless it is approved for public release, and those who refuse to sign the agreement will lose their credentials. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the changes as common sense for a secure facility, but news organizations and press freedom advocates have condemned them as a violation of First Amendment rights.

          <p>OpenAI has unveiled a series of massive infrastructure partnerships, signaling its ambition to become a dominant force in AI on the scale of a hyperscaler. The announcements include a potential $100 billion investment from Nvidia and an expanded $400 billion "Stargate" data center project with Oracle and SoftBank. CEO Sam Altman stated that delivering the next era of AI will require trillions of dollars in data center construction, acknowledging the immense execution risk and energy requirements. Despite burning through cash, the company is betting that insatiable market demand for its models will eventually make these colossal investments profitable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is facing a potential shutdown as Congress has only days left to pass a funding bill before the September 30 deadline. A shutdown would furlough hundreds of thousands of non-essential federal workers, close national parks, and halt many government services. It could also delay the release of key economic data, including the upcoming monthly jobs report. Republicans and Democrats are at an impasse, with Democrats demanding that a stopgap bill include extensions for Affordable Care Act subsidies, a provision Republicans oppose in a "clean" funding extension.</p>

          <p>Nick Clegg, the former head of global affairs at Meta, stated that technology companies should maintain a respectful distance from politics, expressing unease about their intervention in the public sphere. Speaking in the context of the U.S. government's deal to keep TikTok operational, Clegg highlighted the importance of scrutinizing data safety and algorithm ownership. He warned against the trend of "hard data localization," where countries demand citizen data be stored domestically, arguing it erodes the open data flows that are fundamental to the internet. Clegg identified the U.S.-China relationship as a significant potential risk to a global, open internet.</p>

Mass deaths from consuming cheap, homemade alcohol substitutes are a recurring problem in Russia, where high rates of alcoholism persist and the cost of legal spirits can be prohibitive for many, particularly in rural areas.</p>

Local business owners and residents express frustration with the pace of federal and state aid, feeling forgotten as resources appear to be directed toward more popular tourist areas.

The company has outlined an $865 million business optimization program that includes costs for severance.

Under the deal, a new U.S.-based joint venture will be formed with a majority of American investors, and Oracle will manage the security of U.S. user data and the content algorithm.
