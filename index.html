          <p>The United Kingdom is reportedly on the verge of signing a trade deal with the United States, potentially becoming the first country to do so following the U.S. announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs. President Trump hinted at the development, and a U.K. government spokesperson confirmed that talks are ongoing with the U.S., emphasizing the importance of the alliance. While details remain uncertain, the agreement could be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations, aiming to alleviate pressure on U.K. businesses and consumers. Britain was spared the higher tariffs when Trump announced his duties, though it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the Sandpiper Group indicates that global business leaders increasingly view the United States as responsible for the ongoing trade war, with nearly three-quarters blaming the current U.S. administration's policies. The poll, which included 3,050 business leaders across 27 markets, also revealed that 72% believe the U.S. should take the first step to de-escalate the conflict. Furthermore, 70% of respondents anticipate that the trade war will negatively impact the U.S.'s global standing.

          <p>The House is set to vote on a bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill faces opposition, with Democrats calling it a waste of taxpayer money and some Republicans deeming it "juvenile." If passed, federal agencies would be required to update documents and maps within six months, though other countries would not be obligated to adopt the new name.

          <p>E-cigarettes, designed to minimize the harmful chemicals of traditional cigarettes, present a complex public health dilemma. While they have shown promise in helping smokers quit, vaping has also led to a surge in nicotine consumption among young people who never smoked, raising concerns about long-term health risks. Studies suggest e-cigarettes are more effective than nicotine patches or gum for smoking cessation, but they also pose risks to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The article explores the challenges of balancing the potential benefits of vaping for smokers with the need to prevent nicotine addiction among nonsmokers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing movement is advocating for the modernization of U.S. building codes to allow single-stair apartment buildings up to six stories tall, arguing it could significantly increase affordable housing options. Currently, most American cities require two staircases for buildings over three stories, adding substantial construction costs and limiting design flexibility. Proponents argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe, citing examples from Europe and cities like Seattle and New York City. However, fire safety officials express concerns about evacuation times and resident safety, advocating for more research before revising building codes.</p>

          <p>Wikipedia is taking legal action against new Online Safety Act regulations, arguing that they could threaten the safety of its volunteer editors and their ability to keep harmful content off the site. The Wikimedia Foundation seeks a judicial review of rules that could subject Wikipedia to the toughest duties required of websites under the act. The foundation fears additional duties could require the site to verify the identities of its volunteers, potentially exposing them to data breaches and stalking. The government said it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Democrats are intensifying their scrutiny of President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures and the financial gains his family is deriving from these efforts, coinciding with a vote on a key crypto bill. They are calling for investigations into Trump-connected coins and backers, demanding financial records, and attempting to block legislation. Sen. Richard Blumenthal initiated an inquiry into the Trump family's expanding crypto empire, labeling the Trump meme coin dinner contest a "pay-for-play scheme." Democrats are betting that exposing potential corruption in the crypto market will resonate with voters.</p>

The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious.

          <p>For the first time, footage of a Powelliphanta augusta snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured, according to New Zealand's conservation agency. The species, a threatened carnivore endemic to New Zealand, is being cared for in a facility that mimics its alpine habitat. Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the snails for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises. The snails are hermaphrodites, simultaneously exchanging sperm with another snail before creating an egg, which can take over a year to hatch.</p>
