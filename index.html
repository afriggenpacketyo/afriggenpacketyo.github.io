        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Liberal Party has won the federal election, overcoming challenges posed by U.S. President Trump's annexation threats and tariffs. The election was heavily influenced by Trump's actions, which undermined the Canadian economy and pushed voters to prioritize sovereignty. Voters expressed concerns about tariffs affecting market prices and the need for Canada to diversify its global partnerships to avoid dependence on the U.S. The conservative leader Poilievre was seen as having similarities with Mr. Trump that may have ended up costing him votes. The Liberal Party's victory underscores the importance of Canadian sovereignty and economic independence in the face of external pressures.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting it was not an error but a justified action due to Abrego Garcia's alleged terrorist affiliations. Despite a previous withholding order protecting Abrego Garcia from deportation due to gang persecution, Homan claimed the circumstances had changed, designating him as a terrorist linked to MS-13. Abrego Garcia's legal team denies any gang involvement and highlights the absence of a criminal record. The situation has sparked diplomatic tensions, with El Salvador refusing to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. and a federal judge pausing orders related to his return.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's initial 100 days back in office have been marked by a strong "America First" approach, prioritizing US interests and economic protectionism. Key events include confirming a second state visit to the UK, establishing the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, and expanding the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for stricter immigration policies. Trump has also withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement, taken a binary view on gender, and imposed tariffs, leading to market volatility. The administration has faced protests, media scrutiny, and legal challenges, testing the country's legal boundaries on all fronts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and auto parts, providing automakers with more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, they will be modified to avoid stacking with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some tariff costs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of a new car's value in the first year, phased out over two years. The changes aim to reward domestic manufacturing while providing a transition for companies investing in American production.</p>

Badenoch stated she is unconcerned about criticism from individuals unwilling to attach their names to their statements.

          <p>Walmart and other major US retailers have reportedly instructed some manufacturers in China’s Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to resume shipments to the United States. This decision comes after a period of slowed shipments due to escalating tariffs between the US and China. The costs of the new import duties will be borne by the US clients, the firm said. The move suggests a potential shift in strategy or negotiation, as retailers prepare for a possible recovery in demand despite ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A Chinese political scientist, Zheng Yongnian, has cautioned Southeast Asian countries about the risks of siding too closely with the US in the ongoing trade war with China. Zheng suggests that supporting US re-industrialization efforts is not the ultimate goal for ASEAN, and that China is better positioned to assist the 10-nation regional bloc in achieving its goals. He warned that aligning with Washington could lead to isolation from China and hinder industrialization efforts. This perspective highlights the complex geopolitical considerations facing ASEAN nations as they navigate the trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Patrick Vereb, a funeral home director in Pittsburgh, is facing charges for allegedly throwing out thousands of pets' bodies and giving owners ashes from other animals. Vereb is accused of stealing over $650,000 from more than 6,500 customers who paid for pet burial and cremation services between 2021 and 2024. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office has launched a website for potential victims to report their experiences.

The university is also engaged in a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of unlawfully interfering in its affairs.

          <p>As the US-China trade war escalates, the US President Donald Trump has temporarily exempted imports from other countries from the punitive tariffs. He is reportedly trying to bully others into limiting their economic ties with China in exchange for a deal. Washington aims to isolate China, but the opposite is happening. Since last year, a consensus has been built that weak domestic demand is the major drag on China’s economic growth, and Trump’s tariffs have further enhanced China’s determination to reduce dependence on the US market and embark on the path of building itself into a large consumer market.</p>

The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, located in Manhattan, New York, is pictured on Sept. 14, 2017. While the results are promising, the study was conducted at a single hospital — Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City — and some patients have not been followed long enough to know if their cancer might return over time.</p>
