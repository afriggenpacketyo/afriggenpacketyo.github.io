          <p>Diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war are intensifying, with London hosting fresh ceasefire talks involving diplomats from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the US. The talks occur amidst speculation that Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in exchange for concessions, such as US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, though Ukrainian President Zelensky has denied such proposals. Despite Putin's unilateral declaration of a temporary Easter ceasefire, British military intelligence found no evidence of a let-up in attacks. Hundreds of thousands are estimated to have been killed or injured since the invasion began in February 2022.</p>

          <p>A fast-spreading wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has forced thousands of people to evacuate from parts of Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township. The fire, which started at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has burned 8,500 acres and is 10% contained, with the cause still undetermined. Approximately 3,000 people have been evacuated, and 1,320 structures are threatened, with several businesses damaged, and no injuries reported.

          <p>Six major U.S. automotive industry groups are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider 25% tariffs on auto parts, warning that the levies could jeopardize U.S. automotive production. The groups, representing dealers, suppliers, and automakers, argue that many auto suppliers are already financially strained and unable to absorb additional cost increases. They represent a sector supporting 10 million American jobs and contributing $1.2 trillion to the economy. President Trump has indicated a willingness to reconsider the tariffs, similar to relief granted for consumer electronics and semiconductors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists suggest that recent signals from the White House about potentially easing tariffs against China do not indicate significant progress in US-China trade negotiations but may provide Beijing with an opportunity to secure a more favorable deal. President Trump stated that tariffs on Chinese goods would not reach 145% and would be reduced substantially, which analysts interpret as a sign of anxiety from the US side. This perceived eagerness could allow China to negotiate from a position of strength, potentially leading to more advantageous terms for Beijing.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, contingent on major food companies voluntarily removing them to meet consumer demand. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in various products. While the plan relies on an "understanding" with food companies, the International Association of Color Manufacturers has questioned the proposed timeline, while the Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would work with the administration.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP projections for major Asian economies, including China and India, due to trade tensions and "high policy uncertainty." The IMF also reduced Japan's growth forecast, citing tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners as a major negative shock to global growth. This forecast aligns with a broader trend of research firms and banks cutting growth forecasts for Asian economies amid escalating trade disputes and uncertainties stemming from U.S. tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Police chiefs in the UK will be granted new powers to automatically sack officers who fail background checks, aiming to boost public confidence in policing. The measures, making passing vetting checks a legal requirement, follow calls for changes after Sarah Everard's murder by a police officer. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper calls the reforms "essential" to restore confidence, as currently, officers who fail vetting can remain on full pay without public-facing roles. The move aims to ensure only officers of the highest standards wear the uniform.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump clarified that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after repeated criticism of the Fed's monetary policy. Trump expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China and stated he would like Powell to be "a little more active" in cutting interest rates. This statement follows concerns that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise, especially amidst ongoing trade tariffs potentially boosting inflation. The International Monetary Fund recently downgraded the US economic growth forecast for this year, citing tariff-related uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated a softened stance on trade with China, stating that tariffs on goods from China will be reduced “substantially” but “won’t be zero.” This follows comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who expects a “de-escalation” in the trade war. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced he would start pulling back from his role at the “department of government efficiency” (DOGE) from May, as the company reported a significant dip in profits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's energy-storage industry faces a challenging year due to the escalating US-China trade war and reduced government support, prompting concerns about price competition. Exports to the US, its largest market, are likely to be affected by higher tariffs, leading to projected cuts in capital expenditure. Excess supply has also fueled a relentless price war, causing average export prices to decline significantly. Battery energy-storage systems (BESS) are crucial for the global transition to clean energy, with China and the US accounting for a combined 80% of installed capacity in 2024.</p>

          <p>Intel is reportedly planning to cut over 20% of its workforce as part of a strategy to streamline operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. The layoffs mark the first major move under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over last month to revive the struggling chipmaker. The move is part of a broader effort to refocus on an engineering-driven culture. This follows a significant workforce reduction last August, when Intel planned to cut 15% of its jobs as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.</p>
