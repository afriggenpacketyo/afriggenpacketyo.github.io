          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has caused significant devastation in the Caribbean, resulting in at least four deaths across Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The storm has destroyed nearly 200 homes and disrupted water supplies for over half a million people in the Dominican Republic alone. Forecasters from the US National Hurricane Center warn that Melissa is expected to strengthen into a hurricane, threatening the region with catastrophic flash flooding and landslides. The storm is the 13th of an anticipated above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, defeating Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. The election was initiated following Angela Rayner's resignation last month amid a tax controversy. Powell campaigned on a platform of giving grassroots members a stronger voice and advocating for a "course correction" in government, drawing support from members dissatisfied with Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. In her new role, Powell will serve on the party's National Executive Committee and act as its primary campaign organizer.</p>

          <p>Chef Roy Choi, known for his Korean-Mexican fusion food truck Kogi, is promoting a more vegetable-forward cooking style in his latest cookbook, "The Choi of Cooking." He suggests three key strategies to make vegetables more appealing: prepping produce in advance like restaurants do, creating flavorful homemade sauces, and using a small amount of MSG to enhance umami flavor. Choi's approach aims to make healthy eating more convenient and delicious, helping home cooks overcome the common hurdles of preparing and enjoying vegetables regularly. The article includes recipes for several of his signature sauces.</p>

          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to select a successor for the current head of state, Michael D Higgins. The main contenders are independent candidate Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. Early tallies indicate strong support for Connolly, particularly in Dublin constituencies, while also showing a significant number of spoiled ballots. A third candidate's name remains on the ballot despite his withdrawal, and turnout is projected to be low, potentially near the record low set in the 2018 election.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham faces a crucial test in the upcoming El Clasico against Barcelona, a match that could redefine his season and international standing. After recovering from shoulder surgery, Bellingham aims to reaffirm his importance to both his club and the England national team, from which he was recently omitted. The match is notable for featuring two English players, Bellingham and Barcelona's Marcus Rashford, in opposition for the first time. A strong performance could serve as a powerful statement to England's manager ahead of the next squad selection.</p>

          <p>Viral social media claims that Germany has canceled hundreds of its famous Christmas markets for 2025 are false. While a few small, local markets have been called off due to issues like low vendor revenue or renovations, the vast majority are scheduled to proceed as planned across the country. The widespread rumor originated from a single, unsubstantiated article that cited unaffordable security costs, a claim refuted by officials in the towns mentioned. Rising security expenses are a genuine concern for organizers, but they have not led to mass cancellations.</p>

Professor Hester Parr of the University of Glasgow suggests building new 'light routines,' spending time outdoors, and redesigning interior spaces with cozy lighting. The goal is to foster a psychological shift towards embracing winter rather than enduring it.</p>

          <p>As a potential meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump approaches, Beijing's ambassador in Washington has called for cooperation and "shared prosperity." The envoy emphasized that there are numerous reasons to improve the strained U.S.-China relationship, framing the summit as an opportunity to pursue mutual respect and win-win outcomes. This diplomatic messaging comes amid renewed trade tensions and high-level economic consultations between the two nations taking place in Malaysia. The statement signals a desire from Beijing to de-escalate the recent economic friction.</p>

          <h2>White House East Wing Demolished for New Ballroom Construction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 00:27:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The East Wing of the White House has been completely demolished to make way for a new $300 million ballroom championed by President Donald Trump. This action reverses an earlier promise that existing structures would not be torn down for the project, which is being privately funded by corporations and individuals. The East Wing, first built in 1902 and expanded in 1942, housed the first lady's offices and served as an entrance for public tours. The demolition has sparked criticism from presidential historians and preservation groups, who call the move painful and symbolic of disrespect for public assets.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the prosecution of several current and former high-ranking Justice Department officials, including special counsel Jack Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland. Trump accused them of illegal conduct related to an FBI investigation, known as Arctic Frost, that reportedly examined the phone records of nine Republican lawmakers following the 2020 election. This demand is the latest in a series of calls by the president to prosecute political adversaries. The investigation in question did not include the content of calls but rather metadata about who was contacted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing a long-term demographic crisis of a shrinking and aging population, Russia is enacting restrictive laws aimed at boosting its birth rate. The government has introduced measures banning the promotion of abortion and "child-free ideology" while also outlawing LGBTQ+ activism, framing these steps as a return to "traditional family values." These policies come as Russia's birth rate continues to fall amid economic uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, and an exodus of young men. Critics argue that these restrictions will not solve the demographic problem and will only harm women's health.</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has imposed sanctions on several subsidiaries of South Korea's Hanwha Group, a major shipbuilder. The ministry alleges that Hanwha supported a U.S. investigation into Chinese competitors, which resulted in new port fees. The sanctioned entities are now barred from conducting business with Chinese individuals or companies. This move comes as Hanwha deepens its ties with the U.S. through its acquisition of a Philadelphia shipyard, a key part of a U.S.-South Korea initiative to revitalize American shipbuilding, potentially creating further geopolitical tension.</p>

          <p>An analysis of donors funding President Trump's new $300 million White House ballroom reveals that many are corporations with significant business before the federal government. The list includes major tech firms like Google and Microsoft, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, and cryptocurrency companies such as Coinbase and Ripple. These entities are often seeking favorable policy decisions, regulatory approval for mergers, or lucrative government contracts. The White House has dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest, stating that private funding is preferable to using taxpayer money for the construction project.</p>

The race highlights the ongoing ideological dynamics within the city's political landscape.</p>
