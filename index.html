          <h2>Texas Flood Death Toll Surpasses 70 as Rescue Efforts Continue for Missing Campers</h2>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in Texas has tragically climbed to 78, with dozens more people still unaccounted for across the state. Rescue efforts are intensely focused on Kerr County, particularly at the site of Camp Mystic, a Christian youth camp where ten girls and a counselor are still missing after the Guadalupe River surged. The disaster, triggered by months' worth of rain falling in hours, has prompted a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump. Questions are now being raised about the effectiveness of the region's flood warning systems, given the unprecedented speed and intensity of the rising waters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wimbledon officials have issued an apology after the electronic line-calling system on Centre Court was mistakenly deactivated during a fourth-round match, leading to three missed calls in a single game. The error significantly impacted play between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, with one incorrect non-call nearly costing Pavlyuchenkova the game. The All England Club confirmed it was a human operator error and has since reviewed its procedures to prevent a recurrence. The incident has sparked debate among players and commentators about the role of chair umpires and the potential need for video reviews in modern tennis.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Deeper Mutual Understanding is Crucial for the Future of Hong Kong's 'One Country, Two Systems' Framework</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 17:30:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China has been hindered by persistent misunderstandings and misjudgments from both sides. It challenges the early assumption that close physical and economic ties would automatically lead to deeper mutual comprehension of their distinct political and cultural identities. Instead, the author suggests that the complexities of the 'one country, two systems' principle have been underappreciated, leading to a more complicated dynamic. The piece calls for a more nuanced understanding from both Beijing and Hong Kong to navigate the city's future successfully.</p>

          <p>Among the nearly 80 victims of the devastating floods in Central Texas were two sisters from Dallas, 13-year-old Blair and 11-year-old Brooke Harber. The girls were staying with their grandparents, who remain missing, in a riverside cabin and were not attendees of the hard-hit Camp Mystic. Their deaths were confirmed by the St. Rita Catholic Community, where the sisters were students and where a prayer service was held in their memory. This personal story highlights the widespread and tragic human cost of the disaster, which officials have described as a 'mass casualty event' that extends beyond a single location.</p>

Speaking in Calgary, he clarified that the proposal must come from the private sector rather than being a government-led initiative, emphasizing the significant economic opportunity it represents. This development follows the recent passage of a bill designed to fast-track approvals for major natural resource projects, part of Canada's strategy to diversify its exports beyond the United States.

          <p>As a key tariff deadline approaches this week, White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett stated that the 'rough outlines' of new trade deals are becoming clear. He indicated that existing agreements with the U.K. and Vietnam are serving as guidelines for negotiations with other U.S. trading partners. President Trump's 90-day freeze on sweeping new tariffs is set to expire on Wednesday, and Hassett confirmed that a number of deals have been finalized, while letters will be sent to countries where negotiations are less advanced. He suggested that the threat of tariffs is successfully encouraging countries to move business activity into the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

The summit is notably missing Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who participated via video link. Putin used his address to claim the model of liberal globalization is becoming obsolete as economic activity shifts to emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's policies are actively harming post-industrial cities like Flint, Michigan, despite the president's rhetoric about revitalizing the Rust Belt. The author, a public health researcher from Flint, contends that the focus on deregulation and corporate tax incentives comes at the expense of crucial environmental and public health protections. The article points to the administration's rollbacks of clean water regulations and cuts to health monitoring programs as actions that impede recovery from the city's water crisis. It concludes that economic growth policies will fail unless they are paired with investments to repair social and environmental damage.</p>

          <p>Following a public fissure with President Donald Trump over a new tax and spending law, billionaire Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the 'America Party.' Musk, who had previously led a government efficiency task force for Trump, heavily criticized the bill as an 'insane spending bill' that would bankrupt the country. In a series of posts on his social media platform X, Musk stated the new party was formed to 'give you back your freedom' from what he calls a one-party system. This move signals a significant and potentially costly feud between the two powerful figures.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which have killed nearly 70 people, underscore the immense difficulty of forecasting extreme weather events exacerbated by the climate crisis. An analysis shows that the rainfall intensity, with over 10 inches in three hours, was an exceptionally rare event, exceeding a 1-in-500-year probability. Despite National Weather Service forecasters issuing timely watches and warnings, the rainfall totals far exceeded initial predictions. This disaster highlights a critical limitation in current technology: while meteorologists can anticipate a high risk of extreme rain in a region, precisely predicting its location and magnitude remains a major challenge.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the new work requirements for social programs in President Trump's domestic spending bill, suggesting Democrats 'seem to think that poor people are stupid.' His comments came in response to concerns that new administrative burdens could cause eligible people to lose benefits. Kentucky's Democratic Governor, Andy Beshear, pushed back fiercely, arguing the requirements will harm working parents of children with special needs. Bessent countered that the administration is creating manufacturing jobs that will allow people to get off Medicaid and gain employment with good healthcare benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
