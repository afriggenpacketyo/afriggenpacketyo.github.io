          <h2>Iron Dome's Success Sparks Interest in US Missile Defense System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 01:10:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent exchanges between Israel and Iran have highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, prompting renewed interest in the United States' proposed Golden Dome project. The Golden Dome, a multi-layered missile defense system, aims to protect the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through a network of satellites and interceptors. Despite concerns about its cost and potential to escalate arms races, defense and space companies are vying for a role in the project, especially after budget cuts at NASA. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed allocating billions for missile defense and space programs in support of the Golden Dome effort, while Canada has been offered a deal to skip fees by joining the U.S. This situation has led to increased interest in integrated missile defense systems in Europe as well. The overall stability of the situation earns a reasonable score.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 01:03:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trade Minister Douglas Alexander suggests that public support for international aid spending has declined, even if financial constraints were not a factor. This comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's announcement of cuts to the international aid budget to fund increased defense spending, a move criticized by charities. Alexander acknowledged the moral and strategic importance of investing in international aid but believes the argument has been lost, noting similar reversals in other countries. While a recent survey suggested support for the aid budget cut, others maintain that public support for UK aid remains strong and essential for national security. The current situation earns a relatively neutral score.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are raising concerns that children with lazy eyes are being missed for treatment due to the lack of early screenings in schools, with some councils facing capacity and budget constraints. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) advocates for universal screening for amblyopia in schools across England, similar to practices in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Early detection and treatment, ideally before the age of seven, are crucial for effective correction using patching. A BIOS survey indicates that approximately 75,000 children reside in areas without school screening, leading to delayed diagnoses and diminished treatment outcomes. Early detection in schools helps children get the help they need, leading to a high score.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a low-cost, edible, and washable protein-based coating capable of extending the shelf life of fruits by 2.5 times. Tested on 17 different fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes, the coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, effectively delaying spoilage by a week or more. The coating costs approximately 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit and is as effective as existing preservation methods while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and toxicity. The research team, from Shaanxi Normal University, developed the coating using computer-aided molecular simulation, marking a promising solution to global food waste.

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in April and March.

Concurrently, Japan's core inflation rate has climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, surpassing economists' expectations. According to JP Morgan Asset Management, rice accounts for approximately 50% of Japan's core inflation, emphasizing the significant impact of food prices on the country's economic trends.

          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The unanimous order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit allows the continued deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they have been protecting federal property and U.S. immigration agents. Newsom objects to the use of troops and sued the president, but the court sided with Trump, stating that he likely exercised his statutory authority under Title 10. The court said that while judges should be deferential to the president, the Trump administration had a valid basis for invoking Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents.

          <p>China has been urged to use the resumption of visits to Tibet by Indian pilgrims to improve relations between the two countries after years of tensions. This year, China said it would allow pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer to follow two pilgrimage routes after a five-year suspension caused by Covid controls and ongoing cross-border tensions. The sites are sacred to followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon. The pilgrimages are usually organised by the Indian government and involve treks through the Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand or Nathu La Pass in Sikkim. The situation earns a neutral score.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a whip over the government's plans to cut disability benefits, stating that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution to address the welfare bill. A government spokesman responded that it was fixing a "broken welfare system" that was failing the sick and vulnerable. The government's bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit, potentially facing a large rebellion from Labour MPs. The situation earns a score that reflects the political division.</p>

          <p>China maintained its benchmark lending rates unchanged following monetary easing measures last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with Reuters poll estimates. Trade war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva in May, allowing for rare earth and tech trade and suspending tariffs. Analysts suggest that with reduced foreign exchange pressure, the PBOC has greater latitude for future policy maneuvering, but may increase policy support in the second half of the year.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk called a senior White House official a "snake" following reports of a rift between the two men. Musk replied to a post on X, the social media platform he owns, linking to a New York Post story detailing that Sergio Gor had not submitted full vetting paperwork.
