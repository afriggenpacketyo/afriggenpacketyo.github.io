            <h2>China Successfully Tests Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb</h2>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a hydrogen-based explosive device in a controlled field test, achieving a sustained high-temperature fireball without using nuclear materials. The 2kg bomb, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, utilized a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material that releases hydrogen gas upon activation by conventional explosives. This innovation could have implications for both weaponry and clean energy applications, as the material was initially designed to power fuel cells in off-grid areas. The test demonstrates China's advancements in non-nuclear explosive technology. Optimism score is rated at 60 because this is not a nuclear device, but it could have military applications.</p>
