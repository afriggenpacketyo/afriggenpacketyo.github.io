          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to upgrade their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a thaw in relations. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing where the foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China discussed improving cooperation. Relations between the two countries have been strained due to accusations of harboring the Pakistani Taliban and the deportation of Afghan refugees. The move is aimed at fostering enhanced bilateral cooperation across various sectors, although no country has officially recognized the Taliban administration since they took control in 2021. Optimism surrounds the potential for strengthened regional stability and collaboration.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece criticizes the media coverage of National Public Radio's lawsuit against President Trump, arguing that it hides the true nature of public media. The article claims that NPR exhibits partisan bias and lacks objectivity, citing examples such as NPR's coverage of Harvard's response to antisemitism and the celebration of NPR figures with alleged Democratic ties. The author contends that NPR consistently ignores the Public Broadcasting Act's requirement for objectivity and balance, and that NPR's CEO denies any bias despite evidence to the contrary. The article concludes by asserting that NPR's coverage of the lawsuit is one-sided and fails to offer a conservative critique.</p>

          <p>Workers at the U.S. Department of Energy are raising alarms about the impact of budget cuts and deregulation on the department's ability to function effectively. They anticipate that these changes will lead to significant energy cost increases for consumers, with one report estimating a 7% rise in household energy costs by 2035. Employees who have accepted resignation buyout offers cite a decline in morale and a loss of talent and knowledge within the agency. A former senior official warns that the cuts will negatively affect consumers and U.S. competitiveness internationally, while a Department of Energy spokesperson refutes these claims, stating that the changes will lower costs for American consumers.</p>

Some industries, like industrial manufacturing, believe they can profit from the tariffs, while others are insulated from international competition. The situation is further complicated by legal challenges to the tariffs and logistical disruptions, creating a mixed bag for Georgia's economy.</p>

          <p>A rare gold lobster, named Calvin, was saved from being cooked at a Rhode Island restaurant after a cook noticed its unusual coloring. The lobster's gold hue is due to a genetic mutation that occurs in only about one in 30 million lobsters. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center, where it will be displayed for educational purposes. The center's director noted that gold lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange lobsters, and boiling would have turned it red like all cooked lobsters.</p>

          <p>Denmark is raising its retirement age to 70, prompting experts to consider whether the U.S. may follow suit. While some see the move as a signal to work longer, others argue that it may not be a suitable solution for the U.S. due to income inequality and differences in life expectancy. Experts suggest that raising the retirement age in the U.S. could disproportionately harm those at the bottom income quartiles who already receive benefits for a shorter period of time. Additionally, the phased implementation of such a change would take time to produce savings for the Social Security program.</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that President Trump and the MAGA movement are fundamentally anti-conservative, displaying a disdain for laws, procedures, and the Constitution. The author contends that Trump seeks to empower the federal government for brute force, rewarding allies and destroying opponents. The piece asserts that the Republican Party, now controlled by Trump, has abandoned its former principles of limited government, individual liberty, and checks and balances, instead embracing abuse of power and vengeance. The author suggests that this shift is leading America toward authoritarianism.</p>

While there is confidence that the ambition will be reached, some measures will be unaffordable if the spending level is not reached. The review will warn of new threats with drones and AI, and it will recommend the deployment of digital experts alongside troops.
