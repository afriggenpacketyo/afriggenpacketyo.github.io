        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has taken the rare step of filing a misconduct complaint against Judge James Boasberg, accusing him of making improper public comments and criticizing his rulings in a case concerning deported Venezuelan migrants. The complaint alleges Boasberg publicly predicted presidential lawlessness and rushed the government through litigation, sparking a complex review process. While the Justice Department argues the judge's actions violated judicial rules, several legal experts suggest the complaint is misdirected, viewing it as an unusual and aggressive tactic against the judiciary. The outcome of the review could range from dismissal to a recommendation for impeachment proceedings.</p>

          <p>The Pittsburgh Pirates have traded Gold Glove-winning third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes to the Cincinnati Reds in a notable NL Central division deal. In exchange, the Pirates will receive reliever Taylor Rogers and shortstop prospect Sammy Stafura. Hayes, who signed a long-term $70 million contract, provides the Reds with exceptional defensive skill, though he has struggled offensively this season. The trade signals a cost-clearing move for the rebuilding Pirates while bolstering the Reds' roster as they aim for a playoff spot, currently sitting just a few games out of a wild-card position.</p>

This strategic pivot to AI, which also includes the development of smart glasses with partners like Ray-Ban, is proving financially successful for the company. Meta reported strong second-quarter earnings, with analysts noting the move helps future-proof the company amid changing social media trends and antitrust scrutiny.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Prime Minister has announced a significant foreign policy shift, with plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September. This move follows similar recent announcements from G7 allies France and the UK. The recognition is conditional on the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms, including holding elections in 2026 without the participation of Hamas. The Canadian government cited the expansion of Israeli settlements, the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the need to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution as primary motivations for this change in approach.</p>

The offering values the company at $19.3 billion, close to the $20 billion acquisition price Adobe had offered before the deal was terminated due to regulatory challenges. The successful IPO reflects a gradually reopening market for tech companies and strong investor confidence in Figma's performance. The company reported revenue growth of 40% in the most recent quarter, demonstrating continued momentum as it prepares to debut on the New York Stock Exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:02:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brown University has settled with the Trump administration, restoring nearly $50 million in federal research funding and closing several government investigations into the institution. The agreement requires Brown to reaffirm its commitment to nondiscrimination policies and grant federal officials access to admissions data. Unlike a similar settlement with Columbia University, Brown's deal involves no financial penalty. The university will also implement the administration's definitions of male and female for certain campus programs and facilities, but the agreement preserves Brown's autonomy over teaching, learning, and academic speech.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has publicly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing the move "risks rewarding terror." Emily Damari, who was released after more than 15 months in captivity, stated that such recognition emboldens extremists and undermines prospects for genuine peace. Her comments echo concerns from lawyers representing other British hostage families, who fear the policy could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages. The UK's proposal is conditioned on a ceasefire agreement, which the families worry Hamas will now refuse to accept.</p>

          <p>A significant technical failure at the UK's national air traffic control service (NATS) caused major flight disruptions, grounding thousands of planes and leading to over 150 cancellations. Although the radar-related issue at the Swanwick control center lasted only 20 minutes before a backup system was activated, it created a massive backlog at major airports like Heathrow and Manchester. This is the second major outage for NATS in two years, prompting apologies from the firm and calls for an investigation from political leaders.

Bolsonaro, a far-right ally of Trump, is accused of plotting a military coup to remain in power after his electoral defeat. The administration's actions, including sanctioning Justice Alexandre de Moraes under a human rights law, are seen as an extraordinary use of U.S. economic power to interfere in a foreign judicial system.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's grand strategy to disengage from global conflicts to focus solely on containing China has failed. Instead of pivoting resources away from Europe and the Middle East, the administration has become more deeply entangled in both regions. The protracted war in Ukraine and new military strikes against Iran have demanded significant American attention and resources, contrary to the president's promises. This continued involvement has drained American power and inadvertently provided Beijing with strategic breathing room, undermining the core premise of the administration's foreign policy.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to Impose 50% Tariff on Copper Pipes and Wiring</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on certain copper products, including pipes, tubes, and wiring, in a move the White House says is necessary for national security. However, the tariff notably excludes raw copper materials such as ores, concentrates, and cathodes, which are key imports for U.S. industry. This narrower-than-expected scope caused U.S. copper prices to fall sharply, as markets had anticipated sweeping restrictions on all forms of the metal. The policy is expected to aid domestic manufacturers of finished goods but offers little support to U.S. copper mining companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>By declining to run for California governor, Kamala Harris has strategically kept the possibility of a 2028 presidential campaign alive, according to political analysis. Running the nation's largest state while simultaneously preparing a presidential bid would have been a monumental challenge, and she would have faced pressure to commit fully to California voters. While some close to Harris questioned her appetite for the state-level role after serving as vice president, the decision allows her to avoid that path. She would enter a potential 2028 primary with high name recognition, but also face a likely large field of Democratic contenders.</p>

Arm, which designs the architecture used in chips for major tech companies like Apple and Qualcomm, provided a second-quarter revenue forecast that was in line with Wall Street's projections.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged pressure from President Trump but emphasized that the decision was data-dependent, noting that the economy does not appear to be held back by restrictive policy.

Despite countless theories, investigations, and searches, no definitive evidence has ever surfaced to explain what happened to him.
