            <h2>Analysis: UK Trade Deal with US Under Trump May Not Be Gamechanger</h2>

            <p>An analysis suggests that a UK trade deal with the US under Donald Trump is unlikely to be a gamechanger for the UK economy, and could even be detrimental. The author argues that Trump views trade deals as a means of asserting power, and that the US is acting as a global hegemon. The author suggests that a free trade agreement with Trump's US can only be fundamentally defensive, protecting British trade interests, and that the US is never going to be the biggest driver of Britain’s elusive economic growth.</p>

            <p>The European Union is drawing lessons from past clashes with China as it prepares to navigate a potential trade war with the United States under a Donald Trump presidency. The EU is learning to defend its interests and maintain unity in the face of external pressure. This shift comes as Europe considers using some of the same tactics it employed against Beijing to counter potential trade actions from Washington. The EU is preparing to turn some of the weapons it had trained on Beijing towards Washington for potential use in the erstwhile allies’ worsening trade war.</p>

            <p>China is shifting its approach in the trade war with the U.S., moving away from tariff retaliation on goods and focusing on measures targeting the American services sector. This change in strategy follows U.S. President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese goods, which Beijing has described as a "meaningless numbers game." Instead, China is implementing non-tariff restrictive measures, including tightening export controls on rare-earth minerals and opening antitrust probes into American companies. China is also targeting Boeing, America's largest exporter, by ordering Chinese airlines not to take any further deliveries for its jets and requested carriers to halt any purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, according to Bloomberg.</p>

The rise follows comments by the head of US central bank who said President Donald Trump's tariff policies are likely to mean slower growth, higher prices and unemployment risks. Gold is seen as a safe haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, with analysts comparing this year's rally to the Iranian Revolution more than four decades ago. (not investment advice)</p>
