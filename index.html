          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are actively investigating media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The claims, reported by the Mail on Sunday, suggest he provided officers with her date of birth and social security number. This development follows calls for King Charles III to strip Andrew of his "prince" title. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations made against him regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>An Ohio man, Connor Weston, has been charged with criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment after disrupting a Wikipedia conference in Manhattan. He allegedly stormed the stage with a gun, pointed it at his head and the ceiling, and threatened to take his own life. Weston was also wearing a sign identifying himself as a "non-offending pedophile." Conference safety team members successfully tackled and disarmed him before police arrived, preventing any injuries and allowing the event to resume the following day.</p>

          <p>Millions of people participated in the second nationwide "No Kings" day of protest, organized by a network of progressive groups opposing the Trump administration's policies. Demonstrators cited a range of issues, from immigration enforcement to environmental protection rollbacks, under the unifying theme that the president is acting like a monarch. The events were largely peaceful, featuring rallies, marches, and creative displays in cities across the country. While some Republican lawmakers criticized the protests, participants framed the action as a patriotic defense of American democracy.</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians within Gaza, which would constitute a serious violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The U.S. State Department has informed other mediators, including Egypt and Qatar, and stated that measures would be taken to protect Gazans if the attack proceeds. Hamas has denied the allegations, accusing Israel of supporting rival armed gangs to destabilize the region. This warning comes amid a fragile peace and efforts by Hamas to reassert control in the territory.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack has reportedly caused a fire and damaged a workshop at the Orenburg gas processing plant, one of the world's largest such facilities, according to the regional governor. The strike represents a significant escalation in Ukraine's campaign targeting Russian energy infrastructure to disrupt fuel supplies and economic resources for Moscow's war effort. No injuries were reported among the plant's employees. Russia's Defence Ministry stated it had downed 45 Ukrainian drones overnight across several regions, highlighting the increasing scale of these long-range attacks.</p>

          <p>A growing number of major companies, including Accenture and Salesforce, are publicly blaming artificial intelligence for recent job cuts, fueling employee anxiety about technological replacement. However, some critics and academics suggest AI is being used as a convenient "scapegoat" for layoffs that may be driven by other factors, such as over-hiring during the pandemic or general economic slowdowns. Recent data from the New York Fed and Yale University's Budget Lab indicates that AI has not yet caused significant widespread job disruption, suggesting firms may be using the narrative to appear innovative.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, initially sparked by a 2016 BBC secret filming operation, has culminated in the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare (SMT), targeted over 3,500 mostly elderly victims who were desperate to exit their timeshare contracts. Using high-pressure sales tactics, the company defrauded them of their money for useless "credits" while funding a lavish lifestyle for its owners. The Crown Prosecution Service will now pursue the assets gained through the criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits is determined by changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). This index measures inflation based on the spending habits of a segment of the population that differs from retirees, who often face higher costs in areas like healthcare and housing. As a result, the COLA often fails to keep pace with the actual expenses of seniors, leading to a gradual decline in the purchasing power of their benefits over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a massive summer spending spree, Liverpool FC's performance has been inconsistent, with some analysis pointing to the tactical void left by the departure of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid. The article suggests the team now struggles more against high-pressing opponents and in building up play from the back. Alexander-Arnold's unique long-passing range and ability to use his weaker foot provided tactical options that his replacements have not yet replicated. This has forced other players, like new signing Florian Wirtz, to drop into deeper positions, potentially limiting their attacking effectiveness.</p>

          <p>It is common for sexual frequency and desire to decrease in long-term relationships, a phenomenon experts attribute to both hormonal changes and relational dynamics. Psychologists note that after the initial passionate phase driven by certain hormones, the bonding hormone oxytocin becomes more prominent, which can dampen sex drive. For heterosexual women, a discrepancy between physical and psychological arousal can also be a factor. Experts emphasize that open communication, non-sexual physical affection, and prioritizing intimacy are key to maintaining a satisfying sexual connection.</p>

          <p>Rising temperatures and extreme weather events are placing significant stress on the United Kingdom's native trees, with iconic species like oak showing signs of decline. In response, Forestry England has released a list of 30 "species for the future," including non-native trees like the coast redwood, that are better adapted to thrive in a warmer climate. This strategy, known as assisted migration, aims to create more diverse and resilient forests to future-proof the nation's woodlands. The rapid pace of human-driven climate change is exceeding trees' natural ability to adapt.</p>

          <p>A 71-year-old woman who has lived for nearly two decades in a cottage on the West Horsley Place estate is facing eviction. The estate, famously used as the "Button House" location for the BBC sitcom *Ghosts*, is managed by a charitable trust that reportedly plans to convert her home into a holiday rental for fans of the show. The tenant, Baschea Walsh, expressed her heartbreak at being forced to leave a home and community she loves. The trust stated it has provided an extended notice period and assistance in finding alternative housing.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has announced a plan to develop a "T-Dome," a new multilayered air defense network designed to protect the island from potential missile and drone attacks from mainland China. The proposal, which appears to draw inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome system, aims to be accelerated with increased defense spending and the use of advanced technologies like AI. However, the announcement reportedly surprised Taiwan's own defense establishment, as the project was not mentioned in the latest National Defence Report and has no current budget allocation.</p>

          <p>Japan's political landscape is set for a major shift as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the opposition Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) have reportedly agreed to form a coalition. This alliance is expected to pave the way for LDP leader Sanae Takaichi to become the nation's first female prime minister. The move follows the recent collapse of the LDP's long-standing coalition with the Komeito party, which had thrown Takaichi's path to the premiership into doubt. The new coalition is expected to vote for Takaichi in the upcoming parliamentary election.</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California's hopes for a College Football Playoff berth took a significant blow with a 34-24 loss to the University of Notre Dame in a rain-soaked rivalry game. USC's offense struggled with costly mistakes, including two fourth-quarter interceptions and a critical fumble on a trick play. The Trojans' defense was unable to contain Notre Dame's rushing attack, which amassed over 300 yards on the ground. The loss gives USC its second of the season, leaving no margin for error as the future of the century-old rivalry itself remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>UCLA quarterback Nico Iamaleava overcame a late-game knee injury to lead his team to a dramatic 20-17 comeback win against Maryland. After being cleared to return with just 35 seconds left and the score tied, Iamaleava quickly moved the Bruins into field goal range. Kicker Mateen Bhaghani sealed the victory with a 23-yard kick as time expired. The win marks UCLA's third consecutive victory, continuing an improbable midseason turnaround after starting the season 0-4 and pushing the team to the brink of a .500 record.</p>
