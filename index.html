          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 16:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have determined that the modern potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species. A study published in the journal Cell explains that a key gene from the ancient tomato enabled the formation of starchy tubers when combined with the genetics of the other wild plant. This discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, resolves a long-standing puzzle about the evolution of one of the world's most important food crops. The findings highlight how hybridization can drive the emergence of new traits and species.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent statement that Epstein had "stolen" her from his Mar-a-Lago club. In their response, the family questioned what the president knew about Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal activities at the time. The statement has intensified scrutiny of Trump's past association with Epstein, even as the White House maintains the president kicked Epstein out of his club for inappropriate behavior. This development comes as Maxwell has reportedly been interviewed by the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Meta and Microsoft both reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, causing their stock prices to climb significantly. The strong performance is largely attributed to their substantial and ongoing investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure, with both companies signaling plans for continued high capital expenditures. Analysts suggest this increased spending will benefit chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom. While some experts applaud Meta's aggressive AI strategy, others express caution about the high level of spending, even as the company's core business remains robust. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma surged 250% in their New York Stock Exchange debut, valuing the company at nearly $68 billion. The successful initial public offering, which priced shares at $33, is seen as a strong signal of a reopening tech IPO market after a multi-year slowdown. Figma, known for its web-based collaborative design tools, has over 13 million monthly users and counts major tech companies among its clients. The strong market reception suggests investor confidence in the tech sector and could encourage more companies to go public. (not investment advice)</p>

Key focus areas include the impact of President Trump's tariff policies on the e-commerce business and the growth trajectory of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Some analysts believe the tariffs may have inadvertently boosted Amazon's market share by diminishing competition from Chinese retailers like Shein and Temu. Additionally, Wall Street will be scrutinizing the company's significant capital expenditures on AI and whether these investments are accelerating growth in its cloud computing segment.

          <p>United Talent Agency (UTA) and Michael Kassan, the founder of strategic advisory firm MediaLink, have agreed to drop their respective lawsuits against one another. The legal battle stemmed from UTA's $125 million acquisition of MediaLink in 2021, with both sides later accusing the other of breaching their contract. UTA had alleged excessive spending by Kassan, while Kassan claimed UTA failed to honor the terms of the deal. In a joint statement, the parties announced they had "agreed to amicably end their dispute," though the specific terms of the settlement were not disclosed.</p>

SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated the goal is to help make America the "crypto capital of the world" by holistically considering the benefits and risks of tokenization. The project will involve updating antiquated rules to allow for innovation, including the development of "super apps" that bundle multiple financial services. The move signals a significant shift toward embracing blockchain technology within the framework of U.S. securities laws. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A medical examiner's report has confirmed that wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, who died last week at age 71, suffered a fatal heart attack. The document also revealed that Hogan, born Terry Bollea, had a history of atrial fibrillation and had been privately battling chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a type of cancer. Hogan rose to fame in the 1980s as a WWE superstar and became a major cultural figure through television and, later, his vocal support for President Trump. His children, Brooke and Nick Hogan, have shared emotional tributes, remembering their father and his larger-than-life impact.</p>

          <p>Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor has lost his appeal in a civil case where a jury found him liable for assaulting Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel in 2018. The Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling, meaning McGregor must pay nearly €250,000 in damages and over a million euros in legal costs. McGregor, who denies the accusation and claims the encounter was consensual, had appealed on procedural grounds. Hand, who was present for the ruling, stated the proceedings had "retraumatized" her but that she now hopes to heal and move on.</p>

          <p>A recent Delta flight that experienced severe turbulence, injuring 25 people, has highlighted the dangers of unstable air during flights. While fatalities are rare, injuries from turbulence have been growing, and some scientists suggest climate change may be a contributing factor by altering jet streams. The most dangerous type is clear-air turbulence, which is invisible and hard to predict, though pilots use weather radar and reports from other aircraft to avoid it. Experts emphasize that modern planes are built to withstand turbulence and that the most effective safety measure for passengers is to keep their seat belts fastened whenever possible.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of research covering nearly 14.5 million students has found that prolonged exposure to heat negatively impacts cognitive abilities and academic performance. The study, published in PLOS Climate, shows a clear correlation between hotter temperatures and lower test scores, particularly in complex subjects like mathematics. The effects are disproportionately felt by students from lower-income families and minority communities, who often lack access to air conditioning. Researchers warn that as global temperatures rise, these educational disparities will likely worsen, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive strategies in schools.</p>

The incident is the latest in a string of break-ins targeting the homes of professional athletes and celebrities in Southern California.

          <p>American buyers of European-made yachts are expected to use legal loopholes to avoid the newly proposed 15% U.S. tariffs on European goods. The most common strategy will likely be registering the vessel in another country, such as the Cayman Islands or Malta, a practice known as "foreign flagging." This allows the yacht to enter U.S. waters as a visiting vessel, thereby circumventing the import tariff. While this strategy is most viable for larger superyachts, smaller boats will likely still be subject to the tax, potentially creating a new divide in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting August 1, millions of student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE repayment plan will see interest begin to accrue on their accounts again. The Biden administration had placed these borrowers in zero-interest forbearance after court injunctions halted the plan. The change could increase the average borrower's monthly costs by around $300, according to one analysis from an advocacy group. While enrollees can choose to remain in forbearance and not make payments, their total loan balance will grow, making it more expensive to pay back over time. (not investment advice)</p>
