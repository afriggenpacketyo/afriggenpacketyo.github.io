          <p>The relationship between the U.S. and India has deteriorated, shifting from pledges of a trade agreement to public disputes. President Trump has labeled India the "tariff king" and threatened higher levies, citing India's oil purchases from Russia. This has jeopardized a partnership that has been strengthening for two decades, largely based on shared concerns about China. While some experts believe the underlying strategic alignment will endure, others warn that the trust between the nations is eroding, making a near-term trade deal unlikely.</p>

          <p>According to JPMorgan analysts, HSBC is poised to offer the highest shareholder yield among banks in the Greater China region, estimated between 9% and 11% for the year. The analysis follows HSBC's announcement of a 10 US cent per share second-quarter dividend and a $3 billion stock buyback plan. Analysts raised their 2026 price target for the bank's stock to HK$122, expressing confidence that its substantial capital buffer will protect dividend payments from potential impairments.

          <p>President Donald Trump has adopted a sports-inspired analogy to describe recent trade negotiations, likening foreign investment commitments from Europe and Japan to a baseball player's "signing bonus." He claimed to have secured a $550 billion investment pledge from Japan and a $600 billion commitment from the European Union, which he stated he could invest as he wished. This characterization is part of his broader narrative that his tariff policies are forcing other nations to make favorable deals that benefit the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Honda Motor's operating profit fell by 50% in the first quarter, significantly missing analyst estimates due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a strengthening yen. Despite the profit plunge, the Japanese automaker raised its full-year forecast, anticipating a smaller-than-expected hit from tariffs and a weaker yen ahead. The results highlight the broader pressure on Japanese carmakers, like Nissan and Toyota, who are grappling with trade headwinds and cutting prices to maintain U.S. market share.

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis reveals that Russia has more than doubled its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine since President Trump took office in January, despite his calls for a ceasefire. The escalation followed temporary pauses in U.S. military aid, which critics argue emboldened Moscow. While the Trump administration states it is working to stop the violence through sanctions and arms sales to NATO allies, Ukraine faces an intensified air campaign fueled by Russia's increased domestic production of munitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite growing awareness and restrictions on single-use items, global production of new plastic is projected to triple by 2050, significantly increasing greenhouse gas emissions. China remains the world's largest producer, and capacity is expanding in most regions outside of the European Union. While over 100 nations support capping production, the measure has been blocked by petro-states like Russia and Saudi Arabia. Experts argue that reducing demand and fostering a circular economy are crucial alongside supply-side regulations.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced that second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, increased by 67%, although slightly below analyst expectations. The Danish pharmaceutical company is facing significant headwinds, including increased U.S. competition, disappointing trial results for a new drug, and the prospect of White House tariffs. Following a recent guidance cut that caused its stock to fall, the company has pledged to reduce costs and sharpen its commercial focus under new leadership.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new season of 'MasterChef' that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following an investigation that upheld misconduct allegations. The decision has drawn criticism from broadcast unions and women's rights groups, who argue that airing the show rewards bad behavior. While the BBC defended its choice to broadcast for the sake of the contestants, the episodes have been re-edited to reduce the hosts' presence, and one contestant was removed at her own request.</p>

          <p>A leading economic think tank, NIESR, has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must implement a sustained tax increase to cover a projected £41.2 billion shortfall and meet her own fiscal rules.

NIESR recommends measures like reforming council tax or extending the freeze on income tax thresholds to stabilize public finances and reassure investors about the UK's economic stability.

          <p>This article explores why football throw-ins, a frequent set-piece, remain a largely undeveloped tactical element in the modern game. Referencing the brief but effective era of Rory Delap's long throws at Stoke City, it questions the lack of innovation and proposes new strategies. Ideas include specialized training for long-throw specialists and developing complex set-plays, similar to corners, that exploit the fact that the offside rule does not apply, potentially revolutionizing a neglected aspect of the sport.</p>

The national priority project, Guo Wang, has recently accelerated its launch schedule, consuming much of the available state-owned rocket capacity. This has left other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan constellation, to seek launches from private companies, suggesting that China may need to consolidate its efforts behind a single, favored candidate to effectively compete in the space-based internet race.</p>
