          <p>The Trump administration has launched investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review, prompted by reports that the journal prioritized articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. The investigations, conducted by the Department of Education and Health and Human Services, are in response to claims that the Law Review's selection process violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This action follows previous disputes between the administration and Harvard over DEI programs and concerns about antisemitism on campus, including a recent freeze on $2.2 billion in grants to the university.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump met to strategize on the GOP's budget reconciliation efforts, aiming to reshape federal spending according to Trump's domestic agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized "great unity" among Republican leaders on a budget bill prioritizing tax cuts, trade, and deregulation, with hopes of passing the tax portion by July 4. Despite these efforts, recent polls indicate a decline in public approval of Trump's job performance. Johnson remains optimistic about the GOP's chances in upcoming elections, highlighting opportunities in districts currently held by Democrats but won by Trump.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's shift in priorities for the Justice Department's civil rights division has resulted in a mass exodus of lawyers and staff. The division, now under the leadership of Harmeet K. Dhillon, is expected to focus on cases against Ivy League schools and liberal cities, rather than traditional civil rights enforcement. This change in direction has prompted many veterans of the office to leave, with over 100 attorneys expected to resign.</p>
