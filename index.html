          <p>McDonald's is introducing ten new beverages to hundreds of its U.S. restaurants, responding to Gen Z's preference for unique drink combinations. This move follows the closure of its standalone drink-focused chain, CosMc's, with the company now integrating successful beverage concepts directly into its main stores. The new lineup, including items like Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and Popping Tropic Refresher, will be tested in select markets starting in September. This strategy aims to capitalize on the growing beverage market and boost sales after a recent downturn.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The legal action comes shortly after an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot by an undocumented immigrant. Attorney General Pam Bondi and other officials argue that these policies protect criminals and endanger citizens. In response, the mayor's office has expressed that while it supports the principle of sanctuary laws, they may go too far in cases involving violent criminals, calling for a re-examination by the City Council.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is undergoing a significant reorganization that will force thousands of employees to relocate from the Washington D.C. area and accept salary reductions. The plan involves consolidating offices, eliminating management layers, and moving over half of the capital-based staff to new hubs in cities like Kansas City and Raleigh. Critics, including lawmakers and policy experts, warn that this move could weaken support for farmers, disrupt essential services like wildfire response, and lead to a mass loss of experienced staff. The administration frames the move as a way to reduce bureaucracy and move services closer to constituents.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, with a formal declaration planned for the United Nations General Assembly in September. Macron emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza and stated the decision aligns with France's commitment to a just peace in the Middle East. This move makes France one of the most powerful European nations to take this step, joining over 140 other countries. The decision was condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who argued it rewards terrorism and undermines Israel's security.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly pleaded with resident doctors in England to call off their planned five-day strike over pay, warning it would be a "huge loss for the NHS and the country." The British Medical Association (BMA) is demanding a pay restoration to 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation, arguing that wages have been significantly eroded. The government has offered a 5.4% pay rise, which it calls the highest in the public sector, and is willing to negotiate on working conditions but not on further pay increases. The strike threatens to cause major disruptions, with over a million appointments already canceled due to previous walkouts.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he understands President Trump's frustration with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and believes interest rates should be lowered to address issues like housing affordability. Johnson described the path for Powell as a "rocky road," acknowledging the economic argument against cutting rates during a strong economy but suggesting "desperate times call for desperate measures." While echoing the president's desire for rate cuts, the Speaker also noted his uncertainty about the legal authority a president has to fire a Fed chair. This provides a political perspective on the ongoing tensions between the White House and the central bank.</p>

This policy follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that allows for the criminalization of sleeping in public, even without available shelter.

At the time, the cryptocurrency market was plunging, but it has since rebounded to near-record highs. Had Tesla retained its full investment, its digital assets would be worth approximately $5 billion today instead of the current $1.24 billion. While the company's focus is on vehicles and AI, this significant missed opportunity comes as Tesla faces declining auto revenue and a falling stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a rescissions bill into law, successfully clawing back $9 billion in previously approved congressional funding. The legislation, which marks a rare use of the presidential rescission power, targets approximately $8 billion in foreign assistance programs and $1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The passage of the bill was contentious, with some Republican lawmakers expressing reservations about its impact on specific programs like global AIDS prevention and rural broadcast stations. The White House has indicated this may be the first of several such requests to cut spending.</p>

          <p>An intense heat dome that has been affecting the central U.S. is now moving eastward, placing over 130 million Americans under heat alerts across at least 20 states. Forecasters predict temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average, with feel-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas. In the Midwest's Corn Belt, the extreme heat has been exacerbated by "corn sweat," a phenomenon where vast fields of corn release thousands of gallons of water vapor per acre daily. This process of evapotranspiration significantly increases humidity and can make the heat feel even more oppressive.</p>

          <p>American Airlines' stock fell sharply after the carrier issued a third-quarter profit forecast that missed expectations and significantly reduced its full-year 2025 financial outlook. The airline now projects an adjusted 2025 result ranging from a loss to minimal earnings, a steep drop from its initial forecast. CEO Robert Isom cited weakness in the domestic consumer market, flat corporate travel demand, and operational disruptions from storms as key factors. While international travel remains strong, the airline is scaling back its overall capacity growth in response to the challenging domestic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Epping Forest District Council has unanimously voted to ask the UK government to shut down the Bell Hotel, which is being used to house asylum seekers. The decision follows a series of heated protests and unrest outside the hotel, leading to 17 arrests. The demonstrations began after a resident of the hotel was charged with sexual assault. Council leaders expressed concern that the protests are being infiltrated by political extremists and that the hotel is an inappropriate location for vulnerable people without adequate support facilities.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary order blocking a lower court's decision that would have effectively nullified a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. The ruling from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had claimed that private citizens could not bring lawsuits to enforce the act's protections against race-based voter discrimination. This would have limited enforcement to only the Department of Justice. While the Supreme Court's order preserves the ability of individuals to sue for now, three conservative justices—Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch—dissented, indicating their support for leaving the restrictive lower court decision in place.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexual assault charges, citing a lack of credibility in the complainant's allegations. The judge determined that the prosecution did not meet the necessary burden of proof in the case, which stemmed from an incident in a London, Ontario, hotel room in 2018. The case had drawn significant public attention, leading to investigations by police, Hockey Canada, and the NHL. The players, four of whom were active in the NHL, had been on indefinite leave since the charges were filed.</p>

The unusual meeting was arranged by the Department of Justice to seek information Maxwell might have about other potential abusers connected to Epstein's network.

          <p>The Trump administration's current immigration policies are creating a less visible but still impactful form of family separation by dismantling protections for unaccompanied minors. Instead of separating children at the border, the administration is making it harder for relatives to sponsor them, requiring more stringent proof of legal status and income. This has led to children being held in government facilities for much longer periods. Additionally, funding for legal aid for these minors has been cut, and ICE is conducting "wellness checks" on sponsors, creating a climate of fear that deters families from coming forward.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. The court found that the law violates the Second Amendment by imposing a significant burden on the right to keep and bear arms. This decision effectively strikes down a key provision of a 2016 ballot measure intended to strengthen the state's gun control regulations. The ruling, which cited a 2022 Supreme Court decision limiting state-level gun laws, was celebrated by gun rights activists but condemned by gun violence prevention groups, who argued the law was effective at stopping prohibited individuals from buying ammunition.</p>
