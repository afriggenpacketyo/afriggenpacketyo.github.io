          <p>Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Nobitex, suffered a hack resulting in the theft of over $90 million in cryptocurrency, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The stolen funds were transferred from platform wallets to addresses containing anti-government messages referencing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), suggesting a politically motivated cyberattack. The pro-Israel hacking group Gonjeshke Darande, or "Predatory Sparrow," claimed responsibility for the attack and said it would release the exchange's source code. This incident occurred amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with Predatory Sparrow also claiming credit for a separate cyberattack on Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah this week. </p>

          <p>Oil prices remained relatively stable after President Donald Trump indicated that Iran was interested in negotiating over its nuclear program, following a series of Israeli airstrikes. Trump told reporters that the Iranians had reached out and suggested sending a delegation to the White House for negotiations, signaling a potential shift in tone from his previous threats. Despite considering a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, Trump stated that a negotiated settlement was still possible. Oil prices have increased by approximately 10% since Israel initiated its campaign against Iran, reflecting market sensitivity to geopolitical tensions. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its patient approach as it assesses the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff policy. The federal funds rate remains between 4.25% and 4.5%, despite Trump's repeated calls for the Fed to lower rates. The Fed's forecast indicates some concern about a potential resurgence of inflation, with the personal consumption expenditures index expected to rise from 2.1% to 3% over the remainder of 2025. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that tariffs would likely push up prices and weigh on economic activity, but the Fed is well-positioned to wait for more clarity before making any adjustments to its policy stance.

          <p>Humanity is currently producing more food than ever, but this agricultural output is heavily concentrated in a few key regions, making the global food supply vulnerable to climate change. A new study in Nature indicates that major crop-growing areas, including the US Midwest, are projected to experience significant harvest declines due to changing weather patterns. Under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, six staple crops are expected to see an 11.2% decline by the end of the century compared to a world without warming. The largest drops are anticipated in regions already serving as major food producers, highlighting the potential for widespread food insecurity. </p>

          <p>A Hungarian law, allegedly designed to protect children, is likely to be used to ban an upcoming Budapest Pride event, prompting condemnation from EU lawmakers who are urging the EU to pressure Hungary into allowing LGBTQ+ events. The Hungarian Parliament passed a bill in March permitting the prohibition of public LGBTQ+ events on "child protection" grounds and enabling police to use facial recognition technology to identify attendees. Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony, a liberal political opponent of Orban, has attempted to hold a Pride celebration as a municipal event to circumvent the law. The European Commission has initiated infringement proceedings against Budapest, which are currently under review by the European Court of Justice. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained its interest rates amidst expectations of increased inflation and decreased economic growth, while still indicating two potential rate reductions later in the year. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep its key borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, a level that has been in place since December. The committee's closely monitored "dot plot" suggests that two rate cuts by the end of 2025 are still under consideration, although it reduced the expected future rate cuts for both 2026 and 2027. Economic projections from meeting participants pointed to further stagflationary pressures, with participants forecasting a 1.4% pace for gross domestic product in 2025 and an inflation rate of 3%.

          <p>The Trump administration will delay the ban on TikTok for the third time, extending it for 90 days, according to the White House. President Donald Trump met with advisers in the Situation Room after leaving a summit with Group of Seven leaders early, citing tensions in the Middle East. Trump has been presented with a range of options by his national security team related to Iran, including the potential use of American military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are making changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by the House to fund much of President Trump's domestic agenda. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain stable interest rates offers savers an opportunity to earn substantial returns on their money, particularly through certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. Despite a slight decrease from previous years, interest rates remain high, especially for online CD accounts, providing a fixed rate of return. Depositing funds into a 1-year CD this June could yield hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest, depending on the deposit amount and interest rate. With alternatives like high-yield savings and money market accounts utilizing variable rates, a 1-year CD could be a beneficial way to grow money in a relatively expedited timeframe.
