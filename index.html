          <p>Hurricane Erick has intensified into an 'extremely dangerous' Category 4 hurricane, according to US forecasters. The storm is nearing Mexico, prompting warnings for residents in the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, who are most likely to be impacted. The National Hurricane Center warns of potentially devastating wind damage, life-threatening floods, and swells. Around 2,000 shelters have been set up across the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca, and more than 18,000 first responders have been mobilized to prepare for the hurricane. The storm is expected to be the first to make landfall in Mexico this season, which runs from June to the end of November.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during preparations for an engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility in Texas. The explosion destroyed the rocket and potentially damaged infrastructure, likely delaying future test flights. The Starship was being filled with liquid oxygen and methane fuel when the incident occurred, and SpaceX confirmed the anomaly, stating that all personnel were safe. This setback occurs as NASA relies on the Starship for lunar landings in the coming years, requiring multiple successful launches and refueling in orbit, highlighting the challenges of the ambitious project.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and disabled a nearly 3,000-foot-long narcotics smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found in early April, ran under part of the Otay Mesa Port of Entry and was equipped with lighting, electrical wiring, ventilation, and a track system. Authorities found the entrance in a house in Tijuana, recently covered with new tile, and plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use. Since 1993, over 95 tunnels have been decommissioned in the San Diego area, as officials continue to strengthen border security.</p>

The acquisition will make Nippon Steel the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, expanding its global capacity and presence in overseas markets.

          <p>China has urged the United States to "look at the whole picture" regarding tariffs and trade relations, as tensions remain despite a recently agreed framework to ease some restrictions. Chinese ambassador Xie Feng stated that tariffs on Chinese imports are "still unreasonably high" and that export controls and visa denials hinder trade. He suggested that the U.S. goods deficit will persist as long as the U.S. restricts exports of competitive products and limits access for Chinese businesses, tourists, and students. The remarks come as both countries attempt to implement a trade consensus reached in May to reduce tariffs.</p>

The Times says the UK is weighing whether to provide the US with military support if Trump decides to strike Iran.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duties amid rising tariffs, by changing product materials or dimensions to fit into different tariff classifications. This legal practice involves altering items so they qualify for lower rates under the harmonized system code. Companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse have successfully implemented strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs. The article notes that while some sectors can easily implement tariff engineering, more heavily regulated sectors face challenges due to extensive validation and approval processes.
