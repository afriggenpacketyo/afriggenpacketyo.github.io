          <p>A Belgian music festival has canceled a scheduled performance by the Munich Philharmonic, citing concerns over the Israeli nationality of its conductor, Lahav Shani. The Flanders Festival Ghent stated it could not get sufficient clarity on his stance regarding the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, despite Shani's past calls for peace. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from German officials and the orchestra itself, who condemned it as a "cultural boycott" and an attack on democratic values, likening it to a collective punishment of Israeli artists based on their origin.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly asked the European Union to implement tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their continued purchases of Russian oil. The proposal is seen as a new strategy to increase economic pressure on Russia's war economy and punish nations trading with Moscow. However, European officials are reportedly hesitant to adopt the measure, concerned about alienating key trade partners and escalating trade disputes, especially given the EU's own complex energy relationship with Russia.

The successful IPO will test Wall Street's confidence in Klarna's strategic expansion into banking services, including a new debit card and deposit accounts, as it competes with rivals like Affirm and faces potential regulatory headwinds.

          <p>Former Liverpool defender Andre Wisdom has opened up about the 2020 stabbing incident that he says definitively altered the course of his professional career. Attacked by several masked men who stole his watch, Wisdom suffered multiple stab wounds that required surgery and left him with lasting physical and emotional trauma. Despite making a remarkable return to play for Derby County just months later, he struggled to regain his previous form and was eventually released. Now playing for a seventh-tier club, Wisdom reflects on the incident and his gratitude for still being able to play football.</p>

          <p>A recent Morgan Stanley report reveals that over 90% of U.S. investors surveyed are willing to increase their exposure to China's market, marking the highest level of interest since early 2021. This shift is attributed to China's leadership in specific sectors like robotics and biotech, efforts to stabilize its economy, and a growing demand for diversification away from U.S. assets. Despite this renewed interest, the report suggests the capital relocation is just beginning, as many investors need time to research individual stocks after having retreated from the market in previous years.

          <p>US pharmaceutical company Merck, known as MSD in Europe, is canceling its planned £1 billion expansion in the United Kingdom, which includes a major research site in London. The company attributed the decision to the UK government's failure to adequately invest in the life sciences industry and its undervaluation of innovative medicines. This move, which will result in over 100 job losses, is seen as a significant blow to the UK's ambitions as a science hub and follows similar investment reductions by other major pharmaceutical firms like AstraZeneca.

          <p>Eyewitnesses to the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk report that he was ironically in the middle of a debate about gun violence when the gunshot struck him. An attendee standing near the front of the event at Utah Valley University stated that Kirk was responding to a question on the topic when a single shot was heard, causing him to collapse. The event was part of Kirk's "Prove Me Wrong" tour, where he invites students to challenge his views. The detail adds a tragic layer to the assassination as authorities continue their search for the shooter.</p>

          <p>Three senior FBI officials who were fired last month have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming their terminations were an illegal, politically motivated purge. The complaint alleges that FBI Director Kash Patel told one of the agents that his own job depended on firing individuals involved in past investigations of President Trump, stating the president "hasn't forgotten" the FBI's actions. The lawsuit argues these firings were part of a broader effort to punish law enforcement for their work and asserts that such actions jeopardize national security by undermining the agency's independence.</p>

          <p>A Vietnamese family in San José is contemplating closing their jewelry store after a terrifying smash-and-grab robbery where a mob of masked individuals crashed an SUV through their storefront. The brazen daylight heist, which was captured on video, left the 88-year-old owner traumatized and hospitalized after suffering a stroke during the event. The incident has sparked outrage within the local community and among public safety advocates, who are calling for increased law enforcement resources and tougher penalties to combat organized crime rings targeting businesses in the area.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive report from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) indicates a continued decline in democratic health worldwide. Analyzing 173 countries, the study found that over half showed a decline in at least one key democratic indicator, such as credible elections or access to justice, between 2019 and 2024. The report highlights a particularly sharp global deterioration in press freedom, which saw its biggest drop in 50 years, attributed to government crackdowns, disinformation, and lingering effects of the pandemic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from real estate company Redfin suggests that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a level of "normalcy" seen in July 2018, when measured as a ratio of mortgage payments to local income. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with rapidly growing wages for tech workers in the Bay Area. However, the analysis does not imply affordability, as San Francisco households in 2018 still spent a much higher share of their income on housing than the national average, and the trend does not reflect rising costs for renters.

          <p>An analysis piece frames the murder of Charlie Kirk not only as a personal tragedy but also as a disaster for a country already steeped in paranoia and political hatred. The author argues that while Kirk was a divisive provocateur, his killing during a public debate represents a violent assault on the principle of free speech. The article condemns the immediate rush by some to use his death as a pretext for political repression, warning that in an atmosphere of escalating political violence, each act makes the next one more likely, further imperiling American democracy.</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has collected rock samples from a dried river channel on Mars that contain the strongest indications to date of possible ancient microbial life. The samples contain organic carbon along with iron phosphate and iron sulfide compounds, which on Earth are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. Scientists emphasize that while this is a compelling candidate, non-biological processes could also be responsible for the findings. Conclusive analysis will require returning the samples to Earth, an ambitious mission that is currently being re-evaluated by NASA.</p>

The judge had granted the injunction, stating that Cook demonstrated a strong likelihood that her removal would violate federal law requiring it be for "cause," and that Fed independence was in the public interest. Trump sought to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Her lawyers argue the firing is a pretext in a broader campaign to pressure the central bank on interest rates.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, experts on domestic terrorism are warning that the event could act as a flashpoint, escalating an already significant surge in U.S. political violence. Researchers note that politically motivated attacks in the first half of the year nearly doubled compared to the same period last year. They fear that Kirk's murder could inspire retaliatory acts, creating a "vicious spiral" where violence is seen as a justifiable response. This trend is fueled by deep political animosity, economic insecurity, and the spread of conspiracy theories online.</p>
