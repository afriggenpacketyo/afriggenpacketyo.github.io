          <p>A BBC reporter witnessed repeated violations of a ceasefire by Myanmar's ruling junta in the Karenni state following a devastating earthquake. Despite vowing a halt to its military campaign, the junta continued rocket and mortar attacks, killing and injuring civilians and resistance fighters. The UN has called for an end to the military operations, but the junta claims it was attacked by resistance groups. The conflict has displaced millions, and the earthquake has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the country, where ethnic groups and young insurgents are fighting against military rule.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow left Sunday's game against the Pirates in the second inning due to right-shoulder discomfort.

Glasnow underwent Tommy John surgery in 2021, raising concerns about the severity of the current issue.

          <p>The musical “Dead Outlaw,” based on the true story of Elmer McCurdy, a failed crook who gained posthumous fame as a mummified corpse, has premiered on Broadway.

The project, named DolphinGemma, utilizes AI models trained on decades of dolphin sound recordings to identify patterns and structures in their vocalizations. By analyzing clicks, whistles, and buzzes associated with different dolphin behaviors, the project hopes to create a shared vocabulary for interactive communication. Google plans to release DolphinGemma as an open-source model, enabling researchers worldwide to study dolphin communication across various species.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Columbus Day will solely be recognized as Columbus Day, reversing the previous administration's practice of also acknowledging Indigenous Peoples Day. Trump accused Democrats of denigrating Christopher Columbus and his legacy. The decision aligns with Trump's broader efforts to restore what he views as traditional American icons and narratives. The federal holiday will continue to be observed on the second Monday in October.</p>
