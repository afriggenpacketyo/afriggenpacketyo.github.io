          <p>A federal judge has denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury materials related to the Ghislaine Maxwell case. Judge Paul Engelmayer stated the government's argument for transparency was "disingenuous," as the materials contain no significant new information about Maxwell's or Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, their associates, or the investigation itself. The judge concluded that releasing the documents, which primarily consist of testimony from two law enforcement officials already made public, would not serve the public interest and might be perceived as a diversionary tactic rather than a genuine move toward transparency.</p>

Bell fell into a crevasse during a dogsled expedition, and his body was never recovered. The discovery, made by a Polish research team, included over 200 personal items and was confirmed through DNA analysis. Bell's surviving family expressed shock and gratitude for the closure this finding provides after 66 years, highlighting a growing trend of such discoveries as global glaciers melt.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to nearly $120,000, approaching its all-time high, while Ether also experienced a significant rally, reaching levels not seen since 2021. The upward trend in cryptocurrency markets is reportedly fueled by buying during Asian trading hours, driven by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt. This has created a favorable environment for hard assets like Bitcoin and gold. The rally has also boosted the stock prices of related companies, including Coinbase, Circle, and various crypto miners, as investor confidence in the sector grows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have reached an unusual agreement with the Trump administration, allowing them to sell specific AI chips to China in exchange for giving the U.S. government 15% of the revenue. This deal provides the companies with export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, which were previously restricted. While analysts view the arrangement as transactional and unprecedented, investors see it as a net positive, as securing 85% of revenue is better than being completely shut out of the lucrative Chinese market. The move raises long-term questions about potential future government cuts and China's reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

He has threatened a potential federal takeover, including deploying the National Guard, to restore order and beautify the nation's capital. This comes despite official police data showing a year-to-date decrease in overall and violent crime in the city. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, highlighting the city's success in reducing crime to a 30-year low and stating that the president's claims are based on outdated 2023 figures.</p>

Experts emphasize that the value of these cards is diminishing for many, especially for those who carry a monthly balance, as high interest rates can quickly negate any rewards earned. Before applying, consumers should consider their travel frequency, brand loyalty, and whether a general travel card or a co-branded card is more suitable for their spending habits.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady but expected to make cuts soon, financial analysts advise savers to act quickly to secure high returns on their cash. Options like high-yield savings accounts, currently offering over 4%, provide liquidity but have variable rates that will likely fall with Fed cuts. For those with a set timeline, certificates of deposit (CDs) and U.S. Treasury bonds offer a way to lock in current high rates for a fixed period. This strategy is recommended for short- to intermediate-term goals to maximize earnings before the window of opportunity closes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in China experienced a 5% month-on-month decline in July, totaling 1.26 million units, marking the first dip since May. This slowdown is attributed to weaker consumer demand as automakers reduced the significant price cuts that had previously fueled sales. The average discount on cars fell after the government stepped in to curb escalating price wars, fearing they could undermine the industry's stability.

          <p>Lithium mining stocks, including U.S.-based Albemarle, experienced a significant surge on Monday after reports that a major Chinese mine suspended its operations. The Yichun Project, operated by battery maker CATL, halted production because its permit expired, and it is currently working on renewal. This mine is responsible for approximately 4% of the world's projected lithium supply for 2025. The temporary shutdown has tightened an already constrained market, leading investors to anticipate a rise in lithium prices due to the reduced global supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Steven Tompkins, the sheriff of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, has been arrested by the FBI on federal extortion charges. He is accused of pressuring a national cannabis company for over $50,000 in stock before it went public, allegedly by threatening his office's partnership with the firm. The indictment also claims he demanded repayment when the stock's value later fell. This is not Tompkins' first brush with controversy, as he has previously been fined for ethics violations. The case brings further scrutiny to Massachusetts' legalized cannabis industry and the conduct of public officials.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's defense ministry has unveiled plans to develop a new "carrier killer" missile as part of its strategy to deter potential aggression from mainland China. The weapon is described as a long-range, subsonic, anti-ship cruise missile that will incorporate stealth technology from the existing Hsiung Feng IIE land-attack missile. The military plans to invest in key components, such as frequency-agile magnetrons, to enhance the missile's ability to evade interference and improve target detection.

          <p>Major U.S. automakers like Ford, GM, and Tesla are recalibrating their electric vehicle strategies following the Trump administration's moves to eliminate EV subsidies and soften emissions regulations. The impending end of the $7,500 tax credit and the market for regulatory credits is forcing companies to re-evaluate product launches and capital allocation. Ford is pivoting more heavily towards hybrids, while GM anticipates short-term headwinds to EV profitability. EV-only maker Rivian has significantly lowered its revenue forecast from regulatory credit sales, highlighting the direct financial impact of the policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A common scam on payment apps like Venmo and Zelle involves a fraudster sending you money, claiming it was an accident, and then urgently requesting you send it back. The initial transfer is typically made using a stolen credit card or bank account. If you return the funds, the scammer withdraws your real money, and you are left responsible when the original fraudulent transaction is reversed by the bank. To protect yourself, experts advise never sending money back to a stranger, ignoring their messages, and instead contacting the payment app's customer support to report the transaction.</p>

          <p>While many Southeast Asian nations negotiated lower tariffs than initially threatened by the Trump administration, analysts warn the new trade landscape could still negatively impact the region's poor. The policies may cause a downturn in labor-intensive sectors like garment manufacturing, pushing capital towards tech industries that employ fewer workers and potentially widening the wealth gap. Furthermore, an influx of cheap Chinese goods, redirected from the U.S. market, could suppress local wages. A major concern is the U.S. plan to heavily tax "transshipment" goods from China.

          <p>An Ohio state law is creating a transportation crisis in Dayton, where public schools must prioritize busing for private and charter school students to avoid hefty fines. This has forced the district to eliminate bus services for approximately 2,000 of its own high school students, leaving families to find and pay for their own transportation. The situation is a result of a broader conservative push to fund private and charter schools, often at the expense of public school resources. Critics argue the law unfairly burdens the most vulnerable families and is part of a targeted effort against Democratic-leaning cities.</p>

Experts note the irony that these groups are organizing more freely than ever due to changes at the FBI that have dismantled units focused on domestic extremism.
