          <p>A mother in the UK has resorted to illegally purchasing vapes for her two teenage children in an effort to control their severe nicotine addiction. She aims to reduce their nicotine intake and ensure the products are from reputable sources, highlighting the challenges parents face with youth vaping. Despite a new ban on disposable vapes, experts and parents note it has had little impact, with some legal rechargeable vapes still being marketed to children. An NHS clinic for young vapers reports a growing crisis, with some teens experiencing withdrawal symptoms during school.</p>

          <p>Israeli military strikes killed dozens in Gaza, including civilians in a displaced persons shelter, as the humanitarian crisis worsens. This comes as President Trump suggested a ceasefire agreement with Hamas could be reached within the next week, although talks have been stalled. The proposed deal involves a hostage and prisoner exchange, but Hamas has requested amendments that an American envoy deemed unacceptable. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 56,000 Palestinian deaths, and aid distribution remains severely hampered.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth, originating from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. Researchers propose two possible origins for these phenomena: either supermassive black holes ejecting particles or high-speed cosmic particle collisions. This finding suggests that energetic processes have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tehran for the state funeral of top military commanders and nuclear scientists killed during a recent 12-day war with Israel. The conflict, which Israel claimed was to destroy Iran's nuclear program, resulted in over 1,000 Iranian deaths, including key figures from the Revolutionary Guard. Despite the public mourning and defiant chants, Iran's Supreme Leader was not seen at the ceremony.

          <p>Protests in Belgrade turned violent as police clashed with demonstrators demanding an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule and early parliamentary elections. Officers used pepper spray after flares were thrown near a counter-protest by Vucic supporters, leading to dozens of detentions and several police injuries. The protests, led by students, were initially sparked by a deadly train station collapse last year blamed on government negligence. Vucic has rejected calls for a snap election and has accused foreign powers of instigating the unrest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another motion by Donald Trump to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against him by the exonerated men formerly known as the Central Park Five. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP statute, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The plaintiffs sued Trump for defamatory statements he made during a 2024 presidential debate, where he falsely claimed they had killed someone and pled guilty. The men were wrongfully convicted and spent years in prison before being exonerated.</p>

          <p>A recent arrest in Southern California highlights a growing trend of civilians impersonating Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers across the United States. Experts warn that the increased use of plainclothes and masked agents by federal authorities makes it easier for criminals to pose as officers to commit crimes like kidnapping and sexual assault. Several such cases have been reported this year, from South Carolina to Florida. Critics argue this practice poses a significant public safety threat, as it becomes difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate law enforcement actions.</p>

While the term lacked a single blockbuster ruling like the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it continued a trend of 6-3 decisions along ideological lines.

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their ancestral homes. The findings, which also show more grave goods were offered to females, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal social structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>Following his primary victory, New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has become a key figure in Republican attacks against the Democratic party. GOP leaders are portraying the 33-year-old Democratic socialist as a "communist," using his win to argue that the entire party is out of step with the country. While some progressive Democrats have embraced Mamdani, moderates have been more hesitant. In response to the attacks, which have included Islamophobic rhetoric, Mamdani has emphasized his focus on city issues like affordability and has been defended by numerous Democratic colleagues.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by over half a second. Norris described his lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for and said he felt like his "old me" was back after a season marked by qualifying mistakes. The strong performance was aided by recent car upgrades designed to improve front-end feel, an issue that had been hampering his confidence. He will start on the front row alongside Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, with his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri in third.</p>
