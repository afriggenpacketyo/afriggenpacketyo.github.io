          <p>Colombian presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head at a rally in Bogotá and is in critical condition. The attack occurred while Uribe, a senator for the Centro Democratico party, was addressing supporters. A 15-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene with a 9mm Glock-type firearm, and an investigation is underway. President Gustavo Petro condemned the attack and offered support, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed the attack on leftist rhetoric. The incident has raised concerns about political violence and democracy in Colombia, as Uribe had announced his candidacy for next year's presidential election. The tone of the article reflects the gravity of the situation and uncertainty surrounding Uribe's health and the political implications of the attack.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of adults are seeking chiropractic treatment, yet experts urge caution regarding potential risks. Spine doctors emphasize their science-based approach and specialized medical training, while chiropractors focus on manual spinal adjustments. Chiropractic care may reduce tension, inflammation, and stress, but it is important to consult a spine specialist for radiating pain or nerve-related issues. Choosing a transparent chiropractor with a clear treatment plan and a strong relationship with a spine surgery practice is crucial for ensuring safe and effective care.</p>

Pochettino, who managed Spurs from 2014 to 2019, expressed happiness in his current position with the USMNT.

          <p>A new study suggests that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after ingestion. Researchers found that these microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice. These changes could potentially contribute to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. The study highlights concerns about the widespread use of PLA in food packaging and disposable tableware, leading to increased oral exposure to PLA microplastics.</p>

          <p>The Labour government's upcoming Spending Review is a key opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision. The review will allocate resources between departments, signaling the government's priorities to the private sector and international investors. The government has allocated 2.7% of the country's GDP to capital spending, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. The Spending Review aims to rewire the state and promote long-term certainty, but challenges remain in managing public finances and addressing long-term issues such as energy prices and worker illness.</p>
