          <p>During a record-breaking heat wave in Southern California, temperatures soared into the high 90s, prompting multiple rescues due to heat-related issues. In Orange County, fifteen individuals were rescued, including a group of eleven hikers in Newport Coast, while Riverside County saw nine rescues across various locations. Los Angeles also reported a hiker airlifted from the Hollywood Hills due to heat exhaustion. Authorities are urging people to avoid strenuous outdoor activities until the weather cools down, with the National Weather Service forecasting a dip in temperatures and May gray skies early next week.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of crucial trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions arising from President Trump's trade war. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng, seek to address tariffs that have disrupted global supply chains and threaten economic growth. Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs to 80% if China makes concessions, while China has remained firm on not making trade concessions in response to tariffs. Economists remain skeptical about a quick resolution, even if the United States reduces tariff rates, as the overall effective tariff rate would still be significantly higher than pre-Trump levels.</p>

          <p>President Trump's consideration to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has ignited widespread condemnation from Iranians across political and ideological divides.

Experts emphasize the significance of the Persian Gulf as a symbol of Iranian nationhood, highlighting the deep-rooted connection between Iranians and their geographic heritage. While Trump has the authority to alter geographical names within the United States, the international community and Iran are unlikely to adopt the change.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared a "total reset" in US-China trade relations following the initial day of discussions in Geneva between top American and Chinese officials. The meetings were aimed at de-escalating the trade war initiated by his tariffs. Trump lauded the "very good" talks and described them as "a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner". Senior officials from both countries convened in Switzerland to address the tensions that have threatened the global economy, although specific details of the discussions were not immediately available.</p>

          <p>C.C. Opanowski, a survivor of sexual assault, testified against her ex-boyfriend, Shawn Doyle, who was later charged with the murder of Lori Leonard. Opanowski had been sexually assaulted by Doyle years prior but did not press charges at the time, a decision she later regretted. When she learned that Doyle had been arrested for Leonard's murder, she decided to come forward and share her story, despite the trauma it brought back. Her testimony, along with that of another former girlfriend, helped to paint a picture of Doyle as a violent and controlling individual, ultimately leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has revealed that a new medication, zongertinib, is a potentially safe and effective treatment for a difficult-to-treat type of lung cancer.

Zongertinib targets the HER2 protein and blocks the activity of tyrosine kinase, which signals cell growth. The multi-cohort study was conducted at 82 sites worldwide, including institutions in the US, China, and Japan, with Asian populations accounting for a majority of the patients.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration grew increasingly concerned about the escalating conflict between India and Pakistan. Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio engaged in diplomatic efforts to prevent a potential nuclear escalation. The U.S. government's concern was driven by reports of escalating air force engagement and missile strikes near Pakistan's nuclear command headquarters. Despite initial reluctance, both India and Pakistan eventually agreed to a cease-fire, with Pakistan acknowledging the U.S.'s role in facilitating the agreement.

Gallego, who represents a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need for alliances with people who may not agree on everything.

          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and curator of the 2026 Venice Biennale, has died at the age of 57. Kouoh was slated to be the first African woman to curate the Venice Biennale, and her death has left a significant void in the art community. As the curator and executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, she built a global reputation as a torchbearer for artists of color. Her passing occurred just days before she was scheduled to announce the title and theme of next year's event.</p>
