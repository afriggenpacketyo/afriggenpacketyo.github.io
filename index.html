        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The urban planning principles long championed by King Charles are now inspiring a new generation of towns in England. His vision, which favors traditional, walkable, and environmentally friendly communities with "gentle density" over high-rise buildings, was once criticized by the architectural establishment. However, figures like TV architect George Clarke note that these ideas have become mainstream, addressing public dissatisfaction with poorly designed modern housing estates. The government's plans for 12 new towns are expected to reflect these principles, aiming to create communities with strong local identity and public spaces.</p>

          <p>As China prepares to host a global summit on women's rights, the government is emphasizing its advancements in gender equality. A foreign ministry spokesperson stated that China is an "active actor" in promoting women's all-round development, citing significant progress over recent decades. The summit, expected in October, will host international officials, though domestic NGOs may not be invited unless sponsored by overseas entities. This focus comes as two new books by President Xi Jinping were published, containing speeches on gender equality and traditional family values.</p>

          <p>A team of specialist archaeologists and Ministry of Defence caseworkers has successfully identified the remains of two Scottish soldiers killed in World War One. The bodies were discovered during construction work in northern France four years ago, on the site of the Battle of Loos. Investigators used regimental badges, personal items like tramway buttons, and extensive genealogical research to narrow down the identities. DNA tests with living relatives confirmed the soldiers were Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, bringing closure to their families after more than 100 years.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to address several hundred high-ranking military officers at a rare gathering at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. According to officials, Hegseth will personally deliver his message on restoring the "warrior ethos" to the U.S. military and outline new standards to achieve this goal. The unusual summons has raised questions about the logistics, costs, and security required for such a large assembly of senior command staff. The meeting's purpose was not disclosed in the invitations, leading to speculation among military officials.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage in western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their crucial role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communications down, these pilots were among the first to witness the scale of the destruction and conduct rescue missions. Coordinated by groups like Total Flight Solutions and the United Cajun Navy, they performed hundreds of missions, rescuing stranded residents and air-dropping essential supplies like food and medicine. The pilots recall the emotional impact of finding isolated people and the immense community effort that supported their life-saving work.</p>

          <p>The cost of policing ongoing protests in Epping, Essex, is projected to hit £1.7 million by October, according to the local police, fire and crime commissioner. The demonstrations began after an asylum seeker was charged and later jailed for sexual offences while staying at The Bell Hotel. While most protests have been peaceful, there have been instances of disorder, leading to 32 arrests and injuries to eight officers. The significant financial burden must be absorbed by the local police force, as government assistance is only available if costs exceed £4 million.</p>

          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, threatens to undermine decades of economic progress. Studies from the Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute warn that the nation could face a prolonged downturn and potentially zero growth by the 2040s. Despite the government spending over $270 billion on incentives to encourage childbirth, the fertility rate remains drastically below the replacement level of 2.1. This demographic cliff poses risks to the workforce, productivity, the pension system, and even national defense. (not investment advice)</p>

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party maintains a dominant control over the media landscape, including state broadcasters and numerous private outlets.

          <p>The United Nations is poised to reimpose extensive economic and military sanctions on Iran, a decade after they were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The move was triggered by the UK, France, and Germany, who accused Iran of failing to meet its commitments after it stepped up banned nuclear activity following the US withdrawal from the deal in 2016. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the sanctions as "unfair, unjust, and illegal," while insisting his country does not seek nuclear weapons. The reimposed sanctions will include an arms embargo, a ban on uranium enrichment, and asset freezes.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada highlights a significant financial gap in the sport, representing a contest between two different models of development. England, the world's best-funded team, provides full-time professional contracts and benefits from a strong domestic league, leading to sustained dominance. In contrast, Canada's players earn a fraction of their English counterparts and rely on fundraising to support their World Cup campaign, with many playing professionally in England's league. A Canadian victory could be seen as a vindication for a more targeted, lean investment model, potentially influencing how other nations approach professionalizing the women's game.</p>

He has publicly called for the prosecution of specific opponents, suggested revoking TV licenses for media outlets he deems biased, and targeted critics like former FBI Director James Comey, who was recently indicted. Supporters justify these actions as necessary to combat a corrupt "deep state" and biased media, pointing to the legal challenges Trump faced during the Biden administration.

          <p>The gunman responsible for the deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting in July, Shane Tamura, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), according to New York's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Tamura, a former high school football player, killed four people before taking his own life, leaving behind notes referencing CTE and asking for his brain to be studied. CTE is a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head injuries, and while its connection to behavior is still under study, the finding provides context to the tragic event. The NFL, which was believed to be Tamura's target, expressed condolences for the victims.</p>

          <p>Following a recent deadly shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas, Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered Justice Department agents to be deployed to guard Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. In a statement, Bondi said the agents would safeguard federal personnel and property, and she directed Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate attacks against federal authorities as "domestic terrorism." The move comes amid a spike in attacks and tense protests at ICE facilities, which have been central to the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement policies. The DOJ will seek the most serious charges against those involved in these incidents.</p>

          <h2>Hurricane Humberto May Interact with Nearby Storm, Potentially Causing Rare Fujiwhara Effect</h2>

          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto churns in the Atlantic, meteorologists are monitoring the possibility of a rare interaction with another developing storm system nearby. If the two storms get close enough, they could produce the Fujiwhara effect, where they become entangled and rotate around a common center. According to the National Weather Service, the outcome depends on the storms' relative strengths; they might "dance" around each other or the stronger storm could absorb the weaker one. While such an event is considered unlikely in this case, it adds a layer of complexity and unpredictability to the forecast.</p>
