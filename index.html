Zaahir was fatally struck by a bus on Thursday outside a hospital in Margate, Kent, where he had been visiting his grandmother. His father, Navid Feizi, described his son as the "cutest, smartest, charmed boy" and expressed profound grief. The boy's mother, Azaria, started the appeal to provide her son with the "best and most comfortable burial."</p>

          <p>The article explores the potential negative effects of hook-up apps like Grindr on users' mental health, featuring personal accounts of anxiety, depression, and damaged self-esteem. One user, Lewis, describes feeling objectified and chasing validation, leading to a cycle of encounters that left him feeling "dirty and gross." Singer Jacob Alon shares similar sentiments, explaining that his experiences with feeling empty and degraded on the app inspired one of his songs. The piece highlights a toxic culture of instant gratification that can make it difficult for some to form meaningful connections.</p>

          <p>European destinations are experiencing a notable increase in tourists from China, with a 13% year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), this trend is expected to continue, as a recent report found that 72% of Chinese tourists are willing to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is substantially higher than the global average and surpasses interest from traditionally strong markets like the US and Japan. The article suggests this surge is a positive development for Europe's tourism sector.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores the Rise of 'Grifter' as a Prominent Political Insult</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 04:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "grifter" has become an increasingly common insult in modern political discourse, used to accuse opponents of being dishonest swindlers profiting from their views. The article notes a significant rise in the word's usage, pointing to examples involving figures like Nigel Farage, Zarah Sultana, and Donald Trump. This trend is linked to a broader societal paranoia fueled by the prevalence of online influencers with questionable business models, political scandals, and the popularity of the "true scam" genre in media. The piece suggests this atmosphere makes the public more inclined to suspect nefarious motives behind political actions.</p>

The reported directive comes after Trump designated several Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations.

This follows other recent raids, including one dubbed "Operation Trojan Horse" where agents used a rental truck to detain workers.

This American pressure could paradoxically benefit the EU by increasing India's desire to diversify its economic partnerships and secure a predictable trade relationship with the bloc. An EU-India deal could be mutually beneficial, providing stability for both amid global economic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) showed no change in July compared to the previous year, while the producer price index continued to decline, indicating persistent weak demand in the economy. The flat CPI reading was slightly better than market forecasts of a minor decline and follows a 0.1% rise in June. According to China's statistics bureau, the result was influenced by policies aimed at expanding domestic demand. While prices for services and some goods rose, a 1.6% drop in food prices contributed to the overall stagnation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a standout performance in his NFL preseason debut, earning praise from figures like LeBron James. Sanders completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Despite being a fifth-round draft pick and fourth on the depth chart, he was given the start due to injuries and led three touchdown drives, demonstrating significant poise. His impressive play has ignited discussion about his future role on the team, though his coach remained noncommittal about any immediate changes.</p>
