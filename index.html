          <p>Canada has announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, following similar declarations by the UK and France. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the move is contingent on the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms, including holding elections without Hamas's involvement. This policy shift is driven by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements, though Israel and Canadian opposition parties have criticized the decision as a "reward for Hamas."</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why a Massive Magnitude 8.8 Earthquake Caused Minimal Widespread Damage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:55:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in surprisingly little widespread damage and no reported deaths outside the immediate area. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. While the event triggered extensive alerts, experts consider it a "best-case scenario" for a quake of this magnitude, highlighting the critical role of location and directionality in a tsunami's impact.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from Donald Trump, Texas Republicans have unveiled a proposed new congressional map that could give the GOP up to five additional seats in the U.S. House. The aggressive gerrymandering plan has drawn immediate condemnation from Democrats, who argue it is a "racially discriminatory, brazen power grab" that illegally suppresses Black and Latino voters. The map radically redraws districts in major urban areas like Austin and Houston and is expected to face swift legal challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to end the "de minimis" tariff exemption for all countries, which had allowed goods valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. This global expansion follows a previous order targeting China and will affect popular e-commerce sites like Shein and Temu. The White House justified the move as a necessary measure to prevent tariff evasion and to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the country. (not investment advice)</p>
