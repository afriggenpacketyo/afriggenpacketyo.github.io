          <p>Overnight Israeli air strikes across Gaza have resulted in the deaths of at least 24 Palestinians, according to medical personnel and civil defense officials. One strike targeted the Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced families and resulted in 20 fatalities, including children, as fires engulfed classrooms used as living quarters. Shortly before the school strike, another air strike hit a home in central Gaza City, killing four more people, the Hamas-run health ministry said. These incidents are part of a broader Israeli offensive that has escalated in the northern part of the Gaza Strip over the past week, contributing to an already high civilian death toll and prompting renewed calls for a ceasefire.</p>

This victory marked the Knicks' third 20-point comeback win of the playoffs, an NBA record, as they previously achieved similar comebacks against the Boston Celtics. The Pacers, led by Tyrese Haliburton with 20 points, failed to capitalize on their lead, allowing the Knicks to cut the series deficit to 2-1. The Knicks are the first team in NBA history to stage three 20-point comebacks wins in a single postseason; the Knicks also had 20-point comeback wins against the Boston Celtics in the conference semi-finals. The score was close towards the end.</p>

This approach, termed "urban collapse warfare," aims to destroy the Taiwanese independence forces' will to resist and create conditions for a "win without fighting."
