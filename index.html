          <h2>IMF Predicts US Fiscal Deficit to Decrease Due to Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that increased tariff revenue will contribute to a slight decrease in the U.S. fiscal deficit in 2025, despite worsening growth and inflation outlooks due to escalating trade tensions. The report projects the U.S. federal deficit will fall to 6.5% of GDP this year, down from 7.3% in 2024, contingent on higher tariff revenues. The IMF acknowledges uncertainty regarding the magnitude of tariff revenue increase and the potential impact on imports and economic activity. The fund also notes that rising U.S. government debt could push up longer-term interest rates.</p>

          <p>The European Union is considering a proposal to impose export restrictions on all eel species under an international agreement regulating trade in endangered species. If approved, the move could impact supplies to Japan, which relies heavily on imports. The proposal aims to list all 19 eel species and subspecies in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, requiring an export permit for trade. Japan's Fisheries Agency is lobbying against the proposal, but the EU is expected to decide by early June.</p>

          <p>Experts are concerned that the resumption of collections on defaulted student loans, affecting millions of borrowers, could negatively impact the U.S. economy. The plan to garnish wages from defaulted borrowers could reduce consumer spending and potentially exacerbate an economic slowdown. Consumer spending accounts for a significant portion of U.S. economic activity, and the resumption of loan repayments could add downward pressure. However, some experts argue that the policy provides clarity for loan payments after years of uncertainty, despite the short-term pain.</p>
