          <h2>UK Parliament Members Advocate for Delay in Farm Inheritance Tax Changes</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A committee of MPs is urging the government to postpone the implementation of farm inheritance tax reforms by a year, citing inadequate consultation and potential harm to small family businesses. The proposed changes, set to begin in April 2026, would tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than Â£1 million at 20%, a move that has sparked protests across the UK. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee emphasizes the need for alternative schemes that won't negatively impact vulnerable farmers and suggests delaying the policy until April 2027 to allow farmers more time to seek professional advice. The committee also criticizes the sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which affected trust in the government and put many farmers at risk of becoming unviable.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family says was mandated by the state's anti-abortion laws. Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother, was declared brain-dead in February but remains on life support as she is 21 weeks pregnant. Doctors have informed the family that they cannot remove life-sustaining devices due to Georgia's abortion ban, which prohibits abortions after cardiac activity is detected. The family is upset that they don't have decision-making power about her medical decisions. The situation highlights the complex ethical and legal questions arising from abortion bans and fetal personhood laws, especially in cases of brain death during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura faced intense cross-examination on the eighth day of Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial, with defense attorneys attempting to undermine her credibility by presenting text messages showing mutual affection and her apparent willingness to engage in "freak-offs." Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs and her initial eagerness to participate in his lifestyle, but maintained that she was eventually coerced into drug-fueled orgies. Defense lawyers argued that Combs, while admitting to domestic violence and drug abuse, never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone. Ventura's testimony is expected to conclude soon, with concerns about her pregnancy potentially leading to early labor.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, a steeper decline than the 0.1% contraction expected by economists, according to preliminary government data. On an annualized basis, the GDP fell by 0.7%, exceeding the anticipated 0.2% drop. The Bank of Japan had previously warned of a likely moderation in the country's economy due to global trade policies. Despite these concerns, the central bank seems poised to continue raising its policy rate, aiming to achieve its 2% inflation target, which has already been surpassed for three consecutive years, most recently at 3.6% in April.</p>

          <p>The California Assembly unanimously passed legislation to increase criminal penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex, following weeks of political debate. The bill, initially proposed by Assemblymember Maggy Krell, aims to target perpetrators and increase protections for victims. The legislation now applies only to offenders more than three years older than the victim, a compromise reached after controversy over stripping the felony provision. The bill now heads to the state Senate for consideration, with existing law already penalizing solicitation of a minor under 16 as a misdemeanor or felony.</p>

Simon suggests that Walmart may be overstating challenges tied to tariffs, given its strong business and expanding gross profit margin. He is optimistic that consumers can largely handle price increases due to a steady jobs market and cheaper fuel prices, but notes that negative commentary from corporate executives could be eroding consumer confidence. Simon's perspective contrasts with Walmart's reported concerns about the impact of tariffs on its business.</p>

          <p>Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman stated that the company's aspiration is to hold an IPO in 2025, following clearance from the U.S. government to sell shares to an entity in the United Arab Emirates. The chipmaker, which produces processors for artificial intelligence workloads, filed to go public in September but has not provided updates on the offering's size or timing. The clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a key step for Cerebras, which competes with Nvidia in the AI market. The tech IPO market has been in a drought since early 2022, but is showing signs of revival.</p>

          <p>A 9Â½-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency, has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment. Doctors at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia created an infusion specifically designed to fix his unique mutation. The treatment, which is being presented at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, has potential implications for thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases. This innovative approach offers a new path for developing personalized treatments without years of expensive development and testing, potentially transforming healthcare.</p>

          <p>Britain is exploring a closer relationship with the EU, including a new security pact, a veterinary deal to reduce border checks on food and drink, and a youth mobility scheme. The Labour government, elected on a platform of improving relations with European partners, is hosting EU leaders for a summit to launch a new "partnership." However, the move has sparked debate, with Conservatives warning of a "surrender summit" and Reform UK fearing a "great British sellout." The government argues that a security pact will complement Nato and extend to areas beyond defence, like economic security and migration.</p>
