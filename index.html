          <p>Samuel Woodward has been found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student. The trial, delayed for over six years, detailed Woodward's ties to a neo-Nazi group and the brutal nature of the stabbing. The verdict brings a painful chapter to a close for Bernstein's family, who have since founded a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward" to honor their son's legacy. Woodward faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage healthier food choices among consumers. The voluntary plan aims to tackle rising obesity rates by having retailers promote healthier items through discounts, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. While the initiative does not impose specific targets, it will require major retailers to report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. The move is part of a broader government strategy to improve national health and reduce strain on the NHS.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the potential dangers of inflammatory rhetoric from politicians directed at judges. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts noted that such language can lead to serious threats of violence, referencing past instances involving both Democratic and Republican leaders without naming them directly. He emphasized that while criticism is part of the job, threatening statements from high levels of government are inappropriate and dangerous. His remarks underscore growing concerns about judicial security and the politicization of the courts.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Belgrade, Serbia, demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule, leading to clashes with riot police. The demonstration, one of the largest in recent months, saw police use tear gas and stun grenades, resulting in dozens of arrests. Protests have been ongoing for months, fueled by accusations of government corruption and ties to organized crime, and were recently intensified by a deadly railway station roof collapse.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the "urban heat island effect," the phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, particularly during heatwaves. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's heat, releasing it slowly. This effect is compounded by waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning, and a lack of cooling vegetation and water sources. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, the world's growing urban populations will face heightened risks from extreme heat.</p>

Critics view the extravagant, celebrity-filled celebration as an affront to the city's fragile state.

Health experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases later-life cancer risk, and the program aims to instill lifelong healthy habits.

The H2A series, which had a 98 percent success rate over its lifetime, is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket.

The march proceeded despite a government ban, which was justified under a controversial 2021 law equating homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, supported the event, framing it as a peaceful show of freedom against a "hateful power." The large turnout, significantly higher than in previous years, was seen by many as a direct response to the government's attempt at suppression.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of its 12-day war with Israel, the Iranian regime has intensified its domestic crackdown, executing several men on espionage charges and arresting hundreds accused of ties to Israel. Human rights activists express deep concern, stating the accused were denied due to process and that the regime is using the post-war climate to instill fear and punish dissent. Authorities have also announced new surveillance measures to monitor citizens' online activities, which state media has dubbed an "intelligence jihad." The actions follow a familiar pattern of repression after periods of national crisis, deepening fears among ordinary Iranians.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 72 people since Friday, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, with attacks hitting displaced persons' shelters and residential areas. The continued violence comes as President Trump stated a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached within the next week, though neither party has publicly confirmed this. Diplomatic efforts for a pause in fighting have been ongoing, but a deal has remained elusive. The 21-month-long war has resulted in a catastrophic humanitarian situation and killed over 56,000 Palestinians, according to local officials.</p>

His workload remains limited as he returns from Tommy John surgery, but the outing demonstrated his dominant potential on the mound.

Speaking at a summit in Hong Kong, Shum noted that the U.S. remains far ahead in chip production, a gap that will take years to close. However, he highlighted Chinese start-ups like DeepSeek, which have achieved comparable results to top US competitors using far less computing power, suggesting China's focus on algorithmic breakthroughs is proving effective in the intense technological race between the two nations.</p>

A procedural vote to advance the legislation stalled for hours as leaders pressured holdouts to support it. The complex 940-page bill, which combines tax cuts with increased deportation funding, faces unified opposition from Democrats and criticism from figures like Elon Musk. (not investment advice)</p>
