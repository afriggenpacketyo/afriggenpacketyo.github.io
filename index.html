            <h2>China Considers Settling Trade with US in Renminbi to Challenge Dollar's Dominance</h2>

            <p>As the US-China trade war escalates with reciprocal tariff increases, China is considering a strategic countermeasure: requiring bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi. This move aims to strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. With US-China trade worth hundreds of billions, mandatory renminbi settlement would force the US to buy the Chinese currency on a large scale, increasing its demand and value. This shift could also signal to global investors that China's economic fundamentals are strong, potentially increasing capital inflows to China and outflows from the US. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of creating a false impression of honoring an Easter ceasefire, noting continued attacks despite President Putin's announcement of a unilateral truce. Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and drone strikes, suggesting Putin may lack full control over his army or is merely seeking favorable PR coverage. He reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce, emphasizing the need for Russia to fully adhere to ceasefire conditions and stating that Ukraine will act according to the situation on the ground. Despite the ongoing conflict, Zelenskyy acknowledged quieter areas following the ceasefire announcement, attributing it to Putin's direct orders.</p>

            <p>Christians in Nigeria are reportedly facing severe persecution and violence from Islamist militants, particularly in the Middle Belt region. Reports indicate numerous attacks on Christian communities, resulting in deaths, displacement, and destruction of property. The International Christian Concern (ICC) has described the situation as a calculated effort to erase Christians from their homeland, with calls for the U.S. government to designate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern. Bishop Ayuba Matawal highlights the Islamist agenda of seizing land from Christian communities and continuing Uthman dan Fodio's vision of spreading Islam across Nigeria.</p>

            <p>A report by the Atlantic Council warns that the United States risks losing the technological competition with China in the Global South due to complacency. Developing countries are expected to play an increasingly critical role in advanced technology, and their ties with China are likely to strengthen. The report urges the US to engage more actively with the Global South to advance its geopolitical, economic, and technological interests and shape global technological norms and standards. Failure to do so would allow China to expand its influence and undermine the interests of the United States and its allies.</p>

            <p>A former member of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Commission warns that the Trump administration's cuts to science, environmental, and safety agencies, along with the rollback of environmental regulations, are increasing the risk of environmental disasters. Drawing from experiences with the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon spills, the author argues that weakening offshore drilling safety measures and eliminating essential monitoring programs threaten decades of progress. The author insists that these actions are a dangerous rejection of lessons learned from past crises and calls for strong environmental regulations, scientific research, and adequate funding for protective agencies.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is in a showdown with Harvard University over demands for government control over hiring, admissions, and curriculum. The administration plans to freeze billions in grants after Harvard refused to appoint a White House-approved body to audit viewpoint diversity and shutter DEI programs. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated that the demands represent direct governmental regulation violating the school's independence and constitutional rights. Experts view this as part of a broader effort to undermine higher education and exert authoritarian control, reminiscent of McCarthyism, with potential implications for democracy and academic freedom.</p>

            <p>Chris Whipple, previously a supportive biographer of Joe Biden, has released a new book, "Uncharted," which sharply criticizes Biden's mental and physical decline leading up to his withdrawal from the 2024 election. Whipple's earlier work, "The Fight of His Life," had portrayed Biden as mentally sharp, but his new book paints a different picture, drawing on insider accounts of Biden's struggles during debate preparation and his detachment from his own campaign. The book also critiques Kamala Harris' campaign and features insights from Trump's staff, offering a broad assessment of the political landscape and the factors that led to Trump's victory.</p>

            <p>This article examines the early economic policies of Adolf Hitler's regime, particularly focusing on tariffs. Shortly after assuming power, Hitler prioritized tariffs to protect German agriculture and industry, aligning with the National Socialist Party's agenda.

The article details the economic context of the time, the reactions to Hitler's policies, and the consequences of implementing tariffs, ultimately highlighting the parallels between Hitler's trade policies and his broader political goals.</p>

            <p>Train services on Tokyo's busy Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines resumed Sunday following track-switching work for a new route to improve access to Haneda airport, with the suspension of over 24 hours affecting around 550,000 people.

The operator, East Japan Railway Co., carried out platform expansion work over a day and a half from Saturday at Tamachi Station and relocated nearby tracks to prepare for the construction of a new line directly connecting central Tokyo and the airport.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Sunday that his government will not include discussions on security in its trade talks with the United States, while President Donald Trump has called for reducing the U.S. burden in defending Japan.

"I don't think it is appropriate to discuss security and trade together. We should address security issues without linking them to tariffs," Ishiba said on a TV program, days after his close aide met with Trump and senior U.S. officials on the recently increased levies.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, warned against repeating the tariff mistakes of the Great Depression era amid the escalating trade war between the two countries. Speaking at an embassy event, Xie drew on ancient Chinese philosophy and the lessons of the Smoot-Hawley Act, which is widely believed to have worsened the Great Depression. He called for joint efforts to grow the global economy rather than engaging in protectionist policies that could lead to a dramatic fall in global trade.</p>

A few states, including Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas, and New Mexico, have become major hubs for out-of-state patients. This comes as the Trump administration effectively demolished the CDC team responsible for government reports on abortion provision, raising concerns about the ability to track public health outcomes. Researchers estimate that 20-25% of people who want abortions are blocked from getting them due to bans.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has dropped to the lowest point of his presidential career, according to a CNBC survey, amid discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending. The survey indicates that economic optimism has waned, with more Americans believing the economy will worsen. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are significantly more negative about his handling of the economy. The public disapproves of tariffs and inflation, and a majority believe a recession is imminent.</p>

It highlights the skepticism in Ukraine, where President Zelenskyy reported continued attacks despite the ceasefire. The article suggests the truce could be aimed at maintaining good relations with the Trump White House, particularly as the US administration has grown impatient with the lack of progress on Ukraine. The article notes the brevity of the truce and the short notice given, making full preparation difficult for both sides.</p>

While the government is negotiating tariffs with Washington and deregulating the City, global financial stability is threatened by the White House's actions. Labour's focus on a "strong, smart and agile state" should extend to the financial sector, where lightly regulated, non-bank lending has exploded. The Bank of England is working to track potential shocks in this sector, but Labour should prioritize firmer control of shadow banking.</p>
