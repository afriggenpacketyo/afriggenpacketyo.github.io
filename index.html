          <p>A Department of Homeland Security memo details the potential deployment of National Guard troops for immigration enforcement activities. The memo outlines that troops may be used in night operations, rural interdiction, guard duty, and riot control within detention facilities. DHS requested 20,000 troops, with specific numbers allocated for fugitive location, detention support, and transportation of detainees, including unaccompanied children. The Pentagon has not yet approved the request, and legal questions remain regarding interstate troop deployments. The optimism score is based on the potential for civil rights concerns arising from such deployments.</p>

          <p>Police forces from multiple countries have dismantled an international drug trafficking ring that used high-speed "narco boats" to smuggle cocaine from South America to Spain's Canary Islands. The ring allegedly used 11 speedboats to pick up drugs from larger "mother ships" in the Atlantic, using an abandoned shipwreck as a refueling platform. Authorities arrested 48 people and seized nearly 3,800 kilos of cocaine, 19 boats, and around 100,000 euros. Spain is a major gateway for drug trafficking networks due to its ties to Latin America and proximity to Morocco.</p>

          <p>Staffers at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), founded by Elon Musk, are reportedly worried about their futures due to the escalating feud between Musk and President Trump. Some fear political retribution and damage to their career prospects if Trump investigates DOGE, while others worry that distancing from DOGE could become a professional liability. Musk's departure has already marked a turning point for DOGE, with remaining staff now reporting to their respective agency leadership. Some DOGE staffers are reportedly seeking new employment, with tech companies like Coinbase showing interest in hiring DOGE alumni.</p>

          <p>A pair of bills cracking down on sanctuary cities passed the House of Representatives with support from a handful of Democrats. One bill withdraws Small Business Administration (SBA) services from jurisdictions that shelter illegal immigrants, while the other bans people in the U.S. illegally from obtaining SBA loans. House Democratic leaders urged lawmakers to vote against the first bill but did not appear to give guidance on the second. The passage of these bills highlights the continued potency of illegal immigration as a political issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The public falling-out between President Trump and Elon Musk has revealed a significant divide within the contemporary right, both in the US and globally. The conflict appears to stem from personal clashes, business interests related to electric vehicle tax credits, and ideological differences regarding fiscal conservatism versus nationalist conservatism. Musk's opposition to Trump's spending bill, which he deems a "disgusting abomination," highlights the tension between deficit hawks and big spenders within the Republican party. This spat could impact Trump's ability to pass his legislative agenda and potentially shift the political landscape.</p>

Despite securing Tottenham's first major trophy in 17 years with a 1-0 win over Manchester United, the team had a poor Premier League season, finishing 17th. Postecoglou had expressed optimism for the future, but his tenure ended abruptly two years after joining from Celtic.

          <p>President Trump has instituted a new travel ban targeting travelers from multiple countries, sparking limited protests compared to the initial ban in 2017. The administration claims the ban is necessary to prevent terror attacks, citing the Boulder, Colorado, attack as justification. Critics argue that the ban is discriminatory and part of a demographic-engineering project to exclude immigrants from certain ethno-religious backgrounds. The article argues that Americans have become habituated to Trump's discriminatory policies, leading to a diminished response.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that fecal microbial transplants (FMTs), a method hailed for restoring gut microbiomes, may introduce unintended health risks. Researchers found that "mismatches" between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut environment could have negative consequences on immune and metabolic function. The study, conducted on mice, human tissue samples, and a small volunteer group, indicates that FMTs can cause modifications to immune and metabolic functions. Researchers suggest greater care should be taken in designing fecal transplants to use specific, targeted microbes for the intestines.</p>

          <p>The Freedom of the Press Foundation is increasing pressure on Paramount Global to abandon settlement efforts in President Trump's $20 billion lawsuit targeting CBS and "60 Minutes." Abbe David Lowell and Norm Eisen, representing the group, argue a settlement would cause "catastrophic" harm to Paramount. They warn that a settlement could violate fiduciary duty and federal anti-bribery statutes. The senators also suggested that paying money to Trump to help win clearance for the Paramount sale could constitute a bribe.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated rapidly over a ten-day period, moving from disagreement to open animosity. The conflict began with Musk criticizing Trump's spending bill, leading to a series of social media exchanges and public statements. Musk attacked Trump's policies and questioned his integrity, while Trump criticized Musk's business interests and political views. The feud culminated in Musk alleging Trump's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case and Trump threatening to terminate government contracts with Musk's companies.</p>

          <p>North Korea has successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month, according to state media. The damaged vessel will be moved to a dry dock in a different shipyard for repairs. The 5,000-ton destroyer, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a launch malfunction on May 21. The swift action to refloat the ship has surprised analysts, who initially believed the process would take much longer.</p>
