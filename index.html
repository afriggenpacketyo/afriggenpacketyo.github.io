          <p>An anonymous group buried a treasure chest filled with gold and San Francisco artifacts somewhere in the city and posted clues on Reddit. The treasure, valued at over $10,000, was found within eleven hours by three friends in Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve. The chest contained items such as a gold nugget, silver and copper coins, baseball cards featuring Barry Bonds, and a ticket to the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. The organizers expressed surprise at the speed of the discovery and hinted at the possibility of another treasure hunt in the future.</p>

          <p>A new genetics study traces the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from Asia 20,000-30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas and compared them with ancient DNA. The study reveals that early settlers split into isolated groups, with genetic codes showing how these groups adapted to different environments. The findings are particularly important for understanding and preserving the cultural heritage of endangered Indigenous groups, such as the Kawésqar people of Patagonia.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told lawmakers that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is resorting to buying replacement parts on eBay and using 3D printers to maintain aging systems.

The agency has been facing scrutiny due to decades-old technology and persistent staffing problems.

          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide financial relief, but it also has long-term consequences, particularly regarding future credit access. Credit card issuers view settling debt for less than the full amount as a major red flag, making it difficult to obtain new credit. While the settled account is likely to be closed, other existing accounts may remain open but could be subject to reduced credit limits. Rebuilding credit after debt settlement involves monitoring credit reports, starting with secured credit cards, and maintaining low balances with on-time payments.</p>

          <p>New York University is withholding a student’s diploma after he condemned Israel’s war on Gaza during his graduation ceremony speech. Logan Rozos criticized Israel's actions, leading NYU to release a statement denouncing his misuse of his role as a speaker. The university is pursuing disciplinary actions against Rozos, and his student profile on NYU Gallatin’s website appeared to have been taken down. This incident follows previous controversies at NYU regarding anti-war protests and restrictions on anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>Anton Tselykh survived a 400-foot rock climbing fall in Washington's North Cascades mountains that killed his three companions. After the accident, Tselykh hiked back to his car despite suffering brain trauma and other serious internal injuries. He then drove about 40 miles to call 911. During the 911 call, Tselykh reported that he could “hardly breathe” and apologized for his voice.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Wary of Trump's Bid to Restrict US Birthright Citizenship</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 13:22:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US supreme court justices took issue with Donald Trump’s attempt to sidestep the constitution to limit birthright citizenship. The plan is likely to be ultimately struck down, as it directly contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States”. The justice department argues the “nationwide injunctions” unfairly tie the president’s hands. His legal team isn’t asking the supreme court to rule on whether his policy is constitutional, and very little of the arguments focused on the immigration issues at the heart of Trump’s order. </p>

          <h2>SEC Inquiry into Coinbase User Numbers Continues Under Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating whether Coinbase misstated its user numbers in past disclosures. The inquiry, which began during the Biden administration and has continued under Trump, focuses on the company's claim of having over 100 million “verified users.” Coinbase stopped citing the figure two years ago and is cooperating with the SEC in the investigation. The SEC has dropped a number of cases and investigations targeting crypto firms, but this inquiry is still ongoing.</p>

          <p>China has temporarily paused export restrictions targeting 28 American companies, but continues to block exports of seven rare earth metals to the United States. These metals are crucial for U.S. defense, energy, and automotive industries. The export restrictions on rare earths were part of a package of retaliatory measures against President Donald Trump's tariffs. China views the rare earth elements as leverage in its trade negotiations with Washington.</p>
