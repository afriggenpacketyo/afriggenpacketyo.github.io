          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war in Ukraine, this article examines their past encounters and differing diplomatic styles. Previous summits, such as those in Helsinki and at G20 meetings, have revealed Putin's tendency to dominate conversations and Trump's preference for personal rapport over detailed preparation. Former officials suggest Putin will leverage his KGB training to manipulate the discussions, while Trump aims to position himself as a peacemaker. The analysis provides crucial context for understanding the dynamics and potential outcomes of their high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are holding a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, with the primary goal of negotiating a ceasefire in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not present, but Trump has expressed hope for a subsequent meeting that would include him. The meeting is viewed with both skepticism and cautious optimism, as some analysts believe Putin may be using the summit as a tactic to ease international pressure without making real concessions. Meanwhile, Trump has stated he believes both leaders are ready to make peace.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has reached an agreement to sign forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth in a deal valued at up to £42.5 million, setting a new club record. The 23-year-old Burkina Faso international is scheduled for a medical in London after expressing a desire to leave Bournemouth due to a less prominent role. Ouattara made a significant impact for the Cherries last season, scoring nine goals across all competitions. This move follows Brentford's earlier unsuccessful bid for another winger, indicating their determination to strengthen their attacking options.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has announced it will seek the death penalty for Teresa Youngblut, who is accused of murdering a Border Patrol agent in Vermont. A federal grand jury indicted the 21-year-old on charges of murder and assault with a deadly weapon following a fatal traffic stop in January. Investigators have linked Youngblut to a radical fringe group, and the indictment details surveillance of her and a companion in the days leading up to the shooting. The case highlights the federal government's firm stance against attacks on law enforcement officers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows in China's major cities, smaller county-level markets are emerging as a potential new engine for national consumption. Residents in these areas often face lighter economic burdens and have faster-growing incomes, leading to increased purchasing power and willingness to spend. This expanding middle class in lower-tier cities is fueling a consumption upgrade, purchasing items like imported goods and electric vehicles. Experts believe this untapped potential is crucial for China's goal of shifting its economy towards a consumption-driven model, away from its traditional reliance on exports and investment.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell sharply after the company issued a disappointing forecast for the upcoming quarter, citing macroeconomic and policy uncertainties.

The company specifically noted that uncertainty surrounding its business in China, partly due to U.S. tariffs and pending export licenses, is a major factor in the weaker outlook.

          <p>Comedian and actor Paul Rodriguez was arrested again in Burbank, California, on suspicion of misdemeanor narcotics possession, less than five months after a similar incident in the same city. The arrest occurred after police conducted a welfare check on Rodriguez and a female companion in a downtown parking structure. Officers allegedly discovered Xanax and suspected fentanyl in his vehicle, while his companion was also arrested for drug possession. Rodriguez has disputed the charges from his previous arrest in March, claiming the drugs belonged to another individual and alleging civil rights violations by the police.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit is returning to the sport after signing with the Bristol Bears, ending his brief foray into American football. The 24-year-old winger, who has 32 caps for Wales, had left rugby in January 2024 to join the NFL's international player pathway program. After stints with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars, he failed to secure a spot and has chosen to resume his rugby career in the English Premiership. Rees-Zammit expressed excitement about joining Bristol, a club whose values align with his ambition to be a world-class player.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing about its long-term financial stability, with projections indicating its trust funds could be depleted by 2033. If no action is taken, the program may only be able to pay a portion of scheduled benefits, prompting lawmakers to propose various reforms. One bipartisan plan suggests creating a new $1.5 trillion investment fund to cover the shortfall, while another proposal focuses on increasing taxes on high earners. Polls show strong public support for congressional action to ensure the program's solvency for future generations. (not investment advice)</p>

Ryan Wear is accused of selling investors water vending machines that often did not exist and using new investor funds to pay returns to earlier ones. The second man, former fund manager Jordan Chirico, is charged with investing over $100 million of his clients' money into the fraudulent company while concealing his own financial stake.

          <p>As retirees seek stable income streams amid economic uncertainty, the strategy of owning multiple annuities is gaining attention for its potential to diversify and manage risk. This approach allows individuals to combine different types of annuities, such as fixed and variable, to balance guaranteed income with growth potential. However, managing multiple contracts introduces increased complexity, additional fees, and more nuanced tax planning. Prospective buyers should carefully coordinate liquidity needs and understand the specific terms of each contract to ensure the strategy aligns with their overall retirement goals.

          <p>New guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology advise a more aggressive approach to managing high blood pressure and recommend abstaining from alcohol. The updated recommendations suggest that individuals with systolic blood pressure in the 130-139 range should first try lifestyle changes, but begin medication if levels don't improve within three to six months. This is a shift from the previous threshold of 140. Citing growing evidence of alcohol's negative impact on blood pressure, the new guidelines now advocate for complete abstinence as the ideal approach to cardiovascular health.</p>

          <p>From a Ukrainian standpoint, the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is seen as a repugnant spectacle that legitimizes the aggressor in their ongoing war. Ukrainians and their allies are reportedly appalled by what they perceive as naive and clumsy diplomacy from the Trump administration, which they believe is being easily manipulated by Putin. There is widespread fear that any deal reached in Alaska will come at Ukraine's expense, potentially forcing territorial concessions without meaningful security guarantees. The article argues that Trump's focus on a real estate-style deal fundamentally misunderstands Putin's strategic goal of undermining Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>

With home equity levels at a record high, many are considering applying, but the decision may depend on the product type. Since HELOC rates are variable, borrowers can benefit from future rate cuts automatically, whereas those taking out fixed-rate home equity loans might consider waiting for a potentially lower rate.

While military crews from several nations work meticulously to prepare and drop tons of food, the method is highly inefficient and costly compared to overland truck deliveries, which are largely blocked by Israel. On the ground, the airdrops create chaos and desperation, as only the strongest can secure the scattered supplies, leaving many vulnerable people, including the elderly and children, empty-handed.

Putin seeks international recognition and the legitimization of Russia's territorial gains, viewing the high-profile meeting itself as a victory against Western efforts to isolate him. In contrast, Trump is driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker, having previously promised a swift end to the conflict.
