          <p>Two American aid workers were injured at a food distribution site in Khan Younis, Gaza, in an attack the sponsoring foundation attributed to Hamas. The incident occurred as Israeli airstrikes killed 14 Palestinians and ceasefire negotiations showed signs of progress, with Hamas giving a 'positive' initial response to a U.S.-led proposal. Meanwhile, additional Palestinians died while seeking food from aid convoys, highlighting the dire humanitarian crisis and the controversy surrounding different aid distribution methods in the war-torn region. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain secured a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich to advance to the Club World Cup semi-finals, despite finishing the match with only nine players. After Désiré Doué scored the opening goal, Ousmane Dembélé added a second deep in stoppage time to seal the win. The intense and fast-paced game was marred by a serious ankle injury to Bayern's Jamal Musiala following a challenge from PSG's goalkeeper. Both teams had goals disallowed and saw players sent off in a chaotic finish to the match.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, 'Mark Twain,' details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the setting that profoundly shaped his youth and literary career. Traveling to gather material for his book 'Life on the Mississippi,' Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, revisited the scenes of his formative years as a steamboat pilot. He found the experience deeply moving, reflecting on the freedom and independence he felt in that profession compared to his later life as a famous author. The journey highlighted both the changes to the river landscape and the enduring power of his memories.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, Mark Twain's full autobiography has been published 100 years after his death, revealing his uncensored thoughts on society, politics, and personal matters. The work was dictated over four years and intentionally structured in a non-linear, blog-like style, allowing him to speak freely without fear of immediate repercussions for those he criticized. Twain's candid memoir offers sharp commentary on figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and raw emotion regarding his family's tragedies. The century-long embargo was a deliberate choice by Twain to ensure his complete honesty and, as experts note, a brilliant marketing strategy.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris predicts an exciting British Grand Prix, with as many as six cars from three different teams having a realistic chance at victory. The qualifying session was exceptionally close, with the top six drivers separated by just 0.23 seconds. Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured pole position after adjusting his car for higher straight-line speed, while McLaren and Ferrari opted for different aerodynamic setups, creating a strategic battle between cornering speed and straight-line advantage. The varied car configurations and the potential for changing weather conditions suggest a highly competitive and unpredictable race at Silverstone.</p>

          <p>India is poised for victory in the second Test against England, largely thanks to a remarkable performance by captain Shubman Gill. After scoring 269 in the first innings, Gill added another 161 runs, allowing India to set England a near-impossible target of 608. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the end of day four, with key batsmen Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, and Joe Root dismissed. England now faces the difficult choice of attempting a record-breaking chase or batting for a draw to maintain their series lead.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon often described as 'old people smell' is a real biological process, not just a stigma, according to health experts. As people age, changes in skin composition and the breakdown of certain fatty acids produce a compound called 2-nonenal, which has a distinct musty or greasy scent. This compound is not easily removed by standard hygiene practices due to its oily nature. Experts suggest that managing this odor involves a holistic approach, including a diet rich in antioxidants, proper hydration, and antioxidant skincare, while also noting that some medications and hormonal changes can be contributing factors.</p>

Burns advocates for telling a complete, complicated history that includes diverse voices, from the top down and bottom up, to foster a shared understanding.

          <p>An inquiry into the U.S. tax system reveals that while the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of 16%, the disparity with the middle class lies in how income is generated and taxed. The core issue is that the system taxes wages from labor more heavily and immediately than it taxes wealth generated from investments. Billionaires utilize strategies like 'buy-borrow-die,' where they live off tax-free loans secured against their appreciating assets, deferring or avoiding taxes entirely. This creates a significant advantage over middle-class workers whose income is taxed directly from their paychecks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent threats of retribution against political opponents and critics have intensified, raising alarms about the state of U.S. democracy. In the past week, he has suggested deporting Elon Musk, arresting the prospective mayor of New York, and investigating Joe Biden's former homeland security secretary. Pro-democracy advocates warn that even if these threats are not legally executed, they serve to intimidate and chill free speech, creating a climate of fear. These actions follow a pattern of using the instruments of government to punish adversaries, which critics argue undermines the rule of law and the very definition of freedom.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently explained her decision to be a single parent, citing her own upbringing in a home with alcoholism and a tendency to 'lose herself' in romantic relationships. Theron stated she was honest with herself about her capacity to be healthy in a partnership while raising children and chose to build her family on her own. Relationship experts support her choice, viewing it as a sign of strength, self-awareness, and alignment with her personal values.

          <p>The Madre Fire, burning in the Los Padres National Forest in Central California, has rapidly expanded to over 79,600 acres, making it the largest wildfire in the state this year. As of Saturday morning, the fire was only 10% contained, threatening about 50 structures and prompting evacuation orders in parts of San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. Over 600 personnel, along with air tankers and helicopters, are battling the blaze, which has been fueled by difficult terrain and weather conditions. The cause of the fire, which started on Wednesday, is currently under investigation by authorities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a country with which none of them have ties. The men, originally from Cuba, Mexico, and several Asian countries, were the subject of a prolonged legal fight that reached the Supreme Court. Immigration advocates had tried to block the deportation, arguing the men could face torture or other harm in the conflict-ridden African country and that the move was unconstitutionally punitive. The Department of Homeland Security defended the action as a 'victory for the safety and security of the American people,' marking an unprecedented step in U.S. immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rise of digital payment systems and touch-screen kiosks has led to an increase in tip requests in places where they were not previously expected, a phenomenon dubbed 'tipflation.' Customers are now frequently prompted to tip for services ranging from fast-food pickup to self-service checkouts, often with pre-calculated options of 15% or more. This creates social pressure and confusion about when and how much to tip. Experts note that this trend was accelerated by the pandemic's shift to contactless payments, and that system designers have an incentive to make tipping the default.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in downtown Indianapolis early Saturday morning left two people dead and five others injured, just hours after the city's Fourth of July fireworks celebration. One of the deceased was a juvenile, and police stated that at least two other juveniles were among the wounded. The incident occurred amid a chaotic scene where hundreds of unsupervised young people were gathered. A visibly upset police chief criticized parents for not supervising their children and noted that officers had already made 20 arrests and confiscated guns from two minors before the shooting took place.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iran could strengthen North Korea's resolve to maintain and expand its nuclear weapons program, according to security analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang may view the U.S. action as evidence that President Trump is an unpredictable and untrustworthy leader, reinforcing their belief that nuclear weapons are the only true guarantee of the regime's survival. This development could effectively end any remaining possibility of North Korean denuclearization. The analysis comes after a period of stalled diplomacy following two summits between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic 'cortisol cocktail' has gone viral on TikTok, with proponents claiming it can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The drink typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that this combination of ingredients can meaningfully reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, experts recommend proven stress-reduction methods like quality sleep, exercise, and therapy instead.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter designed in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been rediscovered after being lost for decades. The machine is a crucial artifact in the history of modern computing, as it solved the immense challenge of inputting a non-alphabetic language with tens of thousands of characters. Its ingenious design, which broke down characters by shape rather than sound, is a foundational concept for how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The discovery of the typewriter, now acquired by Stanford University, offers new insights into the efforts to preserve the Chinese language in the technological age.</p>
