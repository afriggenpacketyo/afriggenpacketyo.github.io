        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading global authority, has officially declared a famine in Gaza City, warning it will likely spread without a ceasefire and increased aid. This marks the first confirmed famine in the Middle East, with over half a million people facing catastrophic conditions and 132,000 children under five at heightened risk of death. Israel's foreign ministry immediately rejected the assessment, calling it "false and biased" and accusing the IPC of relying on "Hamas lies," despite international pressure to increase aid access. Aid organizations, however, attribute the crisis to Israel's "systematic obstruction" and the destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive to relocate all stray dogs to shelters, responding to widespread protests from animal welfare organizations. The updated ruling mandates that non-aggressive dogs be vaccinated and sterilized before returning to their original locations, while only those with rabies or aggressive tendencies will be permanently sheltered. The court also prohibited feeding stray dogs in public spaces, requiring designated areas instead. This decision seeks to address public safety concerns, particularly regarding rabies, by promoting humane population control measures across the country.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel lawsuit against The Guardian, which published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The High Court judge ruled in favor of the newspaper, determining that its defense of truth and public interest was successful. During the six-week trial, more than a dozen women provided testimony detailing their personal experiences of misconduct by the actor and director. The Guardian's editor-in-chief welcomed the decision, emphasizing its importance for both the women who came forward and the future of public interest journalism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a threat of a full "Federal takeover" of Washington D.C., alleging that Mayor Muriel Bowser is circulating "inaccurate crime figures." In an early Friday post, Trump asserted that the city was "SAFE AGAIN" due to the efforts of the D.C. National Guard and Police, but warned of severe consequences, including federal intervention, if the mayor did not comply. This statement reinforces the President's ongoing campaign to address crime in the capital, which previously included directing the mobilization of local law enforcement for federal duties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has characterized the ongoing transfer dispute with striker Alexander Isak as a "lose-lose situation," noting he has not communicated with the player for a week. Isak reportedly wishes to join Liverpool, but Newcastle rejected a substantial £110m bid, prompting the 25-year-old to publicly claim that promises made to him were broken. Newcastle, however, has refuted these allegations, and Isak is now training apart from the main squad, consequently missing the team's initial Premier League matches.

          <p>An opinion article argues that Canada must urgently develop a "whole society defence" strategy, akin to Finland's, given concerns about a potentially aggressive US administration under President Trump. For decades, Canada has relied on the US for defense, but the current geopolitical climate necessitates a fundamental shift in its national identity. The strategy involves mobilizing all societal resources, including conscription, to make conquest prohibitively costly for any aggressor, rather than matching military capacity. This would bolster Canada's resilience against external threats and foster national unification in an era of global instability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unilaterally ended union contracts for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, following a federal appeals court ruling that lifted an injunction. This move, stemming from a March executive order citing national security, is seen by union leaders as a test bed for a wider assault on labor rights across the US. Contracts at agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs and Environmental Protection Agency have been terminated, affecting an estimated 400,000 employees.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced surprise over Beijing's recent security inquiries concerning the company's H20 artificial intelligence chips, which were custom-made for the Chinese market to adhere to US export controls.

          <p>Chocolate lovers should brace for continued price increases as the lingering effects of record-high cocoa prices impact retailers. Adverse weather, pest outbreaks, and supply tightness in West Africa have caused cocoa futures to soar in recent years, though they have eased slightly this year. Industry experts explain that the higher production costs from past peaks are still being passed on to consumers, maintaining an ongoing market deficit. However, there's a glimmer of hope for a brighter outlook by next Easter, as industrial demand softens and global supply improves with new plantings.</p>

          <p>Berlin's long-planned renaming of "Mohrenstraße" (Moor Street), widely regarded as racist, to "Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Straße" has been halted once more by an urgent court application. The district council had approved the change in 2020 to honor Anton Wilhelm Amo, a pioneering Black German Enlightenment philosopher, but residents filed a lawsuit. Despite a higher court upholding the renaming in July, the Berlin Administrative Court intervened again, citing an unresolved lawsuit from a citizens' initiative. The article highlights decades of lobbying by civil society groups to decolonize the street name, which carries offensive historical connotations related to slavery.</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption surged to a record high in July, exceeding 1 trillion kilowatt-hours, a figure comparable to the entire annual usage of all Asean nations. The National Energy Administration reported an 8.6% year-on-year increase, primarily propelled by intense heatwaves and a robust 5.7% growth in industrial output. Notably, the primary industry, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, experienced the most rapid expansion in electricity use, growing by 20.2%. This significant rise highlights the escalating energy demands within China's economy and its increasing susceptibility to extreme climatic conditions.</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of a royal defamation (lese majeste) charge, a legal victory that could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence. The Bangkok Criminal Court found the evidence too weak for conviction, citing an incomplete prosecution account and potential political bias in witnesses. This acquittal marks a significant moment for Thaksin, who returned to Thailand in 2023 after years of exile and has faced numerous politically motivated charges. Despite this win, he still faces other legal challenges, and his daughter, the current Prime Minister, is also under scrutiny for ethics breaches.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give a significant speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as the central bank deliberates its first interest rate cut of 2025. This address comes amidst persistent pressure from President Trump to lower rates, despite the Fed's stance on holding steady to observe the effects of tariffs. Policymakers face a dilemma: cutting rates could worsen inflation, while raising them risks a downturn, especially with recent signs of slowed hiring. Powell's speech is highly anticipated to clarify the Fed's primary concerns regarding inflation or employment and to address political independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, a steeper decline than initially estimated, marking a loss of economic momentum. The Federal Statistical Office attributed the revision to weaker-than-expected industrial production and private consumption. Exports also edged lower, contributing to Germany's stagnation as the only G7 economy for the past two years, now facing a potential third year of contraction. This economic downturn is compounded by mounting trade tensions, including the 10% baseline tariff imposed by US President Donald Trump, raising fears for Germany's export-driven economy.

Advocates warn that eliminating the $1.2 billion annual funding would severely impact students in underserved regions like eastern Kentucky, potentially stifling their opportunities.
