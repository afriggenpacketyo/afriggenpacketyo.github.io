            <p>A Cessna 310 crashed near I-95 in Boca Raton, Florida, resulting in the deaths of all three people on board and injuries to one person on the ground.

            <p>A US judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, can be deported based on a Cold War-era immigration law citing adverse foreign policy consequences. The Trump administration argued Khalil's presence in the US was unfavorable due to his participation in protests against the war in Gaza. The ACLU criticized the decision, claiming it was pre-written and based solely on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio without any allegations of criminal conduct. Khalil's legal team plans to appeal, asserting his right to speak out against US foreign policy, while the Trump administration maintains its commitment to enforcing immigration laws.</p>

The current District Attorney argues that the brothers have not fully taken responsibility for their crimes.

            <p>The Trump administration has decided to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans in the US, potentially leading to their deportation. This decision reverses the Biden administration's earlier extension of TPS due to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. Critics argue that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened, making it unsafe for return, and that the decision undermines America's commitment to its allies. This action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to overhaul immigration policy and revoke TPS for various countries.</p>

            <p>Experts are warning that a prolonged US-China trade war could have devastating consequences for African economies if it weakens China's economy. The US relies on commodity exports from African nations, and some African countries have already been negatively impacted by US tariffs. While the US has paused reciprocal tariffs for most countries, increased tariffs on China could indirectly harm Africa by reducing demand for its resources. Resource-rich countries like South Africa and those with manufacturing industries under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) could be particularly vulnerable.</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering taking control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, which is facing imminent closure. Parliament is being recalled to pass emergency legislation to keep the Chinese-owned site operational. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. The company is losing money due to challenging market conditions and high costs associated with transitioning to lower-carbon production techniques, leading to potential job cuts and concerns about the UK's long-term economic security.</p>
