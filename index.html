          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, suggested that Japan's purchases of U.S. defense equipment could potentially help reduce the trade deficit between the two countries, which could serve as a bargaining point in upcoming tariff talks. Akazawa met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to discuss strategies before the fourth round of tariff negotiations. While Akazawa acknowledged the potential link between defense spending and trade imbalances, he also cautioned against directly mixing security matters with tariff negotiations due to their differing logic and standards. This comes as Japan recently lost its status as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, adding pressure to address trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino announced that the bureau is actively investigating the alleged cover-up of COVID-19's origin, amidst the emergence of a new strain of the virus. Bongino's statement, made on X, highlights the FBI's continued interest in the pandemic's beginnings and the circumstances surrounding it. This announcement follows a 2023 assessment by then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, who stated the agency had moderate confidence that COVID-19 originated from a lab incident in Wuhan, China. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic is also continuing its inquiry into whether early public health messaging downplayed the lab leak theory for diplomatic or political reasons.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a major blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court said the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Araceli, a Salvadorian immigrant, along with her partner and two daughters, made three attempts to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Canada, seeking asylum from potential deportations under President Trump's policies. The family had been living illegally in the U.S. for over a decade, and after facing difficulties with their asylum application process, they sought refuge in Canada, where Araceli's siblings reside. However, due to the "safe third country agreement" between Canada and the U.S., asylum seekers must apply in the first country they land, with exceptions for those with close relatives in Canada. Despite initial setbacks, the family eventually succeeded in their third attempt, highlighting the increasing number of asylum seekers fleeing the U.S. due to stricter immigration policies.</p>

          <p>China has extended the strike range of its Type 055 destroyer by integrating it with an airborne early warning system, according to state broadcaster CCTV. This enhancement allows the destroyer, Lhasa, to precisely strike beyond visual-range targets without solely relying on its own radars. The system mirrors technology used by Pakistan's Air Force in the Kashmir conflict. The integration represents a significant advancement in operational coordination, enabling complete interoperability and seamless information sharing across domains, with shipborne helicopters and sensors feeding data into the combat center for simultaneous sea-and-air engagements.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank has lowered its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, the lowest since August 2022, marking its fourth cut in the last six meetings. This decision comes as the country faces protracted political uncertainty following a failed attempt to impose martial law and the imposition of 25% reciprocal tariffs by the Trump administration. The Bank of Korea cited expectations of declining economic growth and stable inflation as reasons for the rate cut, while also slashing its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to 0.8%. The central bank plans to maintain its rate cut stance to mitigate downside risks, closely monitoring domestic and external policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is expediting two major reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire to bolster England's water supplies, designating them as "nationally significant." This designation allows the projects to bypass local objections and accelerate through the planning process, though completion is still over a decade away. The move aims to enhance resilience against future droughts in a dry region with high water demand, particularly in light of climate change and a growing population. However, some experts caution that managing water usage and reducing waste should take precedence, alongside concerns about the impact on local communities and potential increases in water bills.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, known as O.C.G., to the United States after a federal judge ordered officials to do so. O.C.G. had been deported to Mexico and then Guatemala despite informing U.S. authorities of violence he experienced in Mexico and his fear of returning. The government's agreement marks a departure from its more defiant stance in other immigration matters. The case is part of a larger lawsuit addressing third-country deportations, in which migrants are sent to countries other than their home countries.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing in China, a strategy that has been criticized by the U.S. and its trade partners for exacerbating global trade imbalances. This move could put China on a collision course with the Trump administration, which aims to boost domestic production of high-tech products. Experts warn that China's focus on self-reliance in manufacturing may conflict with Trump's demands for addressing trade imbalances and ending state subsidies to Chinese companies. Despite these challenges, China appears unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy.</p>

          <p>California has joined 15 other states in a lawsuit against the National Science Foundation (NSF), alleging that the agency illegally terminated millions of dollars in grants and imposed new fees, harming vital research.

It also seeks to overturn the Trump administration’s cap on indirect research costs, which universities claim are essential for their work. California Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that the cuts threaten the state's position as a global leader in science and technology.</p>

The judge found that the government's actions were arbitrary and violated federal administrative law.
