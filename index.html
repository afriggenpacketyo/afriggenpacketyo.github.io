            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized El Salvador President Nayib Bukele and former President Donald Trump, alleging a setup during a meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a U.S. citizen wrongfully deported. Van Hollen claims El Salvador officials placed margarita glasses on the table during the meeting to defame him and the deportee. He emphasized the U.S. government's non-compliance with the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, accusing Trump of diverting attention by raising gang violence allegations. Van Hollen asserted the case is about protecting the constitutional rights of all U.S. residents, not just one man.</p>

            <p>The United States and Iran convened in Rome for a second round of negotiations concerning Tehran's escalating nuclear program, mediated by Omani officials. A U.S. official reported "very good progress" in both direct and indirect discussions, with plans for further meetings in Oman the following week. These talks signify a notable moment given the long-standing tensions between the two nations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. The aim is to reach a deal that ensures Iran is free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, while maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy.</p>

            <p>Superman's enduring popularity stems not only from his status as a beacon of hope but also from his relatable qualities, transcending race and ethnicity. Gene Luen Yang, a comic book writer, draws parallels between his experience as a Chinese-American and Superman's dual identity, highlighting the theme of being caught between cultures. Superman's story, with its roots in Jewish narratives and themes of self-sacrifice, resonates deeply, offering a portal to the sacred through the profane. Despite the religious undertones, Superman's appeal extends to those without religious affiliations, embodying a sense of belonging and shared values.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece discusses the negative stereotypes surrounding stepmothers, tracing them back to fairy tales and myths. It argues that these stereotypes create unnecessary anxieties for women entering blended families. The author suggests that the hatred directed towards stepmothers is often a projection of complex emotions about mothers in general. The piece encourages mothers, whether biological or stepmothers, to disregard these harmful stereotypes and focus on building genuine relationships.</p>

This order suggests the Court may be losing patience with the administration's efforts to evade judicial review through procedural arguments, as Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.</p>
