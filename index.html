          <p>As China's fourth plenum concludes, an official editorial from the ruling Communist Party hails the nation's socialist system as a fundamental source of strength for its vast economy and a crucial anchor of global stability. The article emphasizes that the scientific and consistent formulation and implementation of five-year plans represent a core political strength, enabling China's economic ship to navigate through various challenges steadily and remain on course. It contrasts China's unified national strategy, which mobilizes all sides and advances steadily in the right direction, with the perceived short-term policymaking and frequent reversals often observed in multiparty systems. This perspective underscores Beijing's deep confidence in its unique governance model, portraying it as essential for both sustained domestic development and international economic resilience.</p>

          <h2>Reddit Sues Perplexity Over Alleged AI Scraping of User Posts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 00:41:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social media giant Reddit has initiated a lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Perplexity, alleging the illegal scraping of user posts to train its AI models. The complaint, filed in New York federal court, also names three other entities—Oxylabs, AWMProxy, and SerpApi—accused of assisting Perplexity by masking their identities to extract copyrighted content. Reddit asserts its user posts are a frequently cited source for Perplexity's AI-generated answers and that Perplexity increased citations after a cease-and-desist letter. Perplexity, however, denies training AI models on the content, stating it merely summarizes and cites public discussions, and accuses Reddit of "extortion" in data licensing negotiations. This legal battle highlights broader industry conflicts over data rights and content usage by AI firms.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old semi-truck driver, Jashanpreet Singh, was arrested for driving under the influence following a deadly eight-vehicle collision on the 10 Freeway in Ontario, California, that killed three people. Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed Singh is an Indian national who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. The incident raises questions about the validity of his commercial driver's license, especially after the U.S. government paused issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers due to safety concerns. This event follows a similar fatal crash in Florida, leading to a lawsuit against California and Washington for allegedly failing to comply with federal requirements when issuing CDLs to undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>Wind and rain warnings have been issued across parts of the UK as Storm Benjamin, named by the French weather service Météo France, moves from the English Channel to the North Sea. Commuters are advised to prepare for heavy rain and gusts up to 70mph, with the Met Office warning of potential power cuts, localized flooding, building damage, and widespread travel disruptions. Yellow weather warnings cover significant areas of southern and eastern England and Wales, with some regions expecting 30-50mm of rain. More severe conditions are anticipated for western Europe, including France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with two Europa League matches rescheduled.

          <p>Southern California residents are facing challenges in seeking compensation for property damage caused by falling city-maintained trees, as illustrated by a Burbank woman's ongoing legal battle. Angela Towne's car was severely damaged by a fallen tree, but her claim was initially denied by the city, which cited "Mother Nature." Despite winning in small claims court, the city appealed and she lost, highlighting the difficulties in proving city liability. The article notes that the city of Los Angeles has paid over $18 million in similar settlements since 2021 and advises homeowners to document tree conditions and submit written requests to cities to strengthen their claims.</p>

          <p>The US government shutdown has entered its fourth week, with no clear end in sight as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked over funding. Congressional Republicans initially expected Democrats to concede quickly, but both sides now accuse the other of intransigence, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticizing Republicans for constantly shifting their reasons for blocking funding bills. The article suggests that President Donald Trump, due to his significant influence over congressional Republicans, is ultimately the key to resolving the shutdown, though he has yet to fully engage in negotiations. Despite growing "shutdown fatigue" on Capitol Hill and worries about its impact on national parks, both parties are convinced they are prevailing in the messaging war, indicating a prolonged stalemate.</p>

          <p>China is closely analyzing the implications of closer defense ties between Asia-Pacific allies, specifically the first joint bilateral naval exercise between India and South Korea. This article suggests Beijing views these strengthened alliances as either a strategic counterweight to regional power dynamics or a containment strategy aimed at limiting its influence. The enhanced cooperation reflects concerns among participating nations regarding a potential security vacuum should the United States reduce its military presence in the region. India's naval vessel Sahyadri participated in the exercise as part of its broader operational deployment to the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific, underscoring the evolving geopolitical alignments and complex strategic considerations shaping the security landscape in the region.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in an intensified effort to pressure Moscow into negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine. President Donald Trump stated the move came after failed discussions with Vladimir Putin, citing Putin's refusal to end the "senseless war." US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that these oil companies fund the Kremlin's "war machine," and the sanctions aim to disrupt global fuel supplies. The action, following similar UK measures, has caused global oil prices to rise and puts pressure on major Russian oil customers like China and India to halt purchases.</p>

Immigration and recent ICE raids also became a proxy battleground for candidates' approaches to Donald Trump. Third candidate Sliwa offered occasional levity but did little to shift the perception of the race.

Speaking at Fudan University in Shanghai, the adviser called for confidence in defending the Communist Party's rule and challenging perceived "double standards" about China's rise. He warned that simply resisting and fighting back against Western provocations is unlikely to convince Western societies and, more importantly, risks a backlash among Global South countries.

          <p>President Donald Trump's plan to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House has triggered strong reactions as construction crews began demolishing parts of the East Wing. Historians, preservationists, and politicians expressed umbrage at the unilateral decision to alter the historic residence, with the National Trust for Historic Preservation urging a delay for public review. The White House dismissed the outcry as "manufactured outrage" by "unhinged leftists," while Trump claimed the $300 million project is privately funded. Concerns remain about transparency regarding donors and the potential for the opulent addition to overwhelm the existing White House structure.</p>

          <p>Early voter turnout is exceeding expectations in California's November 4 special election concerning Proposition 50, a Democratic-led initiative to redraw congressional districts. Over 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, a figure comparable to presidential election turnout at this stage, which is notable given the esoteric nature of redistricting. Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Obama, who endorsed Prop 50, highlight its significance for national democracy, framing it as a defense against political manipulation. The current Democratic advantage in returned ballots suggests an edge for the proposition, which needs a simple majority to pass and aims to counter Republican efforts to boost their party's numbers in Congress.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to expand its nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration into the San Francisco area, deploying Border Patrol agents, potentially as early as this week. Officials, speaking anonymously, indicated agents would stage at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. This move has drawn strong condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who accuse the administration of creating anxiety and using "un-American tactics" to target immigrant communities. The Department of Homeland Security stated it targets "the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens," but local leaders vow peaceful protest against the expanded enforcement.</p>

          <p>A German soldier sustained minor injuries after being mistakenly shot by police during a large-scale Bundeswehr training exercise in Erding, Bavaria. The incident occurred due to a "misinterpretation" at the scene when police, responding to reports of an armed man, encountered military police who fired practice ammunition, leading officers to return fire with live rounds. The drills, part of "Marshal Power" rehearsing an attack on a NATO member state, are being conducted in public spaces. This accidental shooting highlights the inherent risks and communication challenges involved in complex, multi-agency training operations in public settings.</p>

          <p>Food insecurity is becoming a growing concern in rural America, exemplified by a mobile food bank in Clinton, Missouri, where the number of people seeking help has doubled. The article highlights that rising inflation and over $1 billion in cuts to federal food aid programs have led to fewer donations for non-profits like Harvesters, which serves nearly 375,000 people daily across Kansas and Missouri. With one in seven people in 27 counties facing food insecurity, the need is at its highest in a decade. The situation is expected to worsen if the ongoing government shutdown continues and SNAP payments are withheld, underscoring a deepening social crisis and prompting calls from affected citizens for politicians to prioritize assistance.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has admitted her department is "not yet fit for purpose" following a "damning" internal report that labeled it dysfunctional and detached from core functions. The report, commissioned by a previous Home Secretary, uncovered a "culture of defeatism" on immigration, fragmented structures, and failures in tackling crime and small boats crossings. It also criticized a lack of accountability and reliance on outdated technology, noting many civil servants avoid immigration work due to ethical opposition or fear of blame. Mahmood pledges to transform the Home Office, echoing past calls for reform in a department plagued by systemic issues.</p>

          <p>The US State Department has removed its Human Rights Reporting Gateway, an online portal for individuals and organizations to report alleged human rights violations by foreign military units supplied with American weapons. This deletion, condemned by human rights campaigners and a congressional aide who drafted the original law, raises serious concerns about transparency and accountability. Critics argue the move signals a weakening of the department's human rights architecture and reduces incentives for foreign governments to address abuses. The State Department insists it still abides by legal requirements and engages with "credible organizations," but the removal eliminates the only publicly accessible formal channel.</p>

          <p>New research and a clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania are offering hope for preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells." These cells, which break away from main tumors and can later spread cancer, were identified in patients' bone marrow. In a trial of 51 women with aggressive triple-negative breast cancer, drug treatments successfully eliminated these dormant cells, resulting in only two recurrences over seven years—significantly below the expected rate. This breakthrough could revolutionize post-treatment care for breast cancer patients, with next steps focusing on larger trials and potential application to other cancers.</p>

          <p>Lebanon is facing an alarming public health crisis, experiencing the fastest rising rate of cancer cases and deaths globally, according to a recent survey. The article attributes this dramatic increase to severe air pollution from vehicles and diesel generators, overuse of agricultural chemicals contaminating water, and exceptionally high smoking rates across all age groups. Despite screening availability, a lack of public health campaigns means many cancers, including lung, leukemia, pancreatic, and liver, are not detected early. Lebanese parliament members have acknowledged the findings, but implementing comprehensive government responses to tackle these multifaceted environmental and lifestyle factors is expected to be a slow journey.</p>
