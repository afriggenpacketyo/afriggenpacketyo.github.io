        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several newspapers, including the Chicago Sun-Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer, published a summer reading list containing fabricated books by well-known authors, leading to widespread criticism. The list, part of licensed content from King Features, included titles like Isabel Allende's nonexistent "Tidewater Dreams" and Percival Everett's fictitious "The Rainmakers." Writer Marco Buscaglia admitted to using AI in creating the list, calling it a "huge mistake" and taking full responsibility. Readers and authors expressed outrage, with some lamenting the inclusion of AI-generated content in hard copy newspapers and the replacement of trained professionals with inaccurate garbage. The incident highlights concerns about accuracy and trust in media, especially given recent staff buyouts at the Chicago Sun-Times.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article analyzes John Mulaney's Netflix talk show, "Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney," highlighting its experimental and ambitious approach to the genre. The article notes the show's departure from traditional talk show formats, such as actors promoting projects and overly planned chats, opting instead for quirky themes and unpredictable stunts, like Mulaney hosting blindfolded. While the show's originality and ambition are praised, the article also points out some inconsistencies, such as awkward viewer calls and aimless panel discussions. However, the article concludes that the show has evolved, becoming tighter, funnier, and more meta, with savvier bookings and hilarious videos, making a case for risk-taking artists in late-night television.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ordered the Maine state legislature to restore the voting rights of Representative Laurel Libby, a Republican who was censured for a social media post identifying a transgender high school athlete. Libby's post criticized the state's policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports, leading to her censure and suspension from participating in debates or votes. The Supreme Court's decision temporarily reinstates her right to vote, with Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissenting. The case has garnered attention from the U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi, who support Libby's lawsuit and defend girls' sports from radical gender ideology.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old man, Dennis Smith, died while attempting a rim-to-rim hike at the Grand Canyon, according to the National Park Service. Smith, an experienced hiker, was found unresponsive on the North Kaibab Trail, a challenging route known for being the least visited in the park. Bystanders and park service personnel attempted resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead at the scene, and the cause of death is under investigation. The Park Service recommends starting such hikes before sunrise and taking breaks during the hottest parts of the day, warning of extreme heat in the coming days, and urging hikers to be self-reliant due to potential delays in assistance.</p>

          <p>In the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, Sharay Hayes, a male escort, testified about alleged sexual encounters involving Sean Combs and Cassie Ventura, stating that Ventura appeared comfortable and focused on Combs during these encounters. During cross-examination, Hayes discussed his book about erectile dysfunction and his career as an exotic dancer, emphasizing that his performances are typically not personal, but he felt "special" because Ventura chose him for these encounters. Federal prosecutors argue that Ventura was coerced into these sexual acts under threat of violence or reputational harm from Combs, while Hayes maintained that Ventura seemed to be enjoying herself but remained consistently aware of Combs' directions and desires.</p>

Neighbors described the children as regular fixtures outside, seemingly happy and well-mannered, and expressed disbelief that such abuse could occur unnoticed.

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials for shots intended for healthy individuals aged 6 months to 64 years. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>Walmart cautioned that higher import duties would soon lead to increased prices for its shoppers, a shift from its previous downplaying of tariff effects. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb, despite Walmart's commitment to everyday low prices. This announcement carries the risk of backlash from President Trump, who has previously attacked companies opposing his agenda. Walmart responded to Trump's subsequent criticism by reiterating its dedication to maintaining low prices, highlighting the delicate balance businesses must strike between appeasing customers, shareholders, and the White House amid evolving trade policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump traveled to the Capitol to rally House Republicans to support his wide-ranging bill, which aims to enact his taxation and immigration priorities. He urged representatives to drop demands for a larger State and Local Tax (Salt) deduction and sought to reassure moderates concerned about Medicaid cuts. Despite Trump's efforts, the bill faces opposition from blue-state Republicans seeking a restored Salt deduction and right-wing fiscal hardliners worried about the bill's $3.8 trillion cost through 2034. The legislation includes making permanent or extending tax cuts, ending taxation of tips and overtime, and funding a border wall and mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Millions of shoppers could receive up to £70 each following a court ruling that deemed historic fees administered by Mastercard as unfair. The decision stems from a legal case initiated nearly a decade ago by Walter Merricks, who argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland who lived there for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008 and purchased goods or services from UK businesses accepting Mastercard credit cards are eligible to claim compensation. The settlement is for £200m, with £100m allocated for consumers, and payments will be capped at £70 per claimant if fewer people apply.</p>
