        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AMIES Technology, a newly established Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, is heralded as a crucial initiative to diminish China's reliance on foreign chipmaking machinery, particularly from Dutch giant ASML. Facing significant bottlenecks and US export controls on advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems, China seeks to bolster its domestic capabilities. As a spin-off from the state-owned Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), AMIES aims to commercialize advanced equipment more rapidly, focusing on the essential front-end wafer fabrication where China currently trails global leaders. This strategic move underscores China's persistent drive towards technological self-sufficiency in the critical semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>China's leading airlines, spearheaded by China Eastern, are implementing free Wi-Fi services on a growing number of domestic flights as a strategic move to attract business travelers. This initiative directly addresses the increasing competition from high-speed trains, which have become a popular alternative for inter-city travel. By offering the ability to "work from the air," airlines aim to provide enhanced convenience and value, thereby differentiating their services and improving customer satisfaction. The article highlights this as a significant effort to adapt to changing market dynamics and secure a competitive edge in the domestic travel sector.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen is aggressively asserting himself in the Formula 1 world championship, challenging McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris for the title, a situation McLaren boss Zak Brown described as potentially "brutal." A significant incident at the US Grand Prix sprint saw Piastri and Norris collide, paving the way for Verstappen to secure a comfortable win and later, pole position for the main race. This article underscores how Verstappen's relentless performance has eroded McLaren's earlier advantage, making the championship fight intensely competitive. McLaren now faces the challenge of overcoming Red Bull's recent pace and internal incidents to achieve their goal of a one-two drivers' championship finish.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a stark warning, citing credible reports that Hamas may be planning an attack targeting Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip. Such an action would be considered a "direct and grave violation" of the recently established ceasefire agreement, potentially jeopardizing the fragile peace achieved through mediation efforts. This alert comes amidst heightened tensions, further fueled by a CBS News video depicting Hamas executing individuals suspected of collaborating with Israel. The article highlights the U.S. administration's concern for civilian protection and the stability of the ceasefire, although specific details regarding the nature or timing of the alleged attack remain undisclosed.</p>

          <p>Human remains found in a shallow grave on the grounds of an abandoned school are believed to be those of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old Philadelphia woman who had been missing for two weeks. Police, acting on a specific anonymous tip, discovered the remains in a heavily wooded area, with the medical examiner now tasked with confirming her identity and determining the cause of death. A suspect, Keon King, 21, was previously charged with kidnapping in connection with Scott's disappearance, as evidence indicated he was the last person in contact with her. This tragic discovery brings a somber resolution to the search, as authorities continue their investigation to ensure justice is served for her family.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, citing his "horrible mistreatment" and ordering his immediate release. Santos, who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, was serving an 87-month sentence and will now be exempt from paying restitution to his victims. While Santos expressed profound gratitude for what he called a "true second chance at life," the decision drew sharp criticism from figures like Rep. Nick LaLota, who argued the crimes warranted a longer sentence. The article clarifies that this action is a commutation, which lessens the sentence but does not erase Santos' criminal record.</p>

Although Terrassa itself has no documented cases of cruelty towards black cats, the decision was prompted by warnings from animal welfare groups regarding incidents in other regions.

The article notes how these fathers, typically aged 18-22, often feel judged, vulnerable, and lonely, with few positive male role models to turn to.

          <p>The Indonesian island of Lombok is experiencing rapid "Bali-fication," as it transforms from a laidback surfers' haven into a major tourist destination, marked by the development of glitzy resorts and a new racetrack. While this government-led initiative promises significant economic opportunities and increased prosperity for locals, many express deep concerns about the social and environmental repercussions. This article highlights issues such as forced evictions, the potential loss of the island's natural beauty, and cultural shifts in the predominantly Muslim community. Both residents and visitors question whether Lombok can retain its unique identity and charm amidst the accelerated push for tourism development, balancing economic growth with cultural and environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the repatriation of two survivors, from Ecuador and Colombia, following a U.S. military strike that destroyed a "drug-carrying submarine" in the Caribbean. The article reports that two other crew members were killed in the operation, which Trump stated targeted fentanyl and other illegal narcotics. This incident marks the sixth known U.S. boat attack in the region, justified by the administration as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels. These strikes are occurring amid a broader U.S. military buildup near Venezuela, drawing criticism from some lawmakers who question the lack of congressional approval and the sufficiency of evidence regarding the vessels' cargo.</p>

          <p>Israel has received two additional bodies from Gaza, which Hamas asserts are hostages, bringing the total returned to 12, with 16 still officially unaccounted for under the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Prime Minister Netanyahu's office has maintained the closure of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, explicitly conditioning its reopening on the complete return of all hostage remains and the full implementation of the agreed-upon outline. This article underscores the persistent tensions and dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with the UN describing the territory as a "wasteland." A recent incident also saw 11 members of a Palestinian family killed by an Israeli tank shell, further complicating the fragile peace.</p>

          <p>A former acting director of ICE, John Sandweg, has sharply criticized President Trump's immigration crackdown, asserting that it places federal agents "in a terrible position" by deploying them to cities where their specialized training is ill-suited. This article highlights growing concerns over aggressive tactics, including the use of tear gas and vehicle crashes, by agents primarily trained for high-risk border threats. Sandweg contends that while individual agents may follow protocols, the administration is responsible for misusing resources and escalating confrontations. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has also condemned these actions, leading to a federal judge ordering agents in Chicago to wear body cameras in response to ongoing lawsuits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his royal titles has brought significant changes for his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who now reverts to her maiden name, and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. This article clarifies that while Beatrice and Eugenie retain their princess titles, their positions are far down the line of succession, making official royal duties improbable. It emphasizes that Ferguson's own recent controversies, including an email referring to Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend," are likely to have a more profound impact on her charity work and business ventures than the loss of her duchess title. Despite these challenges, Ferguson's reputation as a "survivor and master of reinvention" is underscored.</p>
