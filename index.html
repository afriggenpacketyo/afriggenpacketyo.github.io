          <p>Grant Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," is believed to have fled Arkansas after escaping from Calico Rock prison by disguising himself as a law enforcement officer. Authorities are focusing their search on the Ozark Mountain region, where Hardin has extensive knowledge and may be hiding in caves or rugged terrain. The U.S. Border Patrol has deployed a special operations team to assist in the manhunt, and the Arkansas Department of Corrections has released an updated image of Hardin with facial hair and a slimmer appearance. Hardin was serving a 30-year sentence for murder and two 25-year sentences for sexual assault, and a reward of $25,000 is offered for information leading to his capture. The optimism score reflects the serious nature of the crime and the ongoing search. </p>

          <p>David Brooks argues that the Democratic Party's problems are more profound than just a lack of compelling leadership or messaging. He contends that the party needs to adapt to a new historical era marked by widespread social distrust and a belief that social systems are rigged. Brooks suggests that the Republican Party, under Trump, has been more successful in adjusting to this shift by tapping into the atmosphere of alienation and challenging established institutions. He emphasizes that this adaptation requires visionaries willing to shift their entire worldview, rather than just political maneuvering.</p>

          <p>The feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump escalated, with Musk claiming Trump is in the Epstein files. Musk's accusation came after Trump criticized Musk's stance on the president's domestic megabill. Trump has denied any involvement with Epstein. The public rift began with Musk's opposition to the bill's price tag and its impact on the national debt, and has since devolved into personal attacks on social media. </p>
