        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>DoorDash has introduced a new fleet of autonomous delivery robots, named 'Dots,' in the Phoenix metro area to handle smaller-sized orders. These five-foot-tall bots can carry up to 30 pounds and travel at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour in bike lanes, on roads, and on sidewalks. The company's AI-powered platform determines which deliveries are best suited for the robots, aiming to create a more efficient and economical system for local commerce. This initiative, part of DoorDash Labs, is being launched in partnership with the city of Mesa, which views the technology as a way to support local businesses and modernize delivery services.</p>

          <p>India defeated Sri Lanka by 59 runs in a rain-affected opening match of the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup in Guwahati. After a mid-game collapse left them at 124-6, a crucial 103-run partnership between Amanjot Kaur and Deepti Sharma helped India post a competitive total of 269-8. Sharma also excelled with the ball, taking three wickets as India bowled Sri Lanka out for 211 in front of a record crowd for a group-stage game.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government is nearing a shutdown as Congress remains deadlocked over a funding agreement ahead of the October 1 fiscal year deadline. The current impasse is driven by Republican refusal to compromise on a stopgap measure, while Democrats demand extensions for Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of Medicaid cuts. This year's threat is considered more serious due to a White House memo directing agencies to prepare for not just temporary furloughs but also permanent layoffs. A shutdown would halt non-essential federal services, potentially furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers and disrupting everything from national parks to food safety inspections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed its first-ever affirmative Second Amendment lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, alleging a systematic delay in processing concealed carry weapon permits. The complaint claims the LASD forces law-abiding citizens to wait months or even years for a decision, with thousands of applications pending and very few approved in a recent 15-month period. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the department will continue to fight for gun rights, while gun rights groups praised the federal government's intervention. The lawsuit seeks to compel the sheriff's office to comply with constitutional and state-mandated timelines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has decreased, making it a more affordable borrowing option compared to home equity loans and personal loans. For an $80,000 HELOC, current monthly payments are approximately $966 for a 10-year term, which is about $45 cheaper per month than a year ago. The article notes that while the variable rate of a HELOC offers potential for further savings if the Fed continues to cut rates, borrowers should carefully weigh this against the predictability of a fixed-rate home equity loan.

This move is seen as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to downplay the climate crisis, following actions like removing climate change information from government websites. The Department of Energy's press secretary has denied the existence of any such directive, stating the agency remains committed to open dialogue about climate science.</p>

The address focused on creating a clear dividing line between Reform's platform and the rest of the political spectrum, with Starmer positioning himself as the primary figurehead for that opposition. This performance served as a defiant response to internal critics who have called for a more aggressive political strategy. With a challenging budget and local elections ahead, the speech was a critical moment for Starmer to reassert his leadership.</p>

However, the debt itself does not disappear and collectors may still attempt to contact the individual for payment. Making a payment on old debt can sometimes restart the statute of limitations, making it crucial for consumers to understand their rights. (not investment advice)</p>

In a letter to the Education Secretary, lawmakers stated that these seizures have already led to severe financial hardship for some families. After a long pause, the administration resumed garnishments in April, but it appears to be relying on notices sent years ago, before the pandemic.

          <p>Labor unions in Greece have called for a general strike on October 1 to protest a controversial government bill that could legalize a 13-hour workday. The proposed legislation would allow employees to work for a second employer for up to five additional hours after their primary eight-hour shift. The government argues this merely adapts legislation to the reality of many Greeks working second jobs, but unions claim it will lead to exhaustion and erode workers' rights. The strike is expected to halt transportation services across the country, as unions campaign for a reduced 37.5-hour work week instead.</p>

          <p>Arianna Huffington, founder of Huffington Post and CEO of Thrive Global, warns against the 'collective delusion' that equates overwork with success. She recounts her personal experience with burnout in 2007, when she collapsed from exhaustion, as a pivotal moment that shifted her perspective on work-life balance. Citing scientific data, Huffington argues that individuals are more effective, creative, and better leaders when they allow themselves time to recharge. She advocates for 'micro steps'—small, incremental changes in daily habits—as a sustainable way to build a healthier and ultimately more successful life, rather than relying on drastic, hard-to-maintain resolutions.</p>

          <p>If Congress fails to pass a funding deal, the U.S. government will shut down at midnight, causing widespread disruption. As many as 4 million federal employees could go without pay, including essential workers like TSA officers and air traffic controllers who must continue to work. Services like Social Security and Medicare will continue, but national parks and Smithsonian museums could close, and food safety inspections may be delayed. The Pentagon's contingency plan requires all active-duty troops to continue working, though their pay could be delayed, creating financial hardship for military families. This would be the 21st government shutdown since 1977.</p>

          <p>In his advice column, James Parker responds to a reader who has lost the creative 'fire' for writing weekly odes about local food and drink. Parker shares his own experience of losing his connection to what he calls 'the odeness'—the essential, unique quality of a subject—after publishing a book of his own odes. He advises the reader that this creative energy can return, suggesting they broaden their range to more abstract topics like moods or ideas. Parker concludes that odes do not always need to be rapturous or jolly; they simply need to authentically capture the essence of their subject.</p>

          <p>The recent Asia Cup cricket final between India and Pakistan was marred by political tensions, transforming the sporting event into a reflection of the nations' long-standing acrimony. The Indian team refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts throughout the tournament and, after their victory, declined to accept the trophy from Pakistan's Interior Minister, Mohsin Naqvi, leading to a 90-minute standoff. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi linked the win to a recent military operation, drawing a sharp rebuke from Naqvi. The events mark a departure from the historical use of 'cricket diplomacy' to ease tensions between the two rivals.</p>

The film serves as a corrective to the caricatures that have overshadowed the festival's significance, highlighting its role in challenging a male-dominated music industry that refused to play two female artists back-to-back. Lilith Fair created a rare sense of community, safety, and collective power for both performers and audiences. The documentary reflects on what has been lost in the decades since, contrasting the festival's earnest camaraderie with today's more detached and ironic cultural landscape.</p>

With current rates around 4.50%, depositing $24,000 into a 1-year CD or $8,200 into a 3-year CD can yield over $1,000 upon maturity. The article suggests that with more rate cuts expected, now is a timely moment to lock in a high rate.
