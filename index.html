          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is experiencing significant turmoil following massive layoffs, with reports of employees being fired and then temporarily reinstated. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. admitted that about 20% of the cuts were "mistakes" and are being rectified. The restructuring, which aims to realign HHS with its core mission, has resulted in confusion among staff and managers, with many unsure of who still works for them. The cuts have affected various divisions, including those focused on public health, maternal and child health, and HIV outreach, raising concerns about the future of these programs.</p>

          <p>The use of torpedo bats, which have a slightly different shape than traditional wooden bats, has sparked discussion in the baseball community. These bats, which are slightly fatter closer to the middle, distribute weight differently and may offer a slight advantage to hitters. While unambiguously legal, the effectiveness of torpedo bats remains debated, with some players and analysts suggesting they could provide a marginal benefit. The bats gained attention after a high-scoring game by the New York Yankees, but their overall impact on performance is still uncertain and requires further data analysis.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" policies, particularly his aggressive trade and tariff measures, could inadvertently benefit Asia, especially East Asia. These policies create an incentive for East Asia and Europe to strengthen their economic ties, potentially forming a large free-trade area within the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This alliance could offset the impact of US isolationism, with China potentially joining the CPTPP.

Creating an immersive language environment at home through activities like watching cartoons, listening to music, and video-calling relatives can also support language development.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has delayed a potential ban on TikTok for a second time, reportedly due to stalled negotiations with China over the sale of its US operations. This delay is linked to broader trade tensions, including increased tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese goods. While a deal involving US investors running TikTok's US arm had been proposed, Chinese government approval remains an obstacle. The original ban was motivated by concerns that TikTok could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the US response to the Myanmar earthquake, dismissing criticism that the Trump administration's shuttering of USAID hindered rescue efforts. Rubio argued that the US must balance humanitarian work with its national interests and that other wealthy countries should contribute. He also cited the military regime in Myanmar as a factor limiting access, despite the state department's claim that the country had requested assistance. Rubio's statements come amid reports of a rising death toll and concerns about the adequacy of the US response.</p>

          <p>Across-the-board 10% tariffs on nearly all imports have gone into effect, part of President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs, amid continued economic fallout. More severe tariffs on imports from several dozen countries are slated to follow, including a 34% tax on Chinese goods and a 20% tax on European Union imports. Wall Street has been roiling ever since Trump's announcement on Wednesday. The trading session on Friday marked the worst day for U.S. stocks since 2020. Trump has dismissed concerns about the short-term pain economists expect to be passed on to American consumers as a result of the tariffs.</p>
