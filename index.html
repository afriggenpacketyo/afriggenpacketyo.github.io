          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee port, Iran's largest commercial port, resulted in at least 28 fatalities and 800 injuries. The blast, felt up to 50km away, caused extensive damage to nearby buildings and infrastructure. Initial reports suggest the explosion may have been triggered by improperly stored chemicals, possibly solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles. Despite the disaster, the port has resumed some operations, while investigations continue into the exact cause and safety protocols.</p>

          <p>As Vietnam commemorates the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the nation is subtly adjusting the narrative surrounding its victory. While officially termed "The Liberation of the South and National Reunification Day," the event is now increasingly referred to as "Reunification Day," a move seen as an effort to reconcile with the Vietnamese diaspora and improve international relations. This shift also involves toning down rhetoric about the former South Vietnamese government. Despite these efforts, differing perspectives on the event persist, with some overseas Vietnamese still referring to it as "Black April".</p>

          <p>Deep beneath Mt. San Jacinto lies the 13-mile San Jacinto Tunnel, a crucial component of the Colorado River Aqueduct, delivering up to 1 billion gallons of water daily to Southern California. Constructed in the 1930s, this engineering feat involved 1,200 workers blasting and digging for six years. During annual maintenance, the Metropolitan Water District offers rare glimpses inside, revealing a constant flow of groundwater and the impressive scale of the structure. The tunnel's completion in 1939 marked a significant achievement, enabling Southern California's growth, though it also impacted local Native American communities by drying up their springs.

          <p>A New York Times investigation into the Army Black Hawk helicopter collision with an American Airlines regional jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport, which resulted in total loss of life, has uncovered that a series of failures contributed to the accident. The Black Hawk crew failed to properly execute 'see and avoid' rules, a common but sometimes dangerous aviation practice. This practice requires pilots to visually navigate around other aircraft, rather than relying on air traffic control. The investigation highlights that the accident was not caused by one single error but multiple failures in the system.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once projected as a high-round NFL draft pick, fell to the fifth round, raising questions about his perceived value and reported issues during interviews. Despite concerns about his off-field behavior and schematic knowledge, the Cleveland Browns selected him, presenting Sanders with an opportunity to prove his worth. He now faces competition for the starting quarterback position, requiring him to adapt to a new offensive system and demonstrate a willingness to work within a team structure. Sanders' ability to adjust and overcome these challenges will determine his success in the NFL.</p>

          <p>George Clooney claims he has never argued with his wife Amal in their 11 years of marriage, prompting reflection on the role of wealth in relationships. The article questions whether such harmony is possible due to the Clooneys' immense wealth and privilege, which eliminates many common sources of conflict. It also contrasts this with the reality of most people's lives, where arguments are a normal part of relationships. The author suggests that while arguments can be productive, setting clear boundaries and walking away from crossed lines is crucial for a peaceful life.</p>

Starting with a simple video, the channel quickly gained popularity, transforming Evan's childhood into a family business. At Christmas, Jared bought a haul of Angry Birds merch at Toys “R” Us — action figures and magnets, erasers and gummy candy, hoodies and blankets, backpacks and plush toys — and recorded as Evan showcased them, one by one, in front of the family’s dazzling Christmas tree. Since the show-and-tell video, his patter had become polished.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to federal jobs, hiring freezes, and attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs are disrupting a traditional path to the middle class for many Black workers.

The federal government has historically provided stable employment and career advancement opportunities for Black individuals. Concerns are raised about the long-term impact of these changes on Black families and communities, particularly in areas like Prince George's County, Maryland, which has a high concentration of Black federal employees.</p>
