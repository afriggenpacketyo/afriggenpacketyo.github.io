          <h2>Boeing Nears Deal to Avoid Guilty Plea in 737 Max Case</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing and the Justice Department are reportedly close to a deal that would allow the aerospace company to avoid a guilty plea or trial related to the two deadly 737 Max crashes. This development follows a previous agreement where Boeing was to plead guilty to defrauding the government, which a judge rejected over diversity, equity, and inclusion concerns. The fraud charges stem from Boeing's alleged misleading of regulators about the flight-control system implicated in the crashes, marking a significant chapter in the ongoing legal saga surrounding the 737 Max.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation following an Instagram post featuring seashells arranged to read '8647,' which some interpreted as a threat against President Trump. Republicans, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have called for consequences, while Comey claims he was unaware of any violent connotations and removed the post. The Secret Service is taking the matter seriously, and Trump himself has condemned the post as a call for assassination, highlighting the ongoing tension between Comey and the Trump administration. The article also notes the history of the term '86' in political contexts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill has encountered a setback as conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee due to concerns that it does not sufficiently cut federal spending. Five Republicans opposed the legislation, demanding earlier implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Despite the impasse, House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to bringing the bill to a floor vote before Memorial Day, while negotiations continue to address the concerns of both conservative and blue-state Republicans, who are seeking changes to the cap on state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are considering abandoning a deal in which Boeing would plead guilty to a felony charge related to the 737 Max crashes, opting instead for a non-prosecution agreement. Lawyers for the victims' families expressed outrage, calling it a 'backroom deal' that allows the wealthy to avoid accountability. Under the proposed agreement, Boeing would pay $445 million to a victims' fund, invest in compliance, and be overseen by an independent consultant. The Justice Department believes this approach is the best course of action, considering the risks of going to trial.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy have signed coach Greg Vanney to a multiyear contract extension, despite the team's franchise-record winless start to the season. The team also announced additional moves, such as hiring Ravi Ramineni as director of quantitative analysis, promoting former midfielder Juninho to the newly created position of special advisor to the general manager, and promoting Zack Murshedi to director of team administration and player care. Despite the current struggles, the Galaxy remain confident in Vanney's leadership, citing his success in leading the team to their sixth MLS title last season.</p>

          <p>Despite initial market struggles in early 2025, triggered by concerns over tariffs and a cooling artificial intelligence trade, the S&P 500 has rebounded and turned positive for the year. This recovery follows a multiweek rally that was spurred by easing U.S.-China trade tensions and business deals announced during President Trump's Middle East tour. Several stocks, including Meta Platforms, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, and Nvidia, have mirrored the S&P 500's trajectory, erasing their losses and achieving positive year-to-date gains (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A vote on the megabill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee Friday afternoon amid objections from hard-liners, halting the bill's progress at the committee. Republican Reps. Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman and Chip Roy all voted against clearing the bill out of committee -- defying Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson. The group complained, in part, that the bulk of savings in the legislation don't take effect until after Trump leaves office. House Republican leaders will now continue to negotiate with holdouts behind closed doors, and the Budget Committee will reconvene on Monday.</p>
