          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball, has died at the age of 89, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. Nagashima was renowned for his stellar performances during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly as a key player for the Yomiuri Giants. His partnership with teammate Sadaharu Oh, known as "O-N," made them household names, fondly remembered by many older Japanese citizens as symbols of that era. Nagashima's charisma extended beyond sports, making him a cultural icon in Japan.</p>

          <p>French authorities are investigating a potential terrorist motive after a man fatally shot his Tunisian neighbor and injured a Turkish man in Puget-sur-Argens. The suspect, a Frenchman born in 1971, had posted racist videos before and after the shooting, according to prosecutors. The incident follows a previous stabbing of a Malian man in a mosque, raising concerns about hate crimes against Muslims in France.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly presented a proposal to Iran that would allow the country to continue limited low-level uranium enrichment for an unspecified period. According to Axios, the proposal includes restrictions such as halting the construction of new enrichment facilities, dismantling infrastructure for uranium conversion, and ceasing research and development on nuclear centrifuges. In return, Iran would be allowed to develop domestic enrichment capabilities for civilian purposes and participate in a regional enrichment consortium, and it would also be required to reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% and shut down all underground enrichment facilities. The White House insists the terms are tough and would prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating approximately a dozen advertising groups and watchdogs, suspecting them of violating antitrust laws by allegedly coordinating boycotts among advertisers. The investigation centers on whether these groups colluded to pressure advertisers into ceasing business with certain platforms or entities. The FTC is examining if the coordinated actions constitute an illegal restraint of trade, potentially harming competition in the advertising market.

          <p>Analysts are comparing the success of Pop Mart, the company behind the collectible character Labubu, to that of Sanrio and its Hello Kitty property. Labubu, a popular plush clip-on charm, has attracted high-profile fans and surged Pop Mart's shares in Hong Kong. The character's international sales have increased significantly, leading to investor interest. Some experts believe Labubu's popularity opens doors for other Chinese brands to succeed by tapping into universal emotions through design and marketing.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging Congress to pass his tax bill before the Fourth of July holiday, while also addressing concerns about potential cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He dismissed arguments from Democrats about changes to these programs as misinformation, and he warned of "economic ruination" if courts rule against his tariffs. The legislation currently includes deep cuts to Medicaid and other entitlement programs, causing uncertainty for many Americans.</p>

          <p>FEMA staff were reportedly confused after the acting head of the agency, David Richardson, stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season. The comment, made at a daily operational briefing, has raised concerns about Richardson's preparedness to lead the agency during the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season, which officially began on June 1 and is predicted to be above average. Some employees are offended by the comment, which was delivered in poor taste, offending agency staff already suffering from low morale amid a flurry of resignations, firings, leadership overhauls and polygraph tests distributed to staffers.</p>

          <p>The head of FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly told staff he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, causing confusion and concern within the agency. While a spokesperson said the comment was a joke, it has sparked worries about Richardson's familiarity with FEMA's operations, particularly given forecasts for an above-normal hurricane season. Richardson's comments come amid widespread concern that the departures of a raft of top Fema officials, staff cuts and reductions in hurricane preparations will leave the agency ill-prepared for a storm season forecast to be above normal.</p>

          <p>After 47 years, police in San Jose have confirmed that the 1978 killing of high school teacher Diane Peterson was committed by a student, Harry "Nicky" Nickerson, who admitted to the crime shortly after it occurred. The case remained unsolved for decades, despite Nickerson being a person of interest, until a relative disclosed his confession earlier this year. Nickerson, who had a history of criminal activity and committed suicide in 1993, will never face trial, but authorities hope the resolution brings closure to the victim's loved ones and the community.</p>
