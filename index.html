          <p>A family in West Virginia has experienced a medical anomaly after four of their six daughters were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare brain condition. The diagnoses began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, exhibited unusual symptoms, leading to genetic testing and successful brain surgery. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also found to have the same condition, with some also having a tethered spinal cord. After a series of surgeries, the family reports that the girls are now active, happy, and enjoying a new sense of normalcy, a significant relief after a challenging and uncertain period.</p>

          <p>Michael Henry, the Republican candidate for New York Attorney General, has criticized incumbent Letitia James for her strong endorsement of socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. In an interview, Henry argued that James's association with Mamdani, whom he described as an anti-semite and a communist, demonstrates her "horrible judgment" and places New Yorkers in jeopardy. He asserted that James is out of touch and more focused on targeting political opponents like Donald Trump than addressing the concerns of New York families. James has publicly supported Mamdani, calling him the leader the city needs.</p>

          <p>Authorities have discovered and dismantled the first known illegal factory producing weight loss drugs in the United Kingdom, located in Northampton. The operation resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medications by a law enforcement agency globally. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confiscated tens of thousands of empty pens ready for filling, raw ingredients, and over 2,000 unlicensed Retatrutide and Tirzepatide pens. Officials warned the public that these unauthorized products are untested and potentially deadly, urging consumers to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies to avoid serious health risks.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reportedly planning to issue new dietary guidance that encourages Americans to consume more saturated fats, a move that contradicts decades of established health recommendations. This potential policy shift has alarmed nutrition experts and medical professionals, including members of the American Heart Association. While some research suggests saturated fats may be more neutral than previously thought, experts argue that promoting increased consumption is the wrong message. They warn that such a change could have adverse effects on public health, particularly on cholesterol levels and heart disease risk, and would directly impact school lunch programs.</p>

          <p>Erie, Pennsylvania, a key swing county, is experiencing economic whiplash and division due to the policies of the Trump administration. A major $300 million plastic-to-fuel plant project was canceled after a crucial Department of Energy loan was put on hold by a Trump executive order, representing a significant blow to local job creation hopes. Additionally, federal funding cuts have impacted the local food bank, while trade tariffs have created new uncertainties for businesses, including local farmers. Despite these challenges, many Trump supporters in the area remain loyal, attributing economic hardships to other factors and expressing faith in his long-term strategy.</p>

The author humorously notes that the constant listing of side effects for drugs treating conditions such as plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease can make a viewer feel symptomatic themselves. Citing data on the millions spent by drug companies on sports programming, the article consults a medical expert who explains that these ads target a captive, often older, audience. The piece concludes by reflecting on how direct-to-consumer advertising is a form of persuasion that can unduly influence both patients and doctors.</p>

Fluor's 39% holding in the small modular nuclear reactor company represents over half of its market capitalization, yet its core business is valued at a steep discount compared to its peers. Starboard is urging Fluor's management to monetize the NuScale stake, suggesting options like a tax-free spinoff or selling the position to fund a share buyback.

Critics argue the report's conclusions are premature, based on a very small number of incidents, and highlight the subjective nature of classifying and coding domestic terrorism.

The decision was made after non-lethal methods, such as hazing, failed to deter the pack from preying on cattle, a habit officials feared would be passed to younger generations. While conservationists celebrate the return of wolves to California for their ecological benefits, the incident highlights the ongoing conflict between rebounding predator populations and the state's ranching communities.</p>

          <h2>Residents in Rural Southern States Brace for Impact of Forthcoming Medicaid Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Low-income residents in rural Southern communities, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi, are facing anxiety over significant cuts to Medicaid included in a recent law signed by President Trump. The legislation will impose new work reporting requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which researchers estimate could cause hundreds of thousands in Louisiana to lose coverage. For areas like East Carroll Parish, where Medicaid expansion has been a crucial lifeline, the cuts threaten to reverse gains in health coverage and exacerbate existing economic struggles. Health providers and state officials are preparing for the financial strain and the bureaucratic burden of implementing the new rules.</p>

A second truce, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, is currently holding. The negotiations aim to establish mechanisms to ensure stability, with Afghanistan focused on territorial integrity and Pakistan seeking to address what it calls "the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil."</p>

The trip includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where high-stakes trade negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping are also scheduled. Trump's potential meeting with Kim would be their first since 2019, following a series of historic but ultimately inconclusive summits during his first term.

          <p>Researchers in Indonesia's Tanjung Puting National Park have captured the first-ever footage of a female Bornean clouded leopard with two cubs. The rare sighting, recorded by a trail camera, is a significant event for conservationists as the species is threatened and has a low reproduction rate. Bornean clouded leopards require undisturbed rainforest habitats, which are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation. The presence of a breeding female successfully raising two offspring indicates that the park's protection efforts are providing a safe environment for this elusive and vulnerable species to thrive, offering a hopeful sign for its survival.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent military actions against Venezuela, including strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats and authorizing CIA operations, represent a significant escalation that challenges the president's "America First" isolationist rhetoric. This hawkish policy is reportedly driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has successfully advocated for a tough stance against the Nicolás Maduro regime, which the U.S. has designated a "narco-terrorist" organization. Analysts suggest the strategy aims to provoke an internal collapse of the Maduro government and reassert U.S. influence in Latin America, reflecting a return to the principles of the Monroe Doctrine.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs report indicates that major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their export focus away from the United States and towards developing markets, particularly in Southeast Asia. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-U.S. markets have grown at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the U.S. have slightly declined. This diversification allows Chinese firms to leverage their cost advantages and build new supply chains in response to geopolitical tensions. The report also notes that China is moving up the value chain, producing higher-end goods which helps boost profit margins in these new markets. (not investment advice)</p>

This demonstrates how much he values them, making their removal an appropriate punishment for his conduct, which has been a persistent liability to the monarchy.

Despite numerous controversies, including past inflammatory comments and a Nazi-associated tattoo, Platner's backers see him as an ideal working-class messenger who can win over voters without compromising on left-wing social policies. The author contends this theory—that a populist economic message delivered by an authentic-seeming candidate can override voters' more moderate social views—is misguided. The article suggests that genuine ideological moderation, rather than just changing the messenger, is a more reliable path to winning elections in competitive states.</p>
