          <p>Trade data reveals a significant slump in U.S. exports across various ports following the implementation of Trump's trade tariffs, with the agricultural sector being particularly affected. Ports like Oregon and Tacoma have experienced substantial decreases in exports, impacting commodities such as soybeans and corn destined for countries like Japan and China. Simultaneously, U.S. imports continue to decline, leading to concerns about potential supply disruptions and lean retail inventories, as retailers urge consumers to buy sooner rather than later. The article notes that shipping companies are lowering their outlooks due to tariffs and geopolitical issues, as many customers move to a 'China plus one' strategy to diversify their manufacturing locations.

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released after being detained during a citizenship interview, asserts that President Trump will not silence him. Mahdawi, who led Columbia's protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a law allowing visa revocations for individuals posing "adverse foreign policy consequences." He disputes this rationale, emphasizing his advocacy for justice and peace and describing his detention as a betrayal of the Constitution. The article notes that Mahdawi is one of several student activists detained under similar grounds and that he plans to continue protesting, unafraid to share his voice.</p>

          <p>Brood XIV, a group of periodical cicadas, is poised to emerge from underground after 17 years, affecting ecosystems across large portions of the eastern US.

The emergence of these cicadas will provide a significant food source for various forest creatures, impacting bird populations and hunting patterns.

          <p>A newly declassified New York Times article reveals that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's movements in the U.S. The article highlights the administration's forceful criticism of media coverage that contradicted their claims and the subsequent criminal investigation into leaks, despite the declassification supporting the Times' reporting. The ACLU has requested a judge to order the Trump administration to bring back the Venezuelans for normal immigration hearings, citing evidence that some of the men sent there were likely not gang members.</p>

          <p>Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, now a mayoral candidate, is releasing a plan to address public safety concerns by removing more mentally ill individuals from the streets. The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, mandating outpatient treatment screenings, and increasing supportive housing units. Cuomo's proposals are similar to those of Mayor Adams and Gov. Hochul, focusing on those who pose a danger to themselves or others. The plan calls for $2.6 billion in capital funding over five years to build at least 600 additional units of supportive housing each year.</p>
