          <p>Russia has launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, using over 800 drones and missiles in a widespread attack. The barrage resulted in at least two fatalities, including a one-year-old child, and caused damage to a key government building in Kyiv for the first time. Ukrainian air defense successfully neutralized a significant number of the drones and missiles, but the sheer scale of the assault marks a major escalation in Russia's air campaign amid waning hopes for peace talks.</p>

          <p>Two years after a devastating season-ending Achilles injury just four plays into his New York Jets career, quarterback Aaron Rodgers is set to make his debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The opening game of the season pits him directly against the Jets, the team that recently released him. The article recounts the immense hype and subsequent disappointment of his brief tenure in New York, framing this Week 1 matchup as a dramatic opportunity for closure for both the player and his former team.</p>

          <p>The US Open tennis tournament has evolved from a premier sporting event into a cultural phenomenon akin to a music festival, prioritizing consumption and social media presence. This article critiques the "Coachella-fication" of the event, where expensive themed cocktails, celebrity appearances, and influencer marketing often overshadow the tennis itself. While the tournament's popularity and attendance are at an all-time high, this shift raises questions about its accessibility for traditional fans and the commercialization of the sport.</p>

          <p>London's transport network is experiencing significant disruption as London Underground staff, represented by the RMT union, have begun a five-day strike. The industrial action is centered on demands for a pay increase and a reduced 32-hour work week to address fatigue management. Transport for London has offered a 3.4% pay rise but deemed the reduced hours unaffordable, leading to limited or no service on the Tube until the end of the week.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a prime suspect in a series of 2003 bombings in California linked to animal rights extremism, is facing an extradition hearing in London. After evading capture for 21 years and being on the FBI's most wanted list with a $250,000 bounty, he was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in Wales. Former FBI agents reflect on what they describe as "missed opportunities" to arrest him before he vanished following a high-speed chase in 2003.</p>
