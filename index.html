          <p>Carlos Alcaraz has won his second US Open title and sixth career Grand Slam after defeating rival Jannik Sinner in a four-set final in New York. The victory allows the 22-year-old Spaniard to reclaim the world number one ranking from Sinner. The match, which was delayed due to security measures for President Trump's attendance, saw Alcaraz leverage a superior serving performance to overcome the Italian champion. This win evens the Grand Slam tally between the two players for the 2025 season, with each having won two major tournaments.</p>

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is far from dead and is, in fact, flourishing in Asia. In an exclusive interview, he argues that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin notes that while the U.S. appears to be withdrawing, globalisation is becoming more regional and Asian-centric. He also cautions that the benefits of interconnectedness are accompanied by growing risks, such as pandemics, which are also manifestations of a globalized world.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the U.S. Open men's final, marking his first appearance at the event in a decade and creating a notable stir at Arthur Ashe Stadium. His presence prompted enhanced security measures, which led to long lines for spectators and a 30-minute delay to the start of the match. When shown on stadium screens, the president received a mixed reception from the crowd, with reports of both cheers and boos. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showcasing crowd disruptions related to his attendance.</p>

          <p>A California state bill aimed at establishing secure overnight parking programs for homeless community college students is unlikely to pass this legislative session after being held in the Senate Appropriations Committee. The proposed legislation, AB 90, sought to address the significant number of students living in their vehicles by providing designated safe lots with access to bathroom facilities. Despite data showing one in four community college students experiences homelessness, opposition from some college districts citing cost and feasibility concerns has jeopardized the bill's advancement.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that as Hong Kong shows clear signs of economic and social recovery, it must now act decisively to cement its unique international standing. The city's bustling tourism and packed convention centers, including a recent Bitcoin conference featuring Eric Trump, signal a return to its vibrant, capitalist identity. Despite skepticism following the implementation of the national security law, Hong Kong's stock market is booming, with IPO fundraising projected to be the highest in four years. The author contends the city is benefiting from its distinct position between China and the West.</p>

          <p>Much of coastal California is expected to experience a significant drop in temperature this week, with conditions falling 5 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of year. An upper-level low-pressure system is bringing a thick marine layer, fog, and the possibility of light showers to regions from the Bay Area to Los Angeles. This chilly weather is unusual for September, which is typically one of the warmest months for the coast. The cool-down follows a series of late-summer heat waves in Southern California and provides little relief for Bay Area residents who endured their coldest summer in decades.</p>

          <p>The Formula 1 title fight between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri remained respectful during the Italian Grand Prix, even after a controversial team decision. A slow pit stop for Norris caused him to fall behind Piastri, but the team ordered the positions to be swapped back to reflect their on-track merit, citing fairness and pre-established racing principles. Although Piastri initially questioned the call, he complied, and both drivers later publicly supported the decision. The incident highlights team principal Andrea Stella's focus on a culture of fairness, which has been credited with the team's recent success.</p>

          <p>A major Russian aerial attack on Ukraine resulted in a strike on the main government building in Kyiv, a first for the conflict, according to the Ukrainian prime minister. The attack, which involved a record number of over 800 drones and missiles, killed at least four people across the country, including a mother and her baby in a residential building. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the barrage as a deliberate crime intended to prolong the war. The strike on the heavily defended government quarter represents a significant symbolic escalation by Russia.</p>

Responding to criticism from fellow Republican doctors about policies making vaccines harder to access, Marshall argued that not every person needs every vaccine and that parents and doctors should be empowered to make decisions. He reiterated his belief that the COVID-19 vaccine developed under Operation Warp Speed saved millions of lives but stated the context is different now due to widespread natural immunity.</p>

          <p>Leaders of major UK trade unions are warning the government against watering down its proposed Employment Rights Bill, a significant piece of legislation intended to ban zero-hours contracts and enhance protections against unfair dismissal. Unions fear that recent cabinet reshuffles, including the departure of Angela Rayner, have removed key champions of the bill, potentially leading to delays or amendments favorable to business interests. Unison's general secretary called any rollback a "huge mistake" that unions would "furiously" campaign against, demanding a clear timetable for the bill's full implementation.</p>

Alongside his brother Phillip Burton and Willie Brown, he was a key figure in a political machine that dominated San Francisco and state politics.

          <p>International postal traffic to the United States has dropped by more than 80% following the Trump administration's suspension of the "de minimis" trade exemption rule in late August. According to the Universal Postal Union, the change, which eliminated tariff exemptions for packages valued under $800, brought mail flow to a near halt. The administration defended the move as a necessary measure to combat counterfeit goods and illicit substances like fentanyl from entering the country. At least 88 postal operators have suspended some services to the U.S. pending a solution. (not investment advice)</p>

While Trump later told reporters he was not "going to war," the post has drawn sharp condemnation from Illinois leaders, who called the rhetoric authoritarian. The threats follow the recent deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., for similar enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that President Trump is dangerously escalating the failed "war on drugs" by turning a metaphor into a military reality. The piece criticizes a recent U.S. military strike that killed alleged drug traffickers from Venezuela, stating the administration provided no evidence for its claims and set a precedent for extrajudicial killings without oversight. The author contends that such actions are counterproductive, undermine international cooperation, and ignore the root causes of the drug crisis, such as domestic demand and the flow of U.S. arms to cartels. This approach is described as a misguided love of macho spectacle.</p>
