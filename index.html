            <p>As the US and China engage in escalating trade tensions, an opinion piece suggests China should strategically require bilateral trade settlements in renminbi to challenge the US dollar's dominance. This move would significantly strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate, forcing the US to purchase large quantities of Chinese currency. The author contends this approach is more proactive than reciprocal tariffs, which appear to be emotional reactions from the Trump administration. Such a shift could also encourage global investors to reassess risks in the US and increase renminbi asset holdings, boosting capital inflows into China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia is attempting to create a false impression of adhering to an Easter ceasefire while continuing attacks. Despite President Putin's ceasefire declaration, Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and drone strikes. He suggested Putin might not have full control over his army or that Russia is merely seeking favorable PR coverage, reiterating Ukraine's offer to extend the truce. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Ukrainian forces launched attacks in the Donetsk region and sent drones into Russian territory, asserting Russian troops strictly observed the ceasefire.</p>

            <p>Christians in Nigeria face increasing violence from Islamist militants, raising fears of genocide, according to International Christian Concern (ICC). Recent attacks in Plateau State's Bokkos County resulted in numerous deaths and torched homes, with families burned alive. The ICC asserts this is a calculated effort by Fulanis to displace Christians from Nigeria's Middle Belt, leading to thousands of deaths and millions displaced since 2001. Bishop Ayuba Matawal believes extremists aim to seize land from Christian communities, continuing a historical legacy of spreading Islam across Nigeria.</p>

It urges the US to actively engage with developing countries to consolidate its technological foothold and prevent China from advancing its geopolitical and economic interests.

They argue these actions disregard lessons learned from past environmental crises, such as Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon, and urge for strong environmental regulations, scientific research, and adequate funding for protective agencies.</p>

Critics argue this represents an attempt to undermine higher education and democracy, echoing tactics of authoritarian regimes.

            <p>An analysis of Adolf Hitler's economic policies in the 1930s reveals that tariffs were a key component of his agenda, aiming to protect German workers and farmers from foreign competition. Despite concerns from his own foreign minister about sparking a trade war, Hitler implemented tariffs to liberate the German people from a globalized world order. While Germany's economy was recovering when Hitler took power, his tariff policies and challenges to international agreements caused alarm in the markets. The tariffs led to retaliatory measures from other countries and strained trade relations, serving as a prelude to his larger war efforts.</p>

            <p>An analysis suggests that Trump's trade war with China may strengthen China's geopolitical position and weaken the US economy. China's dominance in key industries makes the US heavily reliant on Chinese goods, while China has been preparing for economic conflict by reducing dependence on American imports. China's ability to inflict disproportionate harm on the US gives it an advantage, but the US could win by joining forces with allies to collectively cut off China. However, Trump's actions have alienated allies, and voters may not tolerate the economic distress caused by the trade war.</p>

Despite Kaczynski's violent actions, his critique of technology has resonated with both the radical left and right, though he never showed remorse for his crimes.

            <p>A report indicates that more than 1 million abortions were performed in the US in 2024, with about 155,000 people crossing state lines to access the procedure, double the number from 2020. This highlights a deep geographical divide, with a few states becoming major hubs for abortion access. The report arrives amidst the Trump administration's dismantling of the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports, raising concerns about the ability to track public health outcomes. Experts warn that without tracking, it's impossible to assess the impact of policies and interventions.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has reached its lowest point amid discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey reveals that the post-reelection boost in economic optimism has vanished, with more Americans expecting the economy to worsen. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are increasingly negative, and blue-collar workers' disapproval has risen. Tariffs are a significant source of public discontent, with majorities believing they harm American workers, fuel inflation, and damage the overall economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An analysis questions the sincerity of Putin's Easter truce in Ukraine, suggesting it may be a PR move to maintain good relations with the Trump White House. While Russia claims the truce is for humanitarian reasons, Ukraine reports continued attacks. The brief ceasefire was declared at short notice, giving little time for either side to prepare. Russia is already blaming Ukraine for ceasefire violations, suggesting the truce is more about shifting blame than genuine peace efforts.</p>
