          <p>Warren Buffett outlines his three categories of investments: currency-denominated assets, non-productive assets like gold, and productive assets such as farms or businesses. He argues that gold is a speculative bet on future fear, as it produces nothing and its value depends solely on someone else paying more for it later. Buffett emphasizes his preference for investing in productive assets that generate tangible returns over time, making their intrinsic value the key metric for success rather than short-term market fluctuations.

          <p>Former Alabama coach Nick Saban expressed shock and disappointment over comments made by his former quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, who publicly criticized his Miami Dolphins teammates after a recent loss. Saban stated that a core principle he teaches is to never criticize teammates publicly, emphasizing that leaders should take responsibility for what they can control. Although critical of the initial remarks, Saban commended Tagovailoa for later taking accountability and publicly apologizing for his mistake, viewing it as a valuable learning opportunity for the young quarterback.</p>

          <p>Zions Bancorporation experienced a significant drop in its stock value after disclosing $60 million in loans that are unlikely to be repaid, sparking wider fears about the regional banking sector. The bank's subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, has filed a lawsuit alleging that borrowers manipulated loan structures and eliminated the bank's collateral protections for their own enrichment. This revelation emerged after a related fund was sued for fraud by another bank, prompting Zions to investigate and subsequently charge off a large portion of the loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing movement in cities across the globe is reallocating street space from cars to bicycles, creating cleaner, quieter, and more sustainable urban areas. By implementing protected bike lanes, safer intersections, and cyclist-specific traffic signals, cities like New York, London, and Ghent are making cycling a safer and more appealing option for daily commutes. This shift not only reduces carbon emissions and noise pollution but also offers significant health benefits and cost savings for residents, despite facing some cultural resistance from car-centric communities.</p>

          <p>Players from Spanish football clubs Oviedo and Espanyol staged a 15-second on-field protest by refusing to move at the start of their match. The demonstration was a coordinated effort by the Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) to oppose La Liga's decision to host a regular season game between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami. The AFE and several club figures, including Real Madrid's coach, argue the move lacks transparency, distorts the competition, and was made without proper consultation with the players, who are central to the sport.</p>

          <p>A significant number of Gen Z women in the United States are identifying as 'leftist' rather than 'liberal,' signaling a generational shift toward more anti-capitalist and socially active political stances. This trend, not mirrored by their male counterparts, is driven by a feeling that the Democratic party is too centrist and that pressing issues like reproductive rights, economic inequality, and climate change require more radical solutions. These young women, who came of age amidst political and economic instability, view politics as a matter of self-defense rather than negotiation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has described the Russian idea of a rail tunnel under the Bering Strait connecting to the U.S. as "interesting." The concept was floated by Russia's investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, who claimed a feasibility study began six months ago and suggested the project could be named the "Putin-Trump Tunnel." When asked about the proposal during a press conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was present, stated he was "not happy with this idea," which drew laughter from the U.S. delegation.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that it no longer considers itself bound by the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, as the agreement officially expired. The deal, which capped Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, has been in jeopardy since the U.S. withdrew in 2018. Despite the declaration, Tehran stated its commitment to diplomacy, even as European powers recently triggered a mechanism to reimpose international sanctions due to what they termed Iran's significant violations of the agreement.</p>

          <p>The first Twenty20 international match between England and New Zealand in Christchurch was washed out by rain, but not before all-rounder Sam Curran played a crucial role with the bat. England struggled on a difficult pitch, slumping to 81-5 before Curran's unbeaten 49 from 35 balls helped them post a competitive total of 153-6. However, persistent rain prevented New Zealand from beginning their chase, leading to a frustrating no-result start to the white-ball series, which serves as preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup.</p>
