          <p>A builder named Mark Killick has been found guilty of defrauding 37 victims out of more than £1.25 million across the West of England. Operating under various aliases, Killick took large deposits for building work that he often left unfinished, instead spending the money on luxury goods like a £25,000 Rolex. This marks his fourth conviction for fraud since 2008, with authorities describing him as one of the most prolific rogue traders they have ever dealt with. Killick is scheduled for sentencing in December and has been told to expect a lengthy prison term.</p>

          <p>China is updating its 2016 Cybersecurity Law to incorporate regulations for artificial intelligence, focusing on safety, ethics, and the protection of personal information. The amendments, which have undergone a first review, aim to establish a guiding principle for internet safety that addresses new challenges posed by emerging technologies. The updated framework will also include provisions to support basic AI theory research and the development of key technologies. This move signals Beijing's intent to create a structured legal environment for the rapidly evolving AI sector.</p>

          <p>A second night of disorder outside a Dublin hotel housing asylum seekers has resulted in 24 arrests and injuries to three police officers. The unrest, which saw stones and fireworks thrown at police, followed a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault of a young girl in the area. Authorities stated the violence was planned online and involved "violent thugs" inciting fear, a stark contrast to the peaceful demonstrators. The incident has heightened tensions, with officials vowing a robust response to any further disorder at the site.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has maintained a conspicuous silence after U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly changed his tone on Russia, criticizing President Vladimir Putin and imposing sanctions on two major Russian oil companies. Trump expressed frustration that his conversations with Putin "don't go anywhere" and canceled a planned meeting, a sharp reversal from his previously more conciliatory stance. This policy shift appears to have caught Moscow off guard, with pro-Kremlin media largely ignoring the president's critical remarks. The move suggests a growing impatience in Washington over the lack of progress in Ukraine peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Four survivors have withdrawn from a UK government inquiry into child sexual exploitation by grooming gangs, stating they will only rejoin if Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips resigns. They accuse Phillips of publicly dismissing their concerns about the inquiry's direction as "misinformation," which they described as a betrayal that destroyed their trust. The inquiry has been beset by turmoil, with the two leading candidates for its chair also withdrawing amid what one called a "toxic environment." The government has stated that Phillips will remain in her post, deepening the crisis surrounding the high-profile investigation.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, for the first time targeting the country's lucrative gas sector with a ban on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. This move coincided with new U.S. sanctions against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, a policy shift by the Trump administration that EU officials welcomed as a "signal of strength." The coordinated pressure from both sides of the Atlantic is designed to cripple Russia's war economy by cutting off its primary revenue sources.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in a significant policy shift aimed at forcing Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.

While the immediate economic impact may be limited, the sanctions represent a major change in U.S. strategy, which had previously avoided targeting Russia's energy sector directly.

A proposed new "maritime doctrine," which would involve intercepting boats and returning them to shore, is now viewed by some insiders as a "political stunt" unlikely to be implemented. The shift is attributed partly to political turmoil in France and persistent legal and safety concerns about the dangers of at-sea interventions.

The author, despite having a non-technical background, teamed up with others to build a "digital time capsule" app, highlighting how AI has lowered the barrier to entry for software development. The key takeaway is that product sense and creativity are becoming as important as traditional engineering skills in this new landscape.</p>

          <p>The semi-truck driver arrested for a fatal multi-vehicle crash on a Southern California freeway has been identified by the Department of Homeland Security as an Indian national who is in the U.S. illegally. The 21-year-old man was arrested for DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter after the eight-vehicle collision left three people dead. According to DHS, he entered the country via the U.S.-Mexico border in 2022. The case has drawn attention to issues surrounding the issuance of commercial driver's licenses, with Florida recently suing California for allegedly failing to comply with federal requirements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovakia, the world's leading car producer per capita, is facing a confluence of threats to its dominant automotive industry, which accounts for about 11% of its GDP. The sector is uniquely exposed to potential U.S. tariffs, growing competition from Chinese EV manufacturers, and a less favorable domestic business environment due to new taxes. Furthermore, the current government's pro-Russian stance has created geopolitical uncertainty, potentially deterring investment from Western partners. These challenges are raising concerns about the long-term stability of an industry that has been a cornerstone of the Slovakian economy for decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A metal detectorist in North Wales has discovered what could be the largest hoard of Roman coins ever found in the country, potentially numbering up to 15,000. David Moss found two large clay pots filled with the coins in an "untouched" area he had been exploring. After spending six hours excavating the find, he slept in his car for three days to protect the treasure before delivering it to experts at the National Museum Cardiff. The coins are now being analyzed, and if confirmed as treasure, the value will be shared between the finder and the landowner.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its campaign against alleged drug traffickers by conducting its first-ever strikes on vessels in the Pacific Ocean, killing five people in two separate incidents. These attacks mark a geographic expansion of a controversial new policy that previously saw strikes confined to the Caribbean Sea, bringing the total killed in such operations to 37. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the strikes, calling the targets "narco-terrorists" and vowing the attacks would continue. The unprecedented use of lethal military force against suspected smugglers, rather than law enforcement interdiction, continues to raise legal and diplomatic questions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown is set to continue after the Senate failed to advance a Republican-backed funding bill. The ongoing stalemate reflects the deep partisan divisions that have prevented a compromise on government spending and other contentious issues. The legislative failure was accompanied by a marathon 22-hour speech from a Democratic senator, highlighting the high tensions and procedural tactics being employed. As the shutdown extends, hundreds of thousands of federal workers remain furloughed and numerous government services are suspended, increasing pressure on lawmakers to find a resolution.</p>

          <p>Over 100 firefighters responded to a major hazardous materials fire at a General Motors design studio in Pasadena, California. The four-alarm blaze involved burning lithium-ion batteries and concept cars, creating a challenging situation for fire crews as water cannot be used on such fires. The thick smoke and hazardous materials complicated efforts, and at one point a firefighter became trapped inside the building but was rescued without injury. The incident, one of the largest structure fires in the city's recent history, highlights the dangers associated with large-scale lithium-ion battery storage and technology development.</p>
