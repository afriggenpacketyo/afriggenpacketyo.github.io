          <p>Many newspapers are leading with Angela Rayner's stamp duty admission, with headlines varying from calling for her to be sacked to questioning Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. The Daily Mirror focuses on Virginia Giuffre's family seeking the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, while The Guardian highlights the Metropolitan Police's stance on policing culture war debates. The Times reports on potential changes to university tuition fees based on performance, and The Financial Times discusses AI-assisted robot collaboration. Finally, the Daily Mail mentions new scanners that can predict avocado ripeness, aiming to reduce food waste. The article gives a summary of all of these news stories in one place.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose following a tech rally on Wall Street, although economic concerns weighed on equities. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both saw gains, driven by factors like household spending increases in Australia. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 retreated amidst volatile trading. Global bond markets remained in focus as U.S. Treasury yields nudged above 5%, while Japan's bond yield reached a record high due to inflation and political uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that climate change has significantly intensified wildfires in Spain and Portugal, making the conditions 40 times more frequent and 30% more intense. The fires, which scorched vast areas and resulted in multiple deaths and evacuations, were exacerbated by rising temperatures and drought. The analysis highlights the urgent need to shift away from fossil fuels to mitigate the increasing risk of such extreme weather events. The report also stresses the importance of forest management and prevention measures to reduce the impact of wildfires.</p>

Trump expressed both realism and optimism, stating that progress is being made, but the situation remains challenging. He highlighted his approach of bringing key leaders together to broker agreements in real time and credited his administration with ending several other conflicts. Trump also dismissed the need for the Nobel Peace Prize, stating his focus is on saving lives.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court decision that deemed many of his tariffs illegal. The administration argues that the president has the authority to impose such import taxes on foreign nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The case could significantly impact Trump's economic policies and potentially require the U.S. to refund billions in tariffs. Lawyers challenging the tariffs express confidence in their case, emphasizing the harm inflicted on small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Texas bill allowing residents to sue out-of-state abortion pill providers has reached the governor's desk. The measure would allow Texas residents to sue those who manufacture, transport, or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas, with potential penalties up to $100,000. Supporters say it's a key tool to enforce the state's abortion ban, while opponents see it as an effort to intimidate providers and encourage vigilantism. The bill is expected to face legal challenges from abortion rights supporters.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University was illegal. The judge agreed with Harvard's arguments that the administration imposed the freeze in retaliation for the university's refusal to capitulate to demands that violated First Amendment protections. The ruling vacates freezing orders affecting Harvard and bars anyone in the Trump administration from enforcing those orders. The White House said it would appeal the decision.</p>
