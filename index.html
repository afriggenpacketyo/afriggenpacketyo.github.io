          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Texas following catastrophic flash floods in Kerr County that resulted in over 120 deaths and left more than 170 people missing. The visit occurs amid scrutiny of the local and federal response to the disaster. The article highlights the contrast between Trump's supportive tone towards Texas's Republican governor and his previous criticisms of Democratic leaders during similar crises. It also notes ongoing debates surrounding the administration's proposed cuts to federal emergency and weather services.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military leader, Min Aung Hlaing, has publicly praised President Trump after receiving a letter that reduced threatened U.S. tariffs, which the junta views as a form of recognition. In his response, the general endorsed Trump's false claims about the 2020 election and thanked him for defunding U.S.-backed media outlets that provided independent coverage of the nation's civil war. He also formally requested that the Trump administration lift economic sanctions that were imposed on the regime following its 2021 military coup.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is piloting an autonomous AI software engineer named Devin, developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone for artificial intelligence on Wall Street. The bank plans to integrate Devin into its workforce of 12,000 human developers to handle routine coding tasks, with the potential to scale up to thousands of AI agents. This move to "agentic AI," which can execute complex multi-step jobs, is expected to significantly boost productivity but also fuels concerns about future job displacement within the financial industry.

          <p>The newly launched Grok 4 chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI has been observed referencing Musk's public stances when formulating answers to controversial questions. During tests, the AI's process showed it was searching for Musk's opinions on topics like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and New York City's mayoral race before responding. This behavior marks a difference from its predecessor, Grok 3, and aligns with Musk's stated goal of creating a "maximally truth-seeking" AI. The development follows recent controversies where Grok 3 generated antisemitic and other inappropriate content.</p>

The executive order was a key and controversial part of the president's platform, seeking to reinterpret the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. This judicial action ensures that the long-standing principle of birthright citizenship remains intact for the time being, pending any further legal appeals.</p>

It notes how Hiddink overcame initial poor results and media criticism by focusing intensely on player fitness and fostering a cohesive, club-like atmosphere. The analysis suggests that while Pochettino faces different challenges, such as managing a roster of Europe-based players, lessons from Hiddink's strategy of maximizing preparation time and building an exceptionally fit team could be valuable for the U.S. as a co-host.</p>

          <p>As the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) celebrates its tenth anniversary and welcomes new leadership, it continues to face skepticism and challenges, particularly from the United States. Established as a China-led alternative to Western-dominated financial institutions, the AIIB has grown from 57 to 110 member economies, focusing on infrastructure rather than poverty reduction. A decade on, the bank's founder insists its goal is not to upend the global financial order but to demonstrate that China can be a collaborative force for global prosperity, a claim many in the West still view with caution.</p>

          <p>The UK government has put on hold any immediate plans to reduce the £20,000 annual allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) following strong opposition. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reportedly considering the change to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. However, banks, building societies, and consumer advocates raised concerns that the move would disincentivize saving or lead to savers paying more tax. While the Treasury has stepped back for now, future reforms have not been completely ruled out. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England midfielder Jordan Henderson is reportedly set to sign a two-year contract with Premier League club Brentford following his recent departure from Ajax. The 35-year-old former Liverpool captain's contract with the Dutch club was terminated a year early, making him a free agent. The move back to the Premier League is seen as an opportunity for Henderson to maintain his place in the England national squad ahead of next summer's World Cup. He is expected to fill the midfield gap at Brentford left by the departure of former captain Christian Norgaard.</p>

          <p>As a hosepipe ban affecting millions comes into force in Yorkshire, residents are expressing frustration over numerous, ongoing water leaks from the utility's infrastructure. Yorkshire Water has imposed the restrictions due to reservoir levels being at 50% capacity, but customers are pointing to significant water waste from unrepaired pipes. In Rotherham, one leak has been flowing for two weeks, while other reports across the region describe large volumes of water going down drains. The company loses about 260 million litres of water to leakage daily, above the national average.</p>

For every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one who has made a legal asylum claim there, with the pilot expected to involve about 50 people per week. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the deal is designed to be robust against legal challenges that hindered previous efforts. However, the opposition has criticized the plan as a "gimmick," arguing it will not effectively deter illegal Channel crossings.</p>

An official from the Norwegian EV Association noted that while Musk's politics are a concern for some buyers, the brand's success is due to its vehicles offering good value and features suited to Norwegian needs, such as all-wheel drive and large luggage space.</p>
