          <p>The Trump administration has significantly increased federal control over Washington D.C. by appointing the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, as the city's "emergency police commissioner." This directive, issued by Attorney General Pam Bondi, grants Cole the full powers of the police chief, requiring the Metropolitan Police Department to seek his approval for all orders. The move follows disagreements over the city's "sanctuary" policies and represents a major assertion of federal authority over local governance, justified by the administration as a necessary response to crime.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington D.C. that limited cooperation between city police and federal immigration agents. This action effectively ends the capital's "sanctuary city" policies, allowing for full collaboration with agencies like ICE.

          <p>China's economy showed signs of slowing in July, with key data points failing to meet analysts' expectations amid weak domestic demand. Retail sales rose by 3.7%, missing the forecast of 4.6%, while industrial output grew by 5.7%, also below projections. This slowdown follows a strong first half of the year, raising concerns among economists about achieving the annual growth target of 5% and prompting calls for new policy support.

This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent by the military government, which seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021 and has since aligned with Russia over Western partners.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding forecasts despite facing new U.S. tariffs. The growth was largely driven by resilient exports, which offset some of the headwinds from the trade environment. However, economists remain cautious, predicting a potential slowdown in the coming quarters as investment spending may soften and the full impact of tariffs on key sectors like auto exports is felt.

          <p>As the summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump approaches, this analysis suggests the Russian president will act as a master negotiator, aiming to exploit his deep knowledge of the conflict's details against Trump's relative lack thereof. Putin's strategy will likely involve playing to Trump's desire for a quick resolution and public credit, potentially offering superficial concessions like a meeting with President Zelenskyy. The article posits that Putin will frame a deal on Russia's terms as the fastest path to peace, while also appealing to Trump's transactional nature with potential economic incentives.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state to move to in 2025, a drop from its previous ranking as seventh worst. The state received low scores for affordability, safety, economic strength, education, and healthcare access. The report also highlighted Oregon's vulnerability to environmental risks like wildfires and drought as a significant challenge for attracting and retaining residents, placing it just above California, Louisiana, and New Mexico at the bottom of the list.</p>

          <p>Police in Serbia fired tear gas at anti-government protesters in Belgrade and Novi Sad, marking an escalation in demonstrations that have been ongoing since late 2024. In Novi Sad, protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling party, leading to clashes and arrests. The student-led protests, initially sparked by a deadly building collapse blamed on corruption, now demand an early election from President Aleksandar Vucic's increasingly authoritarian government.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, alleging that the company has failed to implement adequate safety measures, creating an environment where sexual predators can victimize children.

This legal action follows similar complaints and lawsuits against the popular platform, which has over 111 million monthly users, for not doing enough to protect its young user base.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years, and few view this trend positively. The survey revealed differing perspectives on the purpose of tipping, with some seeing it as a way to show appreciation or supplement wages, while others view it as an additional mandatory cost. This sentiment aligns with broader public concern over rising prices and costs, suggesting that increased tipping pressure is contributing to financial strain for many consumers.</p>

          <p>The UK government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the risks associated with traveling overseas for cosmetic procedures. This campaign addresses growing concerns over "medical tourism," where Britons seek cheaper treatments like dental work or hair implants abroad, sometimes with dangerous consequences. The influencers will advise viewers to consult a UK doctor, purchase proper travel insurance, and be wary of package deals that include surgery, aiming to prevent botched procedures and the subsequent burden on the NHS.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously pivoting to an entirely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had championed the vegan menu as an ethical and creative imperative, cited a desire for inclusion and business realities for the reversal. The restaurant experienced a decline in private event bookings and wine sales, suggesting that diners, particularly in the luxury market, were less interested in a high-end dining experience without meat, fish, or other animal products.</p>

          <p>This in-depth article from the BBC explores the profound societal divisions in Israel nearly two years into the war in Gaza, arguing that the national unity predicted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not materialized. The analysis highlights the chasm between a secular population increasingly calling for an end to the war to secure the return of hostages, and a religious nationalist right-wing that sees the conflict as a divine opportunity. It also notes that opinion polls show most Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering, a view shaped by trauma and media coverage.</p>

For Trump, the goal appears to be fulfilling his campaign promise of being a global peacemaker, though his vacillating statements have made his precise aims unclear, creating uncertainty for Ukraine and its European allies.</p>
