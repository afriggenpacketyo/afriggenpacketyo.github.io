          <p>A record 7.3 million Canadians cast their ballots early, marking a 25% increase from the 2021 election, according to Elections Canada. The high turnout comes as federal leaders enter the final stretch of campaigning before the 28 April election. Voters are weighing their options amid trade tensions with the U.S. and comments from President Trump about potentially annexing Canada. Latest polling data indicates the Liberals hold a slight lead over the Conservatives, with both leaders actively campaigning across the country.</p>

          <p>Tesla's CFO Vaibhav Taneja stated that the company is carefully considering entering the Indian market, acknowledging its potential due to a large middle class, but also noting the challenges posed by high import tariffs and luxury taxes. India has proposed a policy to reduce EV tariffs for companies that localize manufacturing, but Tesla is likely to push for further reforms. The potential for increased tariffs on India from the U.S. could further complicate negotiations, as Tesla faces falling sales and seeks new markets. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss potential collaboration.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is grappling with a challenging outlook due to the escalating US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. With exports to the US facing higher tariffs, producers are expected to cut capital expenditure, potentially slowing the expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). The sector is also dealing with overproduction and cutthroat price rivalry, causing export prices to decline significantly. BESS devices are crucial for storing renewable energy, with China and the US accounting for a large portion of installed capacity.</p>

          <p>As Tesla's profits plunge 71%, CEO Elon Musk says he'll spend less time working for the federal government — but that he has no plans to stop his work with DOGE entirely. Tesla's quarterly earnings report, released about an hour before the call, showed that the company's net income plunged by 71% year-over-year and that revenue from selling cars dropped by 20%. Analysts had been expecting bad news: They already knew Tesla's deliveries in the first quarter of 2025 were down 13% from a year ago .</p>

The jury in Maricopa County, Arizona, was handed the case Monday afternoon before reaching a verdict Tuesday afternoon. She had pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Prosecutors, meanwhile, said the shooting was a ploy for Daybell to get rid of her estranged husband so she could get his $1 million life insurance policy and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, whom she married four months after the shooting.</p>

It’s not a ban: Kennedy, who oversees the FDA, said in a press conference that he has reached an “understanding” with the food companies to phase out these dyes, although he provided scant details on the specifics. (An HHS spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.)The true test will be how Kennedy and his movement deals with much more pressing, and intractable, challenges in the American diet. Even without synthetic dyes in our foods, Americans will still overwhelmingly be eating ultra-processed foods loaded with excess sodium and sugar.</p>
