          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Modi has engaged with world leaders and diplomats, signaling a potential shift towards military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of involvement in the attack. Modi promised severe punishment for those responsible and the razing of terror safe havens. Security forces from both sides have exchanged small-arms fire across the border, and Indian forces have initiated a clampdown in Kashmir, arresting hundreds in search of the perpetrators, escalating tensions between the two nations and raising concerns about regional stability. Optimism in this area is low as a result.</p>

          <p>China is aggressively pursuing AI in agriculture to bolster food security amidst climate pressures and geopolitical tensions, as outlined in its new 10-year agricultural master plan. Facing declining food self-sufficiency rates, China aims to leverage AI to improve crop cultivation, livestock management, and agricultural infrastructure, with focus on reducing post-harvest food losses. This strategic move could strengthen China's agricultural technology and AI export sectors while addressing long-standing inefficiencies in food production, potentially altering global agricultural trade dynamics.

          <p>A former Disney World menu production manager, Michael Scheuer, received a three-year prison sentence for hacking into the park's menu system after being fired. Scheuer removed peanut allergy information, added profanities, and altered pricing, although the changes never reached customers.
