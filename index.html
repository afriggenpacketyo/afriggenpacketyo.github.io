          <p>The Israeli military has initiated the call-up of tens of thousands of reservists to intensify and broaden its operations in Gaza, aiming to increase pressure on Hamas, secure the release of hostages, and dismantle the militant group's infrastructure. Critics have voiced concerns about the effectiveness of the ongoing military actions in securing hostage releases and have questioned Prime Minister Netanyahu's broader objectives in the conflict, especially regarding the lack of a post-war plan. Aid agencies have reported severe shortages of food, water, and medicine due to the blockade, which they describe as a policy of starvation. The article highlights the increasing pressure on reservists and the concerns of hostage families, who urge the government to prioritize a deal with Hamas to save lives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry due to incentives offered by other nations. Trump described this as a "National Security threat," arguing that foreign films involve messaging and propaganda. He stated his intention to bring movie production back to America, appointing film stars as special envoys to promote business opportunities in Hollywood. This decision follows previous trade disputes, including China's reduction of American films allowed into the country, and has raised concerns about potential economic repercussions and retaliatory measures from other nations.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's inconsistency with his sweeper pitch proved costly in the Dodgers' 4-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves, ending their seven-game winning streak. Two poorly executed sweepers to Austin Riley resulted in two two-run home runs, accounting for all of the Braves' runs against May. Despite an otherwise effective outing, May's struggles with his signature pitch have contributed to his recent regression, yielding 14 runs in his last three starts. The Dodgers' offense struggled to provide support, with Miguel Rojas's home run providing the only significant spark, highlighting the team's reliance on May to step up amidst injuries in the rotation.</p>

Trump indicated that his administration interprets the court's decision differently and suggested Abrego Garcia should not be allowed back into the country due to alleged gang affiliations.

          <p>Several stories are leading Monday's papers, the Daily Mail focuses its coverage on raids conducted by counter-terrorism police across England, which resulted in eight arrests as part of two separate investigations. The arrests, seven of which were of Iranian men, have led to renewed calls for the government to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. The EU has told British negotiators there can be no access to its crime and illegal migration databases as part of Britain's Brexit reset. The Guardian also leads with political news, focusing on comments from former transport secretary Louise Haigh, who it says has urged the prime minister to avoid a "simplistic and naive" lurch to the right in the wake of Reform UK's success in local elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for rejecting his offer to send U.S. troops into Mexico to combat drug cartels, attributing her decision to fear of the cartels. Trump stated that Sheinbaum is "so afraid of the cartels that she can’t even think straight," emphasizing the need to address the fentanyl crisis in the United States. This exchange highlights potential tensions between the two leaders, despite previous cooperation on immigration and trade, as Trump pushes for a more aggressive U.S. role in combating drug trafficking within Mexico.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how the Trump factor is shaping global politics, with recent elections in Canada and Australia showing voters punishing right-wing parties that borrowed from the MAGA playbook. In both countries, center-left parties saw their fortunes revived after initially appearing poised to lose power, with leaders campaigning on anti-Trump messages or benefiting from a perception of stability in the face of Trump's policies. However, the article notes that the Trump effect is more complex in other countries, such as Germany, and that Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain initially gained praise for his businesslike approach to the new American president.</p>

Police said the officer who shot Ryan stated that the suspect pointed a gun at him during the chase, but there was no indication that he fired at police before he was shot.</p>

The BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries, identifying the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Military experts estimate the number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.</p>

          <p>Nearly a million people in 17 states may lose healthcare coverage as Aetna's parent company, CVS, announced its withdrawal from the federal insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CVS cited the upcoming expiration of ACA tax credits and financial incentives, which would lead to higher premium costs, as a factor in the decision. While Aetna is not a major player in the ACA marketplace, its departure raises concerns about access to affordable healthcare for many individuals, although CVS stated it will continue offering other health benefit solutions.</p>
