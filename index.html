          <p>Sports broadcaster and cervical cancer survivor Erin Andrews is promoting a new campaign to encourage early cancer screenings after her own diagnosis in 2017 came as a shock despite having no symptoms. Andrews, who credits a routine check-up with saving her life, has partnered with Aflac for the "Check for Cancer" initiative to raise awareness and improve access to screenings. She emphasizes that early detection is crucial, especially as cancer rates are rising among younger Americans, and hopes the campaign will help instill proactive health habits in the public.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated his administration is considering the deployment of National Guard troops to cities like New Orleans, stating that Louisiana's Republican governor would welcome the federal support to address crime. This follows strenuous objections from Illinois' Democratic governor to a similar potential deployment in Chicago, highlighting a partisan divide on the use of federal forces for domestic law enforcement. Trump's comments come amid ongoing legal challenges to his authority to deploy troops domestically, with a recent federal court ruling against his administration's actions in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's young daughter, Kim Ju Ae, made her first known trip outside the country, accompanying her father to Beijing for a public event. This rare appearance has intensified speculation among analysts that she is being positioned as a potential successor, following a tradition of North Korean leaders introducing their heirs to Chinese officials. While her age and gender present challenges in the patriarchal society, her increasing presence at major state functions suggests she is being groomed for a significant future role within the regime.</p>

          <p>A U.S. circuit court has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan nationals. The 2-1 decision rejected the administration's claim that a Venezuelan gang's presence constituted a "predatory incursion," a necessary condition for invoking the wartime statute. Legal advocates have hailed the ruling as a significant victory for the rule of law, marking a judicial check on the expansion of presidential power for immigration enforcement during peacetime.</p>

          <p>An analysis of current interest rates reveals a close competition between Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts for maximizing returns on a $25,000 deposit. While a high-yield savings account might currently offer a slightly higher rate, its variable nature means returns could decrease with anticipated Fed rate cuts. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed interest rate, providing guaranteed earnings over its term, which may make it a more secure option for savers in a cooling rate environment.

          <p>The world's largest sports piracy site, Streameast, has been terminated following a sting operation in Egypt conducted by local law enforcement and the antipiracy group Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). The service, which amassed over 1.6 billion visits in the past year by illegally streaming major sporting events, was operated by two men who were arrested outside of Cairo. The shutdown is being hailed as a major victory for sports leagues and entertainment companies in the global fight against digital piracy.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Tim Cook's efforts to shield Apple from the worst of the Trump administration's tariffs, analysts predict the company may still raise the prices of its upcoming iPhone 17 models. While Apple has managed its supply chain to mitigate some tariff costs, the company has still incurred significant expenses, which it may now pass on to consumers. Any price hike would likely be attributed to rising component costs and new features rather than directly to tariffs, continuing a trend of increasing average selling prices for smartphones.</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling that allows Alphabet's Google to continue paying for its search engine placement on Apple devices is seen as a major victory for both tech giants. The decision permits Apple to maintain its multi-billion dollar revenue stream from Google and also opens the door for similar lucrative deals with AI companies for chatbot integration, particularly with its Siri assistant. This development could significantly boost Apple's high-margin Services division, which had been under a cloud of uncertainty pending the outcome of the landmark antitrust case.</p>

          <p>The number of federal student loan borrowers enrolled in forbearance, a form of payment pause, has surged from 2.9 million to 10.3 million over the past year, according to an analysis of Department of Education data. This dramatic increase is largely attributed to the administrative forbearance offered to borrowers in the now-repealed SAVE repayment plan, as well as a rise in deferments due to economic hardship and unemployment. The trend indicates that a growing number of borrowers are struggling to manage their loan payments alongside other rising living costs.</p>

The study, published in Science Advances, attributes the desiccation to rising temperatures and the chronic overpumping of groundwater aquifers for agriculture and cities. This rapid water loss, affecting nearly three-fourths of humanity, is now a larger contributor to sea-level rise than the melting of mountain glaciers or polar ice sheets.</p>
