          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has maintained its key policy rate at 5.5%, a decision influenced by rising trade tensions and tariff threats from the U.S. This move was widely expected by economists following a significant rate cut in the previous meeting. While recent low inflation data could support a future cut, the central bank is taking a cautious "neutral" stance, waiting for a clearer economic outlook, especially with India's GDP growing faster than anticipated. The decision also comes as the U.S. criticizes India's trade relationship with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

The potential plan, which requires approval from Israel's security cabinet, has created division within the Israeli government and military. This development occurs amid a severe humanitarian crisis, with UN agencies reporting man-made starvation, and follows a recent breakdown in ceasefire negotiations with Hamas.

          <p>The Italian government has advanced a draft law that would impose stricter regulations on gender-affirming medical treatments for individuals under 18. The legislation would require new protocols from the health ministry or approval from a national ethics committee before puberty blockers or hormones could be dispensed to minors. It also proposes a national registry to monitor these treatments, a move proponents say is to protect minors' health. The bill, backed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government, has been met with protests from transgender rights advocates.</p>

          <p>China is encountering a significant challenge in its ambition to build a satellite internet constellation to rival SpaceX's Starlink due to a shortage of available rockets. The state-backed Guo Wang project is receiving priority access to the national Long March rockets, leaving other commercial projects like Shanghai's Qianfan to rely on the nascent private launch sector. This bottleneck highlights the growing pains of China's space industry as it tries to balance national strategic goals with burgeoning commercial demand for launch capacity. The situation underscores the intense competition in the global space economy.</p>

          <p>The city of Hiroshima marked the 80th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing with a solemn ceremony, including a moment of silence at the exact time the bomb was dropped in 1945. Officials and survivors gathered at the peace memorial park, releasing doves and calling for a world without nuclear weapons. Speakers, including the city's mayor and Japan's Prime Minister, warned against the rising global military tensions and the growing acceptance of nuclear deterrence. The event serves as a powerful reminder of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear warfare.</p>

          <p>A former staffer for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Edward Coristine, was allegedly assaulted during an attempted carjacking in Washington, D.C., leading to the arrest of two teenagers. The incident prompted President Trump to decry the city's crime rate as "out of control" and threaten to place the capital under federal control. This constitutional power, though rarely used, would revoke the city's local governance. The event has intensified the political debate over crime in D.C. and the extent of federal authority over the district.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of State Representative Gene Wu, the Democratic caucus chair, from office. Abbott alleges that Wu, as the "ringleader" of the Democratic walkout, has abandoned his official duties by fleeing the state to block a vote on a contentious Republican-backed redistricting plan. The lawsuit is a significant escalation in the political standoff, with Abbott claiming the lawmakers' absence deprives the House of the necessary quorum to conduct business.

          <p>Chipmaker AMD announced second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, even as its revenue surpassed estimates, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. The company's AI business revenue declined, impacted by U.S. export controls restricting sales to China. However, its data center and client/gaming segments saw significant year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand for CPUs and gaming console chips. CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in the competitiveness of AMD's upcoming AI chips against rivals like Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funding without congressional approval. The judge stated that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters. The administration is now temporarily blocked from repurposing the funds.</p>

          <p>According to a source close to his legal team, musician and producer Sean "Diddy" Combs has contacted Donald Trump regarding a potential presidential pardon. Combs was recently convicted on prostitution-related charges and is awaiting sentencing, where he could face up to 20 years in prison.

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by China's state-owned Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak Mine project, awarded in 2008, has been stalled for 17 years due to security issues, archaeological concerns, and a lack of infrastructure. The Taliban government announced last year that the mine would use a costlier underground mining process to better protect ancient Buddhist relics at the site. This development signals a potential economic step forward for the region.</p>

First detected in Southeast Asia, the variant is a combination of two other strains and may have an enhanced ability to evade immune responses. However, the World Health Organization has assessed its public health risk as "low," and there is currently no evidence it causes more severe disease than previous Omicron variants.</p>

The measure aims to protect tenants, particularly vulnerable populations, from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law will take effect next month but will not be enforced until 2027 to give landlords time to comply. Officials are encouraging passive cooling methods like blackout curtains and reflective roofing.</p>
