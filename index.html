          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey announced he will boycott the banquet for Donald Trump's state visit in September to protest the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, citing Trump's influence over Israel and Gulf states as key to resolving the situation. Davey emphasized the difficulty of declining an invitation from the King, but feels compelled to send a message to Trump and Keir Starmer. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized the decision as disrespectful to the King and an act of gesture politics, but Davey maintains he meant no disrespect and has communicated his decision to the King personally. The article highlights the ongoing conflict in Gaza and international concerns about restricted aid and high casualty numbers. Optimism is low given the humanitarian crisis and political divisions.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe experienced a significant drop in July, marking the seventh consecutive month of declines, while Chinese EV rival BYD witnessed a substantial surge in sales. Tesla's new car registrations fell by 40% year-on-year, while BYD's registrations increased by 225% annually, as Tesla faces challenges such as intense competition and reputational damage. Tesla has not had a major refresh of its car line-up and is working on a more affordable electric car with volume production planned for the second half of 2025. Chinese brands are aggressively launching models and expanding into Europe, impacting not only Tesla but also other automakers like Stellantis, Hyundai, and Toyota. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Kansas City police officer, Hunter Simoncic, was fatally struck by a fleeing suspect while deploying stop sticks during a pursuit. The incident occurred early Tuesday morning when officers responded to reports of shots fired and found Dennis Mitchell III, who then fled in a stolen truck. Mitchell is now charged with capital murder and other offenses, with police later discovering that both trucks he drove were stolen. The department expressed a profound sense of loss and pain, noting Simoncic's dedication to the community and his previous work with youth and his funeral is scheduled for September 3rd. The optimism is low given the tragic loss of life.</p>

          <p>A large Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv resulted in multiple deaths and injuries, marking a significant escalation in the conflict. The attack, which included a rare strike in the city center, is one of the war's biggest air attacks, with Russia launching numerous drones and missiles across the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack and called for a stronger international response, while Russia claimed to have shot down numerous Ukrainian drones. The strikes caused widespread damage, impacting residential buildings and infrastructure, and disrupting power and transportation services, with the attack occuring after a meeting between President Trump and President Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Daniil Medvedev, a former US Open champion, has been fined nearly £31,500 for his behavior during a first-round exit, with the fine including penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct and destroying a racket. Medvedev was knocked out of the Grand Slam tournament after a meltdown triggered by a photographer walking onto the court during his defeat by Benjamin Bonzi.

He based the argument on a pledge made by the government this year to put a floor under stocks in a shaky economy. Jia’s equity exposure is concentrated in new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software and hardware companies – the so-called high-beta stocks that tend to rise more when the broader market stabilises or stages a comeback.
