          <p>The stock market experienced gains, continuing a two-day rally as investors hoped for a de-escalation of trade tensions with China and digested comments from a Federal Reserve official. Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, indicated that the economic impact of tariffs would take time to materialize, suggesting the central bank is not immediately planning to lower interest rates. Investors are closely monitoring developments in the trade war and monetary policy, leading to market volatility in the absence of concrete progress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation replaced the federal lawyers defending it in a lawsuit over New York City’s congestion pricing program, alleging that they undermined the department’s efforts to halt the toll. This action followed the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office's mistaken filing of a confidential memo questioning the department's legal strategy, which the department officials suggested might be an attempt to sabotage their efforts. The memo warned that the transportation secretary's rationale for ending the tolling plan was weak and likely to fail, leading to the case's transfer to the Justice Department's civil division.</p>

          <p>Federal health officials are planning to cut funding for the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), effectively ending one of the largest and longest-running studies of women's health. The WHI, which enrolled over 160,000 participants, has significantly impacted medical practice and clinical guidelines, preventing numerous cases of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. The Department of Health and Human Services is terminating contracts for the WHI's regional centers in September, with the clinical coordinating center receiving funding through January 2026.</p>
