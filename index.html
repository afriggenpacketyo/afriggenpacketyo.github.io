          <p>A BBC investigation highlights severe side effects of dopamine agonist drugs, such as Ropinirole, prescribed for Parkinson's disease and other conditions. The article details cases where patients developed intense gambling addictions, hypersexuality, and other compulsive behaviors, leading to devastating personal consequences including family breakdowns. One case describes a man who began spying on his wife and later sexually assaulted care home staff after his dosage increased. Despite long-known risks, the report finds that doctors are still not adequately warning all patients about these potential life-altering side effects.</p>

          <p>A labor dispute involving employees of Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, has led to strikes and trash pile-ups in several American cities. Represented by the Teamsters union, workers are demanding better pay and benefits, citing a high cost of living that current offers do not meet. The strike, which began in the Boston area, has spread to other states, impacting millions and causing significant public nuisance due to rotting garbage in the summer heat. While some local disputes have been resolved, negotiations in other areas have stalled, with no immediate resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that one of two grenades recovered from a Santa Monica garage is missing following a deadly explosion at a training facility. The other grenade detonated, killing three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail who reportedly believed the devices were inert. An extensive search led by the ATF is underway for the second explosive, which investigators believe was transported to the facility but has not been located since the blast. The department has implemented new policies to treat all recovered explosive devices as live to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' World Food Programme has issued a stark warning that nearly one-third of people in the Gaza Strip are going entire days without eating. Malnutrition is reportedly surging, with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment, and the death toll from malnutrition-related causes continues to rise. Amid mounting international pressure, Israel has stated it places no restrictions on aid, while countries like the UK consider participating in aid airdrops. However, aid agencies describe these measures as insufficient to address the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the territory.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to remove all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, according to a source familiar with the matter. This independent panel is responsible for recommending which preventive health services, like cancer screenings, must be covered by insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The source indicated that Kennedy views the group as too “woke,” although HHS has stated that no final decision has been made. This move comes as the Trump administration also saw a legal victory when a judge dismissed its lawsuit against Illinois over its sanctuary city policies.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its nuclear energy ambitions by completing the conceptual design for a next-generation commercial fast neutron reactor. Known as the CFR-1000, this facility will be the country's first gigawatt-level, fourth-generation reactor, designed for greater fuel efficiency and sustainability. The project, which builds on a smaller demonstration reactor in Fujian province, is now awaiting final approval from national energy authorities. It is expected to become operational after 2030, positioning China alongside other major powers like Russia and the U.S. in developing advanced nuclear technology.</p>

In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move an act of "transnational repression" that infringes on the rights and safety of individuals in the UK. The bounties, ranging up to $125,000, target 19 activists accused of violating Beijing's national security law.

          <p>A BBC investigation has identified at least 245 Russian soldiers aged 18 who have been killed in Ukraine, despite official promises that young conscripts would not be sent to the front lines. The report reveals that new rules allow teenagers to sign contracts with the regular army immediately after finishing school, bypassing traditional military service. Attracted by significant cash bonuses and patriotic propaganda in schools, these young men are enlisting voluntarily. The article profiles several of these teenage soldiers, highlighting the personal tragedies behind the statistics of Russia's ongoing war.</p>

          <h2>Warm, Sunny Weather in UK Leads to Boom for Some Insect Species</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. However, experts express concern that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying up wetland habitats essential for egg-laying. This short-term boom contrasts with the long-term trend of declining flying insect populations in the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state of Illinois over their so-called sanctuary policies. The suit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents illegally thwarted enforcement efforts. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that the city and state's decision not to participate in federal immigration enforcement is protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor praised the ruling, affirming their commitment to welcoming city ordinances they believe enhance public safety.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the infamous Hollywood blacklist era of the 1940s and 50s. The display focuses on the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry, which led to the blacklisting of the "Hollywood Ten" and many others. The exhibit features personal artifacts, such as letters from screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's daughter, and testimony from figures like Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan. It examines the profound impact on careers and free speech, and how the blacklist's power eventually faded.</p>

For Trump, golf has been a vehicle for building his real estate empire and forging connections with politicians and world leaders, from Shinzo Abe to the president of Finland. The sport provides him a private environment for transactional discussions, away from the media spotlight, at his portfolio of exclusive, high-prestige courses.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity for her two-day interview with the Deputy Attorney General, allowing her to answer questions without the responses being used against her, sources told ABC News. This type of immunity is common when prosecutors are seeking cooperation, though Maxwell has already been convicted. Her lawyer confirmed she was asked about approximately 100 different people and answered all questions, but stated no promises were made in return. The high-level meeting comes as the Justice Department faces pressure to provide more transparency regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease. After a disease outbreak wiped out about 50% of the population, a team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd. The animals were airlifted, checked by veterinarians, and relocated over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, healthy colony. A recent check confirmed the relocated sheep have survived and have begun to reproduce, offering new hope for the species' survival in Texas.</p>

The envoy blamed Hamas, saying its response showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire" and that the U.S. would now consider "alternative options" to free the hostages. The talks have been deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war. The diplomatic failure comes as the UN warns of a severe humanitarian crisis, with children in Gaza reportedly starving to death.</p>

          <p>A BBC report explores the science behind popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours a night. Experts suggest there is often more flexibility than the rigid numbers imply, with individual needs varying based on factors like size and activity level. While some targets, like getting at least seven hours of quality sleep, are strongly supported by evidence for long-term health, others can be viewed as useful guides rather than strict rules. The consensus is that incorporating a generally healthy outlook is more beneficial than fixating on hitting every single target daily.</p>
