          <p>Brazilian police thwarted a planned bomb attack at a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, attended by over two million people. The suspects, who identified as Lady Gaga fans, aimed to gain notoriety on social media by spreading hate speech against children, adolescents, and the LGBTQIA+ community. Authorities arrested the alleged mastermind for illegal firearm possession and detained a teenager for storing child pornography, seizing electronic devices and materials in multiple states. The concert, intended to revitalize Rio's economy, was secured by 5,000 officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras.</p>

          <p>Nicaragua has withdrawn from UNESCO after the UN cultural body awarded the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize to exiled Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa. UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay expressed regret, stating the decision would deprive Nicaraguans of cooperation benefits, especially in education and culture. La Prensa, operating in exile due to President Daniel Ortega's crackdown, was accused by Nicaraguan authorities of promoting US interventions. This withdrawal is a setback for UNESCO, which faced similar criticism from the US under President Trump but rejoined under the Biden administration.</p>

Experts emphasize the importance of identifying funds with unique approaches and not overreacting to short-term market swings. Investors are advised to remain invested, as timing the market can negatively impact long-term portfolio returns, and advisors are allocating clients to active ETFs for income and downside protection.

Trump acknowledged constitutional constraints preventing him from seeking a third term, despite strong support from some quarters. He praised potential successors like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, while refraining from endorsing any specific candidate. Trump also defended his tariff policies despite recent economic contraction, blaming former President Biden for economic challenges while taking credit for positive aspects.</p>

While some spectators cheered the athlete, others, like State Representative Laurel Libby, criticized the fairness of biological males competing in girls' sports.

          <p>Since Donald Trump's return to power, mass firings of federal workers, particularly probationary employees, have led to legal challenges and court-ordered reinstatements, creating a state of limbo for many. Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge) has been central to these actions, which aim to cut government spending but have resulted in confusion, lost productivity, and significant costs. While Americans generally support government efficiency, the administration's treatment of federal workers has sparked opposition and concerns about the erosion of civil service stability and expertise. The future remains uncertain for many probationary employees, who feel increasingly vulnerable despite legal challenges and public outcry.</p>

          <p>Residents of a Texan town near the Mexican border, home to Elon Musk's SpaceX, voted to rename their community 'Starbase' and incorporate it as a city. The move separates the town from Cameron County, which had previously rejected plans for additional housing for SpaceX employees. With 212 residents voting in favor and only six against, the newly named Starbase covers approximately 3.75 square kilometers.

Lau, who fled Hong Kong five years ago, spoke at a rally against the embassy's construction, leading to the arrest and questioning of her aunt and uncle in Hong Kong. Police reportedly sought information on Lau's financial ties and family connections in Hong Kong, subsequently arresting another aunt. Lau believes this harassment is an attempt to silence her "anti-Chinese" activism in the UK, where she has sought refuge after facing surveillance and harassment.</p>

          <p>Dozens of US arts organizations have received notices that their government grants are being terminated, following Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The cancellations come as part of the administration's 2026 discretionary budget request, aiming to reduce the size of the federal government. The NEA is shifting its focus to projects that align with the president's priorities, including celebrating American independence and supporting historically Black colleges. Critics argue that these cuts will disproportionately affect communities of color and limit public access to creative expression, impacting smaller arts organizations reliant on NEA grants.</p>

Lee's use of dialogue, music, and camera work aimed to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death, with Washington's performance capturing a sense of relief rather than fear.

          <p>This month marks the 100th birthday of Malcolm X, the charismatic Black leader whose influence has continued to grow since his assassination in 1965. Once a spokesman for the Nation of Islam preaching racial separatism, Malcolm evolved into a human rights leader advocating for self-defense and Black pride. His famous phrase "By any means necessary" is seen as a call for self-reliance, and his piercing questions about Black identity and racial injustice still resonate today. Scholars compare him to Martin Luther King Jr., with Malcolm serving as the political sword and King as the political shield.</p>

          <p>As the process to elect a successor to Pope Francis begins, interest has surged in the Oscar-winning film "Conclave," which dramatizes the intrigue behind papal elections.

          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" is highly damaging to relationships. This comparison undermines a partner's sense of worth, leading to insecurity and questioning of their ability to meet expectations. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as fear of openly expressing needs or frustrations. Open and direct communication, without shame or comparison, is essential for a healthy relationship.</p>
