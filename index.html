          <p>Former NFL MVP Matt Ryan has suggested that the New York Giants should consider giving rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart significant playing time sooner rather than later. While veteran Russell Wilson is slated to start, reports indicate the Giants have prepared a special package of plays for Dart, who was their first-round draft pick. Ryan argued on a CBS pregame show that the organization's future rests with Dart, and accelerating his development through on-field experience would be beneficial for the team's long-term success. Dart himself has expressed a desire to support the team in any capacity while learning from Wilson.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, marking a significant return to form. However, the race was largely overshadowed by a controversial decision from the McLaren team, which ordered Oscar Piastri to cede second place to his teammate Lando Norris. The order came after a slow pit stop, caused by a faulty wheel gun, dropped Norris behind Piastri, reversing their on-track positions. While the team justified the decision as fair based on Norris's performance throughout the race, the incident has sparked debate about the role of team orders in the tight championship battle.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren-like sound as part of the second national test of the government's emergency alert system. The test, which occurred around 3:00 PM on Sunday, was designed to ensure the system's effectiveness in broadcasting urgent warnings during national emergencies like severe weather or public safety threats. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the drill a success and an important step in public safety preparedness. While the test was largely successful, even reaching London's Underground, some users reported receiving garbled messages, similar to minor issues experienced during the first test in 2023.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has confirmed that its Azure cloud computing platform is experiencing service disruptions due to cuts in undersea fiber optic cables in the Red Sea. The damage is causing increased latency and delays for internet traffic routed through the Middle East, affecting users in the region as well as in parts of Asia, including India and Pakistan. Microsoft stated it has rerouted traffic to mitigate the impact and that services not traversing the Middle East are unaffected. The cause of the cable cuts has not been specified, but the incident highlights the vulnerability of critical global internet infrastructure laid on the ocean floor.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that President Donald Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska effectively gave the Russian leader what he desired. In an interview with ABC News, Zelenskyy expressed that Putin's primary goal was to secure a meeting with the U.S. president to project strength and legitimacy on the world stage, a goal he achieved. The comments came just before Russia launched a record aerial assault on Ukraine, which struck a government building in Kyiv.

          <p>The Catholic Church has canonized Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, making him the first millennial to be declared a saint. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his self-taught coding skills to create a website documenting religious miracles, spreading his faith through the internet. Pope Leo XIV led the canonization ceremony in St. Peter's Square, highlighting Acutis as an inspiration for young people to integrate modern life with faith. His preserved body, dressed in jeans and sneakers, lies in a tomb in Assisi and has become a major pilgrimage site, attracting over a million visitors last year.</p>

As AI takes over routine tasks, the first rung for many young professionals is disappearing, raising questions about skill development and upward mobility. A study by SignalFire found a 50% decline in new roles for recent graduates at major tech firms between 2019 and 2024. This trend is forcing a shift where new entrants to the workforce must acquire advanced skills independently, as on-the-job training opportunities diminish, fundamentally altering how careers begin and progress.</p>

The article argues that the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected by the change. Although the tariffs will lead to price increases on certain imported goods, the overall economy is positioned to absorb these costs as long as consumer income and wealth continue to grow. Businesses are advised to adapt by diversifying suppliers and exploring alternative payment options for customers. (not investment advice)</p>

The research, which examined nine disorders including depression, anxiety, and ADHD over several decades, revealed that if one partner has a diagnosis, the other is significantly more likely to have the same one. This phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," has remained stable across different cultures and generations since the 1930s.

          <h2>Shifting Amazon River Sparks Border Tensions Between Colombia and Peru</h2>

          <p>Changes in the course of the Amazon River are threatening to leave Colombia's only river port, Leticia, landlocked, fueling a diplomatic dispute with neighboring Peru. Drought and sedimentation are causing the river to shift south, away from the Colombian town and toward Peruvian territory. This has created tension over the sovereignty of Santa Rosa, a small island that formed in the river decades ago. The situation is critical for Leticia, which relies on the river for trade and supplies, as it has no highway connections to the rest of Colombia. Officials from both countries are scheduled to meet to discuss the border issues.</p>

          <p>Five humanitarian aid workers are on trial in Poland, accused of human trafficking for providing emergency assistance to a migrant family near the Belarusian border. The case highlights the Polish government's hardline stance on migration and the criminalization of aid efforts. Prosecutors argue the activists deliberately resisted state migration policy, while the defense contends they were saving lives in a desperate situation, as the family had been illegally pushed back to Belarus twice by border guards. The trial has drawn significant media attention, occurring shortly after the EU Commission President praised Poland's border security measures.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most crucial things parents can do for their child's future well-being. Consistent, deep sleep is fundamental for a baby's physical, mental, and cognitive development, and it lays the foundation for emotional regulation and resilience later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises parents to create a soothing environment with white noise, involve both caregivers in settling the baby, and maintain a flexible routine. He stresses that teaching a baby to sleep well is a key skill that benefits them throughout their entire life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article posits that solar power should be embraced by right-wing survivalists and preppers, despite its association with left-leaning environmentalism. The author argues that solar energy is the ultimate tool for self-sufficiency and individualism, providing a reliable power source independent of complex, vulnerable infrastructure like the oil and gas industry. Unlike fossil fuels, which require extensive supply chains, solar panels offer long-term energy security with minimal maintenance, directly from the sun. The piece suggests that the desire for independence from government and corporate systems makes solar technology a perfect fit for a conservative, self-reliant mindset.</p>

          <p>Arizona State Senator Analise Ortiz, a Democrat, is facing an ethics complaint and calls for her expulsion from Republican colleagues after she reshared an Instagram post warning of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity near an elementary school. Republican leaders claim her action was reckless and endangered officers, filing a complaint that seeks her removal from the chamber. Ortiz defends her actions as protected First Amendment speech, stating she was informing her community about government activity in sensitive locations. Free speech experts and the state's Democratic attorney general have condemned the expulsion effort as a politically motivated attempt to intimidate and silence a lawmaker.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The protests, some of the largest in recent months, included impassioned pleas from the families of the remaining hostages, who fear that an intensified military offensive will further endanger their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure, the Israeli government has shown no signs of halting its campaign, vowing to achieve total victory over Hamas and gain full control of the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Following his first victory as the head coach of the University of North Carolina, Bill Belichick confirmed reports of ongoing animosity with his former team, the New England Patriots. Belichick stated that he has banned Patriots scouts from attending UNC practices, explaining, "It’s clear I’m not welcomed in their facility, so they aren’t welcomed in ours." The comments came after his Tar Heels team secured a 20-3 win over Charlotte. The victory provided a much-needed positive result after an embarrassing blowout loss to TCU in his debut game a week earlier.</p>

          <p>London's transport network is experiencing significant disruption as London Underground staff have begun a five-day strike over pay and working conditions. Members of the RMT union are demanding a 32-hour work week and better fatigue management, leading to rolling action that will result in little to no service on the Tube from Monday to Thursday. Transport for London (TfL) has called the demand for a shorter week unaffordable but remains open to further talks. The strike, the first to close the entire network since March 2023, is causing overcrowding on other services like the Elizabeth line and buses.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece strongly criticizes the United States Tennis Association (USTA) for instructing broadcasters to avoid showing any crowd dissent against Donald Trump during the US Open final. The author calls the decision cowardly and hypocritical, pointing out that the tournament has previously televised other disruptions, such as climate protests, and embraces a chaotic brand. The article argues that censoring public disapproval of a political figure is un-American and strips the event of its authentic, unfiltered character. This move is seen as a capitulation that sacrifices the tournament's integrity to shield a politician from criticism.</p>

          <p>The online marketplace Vinted, now valued at over a billion dollars, originated from a common problem: having too many clothes. In 2008, co-founder Milda Mitkutė was moving to a smaller apartment and realized she couldn't take all 300 items of her clothing with her. She discussed the idea of creating a website to sell her unwanted items with a friend, Justas Janauskas, at a party. Within two weeks, they launched a basic site that quickly gained popularity through word of mouth, eventually expanding from Lithuania to Germany and beyond, becoming a major player in the second-hand fashion market.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, following the implementation of a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious texts. In a statement, Paxton endorsed specific Christian practices, which critics argue violates the constitutional separation of church and state. This stance contrasts sharply with his past actions, where in 2017 he raised alarms about Muslim students using a classroom for prayer. This apparent double standard is seen by watchdog groups as part of a broader Christian nationalist agenda to prioritize one religion within the state's secular public education system.</p>

          <p>The criminal referral against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud was initiated through a highly unusual process by William Pulte, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Former officials and experts described the director's direct involvement as "bizarre," noting that such matters are typically handled independently by the agency's Office of Inspector General to avoid political influence. The move is widely seen as politically motivated, as it provides a basis for President Trump's attempts to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve board. Pulte has also made similar referrals against other political opponents of Trump.</p>
