          <p>An attack at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, left multiple people injured, prompting an FBI investigation. FBI Director Kash Patel described the incident as a "targeted terror attack," while local police stated they were not ready to label it as such. The attack occurred near a pro-Israel demonstration, but it remains unclear whether the group was specifically targeted, as police responded to reports of a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, discovering victims with burn injuries upon arrival. The Boulder Jewish community has expressed sadness and heartbreak, offering support to those affected by the horrible attack. The scene is currently contained but not yet deemed safe, with authorities evacuating the surrounding area for investigation purposes, and asking for patience and empathy for the victims. </p>

          <p>Salman Rushdie addressed the growing trend of censorship in America, noting that it now comes from both progressive and conservative voices. He argued that suppressing speech often harms minority groups and that people should have the right to challenge themselves by engaging with offensive material. Rushdie, who faced a fatwa for his novel "The Satanic Verses," emphasized the importance of protecting writers whose lives are under threat. He expressed disappointment that he is often known for the threats against his life rather than his lifetime of storytelling, as Rushdie wishes to be remembered for his books and the worlds he created. The article highlights the value in hearing challenging voices and the dangers of limiting free expression. </p>

          <p>Jon DiMaggio, a former NSA analyst, has infiltrated ransomware gangs on the dark web to investigate and combat cyber attacks. He develops fake online personas to gain trust and extract information from hackers, including those in leadership positions. DiMaggio's work has revealed that many cybercriminals are ordinary people driven by personal circumstances, such as financial need. He also communicated with the leader of the LockBit gang during an attack on a U.S. hospital, and while DiMaggio believes that the successful seizure of LockBit's servers and takedown of their websites was an important step in the right direction, there are ways the U.S. can "do better" in addressing the scourge of ransomware. DiMaggio advocates for increased resources and authorities for cybersecurity efforts to effectively address the growing threat of ransomware. </p>

          <p>Australia, despite its small population, has produced a surprising number of Hollywood stars, including Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and Cate Blanchett. The article explores the reasons behind this phenomenon, highlighting the influence of institutions like the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), which provides rigorous training and encourages a "can-do" attitude. The remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their talents away from the intense scrutiny of Hollywood. There is an understanding that it's all oftentimes smoke and mirrors. And it's fun, and it's a game. </p>

          <p>The FBI and cybersecurity firms are battling increasingly brazen ransomware attacks, with a focus on the group Scattered Spider, a network of young, English-speaking hackers. These hackers use social engineering to infiltrate corporate networks, as seen in the MGM Resorts attack, costing the company over $100 million. They have partnered with Russian ransomware gangs like BlackCat, who provide malware and experience, leading to more sophisticated and damaging attacks, such as the Colonial Pipeline and UnitedHealth Group incidents. The collaboration between Western and Russian hackers has made cybercrime more potent, with the Russian government providing a safe haven for these gangs, which has caused the NSA to join the fight. </p>

          <p>Robots are transforming the art world, enabling sculptors to carve with precision and speed, but this development has sparked debate among artists. Companies like Robotor use robots to complete 99% of the work on sculptures, but some artists worry about the loss of human touch and artistry. Barry X Ball, a contemporary artist, embraces robots to create complex works, while others, like Tuscan artist Michael Monfroni, argue that only a human can coax the divine out of stone. The use of robots has divided the artistic community, raising questions about the nature of artistry and the role of technology in creative expression. </p>

Trzaskowski initially claimed victory, but the second exit poll sensationally overturned the result. The official result is due to be published on Monday morning, and the outcome will shape the country's political direction and its relationship with the European Union. </p>

Alongside nuclear-armed submarines, the new vessels would keep Britain and Nato safe for decades. The review will include commitments to munitions production, long-range weapons, a cyber command, military housing repairs, and technology for targeting information. </p>

          <p>The Colorado Rockies have set an unfortunate MLB record, becoming the first team this season to reach 50 losses, with a 5-3 defeat to the New York Mets. The Rockies have the worst record in 59 games of any major league team in modern baseball, having been swept 10 times in 20 series. The Mets regained sole possession of first place in the National League East with the win, highlighting the contrast in their seasons. The Rockies' season continues to be challenging, and the team hopes to turn things around after already firing their manager in May. </p>
