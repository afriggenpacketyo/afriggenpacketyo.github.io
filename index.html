The planned route cuts through valuable farmland, disrupting agricultural operations and leaving remnant pieces of land unusable. Despite the challenges, the project aims to connect Bakersfield and Merced by 2033, but the original vision of linking Los Angeles and San Francisco remains distant. </p>
