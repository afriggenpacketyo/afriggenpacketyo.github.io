          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue to $28.10 billion, marking an end to two periods of decline. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents fell short of analyst estimates of 54 cents, leading to a 2% drop in its stock during extended trading. The profit decline was attributed to reduced electric vehicle prices and a substantial 50% rise in operating expenses, partly driven by investments in artificial intelligence and other research and development projects. The article also highlights the impact of expiring federal tax credits and increased competition in Europe as contributing factors to the sales slump, despite the overall revenue growth.

          <p>Thames Valley Police have concluded their investigation and will not press charges against four men arrested for projecting images of Donald Trump and convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle. The incident occurred in September 2025 during President Trump's state visit to the UK, sparking arrests on suspicion of malicious communications and public nuisance. The group "Led By Donkeys" claimed responsibility for the nine-minute projection, which aimed to highlight Trump's historical associations with Epstein. The decision not to pursue charges resolves the legal aspect of the protest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that maintaining good oral health is crucial for heart and brain well-being, with studies linking gum disease to an increased risk of stroke and brain damage. One article published in Neurology Open Access found that adults with gum disease were more likely to exhibit signs of white matter damage in the brain, suggesting a connection through inflammation. Another study by Dr. Souvik Sen revealed that having both gum disease and cavities elevates stroke risk by 86%, but consistent oral care can reduce this risk by as much as 81%. This research reinforces the significant impact of oral health on overall cardiovascular and neurological health.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has provided no new information regarding its ongoing gambling investigation into Cleveland Guardians pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase, who were placed on non-disciplinary paid leave in July 2025. The investigation, which began after unusual betting activity on Ortiz's pitches was flagged, and their leave was extended indefinitely in August. The lack of an update comes just days before the World Series, leaving uncertainty about their future availability. This situation contrasts with the swift resolution of Shohei Ohtani's gambling controversy, where he was absolved of wrongdoing, highlighting the prolonged nature of the Guardians' probe.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States will impose a "substantial pickup" in sanctions against Russia, accusing President Vladimir Putin of a lack of honesty in diplomatic engagements with Donald Trump. This declaration follows intense Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, which resulted in at least seven deaths, including two children, and came hours after Trump postponed a planned meeting with Putin. The new sanctions, expected to be unveiled shortly, aim to exert economic pressure on Moscow and target countries purchasing Russian oil, reflecting ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>New port fees implemented by the Trump administration's U.S. Trade Representative have imposed an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill on Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a US-based ocean carrier. The reclassification of ACL's unique container-roll-on/roll-off hybrid vessels under Section 301 now bases fees on net tonnage, rather than cargo, despite only 1% of its roll-on/roll-off freight being passenger cars. ACL's CEO, Andrew Abbott, warns that these substantial tariffs could force the company to cease US operations, jeopardizing crucial services for American manufacturers and exporters. The USTR maintains its classification is based on vessel construction. (not investment advice)</p>

This potential "windfall" is largely due to new, retroactive provisions enacted through the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act, which could lead to an additional $50 billion in total taxpayer savings. The legislation extended existing tax cuts and introduced new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, and significantly raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction.

          <p>An American missionary was kidnapped from his home in Niamey, Niger's capital, by three armed men, according to multiple security sources. The abduction occurred approximately 100 yards from the presidential palace, where the ousted President Mohamed Bazoum remains held since a 2023 coup. The US Embassy in Niamey subsequently issued a security alert, warning American citizens of a heightened risk of kidnapping throughout the capital. The US State Department confirmed efforts are underway across the government to support the recovery and safe return of the citizen, who has worked for a US-based charity since 2010.</p>

          <p>The director of the Louvre Museum, Laurence des Cars, has acknowledged significant security failings that allowed a gang of thieves to steal €88 million worth of French crown jewels. She revealed that the museum's "aging" and "unsatisfactory" CCTV system, particularly a single exterior camera pointing away from the entry point, failed to detect the intruders. Des Cars admitted the museum was "defeated" and highlighted chronic budget challenges for modernizing security infrastructure. While a damaged 19th-century crown was recovered, eight prized pieces of jewelry remain missing, prompting calls for immediate security upgrades.</p>

          <p>England's unbeaten streak in the Women's Cricket World Cup was decisively ended by Australia, delivering a "reality check" despite England having already secured a semi-final spot. The article notes that while England has shown significant improvement since their last Ashes encounter, Australia's consistent dominance and deep batting lineup proved insurmountable. Key performances from Annabel Sutherland, who nearly scored a century, and Ash Gardner, with a brutal fifty, highlighted Australia's ruthless execution. This defeat underscores the high level of perfection required for England to overcome such a formidable and consistently strong opponent in future competitions.</p>

Ongoing economic uncertainties, including President Donald Trump's trade policies, interest rate trajectories, and a cooling labor market, necessitate a discerning investment approach. The article advises focusing on individual company fundamentals, such as Costco's loyal membership model or TJX Companies' ability to navigate tariffs, rather than solely relying on broad economic indicators.

          <p>President Donald Trump's demolition of the White House East Wing for a new ballroom is being widely interpreted as a powerful metaphor for his presidency, with critics labeling him a "human wrecking ball." While the administration defends the $250 million project as a "bold, necessary addition" funded by private donors, commentators and historians view it as symbolic of Trump's disruption of established norms and institutions. The article highlights the controversy and the administration's defensive stance against perceived "manufactured outrage," noting this renovation is part of Trump's increasingly ambitious and Mar-a-Lago-esque second-term makeovers.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that support for California's Proposition 50, a state ballot measure concerning redistricting, is significantly driven by national political sentiments, particularly opposition to President Trump. Voters backing the proposition overwhelmingly cite their desire to oppose the Trump administration and national Republicans, reflecting a widespread feeling that Trump treats California worse than other states. Conversely, opponents are motivated by concerns that redistricting would shift power from rural to urban areas and incur state costs. The poll underscores how deeply national partisan divides influence state-level political issues in California.</p>
