          <h2>Supreme Court Sides With Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Texas Waste Storage Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 10:13:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and landowners challenging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to store nuclear waste in the state. Justice Kavanaugh stated that Texas and the land developer weren't parties to the licensing process, thus lacking entitlement to judicial review. The ruling reverses the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision. The issue of nuclear waste storage has been politically complicated, with the Yucca Mountain project in Nevada stalled due to state pushback, leaving over 90,000 metric tons of nuclear waste in private storage. The case hinged on whether Texas and the landowners had the standing to challenge the license initially. The current ruling enables Interim Storage Partners to store nuclear waste in Andrews County, Texas. Optimism regarding the long-term solution to nuclear waste storage remains tempered by the ongoing political and logistical challenges. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick is rapidly intensifying in the Eastern Pacific, posing a threat to southern Mexico. The National Hurricane Center anticipates Erick could reach major hurricane strength before making landfall. A hurricane warning is in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Angel, with a hurricane watch extending further along the coast. The storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall, potentially reaching 20 inches in some areas, leading to life-threatening flooding and mudslides. Dangerous storm surges and destructive waves are also anticipated along the coast, heightening the risk to coastal communities. The situation underscores the ongoing dangers posed by hurricanes and the need for preparedness in vulnerable regions. </p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares have been removed from the New York Stock Exchange after Nippon Steel completed its acquisition, making U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary. The NYSE notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of the delisting. Former President Trump initially opposed the acquisition but later changed his stance after taking office, ordering a new review of the deal. Despite Trump's announcement of a "partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon, the original merger agreement terms were upheld. This marks the end of an era for the iconic American industrial name as it transitions to Japanese ownership. </p>

          <p>An Iranian official cautioned that U.S. involvement in the conflict with Israel risks escalating it into an "all-out war." This warning follows a series of Israeli strikes on Iran, including one targeting a centrifuge production site, and retaliatory missile launches by Iran. The U.N.'s IAEA confirmed that two centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit during the strikes. President Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, demanding an "unconditional surrender," while Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei rejected Trump's ultimatum. The U.S. military is reportedly considering joining the strikes, but Israel has not requested U.S. assistance. </p>

          <p>A woman from South Yorkshire died from rabies after being exposed to a stray dog while on holiday in Morocco. The UK Health Security Agency stated that the risk to the general public is low, as rabies is not known to spread between people. Close contacts and healthcare workers are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precaution. The UKHSA advises that anyone bitten, scratched, or licked by an animal in a country where rabies is present should wash the wound thoroughly and seek immediate medical attention. Rabies is almost always fatal if left untreated. </p>

          <p>Iowa is experiencing a cancer "crisis," with the second-highest cancer rate in the nation, prompting research into environmental causes. Many residents suspect insecticides, herbicides, and high nitrate levels from farm fields contaminating the water supply. The research project will investigate links between cancer and pesticides, nitrates, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs). The focus on agricultural practices is controversial, given the industry's significant contribution to Iowa's economy. Researchers aim to release initial findings later this year to inform policies that can help reduce cancer rates. </p>

          <p>Under the guise of "elbows up" against Trump, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney is implementing policies mirroring Trump's authoritarian approach. British Columbia passed Bills 14 and 15 to expedite resource extraction, while Ontario created Special Economic Zones to fast-track mining. Federally, the Building Canada Act grants the cabinet power to waive federal laws for projects deemed in the "national interest." These measures are criticized for prioritizing corporate interests over Indigenous rights, environmental regulations, and workers' protections. The legislative changes concentrate power within the executive branches, creating "legal black holes" that undermine democratic processes. </p>

Arnaz made the decision to film "I Love Lucy" on 35mm film, enabling the preservation, reruns, and syndication that define modern television economics. The show was created partly to save Arnaz's marriage to Lucille Ball, who insisted he co-star. Arnaz's business acumen led to the purchase of RKO Studios, renamed Desilu, which became a television production powerhouse.

          <p>A North Carolina town devastated by Hurricane Helene faces uncertainty in its rebuilding plans due to potential cuts from President Trump's administration. The town had been seeking federal funding for an ambitious rebuilding plan after the hurricane damaged a century-old dam. Trump's plans to shrink or abolish FEMA and shift disaster response costs to states have injected uncertainty into the recovery process. The situation highlights the challenges faced by communities recovering from natural disasters amid changing federal policies. The proposed cuts may leave the town's rebuilding plans adrift. </p>

          <h2>Senate's Tax Plan for Trump's Spending Package Would Permanently Extend TCJA Cuts (not investment advice)</h2>

          <p>The Senate's tax plan for President Trump's spending package aims to permanently extend the tax cuts introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This would result in most taxpayers seeing a tax cut, according to the Tax Foundation. Both the Senate and House versions of the bill extend the 2017 tax cuts, while also introducing new tax breaks. The bills differ in areas such as Medicaid rules, state and local tax deduction limits, and clean energy tax credits. The final version of the budget bill will determine the extent of the tax breaks for Americans. (not investment advice)</p>
