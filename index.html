          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the UK highlights a lifelong affection for the British royal family, influenced by his Scottish mother's admiration for their pageantry. This fascination has been evident throughout his career, from reportedly using Princess Diana's name to promote his Mar-a-Lago club to expressing deep personal satisfaction in meeting the late Queen Elizabeth II. Observers suggest his engagement with the royals serves his desire for status, legitimacy, and media attention, reflecting a long-held aspiration to be associated with their global standing.</p>

          <h2>Fortnum & Mason CEO Says Trump's Tariffs Have Harmed US Tea Exports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of luxury retailer Fortnum & Mason has stated that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have negatively impacted the company's tea exports to the United States. Changes to country-of-origin rules and the elimination of a cost exemption for small parcels have led to significantly higher delivery fees and prices for American consumers. The tariffs, which can be as high as 50% for products containing tea from India, have created logistical challenges and financial burdens for the historic British brand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's annual inflation rate remained at 3.8% in August, matching the previous month's figure, as rising food costs offset easing prices in other areas. According to the Office for National Statistics, food price inflation has now risen for five consecutive months, with some economists attributing this to businesses passing on higher labor costs to consumers. With inflation still well above the Bank of England's 2% target, expectations are that interest rates will remain on hold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While German basketball is experiencing a golden era with recent international championships, the domestic league faces a new challenge from the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) policies in U.S. college sports. The ability for student-athletes in the U.S. to earn significant money is luring top young German talent away, disrupting the development pipeline for the domestic Bundesliga. This trend is forcing German clubs and the league to seek compensation models to protect their investment in training players who leave for the lucrative American college system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ambitious vision for a green hydrogen economy is facing a reality check as major investment deals, such as a German-Australian supply agreement, have collapsed. High production costs, driven by the immense amount of renewable electricity required, are making green hydrogen uncompetitive with cheaper alternatives like natural gas. As a result, companies like BP and E.On are scaling back their plans, suggesting that green hydrogen may ultimately fill a niche role in decarbonization rather than becoming a cornerstone of the future energy system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hopes for the elimination of a 25% tariff on UK steel exports to the United States have been dashed, as a proposed deal has been put on hold indefinitely. Although President Trump hinted at potential relief, no agreement was reached, leaving the UK steel industry disappointed. While the UK's 25% tariff is lower than the 50% faced by some other nations, the failure to secure a zero-tariff quota is a setback for British producers who hoped for better access to the American market.</p>
