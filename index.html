          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, citing increased sales to home professionals as a buffer against weaker demand from do-it-yourself customers, despite narrowly missing quarterly sales expectations but surpassing earnings estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison credited investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating housing market challenges. Sales to home professionals saw mid-single-digit growth, attributed to Lowe's strategic investments since 2018, including expanding merchandise and a pro loyalty program. The company anticipates full-year sales between $83.5 billion and $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corporation announced that the redesigned 2026 Toyota RAV4 SUV will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, marking the first time the model will eliminate the traditional gas engine. This decision is driven by growing customer demand for hybrid vehicles, which accounted for roughly half of RAV4 sales last year. David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, noted that the hybrid model has faster turnover and more sales orders. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign that includes interior and exterior changes, along with upgrades to the vehicle's performance and technologies.</p>

          <p>Target has revised its sales outlook for the year, anticipating a decline due to weaker discretionary spending, uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and negative reactions to the company's reduction of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First-quarter earnings and revenue fell short of expectations, with transactions and average spending decreasing. CEO Brian Cornell attributed many of the retailer's challenges to the economy, while also acknowledging that Target is losing market share in several merchandise categories. The company now projects a low-single-digit decline in sales for the fiscal year, a significant shift from its previous forecast of 1% growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump pressured House Republicans to support a budget package containing his legislative priorities, but the bill faces opposition from both conservative and moderate factions. Conservatives are demanding steeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates are resisting changes to the state and local tax deduction. The Rules Committee met late into the night to try to advance the bill to a floor vote, but its passage remains uncertain due to the slim Republican majority and deep divisions within the party. The budget package is estimated to add trillions to the deficit over the next decade, further complicating efforts to reach a consensus.</p>

          <p>Israel has declared an expansion of its ground offensive in Gaza, aiming to seize large areas and force Hamas's surrender after more than 19 months of war. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that Israeli troops could potentially take control of all of Gaza, a move condemned by allies such as Britain, France, and Canada. The past week has been particularly deadly for Palestinians, with Israeli strikes reportedly killing over 400 people. Despite the military escalation, details about troop movements remain scarce, and a major ground offensive in major cities has yet to begin.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to the Middle East resulted in significant artificial intelligence (AI) investment deals between US tech firms and Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These deals, involving companies like Nvidia and OpenAI, aim to bolster AI development in the Gulf states. However, critics worry that providing advanced chips to these countries could indirectly benefit China in the global AI race. The Trump administration had previously scrapped rules that restricted the sale of AI-capable chips to certain Middle Eastern countries, leading to concerns that these chips could find their way to China.</p>

While her rise has thrilled supporters, it has also drawn criticism from food industry executives and scientists who question her methods and scientific accuracy.

          <p>A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicates that five-day in-office mandates are outdated, citing benefits of telework like improved talent acquisition, cost savings, and productivity gains. The report highlights that flexible work arrangements attract and retain talent, reduce costs through smaller office footprints, and boost productivity by eliminating commutes. However, it also acknowledges challenges in building workplace culture in distributed teams, suggesting solutions such as virtual meetings and mentorship programs.

Alternatives include traditional CDs, which offer lower rates but guarantee the term, and high-yield savings accounts.

          <p>Major American retailers are facing pressure to absorb price increases resulting from President Trump's tariffs, while also navigating the challenge of communicating these impacts to consumers without provoking the White House. Target recently lowered its financial forecast, downplaying plans for tariff-related price hikes, while Home Depot stated it does not plan to broadly raise prices. This follows warnings from Walmart about the need to raise prices due to tariffs. The article highlights the delicate balance retailers must strike between managing costs, maintaining customer loyalty, and avoiding political backlash.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's time in Washington is drawing to a close, marked by isolation and failure to build necessary alliances within the Trump administration. Musk, appointed to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), promised to cut vast amounts of taxpayer spending, but struggled to navigate the complexities of the federal government. His efforts were met with resistance from cabinet secretaries, court challenges, and ridicule. As Musk shifts his focus back to his companies, his departure is viewed as a relief by many federal leaders.</p>

          <p>Both Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have proposed eliminating federal taxes on tips, a seemingly unifying policy proposal. However, experts argue that this policy primarily benefits businesses rather than workers, potentially depressing service sector wages. They suggest that the focus should be on raising the minimum wage for tipped workers, as eliminating taxes on tips would do little for those already exempt from federal income taxes. Critics argue that such a tax cut could incentivize employers to rely more on tips, rather than offering competitive wages.</p>

          <p>An unexpected rise in inflation suggests the economic outlook could be more challenging than previously anticipated, with higher energy and water bills contributing to the increase. While pay rises are outpacing the rate at which prices are rising for some workers, inflation remains higher than the Bank of England would prefer. Government policies and global trade dynamics could further impact inflation, leading economists to believe that interest rate cuts may be limited. US President Donald Trump's trade war and uncertainty over trade policies could also influence commodity prices and inflation.</p>
