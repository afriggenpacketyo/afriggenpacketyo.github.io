          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a review of Harvard University's patents derived from federally funded research, threatening to seize them or grant third-party licenses. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick alleges the university has not complied with the Bayh-Dole Act, which requires such inventions to benefit the American public. This action represents a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between the administration and the university, which has already faced freezes on federal research funding over other disputes. Harvard has described the move as another retaliatory effort against the institution.</p>

          <p>Famed astronaut Jim Lovell, best known for commanding the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell's calm leadership during the 1970 "successful failure," when an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft, was crucial in safely returning the crew to Earth. He also flew on the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, where he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." Lovell's legacy is remembered for his courage under pressure and his significant contributions to human space exploration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) reports a significant increase in complaints regarding models who appear "unhealthily thin" in advertisements. Major retailers like Zara, Next, and Marks & Spencer have recently had ads banned, sparking debate about a potential return to the "super skinny" aesthetic of the 1990s. While brands claim the models are healthy, the ASA has cited posing, lighting, and styling for creating a misleadingly thin appearance. This trend has raised concerns among activists about its potential harm, especially in contrast to the recent body positivity movement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15. The summit comes as a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine approaches, with the administration threatening significant secondary sanctions on countries trading with Russia. While the White House has expressed openness to including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, initial plans appear to focus on a bilateral meeting. The meeting signals a critical point in diplomatic efforts to end the war, though the terms of any potential peace deal remain highly uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is demanding a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to resolve claims of antisemitism and discrimination on campus. The proposal, which comes after the administration froze $584 million in federal grants, also requires a $172 million fund for alleged victims. University officials have called the demand a devastating misuse of taxpayer money that would harm the public university system. This follows similar high-profile settlements with Columbia and Brown universities over related campus issues.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, dubbed the Canyon fire, has forced thousands of evacuations in a mountainous region of Southern California. The blaze, which started in Ventura County and spread into Los Angeles County, has burned over 5,000 acres amid dangerously hot and dry conditions. Hundreds of firefighters are battling the fire, which is partially contained, but low humidity and record-low moisture levels in the vegetation are fueling its growth.

          <p>President Trump has reportedly ordered the U.S. military to target drug cartels in Latin America, a significant escalation in his administration's efforts to combat the flow of illicit drugs. This directive follows earlier moves to designate several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a status that grants more legal authority for national security actions beyond standard law enforcement. The move has been met with concern from some lawmakers and raises questions about potential military intervention in other countries.

Filmed on location near the Chimborazo volcano with the cooperation of the local Indigenous community, the film incorporates the Kichwa language and authentic rituals. The review highlights the film's raw, personal feel and its use of the Supay, a demon from Andean mythology, to provide a fresh perspective on the exorcism genre.</p>

While much of the story is known, the biography reportedly adds new, damaging details from extensive research and interviews.

          <p>President Trump has removed Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) just two months after he was sworn into the position. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as the acting commissioner. Long, a former congressman whose term was meant to run until 2027, is expected to be nominated for the post of ambassador to Iceland. His brief tenure occurred during the implementation of new tariffs and tax code changes by the administration, as well as significant job cuts at the agency.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace deal at the White House, formally ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Hosted by President Donald Trump, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev committed to respecting each other's territorial integrity and opening diplomatic relations. A key part of the agreement is the establishment of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, which will connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave.

          <p>Michael Paul Brown, the 45-year-old suspect in a deadly mass shooting at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been apprehended after a seven-day manhunt. Authorities say Brown killed four people at The Owl Bar on August 1 before fleeing into the nearby mountains. His capture was confirmed by the state's governor and attorney general, bringing an end to an intensive search involving multiple law enforcement agencies. Brown, an army veteran who reportedly struggled with mental illness, lived next door to the bar where the attack took place.</p>

          <p>The recent death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell brings the number of living astronauts who have journeyed to the Moon down to just five. This small, aging group of pioneers includes Buzz Aldrin, Charles Duke, Harrison Schmitt, and David Scott, who all walked on the lunar surface, and Fred Haise, who was part of the perilous Apollo 13 mission. The article reflects on their stories and legacies as NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon for the first time since 1972. Their dwindling numbers highlight the passage of time since the historic Apollo era.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to approve an occupation of Gaza City is driven more by political survival than strategic consensus. The plan is opposed by both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the public, who fear it will be a trap that drains resources and endangers lives. However, Netanyahu relies on the support of hard-right, pro-settler parties in his narrow coalition who advocate for annexing Gaza. This dynamic has created a significant gap between the government's actions and the desires of the Israeli people and military experts.</p>

          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted on social media that he had alerted authorities to a dinghy coming ashore, demanding mass deportations. It was later revealed the boat contained a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning of his error, the MP apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause.</p>

Her comments address renewed nationalist fears in Mexico following the U.S. designation of several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum reiterated that Mexico's sovereignty is inalienable and that she had previously rebuffed offers of direct U.S. military assistance.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government announced it will lower the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. This move aligns Canada with the European Union and the United Kingdom, who recently took similar action to increase economic pressure on Moscow. The price cap mechanism is designed to limit Russia's revenue from oil sales, a crucial source of funding for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne stated the measure is intended to ratchet up economic pressure and curtail funding for the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

This follows the declassification of documents by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, who accused the Obama administration of pushing a false narrative to sabotage Trump.
