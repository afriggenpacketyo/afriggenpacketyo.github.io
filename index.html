          <p>U.S. immigration authorities have detained approximately 475 people in a large-scale raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle factory site in Georgia, marking the largest workplace operation of President Trump's second term. A majority of those arrested are South Korean nationals, prompting an expression of "concern and regret" from the South Korean government. U.S. Homeland Security stated the raid was part of a multi-month criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices and not solely an immigration sweep. The event highlights a potential conflict between the administration's goals of boosting domestic manufacturing and enforcing strict immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sudden resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has sparked confusion and speculation, with new questions arising from her personal real estate records. Kugler's financial disclosures and state tax records present seemingly conflicting information about her primary residence, an issue that has become politically charged in other contexts. While Kugler attributed the discrepancy to a clerical error by the county, her departure provides President Trump an opportunity to appoint a successor and gain more influence over the central bank. This comes amid Trump's ongoing public pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, dropped more than 10% following a report that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to release a report linking autism to acetaminophen use during pregnancy. HHS confirmed it is investigating the rise in autism rates but called claims about the report's contents speculation. Kenvue maintains there is no causal link, a position supported by the FDA and major medical organizations, though some past studies have suggested risks. The development reflects Kennedy's broader agenda of questioning established medical science from his position at HHS. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, marking the largest one-day drop in over a year. This decline was a direct reaction to a weaker-than-expected August employment report, which eased concerns about inflation and future Federal Reserve rate hikes. For potential homebuyers, this rate drop could translate into considerable monthly savings, although it remains uncertain if this will be enough to reinvigorate a housing market hampered by high prices. Analysts suggest that rates may need to fall into the 5% range to significantly boost buyer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

His appointment comes as the FBI faces scrutiny and high turnover under the Trump administration. Supporters view him as a principled conservative, while critics express concern that he will use his new federal power to advance a partisan agenda on a national scale.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old man, reportedly in the U.S. illegally, has been charged with the murder of 19-year-old Dacara Thompson, who was reported missing in August. The suspect, Hugo Hernandez-Mendez, was arrested after police uncovered evidence suggesting Thompson was killed in his residence in Bowie, Maryland. According to reports, Hernandez-Mendez had been previously arrested for a DWI in April and was out on bail at the time of the alleged murder. An ICE detainer has been issued for him, and he is currently being held without bond on first- and second-degree murder charges.</p>

Russian officials and media frequently use derogatory and sexist language to attack her, often reducing her extensive political career to her past work as a gynecologist. Experts believe these attacks are a response to her strong support for Ukraine, her influential role in strengthening EU defense, and her gender, which clashes with the Kremlin's projection of toxic masculinity.

          <p>Following the abrupt resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle to assert his authority and refocus his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer has recast his top team, appointing new home and foreign secretaries in a move designed to re-energize his administration. This political maneuver is seen as an attempt to seize control of the narrative after a difficult start to the week and to prepare for upcoming political battles. The scale of the changes represents both an opportunity and a risk for the prime minister's leadership.</p>

This trend of weak hiring reflects business uncertainty amid new tariffs and has widened the racial unemployment gap, with the rate for Black Americans rising to 7.5%.

This shift comes as Tesla's car sales have declined globally amid increased competition and controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk. While Musk envisions AI as the key to making Tesla a ten-trillion-dollar company, the move is a major gamble away from its proven and profitable car business.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles, one of the nation's busiest highways, will be partially closed this weekend for a major repaving project. The freeway will be reduced to three lanes in each direction through the Sepulveda Pass, a critical commuter and commercial route. The California Department of Transportation is strongly urging motorists to find alternative routes or use public transit to avoid severe congestion. This weekend's work is the first of up to 25 planned closures for the $143.7 million project, which is scheduled for completion in late 2028 or early 2029.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed legislation raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 limit imposed by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was a significant departure from the previously unlimited deduction. The move is intended to provide relief to taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who argue the cap amounts to double taxation. However, fiscal analyses project the higher cap will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Department of Health and Human Services is systematically dismantling the nation's vaccine infrastructure, prompting states and medical societies to break from federal guidance. Kennedy has defunded research, spread misinformation, and replaced the CDC's expert advisory panel with anti-vaccine figures. In response, states like California, Oregon, and Washington have formed a coalition to issue their own science-based vaccine recommendations. This fragmentation of public health policy creates a dangerous void, as the country's unified defense against infectious diseases shatters, potentially taking decades to repair.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," its pre-World War II designation. The current name was adopted in 1947 when the Army and Navy were unified into a single department, reflecting a post-war focus on deterring conflict rather than solely waging it. Trump argues that "Department of War" has a stronger sound and is associated with a time when the U.S. won its wars. Critics, however, worry that the symbolic change implies a more bellicose foreign policy and a departure from the strategic goal of preventing major conflicts.</p>

The connection was made after a genealogist identified him as a potential suspect, and his DNA was confirmed using a biological sample from a 1993 Indiana case where he was a suspect.

Simply allowing a CD to roll over could lock in a much lower rate than previously enjoyed. This article explores three viable options: moving funds to a high-yield savings account for flexibility, opting for a money market account that combines high rates with checking features, or reinvesting in a new long-term CD to secure a fixed rate against future market declines. Each strategy offers different benefits depending on the saver's goals for liquidity and growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Putin warned that any such foreign forces in Ukraine would be considered legitimate targets for the Russian military, escalating tensions. The statement comes amid stalled peace talks, with Putin expressing little optimism for reaching an agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on key issues, thereby diminishing hopes for an imminent end to the conflict.</p>
