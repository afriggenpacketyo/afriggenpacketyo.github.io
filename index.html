          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 20:40:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with the food industry to eliminate six others commonly found in cereals, ice cream, and snacks. The plan is contingent on cooperation from major food companies, with the HHS and FDA calling for a national standard and timeline to transition to natural alternatives. The International Association of Color Manufacturers has questioned the feasibility of the proposed timeline, while the Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would work with the administration on food dye priorities.</p>

          <p>Tesla's profits have plunged by 71%, leading CEO Elon Musk to announce he will reduce his time spent on DOGE, while maintaining his involvement to prevent waste and fraud. Tesla's Q1 earnings report revealed a 20% drop in car sales revenue, attributed to factors including anticipation for the Model Y refresh and potential brand damage from Musk's political activities. Musk dismissed concerns about demand reduction, blaming blowback on those who benefited from wasteful government spending. Despite headwinds like falling used Tesla prices and tariff impacts, Musk remains optimistic about Tesla's future, focusing on robotaxis and autonomous robots rather than traditional car sales.</p>

          <p>Congressional lawmakers have condemned the detention of Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two students held by U.S. immigration authorities for their pro-Palestinian activism, labeling their treatment a "national disgrace." The lawmakers visited the ICE processing centers in Louisiana where the students are detained, emphasizing their support for free speech. Neither student has been accused of criminal conduct, and their detention is seen as a violation of their constitutional rights amid a crackdown on immigrants. Lawmakers described those being held as political prisoners and highlighted concerns about unsanitary conditions, denial of medical treatment, and the chilling effect on free speech.</p>

          <p>A former oil executive and representative of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been granted significant authority to implement changes within the Department of Interior. This move has sparked alarm among conservation groups, who fear potential dismantling of national parks and public lands management. The order signed by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum gives Tyler Hassen sweeping power over administrative functions and funding within the department. Conservation groups criticize the appointment, suggesting it places unelected DOGE officials with limited experience in charge of national parks, while the Department of Interior defends the move as an effort to restore accountability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed the first RICO racketeering charges against members and associates of the migrant terrorist group Tren de Aragua (TdA) in New York. The charges, part of "Operation Take Back America," target 27 alleged members for crimes including human smuggling, sexual assault trafficking, and murder. The Trump State Department has designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization, and Attorney General Pam Bondi has vowed to dismantle the organization. The indictments detail the smuggling of "multadas" (indentured sex workers) from Venezuela into the U.S., with threats of violence used to keep them enslaved.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears likely to side with parents seeking the ability to opt their children out of elementary school instruction featuring storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case involves a dispute between families and the Montgomery County Board of Education over whether requiring children to participate in such instruction violates the parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom. Justices questioned the school board's decision to eliminate opt-outs, with several suggesting it was feasible to accommodate parents' religious objections. The court's decision, expected by early July, could have broad implications for public education and parental rights.</p>

Daybell represented herself in the trial, maintaining that her brother shot Vallow in self-defense.

          <p>Three more federal prosecutors have resigned following the dismissal of the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, citing pressure to admit wrongdoing or regret as a condition for reinstatement. The prosecutors refused to confess wrongdoing when they believed none existed, accusing the Justice Department of prioritizing obedience over legal and ethical obligations. The resignations follow the swearing-in of Jay Clayton as the new interim top prosecutor for the New York office. The Adams case was dismissed in April, with the judge noting that the prosecutors had followed all guidelines and had no improper motives.</p>

          <p>The FDA announced plans to phase out Yellow 5 and other synthetic food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, following pressure from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The move is framed as an "understanding" with food companies, rather than a formal ban, with the FDA encouraging the use of natural dyes instead. The decision follows increasing state-level bans on artificial food dyes and is seen as a victory for Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" movement. The article suggests that the true test of the movement will be addressing more pressing issues like excess sugar and sodium in processed foods.</p>
