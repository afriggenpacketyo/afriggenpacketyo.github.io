          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that seeks to defund public broadcasting. The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Washington, accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violating the First Amendment through viewpoint discrimination and illegal retaliation. The suit alleges the executive order aims to cut off funds to PBS due to the content of its programming, infringing on the network's editorial discretion. If implemented, the order would profoundly impact PBS's ability to provide diverse programming to Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the United States will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while decreasing reliance on China. He touted the increase to 50% as a way to ensure US Steel's survival, reflecting on how he "saved" US Steel with the 25% steel tariffs he implemented during his first term as president in 2018. The announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue after a lower court had ordered the administration to halt the taxes.

Akazawa emphasized Japan's demand for the U.S. to remove all additional tariffs on Japanese imports, highlighting the importance of boosting investment and addressing economic security issues. Both countries aim to achieve a win-win relationship through increased Japanese investment in the United States rather than relying on tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities are expressing anger and disappointment over the sport's 130-year history without a knighthood or damehood for its players. The Rugby Football League and Members of Parliament, including Speaker of the House Sir Lindsay Hoyle, are calling for recognition of the sport's stars, suggesting class prejudice may be a factor in the lack of honors. In contrast, rugby union, often associated with more middle-class roots, has had knighthoods for over a century, sparking debate about fairness in the honors system. Rugby league figures, like Kevin Sinfield, have also raised millions for charity, adding to the argument for recognition.</p>

          <p>Dodgers reliever Evan Phillips is scheduled to undergo Tommy John surgery and will miss the remainder of the season, manager Dave Roberts announced. Phillips had been sidelined for three weeks due to forearm discomfort and had not progressed in his recovery. This season, Phillips started on the injured list while recovering from a partially torn rotator cuff suffered in last year’s postseason. The team also announced that shortstop Mookie Betts was out of the lineup due to a toe injury and is considered day-to-day.</p>

          <p>A former Los Angeles Police Department reserve officer and his brother have been charged with insurance fraud related to a Bentley crash. Eric Benjamin Halem, and his brother Jacob Halem, allegedly misrepresented details in a $200,000 insurance claim. The investigation revealed that the Bentley had been rented by a Drive LA client and crashed three days before the brothers claimed Jacob crashed it. Authorities allege the brothers submitted staged photographs of the damaged Bentley and that Jacob Halem provided a false statement to corroborate his brother’s claim.</p>

Trump issued an executive order directing the removal of "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" from the institution's museums.</p>

          <p>Norway is addressing the issue of increasingly excessive celebrations among school leavers, known as russe, particularly involving party buses. These celebrations, starting weeks before exams, involve nightly partying, heavy drinking, and significant expenses, leading to concerns about teenagers' wellbeing and academic performance. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store and Minister of Education Kari Nessa Nordtun have expressed worries about the negative impacts, including social exclusion and peer pressure. The government plans to move the celebrations to the post-exam period to ensure a more inclusive and less disruptive graduation experience.</p>

The agreement concludes a legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claims to be a descendant of individuals in the photos. The images, daguerreotypes taken in 1850, will be placed in a museum near where the people in the photos were enslaved. The photos were commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz for discredited research to prove white superiority, and the case has fueled debate on how universities should respond to their historical ties to slavery.</p>

The GENIUS Act, a Senate bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, is expected to move to a cloture vote.

          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges contend Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to protections afforded to members of the legislative and executive branches. They call the prosecution an "egregious overreach" that threatens public trust in the judicial system and independent decision-making.</p>
