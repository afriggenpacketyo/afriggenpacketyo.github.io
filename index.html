        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The implementation of the UK's Online Safety Act, which requires age verification for sites with adult content, has led to a dramatic increase in VPN usage. Virtual Private Network applications now dominate the top download charts on Apple's App Store in the UK, with one provider reporting an 1800% spike in sign-ups. This suggests many users are circumventing the new age checks over privacy concerns related to submitting personal data. Cybersecurity experts warn that many free VPN services carry significant security and privacy risks, potentially exposing user data.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Cambridge University have found a rare and remarkably complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact. The print was pressed into the clay of a "soul house," a ceramic model of a building placed in tombs, likely by the craftsperson who made it between 2055 and 1650 B.C.E. Egyptologists have called the discovery exciting and unusual, noting that while fingerprints are sometimes found, a full handprint is exceptionally rare. The artifact will be a centerpiece in an upcoming exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum focusing on the artisans of ancient Egypt.</p>

          <p>With an October 1st government funding deadline approaching, divisions are emerging within the Republican party over the best strategy to avert a shutdown. Some conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus have suggested they could support a full-year continuing resolution (CR), which would freeze spending at current levels. However, this idea faces strong opposition from mainstream Republicans and defense hawks, who argue it would harm military funding. With only 14 legislative days remaining, the internal clash highlights the difficulty of reaching a consensus to pass the necessary spending bills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened the timeline for Russia to agree to a peace deal with Ukraine, reducing his previous 50-day deadline to just 10 or 12 days. Citing a lack of progress in negotiations, Trump expressed his disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the continued conflict and civilian casualties. If a ceasefire is not reached within this new timeframe, the U.S. plans to impose massive "secondary tariffs" on countries that continue to trade with Moscow. This move signals escalating pressure from the Trump administration to end the war.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive international study conducted by US and Chinese researchers has raised alarms about the global prevalence of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) in livestock. The research, which analyzed samples from 26 countries over 14 years, identified a diverse and abundant collection of these "superbug" genes in animal waste. The team developed a risk-assessment framework to map global hotspots where these genes are most likely to transfer to humans through bacteria like E. coli. This study provides a critical tool for guiding future policy to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

French and Hungarian leaders condemned the deal, with some MEPs calling it a "disaster" for failing to secure concessions from Washington.

          <h2>Gold Price Holds Firm as a Safe-Haven Asset Amid Market Fluctuations</h2>

          <p>The price of gold was recorded at $3,342.20 per ounce as of July 25, 2025, reflecting its continued status as a key commodity for investors. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, attracting interest during times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Its price is influenced by numerous factors, including global supply and demand, inflation rates, and interest rate policies. Because physical gold has historically held its value, it remains a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and protect against currency devaluation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, a simple yet powerful way to become more influential and likable at work is to practice active listening. This involves more than just hearing someone; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said to confirm understanding. This "superhero move," as she calls it, shows respect and competence, building trust with colleagues and managers. Research indicates that asking more questions makes a person more likable, which often correlates with better job performance reviews and career success.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, a disabled writer details the profound and humiliating challenges of finding safe, accessible housing in both the U.S. and Canada. The author, a wheelchair user, recounts experiences from being trapped in a high-rise during a fire alarm to facing community opposition when trying to build an accessible home. The piece argues that the lack of accessible housing is a continuation of historical discrimination and exclusion, forcing many disabled people into unsafe or undignified living situations. It calls for a shift in design and societal mindset to create homes that accommodate all bodies.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took the helm a year ago. The company's aircraft production has increased, deliveries are at an 18-month high, and analysts expect it to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year. Ortberg has focused on changing the company culture and improving quality, which has been praised by airline customers. Despite progress, Boeing still faces challenges, including an FAA cap on 737 Max production and unresolved labor issues at its defense unit.</p>

          <p>NHS England has criticized the British Medical Association (BMA) for its "increasingly hardline" stance on rejecting requests for striking resident doctors to return to work for emergencies. During the latest five-day walkout over pay, the NHS can request staff under a "derogation" process to ensure patient safety, but 18 such requests have been denied. The BMA contends that hospitals are misusing the system to cover for poor planning and non-urgent care. NHS officials argue the union is putting safety at risk by second-guessing the needs of doctors on the ground, particularly concerning cancer care.</p>
