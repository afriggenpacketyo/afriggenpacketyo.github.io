          <p>A team of researchers is working to create NeoTest, a rapid and affordable diagnostic test for neonatal sepsis, a major cause of infant mortality in developing countries. The current methods for testing are slow, expensive, and often inaccurate, leading to delayed treatment and hundreds of thousands of infant deaths annually. The NeoTest team aims to secure $120 million for an advance market commitment, incentivizing manufacturers to develop a test that provides results within minutes and costs around $8 per test. The initiative seeks funding primarily from middle-income countries that would directly benefit, marking a shift towards self-reliance in global health initiatives. This innovative approach could save countless lives by improving antibiotic targeting and reducing antibiotic resistance.</p>

          <p>Reece Galbraith has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for manslaughter after an explosion at his illegal cannabis factory resulted in the death of seven-year-old Archie York. Galbraith and Jason Laws were producing cannabis-infused sweets in a ground-floor flat when a build-up of butane gas caused a catastrophic blast, destroying several homes and killing both Archie and Laws. The explosion displaced dozens of residents and caused millions of dollars in damage to the local area, leaving Archie's family devastated and highlighting the severe consequences of illegal drug operations. Archie's mother confronted Galbraith in court, expressing her unforgiveness for the death of her son.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock has criticized Republican proposals to impose work requirements for Medicaid eligibility, arguing they would disproportionately harm hardworking Americans. Warnock cites studies showing that such requirements do not incentivize work and instead create bureaucratic hurdles that lead to coverage loss. He contends that providing healthcare access encourages employment by supporting a healthy workforce, advocating for expanded Medicaid coverage without these conditions. A Republican House budget resolution includes significant spending cuts to Medicaid through 2034, with work requirements being considered as a means to achieve these reductions, potentially impacting millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria after 14 years of civil war, a move hailed in Damascus as a chance for economic recovery and stability. The decision follows the establishment of a new interim government led by Ahmad al-Sharaa after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The sanctions relief is expected to facilitate aid delivery, encourage investment from neighboring countries, and enable the rebuilding of devastated infrastructure. While challenges remain, including corruption and the scale of economic damage, the move is seen as a significant step toward revitalizing the Syrian economy and stabilizing the region.</p>

          <p>A Muslim reformer argues that lasting peace in the Middle East requires the complete and unconditional surrender of Hamas and the Palestinian people, drawing parallels to the Allied forces' approach to Germany and Japan after World War II. He criticizes the international community for not compelling Palestinians to acknowledge defeat, allowing them to perpetuate a cycle of war and violence. The author believes that unconditional surrender would enable the silent majority to reject Islamist ideology and embrace modernity, ultimately leading to a post-Hamas, post-Islamist Gaza.</p>

The move comes amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, with both sides accusing each other of spreading false information about recent military clashes. India's government has directed X to block approximately 8,000 accounts and remove Pakistan-linked content, drawing criticism from press freedom activists. The blocked accounts belong to credible Indian news publications like Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat ,The Wire and journalists like Anuradha Bhasin, which has drawn criticism from press freedom activists.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, one day after Washington announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on the war-ravaged country.

Trump "encouraged President al-Sharaa to do a great job for the Syrian people," the readout said, and included a list of actions that the U.S. president urged al-Sharaa to take.</p>

          <p>Beijing’s moderate relaxation of export controls on some rare earths – raw materials essential in hi-tech and aerospace hardware – as part of a trade truce with the US reflects China’s goodwill in striving to de-escalate tensions even as it remains firmly in control of those critical metals, according to analysts. On Monday, Beijing agreed to pause or remove all non-tariff countermeasures imposed since April 2 , alongside the lowering of most tariffs imposed by the two countries, for 90 days, from today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's attacks on the courts follow a pattern seen in backsliding democracies, where political leaders undermine the judiciary to assert power. This strategy, called "court-baiting," involves enacting popular but likely illegal policies, provoking court challenges, and then using the unpopular decisions to discredit the judiciary. The president can thus choose favorable terrain on which to do battle with the judiciary, challenging the courts on policy issues that are popular with voters. To defend against court-baiting, defenders of the judiciary can combat court-baiting by reframing the executive’s policies to undercut their popular appeal.</p>

          <p>Many institutions and individuals still assume that mothers are the default parent, even when fathers are equally or more involved in childcare. Research shows that schools and doctor's offices are more likely to contact mothers, regardless of which parent is listed as the primary contact. This assumption can disrupt mothers' work and create frustration for fathers who want to be more involved. Outdated software systems and societal stereotypes contribute to the problem, highlighting the need for a shift in perceptions and practices to support more equitable parenting roles.</p>
