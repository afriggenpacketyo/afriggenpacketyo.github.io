            <h2>FDA Considers Outsourcing Food Safety Inspections to States</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 11:55:23 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The FDA is considering a plan to shift routine food safety inspections to state and local authorities, potentially freeing up resources for higher-priority and foreign inspections. This move, which requires congressional action, aims to streamline operations and reduce redundancies, with some FDA employees having worked on this shift for years. The FDA already outsources some inspections to 43 states and Puerto Rico, but the new plan could expand this arrangement, potentially leading to better food safety through a more efficient allocation of resources. However, concerns remain about the transition's timeline and resources, as well as the capacity of states without existing FDA contracts to conduct inspections.</p>

            <p>A batch of lercanidipine, a common blood pressure medication, has been recalled after it was discovered that some packs of 10mg tablets were incorrectly labeled as containing 20mg pills. The MHRA has issued an alert, urging patients taking the medication to check their packs, specifically looking for batch number MD4L07 with an expiry date of January 2028. While the incorrect strength is printed on the outside of the affected packs, the correct dose is printed on the blister strips inside and on the side of some of the boxes. Patients prescribed 10mg tablets should seek medical advice immediately, while those prescribed 20mg tablets should verify they have the correct strength.</p>

            <p>President Trump hinted at ongoing discussions between the U.S. and China regarding a potential tariff deal, suggesting an agreement could be reached within weeks. While he remained vague about direct communication with President Xi Jinping, Trump emphasized his belief that a deal would be achieved, regardless of whether formal agreements are made. This announcement comes amid escalating trade tensions, with the U.S. having imposed significant tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliating with its own levies. The potential deal could signal a shift in trade relations and impact global markets.</p>

            <p>Ukraine has imposed sanctions on three Chinese companies, escalating tensions between Kyiv and Beijing following accusations that China is supplying weapons to Russia. The sanctions will prevent the companies from conducting business with Ukraine and freeze any assets they hold within the country. This move follows claims by President Zelenskyy that Ukraine has intelligence indicating China is providing weapons to Russia, a claim Beijing denies. The sanctions mark a shift from Ukraine's previously neutral stance towards China and could further strain relations between the two nations.</p>

            <p>A coroner's report in Lancashire is urging the UK government to reassess eyesight rules for motorists, deeming the current self-reporting system "ineffective and unsafe" after inquests into four deaths caused by drivers with impaired vision. The coroner highlighted that the UK is among the few European countries without mandatory visual checks for drivers until the age of 70. The report detailed cases where drivers with known eyesight problems failed to declare them to the DVLA, resulting in fatal accidents. The Department for Transport acknowledges the need for reassessment, with potential changes to eyesight requirements as part of a broader road safety strategy.</p>

The project, led by Equinor, promised to power 500,000 homes and create over 1,500 jobs.

The escalating trade war, characterized by high tariffs imposed by both Washington and Beijing, is seen by some as an attempt to suppress China's development.

            <h2>Trump's Economic Policies Risk Disaster, Analysts Warn</h2>

            <p>President Trump's economic policies, including global tariffs and criticism of the Federal Reserve, are raising concerns about potential economic disaster. His trade levies, particularly the high tariff on Chinese goods, are hurting farmers, small businesses, and consumers. The diminished outlook for growth and corporate profits has led to a plunge in stock prices, and the country is facing higher borrowing costs and slower growth. The potential for political interference with the Fed's decisions further complicates the situation and could lead to a financial crisis.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration, which has accused him of being a member of MS-13, allegations his lawyer denies. Despite a court order to "facilitate" his return, the administration continues to resist his return to the US. The meeting, which appeared to take place in a hotel, was followed by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stating the detainee would remain in the country's custody. The senator called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love.</p>

            <h2>Tariffs Could Further Increase Auto Insurance Rates</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>New tariffs, including those specific to vehicles and parts, are expected to push auto insurance rates even higher. Tariffs are increasing the prices of parts, leading to more expensive maintenance and repairs. As repair costs rise, auto insurers will likely increase premiums to cover the higher costs of doing business. While insurance rates had begun to stabilize, the introduction of tariffs is expected to disrupt this trend, making it more expensive for drivers to own and operate a car. (not investment advice)</p>

Her lawyers allege the detention violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights, stemming from an op-ed she co-wrote in the campus newspaper. The State Department memo revoking her visa cited her involvement in associations "'that may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization'." Immigration officials took Öztürk into custody on March 25 and transported her to a detention center in Louisiana.</p>
