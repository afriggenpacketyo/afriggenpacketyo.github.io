          <p>Federal health officials have reported a salmonella outbreak across 18 states, affecting nearly four dozen people and leading to at least 16 hospitalizations, all linked to recalled cucumbers grown by Bedner Growers Inc. These cucumbers were sold at Bedner's Farm Fresh Markets locations in Florida and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Inc. to stores and restaurants across multiple states between April 29 and May 19. The CDC advises consumers to discard any cucumbers if the origin is unknown and to wash surfaces that may have come into contact with the contaminated produce. Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, typically appearing 6 hours to 6 days after exposure, and severe cases may require medical treatment. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied an emergency motion to stay a preliminary injunction, allowing a pro-LGBT organization to host an outdoor drag show open to all ages in Naples, Florida. Judge John Steele previously blocked the city from prohibiting the drag performance at Cambier Park and imposing an age requirement for attendance. The Naples PrideFest, scheduled for June 7, includes a drag performance, which the city had attempted to restrict to an indoor venue with an 18+ age limit. The city of Naples stated that its legal team is reviewing the order and determining next steps, while Naples Pride hailed the judge's decision as a victory for free speech.</p>

          <p>The State Department has instructed U.S. embassies and consulates to expand vetting for all visa applicants seeking to attend Harvard University, including students, faculty, and visitors. This "additional vetting" includes a complete screening of the applicant's online presence, with consular officers considering the lack of online presence as potentially evasive. The move is based on concerns that Harvard has "failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism." This new procedure will also serve as a pilot for expanded screening and vetting of visa applicants generally.</p>
