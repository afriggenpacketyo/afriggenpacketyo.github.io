        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC has launched an engaging interactive tool, "Cooler Than Me?", allowing users to compare their local weather with forecasts from cities around the world. This feature taps into Britain's cultural tendency to discuss and often lament the weather, offering a novel way to see if other places are indeed "greener and more pleasant." Users can explore the latest forecasts on the BBC Weather website, potentially transforming into armchair meteorologists. This playful approach encourages public engagement with meteorological data, moving beyond anecdotal observations to data-driven comparisons of global climate variations.</p>

          <p>A monumental $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, has been won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. This significant payout concludes a three-month streak without a grand prize winner, tying the game's record for consecutive drawings. The fortunate ticketholders will share the colossal sum, with options for a lump sum cash payment of approximately $410.3 million each or 30 escalating annual installments. This historic win, achieved against immense odds of 1 in 292.2 million, underscores the life-changing potential of lottery games, which also contribute significantly to public causes through ticket sales.

          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy, son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, is launching his first major tour in 45 years, "The Road to Us Tour." The 66-year-old, who stepped back from the limelight for a career in television writing and producing, had to relearn his own songs and guitar skills for this comeback. Cassidy, known for hits like "Da Doo Ron Ron" and his role in "The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries," expressed that performing now feels fresh as he focuses on storytelling and songs that resonate with him today. The 50-city tour, starting September 13, will feature classic hits, new music, and personal anecdotes from his unique career trajectory.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football team experienced a "full-blown debacle" with a 30-23 loss to UNLV, marking their second consecutive defeat and an 0-2 start for the first time since 2019. The article details how the Bruins displayed recurring problems, including a slow defense, an anemic offense struggling to sustain drives, and a propensity for opponents to make crucial plays. Despite a late fourth-quarter rally that offered a chance for a comeback, an interception sealed their fate. This defeat against a Mountain West Conference opponent significantly increases pressure on coach DeShaun Foster early in his second season, raising questions about the team's overall direction and performance.</p>

This fresh aggression comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin has escalated warnings against Western aid to Ukraine, with air raid alerts activated across the entire country. The deliberate targeting of civilian facilities has been condemned by Kyiv authorities.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying support against what they termed "oligarchic control" in the U.S. and New York. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist backed by progressives, vowed to freeze rent, increase housing, and raise taxes on the city's wealthiest 1%. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case" for democracy against billionaire donors and media oligarchs, criticizing mainstream Democrats for not fully supporting him. The event highlighted Mamdani's commitment to representing working-class and low-income communities, addressing issues like immigration and housing justice amidst a contentious mayoral race.</p>

Her defense argued the fire's origin was accidental and that Todd himself might have started it, citing his past arson suspicions.

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This groundbreaking technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, which causes water droplets on the surface to boil, triggering the formation of vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles grow to a critical point, they suddenly collapse, releasing energy and creating a strong force capable of propelling tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. Published in the peer-reviewed journal "Science," the study demonstrates that cavitation can serve as an incredibly efficient launching mechanism for micro-robotics.</p>

The chancellor's team is expected to argue that any fiscal gap must be filled by higher taxes or lower spending, emphasizing the need for long-term, pro-growth reforms to the tax system.

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who served in Iraq, is advocating for increased recognition and support for women who performed dangerous front-line roles in the military. She co-founded Sisters in Service, a community interest company that provides a supportive network for female military veterans working in healthcare. Dr. Bennett highlights the "very outdated idea" that only men deploy to the front line, emphasizing women's critical contributions in roles like female searching and providing cover. The article explains that many female veterans feel isolated and misunderstood after leaving service, often avoiding traditional support spaces due to misconceptions about their military experience.</p>

          <p>Mount Sinai, a site revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is at the center of a controversy as Egypt proceeds with a mega-tourism project. Plans include luxury hotels, villas, and shopping bazaars, transforming the long-isolated desert location and UNESCO World Heritage site. The indigenous Bedouin community, the Jebeleya tribe, has seen homes and eco-camps demolished with little compensation, even being forced to move graves. Critics argue this "Great Transfiguration Project" is imposed against local will, destroying the area's natural and spiritual characteristics. Despite international concerns from UNESCO and Greece, Egypt views the development as crucial for its flagging economy and tourism goals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a new immigration enforcement operation, "Patriot 2.0," targeting Massachusetts for arrests and deportations, a move confirmed by a Department of Homeland Security official. This operation, expected to last several weeks, focuses on immigrants released from local custody despite ICE agents' attempts to detain them. A DHS spokesperson criticized Boston's "sanctuary policies," claiming they protect criminals. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who previously testified before Congress defending such policies, stated her administration is preparing for potential federal National Guard deployment. Tensions are high as the administration intensifies its crackdown on "sanctuary cities."</p>

The Glória funicular swerved off its tracks and crashed into a building, resulting in 16 deaths and 21 injuries. Investigators stated that a visual check conducted hours before the accident found no anomalies in the cable or braking systems, and the scheduled maintenance plan was up to date. The accident occurred within 50 seconds of the cabins losing their balancing force.

The article highlights the effectiveness of these imitations, which can also include 2D decoys, heat-mimicking dummies, and radar reflectors.

His body, preserved in wax, lies in Assisi, a pilgrimage site that has seen increased visitors, as has Our Lady of Dolours Church in London, where he was baptized. Two miracles were attributed to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer.

South Korea, led by Son Heung-min's opening goal, appeared rejuvenated and capitalized on US errors.

Eighty-eight postal operators have suspended service to the US due to inability to comply with new procedures.

Concerns persist about potential long queues during the initial registration phase, particularly at busy points like Dover and Eurostar terminals.
