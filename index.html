        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation indicates significant doubt among the Taiwanese public regarding Donald Trump's willingness to defend the island from a potential Chinese invasion. The survey found that 44.8% of respondents believe Trump is not serious about preventing an attack by force, compared to 34.3% who think he is. This sentiment reflects a broader wave of pessimism and wavering confidence in the United States as a reliable security partner. The poll highlights growing anxiety in Taiwan over America's defense commitments under Trump's second term, a shift from previous years.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced strong third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, leading the company to raise its financial guidance for 2025. The automaker reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, citing a compelling vehicle portfolio and effective management. GM now anticipates adjusted earnings before interest and taxes between $12 billion and $13 billion for the full year and has also lowered its expected financial impact from tariffs. This positive outlook signals confidence in the company's performance heading into the final quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts anticipating earnings of 78 cents per share on revenue of $12.39 billion. The beverage company has faced weaker demand in key markets like the U.S. and Latin America in recent quarters, though analysts remain more bullish on its prospects compared to rival PepsiCo. The company is also reportedly considering the sale of its British coffee chain, Costa Coffee, which it acquired in 2019 but has not delivered the expected growth.

          <h2>The Theory of 'Enshittification' Explains the Perceived Decline of Major Internet Platforms</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Journalist and activist Cory Doctorow's theory of "enshittification" describes a three-stage process explaining why internet platforms like Amazon, Facebook, and Google seem to degrade over time. Initially, platforms offer great value to attract users, then they pivot to benefit business customers, locking both groups in. In the final stage, the platform extracts value from its business customers and users, causing the service quality to plummet for everyone except shareholders. Doctorow argues this decline is driven by a lack of competition and insufficient regulation, which allows tech giants to exploit their captive audiences without fear of them leaving for better alternatives.</p>

          <p>Bernardo Bravo, the president of a lime growers association in Michoacan, Mexico, was found killed in his vehicle on Monday. His death follows recent public statements in which he condemned the pervasive extortion of producers by organized crime cartels, describing their financial demands as unbearable. For years, criminal groups like the Los Viagras and others have targeted the region's lucrative lime and avocado industries, demanding a cut of the profits and creating a climate of fear. This incident highlights the ongoing struggle for control and the severe danger faced by those who speak out against cartel operations in the state.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be incarcerated, beginning a five-year sentence for his role in a campaign finance conspiracy involving funds from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The 70-year-old, who was president from 2007 to 2012, entered Paris's La Santé prison while maintaining his innocence and describing the jailing as an act of revenge. He will be held in the prison's isolation wing for his own safety, with limited contact and one hour of daily exercise. His lawyer has already filed a request for his release pending an appeal.</p>

          <p>A group of former tenants of Equity Residential, one of the largest corporate landlords in the U.S., is organizing a first-of-its-kind rent debt strike to demand the cancellation of tens of thousands of dollars in back rent. Organized with the Debt Collective, the campaign targets what they describe as predatory practices that trap renters in a cycle of debt and housing insecurity, making it difficult to find new housing. The strike utilizes a new online tool that helps tenants document landlord issues and generate formal dispute letters to challenge the legitimacy of their debts. This action represents a new front in debt resistance, focusing on corporate landlords.</p>

          <p>Scientists report that the population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale has grown for the fourth consecutive year, reaching an estimated 384 individuals. This slight increase offers a sign of hope after the species' population declined by about 25% between 2010 and 2020 due to ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement. Researchers credit new conservation measures, particularly in Canada, for the positive trend. While the recovery remains slow and fragile, the birth of 11 calves and the entry of new females into the reproductive pool provide cautious optimism for the whale's future.</p>

          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached £20.2 billion in September, the highest for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase was driven by rising debt interest payments, which counteracted higher tax revenues. The figures present a significant challenge for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget, where tax hikes are anticipated to align with fiscal rules. Total borrowing for the first half of the financial year now stands at £99.8 billion, the second-highest on record for this period, underscoring the difficult economic landscape the government is navigating.

This latest breach has prompted a security review at the Louvre and serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of priceless artifacts.

          <p>An opinion article expresses skepticism about Instagram's latest teen safety feature, which automatically places users under 18 into a more restrictive 'PG-13' content setting. The author argues that given Meta's history of failed promises and prioritizing engagement over safety, this new measure is likely another hollow gesture. Citing internal documents and whistleblower research showing previous safety tools were ineffective, the piece contends that the platform remains a dangerous space for minors. The author calls for stronger regulation and for parents to proactively teach online safety, as trusting tech companies to self-regulate has proven to be a failing strategy.</p>

Overfishing is devastating coral reefs, deforestation is rampant, and nearly all native lemur species are threatened with extinction. Traditional conservation efforts, such as creating protected areas, have largely failed because they do not address the root cause: people's desperate need to exploit natural resources for survival.

          <p>An opinion article argues that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) tactic of entering homes without judicial warrants is a reckless policy that could lead to violent shootouts. The author asserts that this practice, justified by the Trump administration through an obscure 1798 law, bypasses fundamental Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. This creates a dangerous scenario where residents, legally protected by "castle doctrine" state laws allowing the use of deadly force against intruders, might mistake federal agents for criminal home invaders. The piece calls for an immediate end to these warrantless raids to prevent needless bloodshed.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Compton are investigating an incident where a female customer shot and killed a man who was reportedly groping and attacking people inside a store. According to the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department, the man became aggressive after being asked to leave, damaging merchandise and threatening patrons with an object believed to be a knife. Fearing for her safety and that of others, the woman fired a warning shot before firing a second, fatal shot when the man turned toward her. Investigators are now seeking additional witnesses who were present during the altercation.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Sequoia Park Zoo in Eureka, California, were surprised to find a wild American black bear inside the zoo grounds before opening hours. The bear was observed leaning on a gate, seemingly interacting with the zoo's three resident black bears through their habitat fencing. The animal, which did not behave aggressively, is believed to have entered from the adjacent Sequoia Park. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife safely guided the "polite visitor" back into the woods through a service gate without incident. The zoo's perimeter fence was found to be secure and intact.</p>

          <p>Following last week's significant rainfall, parts of Southern California could see more precipitation this week with a slight chance of light rain and thunderstorms. The National Weather Service forecasts a 10% chance of rain for Los Angeles County on Tuesday night, primarily affecting interior valleys and mountain areas. Meteorologists also noted a low risk of dry lightning, which occurs when rain evaporates before hitting the dry ground, potentially sparking fires. However, the recent soaking has temporarily reduced the overall fire danger. This potential moisture is not expected to alter the forecast for a dry winter due to returning La Niña conditions.</p>

          <p>A live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton resulted in an artillery round exploding mid-air, showering a California Highway Patrol vehicle with shrapnel and forcing an early end to the event. Experts note that firing live munitions, such as the M777 howitzers used, over the busy Interstate 5 is an extremely rare and unconventional practice for the base. Typically, such large-scale artillery exercises are conducted in more remote inland areas. The incident has raised questions about safety protocols and the decision-making process that led to the live-fire exercise over a major public highway, which required a last-minute freeway closure due to safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Exports of Chinese rare earth magnets to the United States fell by 28.7% in September compared to the previous month, marking the second straight monthly decline. This drop reverses a brief recovery and comes amid ongoing trade tensions and Washington's efforts to develop alternative supply chains for the critical materials. The magnets are essential for electric vehicles, defense systems, and electronics. The decrease in shipments reflects tighter Chinese scrutiny on export licenses and precedes a recent expansion of Beijing's export control regime, signaling further potential disruptions for industries reliant on these components.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cruciate ligament tear, such as the recent one suffered by German footballer Lena Oberdorf, is a serious and common injury in sports. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) stabilizes the knee and typically tears during non-contact movements like sudden stops or changes in direction. Treatment can be surgical, replacing the ligament with a graft, or conservative, focusing on muscle strengthening. Recovery is lengthy, often taking six to nine months before a return to competition. Women are at a higher risk for such injuries due to anatomical and hormonal factors, highlighting the need for continued research into prevention strategies.</p>
