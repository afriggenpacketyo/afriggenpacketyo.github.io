          <p>President Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant economic sanctions. While the White House has described recent discussions as productive, the specific terms of a peace deal remain uncertain, with Trump suggesting a "swapping of territories" could be involved. This will be the first face-to-face summit between an American president and Putin since 2021.</p>

          <p>A Fremont man, Jeffrey Ying, has been charged with felony theft for allegedly stealing rare Chinese manuscripts valued at over $216,000 from the UCLA library system. According to federal investigators, Ying used multiple aliases and a flawed library card system to check out valuable antique books, some dating to the 13th century. He would then allegedly return "dummy books" with forged labels in their place, a scheme that may have spanned five years. Ying was arrested before a planned flight to China, and authorities found fraudulent IDs and book-making materials in his hotel room.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company and actress Gina Carano have settled a lawsuit she filed after being fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over her social media posts. While settlement details remain private, Lucasfilm issued a statement praising Carano's professionalism and expressing hope for future collaborations. The article analyzes the settlement not as a case of "corporate capitulation" but as a reasonable resolution to what it calls an overreaction by Disney. It argues that while Carano's posts were provocative, her firing was an extreme response to social media pressure.</p>

Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom hosted the Texas lawmakers, stating his administration is prepared to place a measure on the November ballot to redraw California's own congressional map to "nullify" the GOP's moves.

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are facing a significant setback after learning that star offensive tackle Rashawn Slater will miss the entire 2025 season due to a ruptured patellar tendon. Head coach Jim Harbaugh described the season-ending injury as a "gut punch" that took the wind out of the team. Slater's absence forces a major reshuffle of the offensive line, with Joe Alt moving to left tackle and Trey Pipkins III likely stepping into the starting right tackle role. The team plans to explore the free-agent market to add depth to the depleted line.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has noted a significant rise in complaints regarding models in high street fashion ads who appear "unhealthily thin." Recent ads from major retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S have been banned, sparking concerns among industry experts about a potential return to the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s. While brands defend the models as healthy, the ASA has ruled that specific poses, lighting, and styling have made them appear underweight. This trend coincides with the rise of weight-loss drugs and social media trends promoting extreme thinness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has instructed the U.S. military to develop plans for targeting drug cartels in Latin America, according to a source familiar with the directive.

The administration has previously designated several cartels and gangs, including MS-13 and Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles, as foreign terrorist organizations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated this designation allows the use of intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense to target these groups.</p>

Based on hundreds of interviews, the biography is filled with anecdotes about his rudeness, poor judgment in business dealings, and a lack of self-awareness.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would permit alternative investments, such as cryptocurrency and private equity, in 401(k) retirement plans. The move aims to "democratize" retirement savings by giving workers access to asset classes that have the potential for high returns, but also carry higher risks and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While the private equity industry has long sought access to the vast retirement market, it is unclear how quickly employers would adopt these new, more complex options for their workers.

          <p>A new documentary, "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley," provides an intimate and honest look at the life of the influential musician who died in 1997 at age 30. Director Amy Berg moves beyond the typical narrative of a doomed artist, instead focusing on Buckley's complex personality, creative influences, and internal conflicts with sudden fame. Through archival footage, personal writings, and interviews with his mother and close confidantes, the film explores his turbulent upbringing and artistic blossoming in New York. The review praises the film for thoughtfully dimensionalizing a one-album wonder and handling the tragic end of his life with care.</p>

          <p>A BBC article delves into the potential negative consequences of using hook-up apps like Grindr, focusing on the experiences of young gay men. It highlights stories of individuals who initially found the apps exciting but later felt the experience became addictive and damaging to their self-esteem. The piece describes a cycle where low moods lead to seeking validation through casual sexual encounters, which in turn can leave users feeling empty and objectified. It raises questions about whether the normalization of easy-access sex is making it more challenging to form meaningful, non-sexual connections within the GBTQ community.</p>

          <p>The president of Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU), a unique institution in Suzhou that bridges Chinese and Western academia, has identified geopolitics as the greatest challenge to academic freedom. Xi Youmin stated that global division and conflict are permeating universities and scientific research, creating an abnormal environment where political pressure stifles inquiry. He argued that one way to ease this tension on campuses is for China to improve understanding by easing visa restrictions and allowing more foreign students and visitors into the country. The university itself is a joint venture between institutions in China and the UK.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, formally ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. In a ceremony with President Donald Trump, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev committed to opening diplomatic relations and respecting each other's territorial integrity. A key part of the deal is the establishment of a transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, which will be developed with exclusive rights by the United States.

The article reflects on the legacies of the remaining pioneers from the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s, who ventured beyond Earth's orbit. These last few "Moon men" include Buzz Aldrin, David Scott, and Charles Duke, who walked on the lunar surface, and Fred Haise and Harrison Schmitt. Their stories are recounted as NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon in the coming years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent decision to approve an occupation of Gaza City is driven by his political dependence on his far-right coalition partners. This move is opposed by both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the Israeli public, who favor ending the war with a hostage deal. The article suggests that Netanyahu's primary goal is his own political survival, which requires placating hard-right parties that advocate for annexing and resettling Gaza. President Trump's hands-off approach and rhetoric have further tilted the situation toward these more absolutist outcomes.</p>

          <p>Independent UK Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe has admitted he wrongly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as possible "illegal migrants." Lowe posted on social media that he had alerted authorities to a dinghy coming ashore, demanding mass deportations. It was later revealed the boat contained a four-person crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning of his mistake, the MP apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, throwing out a district judge's criminal contempt order related to the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case began when U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found officials may have willfully defied his order to halt the removal of migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. However, a 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated that finding, with the majority arguing the lower court's order raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions" like foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will lower the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. This move brings Canada in line with actions already taken by the European Union and the United Kingdom. The coordinated effort is designed to further restrict Russia's oil revenues, a crucial source of funding for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Canada's Finance Minister stated the measure is intended to ratchet up economic pressure on Moscow and limit its ability to finance the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>
