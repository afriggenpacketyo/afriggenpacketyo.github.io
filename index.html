          <p>California's snowpack is at 90% of average, with more storms expected.  While northern and central regions are well-supplied, southern California remains in drought conditions. The Los Angeles Times article presents a balanced view of the state's water situation, but the emphasis on the positive aspects of the snowpack might downplay the ongoing drought concerns in the south.  The mention of Trump's administration's interest in California water management might subtly suggest a political bias.</p>
