          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway for the suspect who shot and killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah Valley University event. Authorities have released images and video of a college-aged person of interest and recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used in what they are calling a targeted political assassination. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, as investigators analyze evidence including palm prints and shoe prints left at the scene.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Ukrainian children remain in Russia after being forcibly deported from occupied territories since the 2022 full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian government has made their return a precondition for peace talks, a demand now supported by a coalition of 38 countries and the European Union. While Russia denies the abductions, claiming it "rescued" the children, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin over the unlawful transfers, which are considered a war crime.</p>

The judge noted Riley's leading role in planning the revenge act, while the gunman who fired the shots remains at large.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy experienced zero growth in July, largely due to a 1.3% contraction in the manufacturing sector, the sharpest monthly decline in a year. While the services sector showed some resilience, the overall flatline figure puts pressure on the government to stimulate growth ahead of the upcoming budget. The Office for National Statistics noted the economy has continued to slow over the past three months, though it still expanded by 0.2% during that period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI's handling of the initial hours of the Charlie Kirk murder investigation has drawn sharp criticism, focusing on the social media activity of Director Kash Patel. Patel, a pro-Trump influencer before his appointment, prematurely announced a suspect was in custody on X, only for the Bureau to retract the statement shortly after, leading to public confusion and accusations of incompetence. This article argues that the director's approach is ill-suited for leading a sensitive investigation and risks undermining public trust in the law enforcement agency.</p>

          <p>The recent deployment of US Navy ships to the Venezuelan coast for an anti-drug mission aligns with a strategy previously advocated by Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. Months ago, she suggested the US treat the Maduro regime as a law-enforcement target, specifically proposing a major anti-narcotics operation in the Caribbean. The article explores how the opposition's narrative framing Nicolás Maduro as a "narco-terrorist" may have encouraged the Trump administration's military posture, a gamble that could be seen as inviting US intervention.</p>

          <p>A bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales has advanced to the House of Lords for a two-day debate, following its passage in the House of Commons. The bill's sponsor, Lord Falconer, urged peers to scrutinize but not block the legislation, arguing the current law causes "terrible suffering." The debate features powerful arguments from both sides, with former Prime Minister Theresa May expressing concern about inadequate safeguards, while others champion the right of terminally ill individuals to choose how they die.</p>

          <p>The Oxford Union has condemned its incoming president, George Abaraonye, for social media posts that appeared to celebrate the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Abaraonye, who had debated Kirk at the university society in May, reportedly posted a message reading "Charlie Kirk got shot loool." He has since deleted the comments, stating that he reacted impulsively and that his words do not reflect his values, while also extending condolences to Kirk's family. The Union has distanced itself from his remarks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can temporarily block Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood while legal challenges proceed. The block stems from a provision in a tax bill that ends Medicaid payments for one year to certain abortion providers, which Planned Parenthood argues illegally restricts access to its non-abortion healthcare services. The ruling reverses a lower court's decision and means over a million patients may not be able to use their Medicaid insurance at the organization's clinics nationwide.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's killing demonstrates the danger of eliminating the Senate filibuster. As President Trump and his allies call for a crackdown on political opponents, the filibuster remains a key procedural obstacle preventing the majority party from passing repressive "emergency laws" without bipartisan support. The article cautions Democrats against forcing a government shutdown, as such a move could provoke Senate Republicans into using the "nuclear option" to abolish the filibuster, ultimately handing more power to Trump.</p>

          <p>Hakyung Lee, a woman on trial in New Zealand, has admitted to killing her two young children, whose bodies were discovered in suitcases four years after their deaths. Prosecutors say she acknowledged giving her children a fatal dose of an antidepressant in 2018 before fleeing to South Korea. However, her defense is arguing that she is not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming the death of her husband the previous year had sent her into a severe depressive spiral.</p>

          <p>Russia's recent drone incursion into Polish airspace is being interpreted by geopolitical analysts as an example of a "salami-slicing" strategy. This tactic involves a series of small, incremental provocations designed to test an adversary's resolve without triggering a major military response. Analysts argue that Russia has frequently used this approach to probe NATO's defenses, and that the drone incident is a deliberate test of the alliance's unity and response capabilities, putting pressure on Western nations to react decisively.</p>
