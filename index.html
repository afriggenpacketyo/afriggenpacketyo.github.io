          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7 million penalty, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for violations related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The fine includes Â£104.5 million for sewage breaches and Â£18.2 million for "undeserved dividends," marking the first time Ofwat has penalized a water company for such payouts. This action follows criticism of Thames Water's performance, including sewage discharges and leaks, as the company grapples with a Â£20 billion debt. The company secured an emergency Â£3 billion loan in March to avoid collapse and serves a quarter of the UK's population. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Overnight into Wednesday morning, hundreds of Ukrainian drones attacked Russia, with dozens targeting Moscow and causing flight disruptions. Russia's Defense Ministry claims to have shot down 296 drones across 12 regions, including Moscow, while Moscow's governor reported 42 drones downed in the Moscow region, causing damage to three homes. Ukraine's Counter-Disinformation Center reported "some pretty good hits," targeting facilities involved in aviation, missile, drone technology, microelectronics, IT, robotics, and medical equipment production. This escalation in attacks from both sides follows increasing frustration from President Trump regarding stalled ceasefire efforts, with the U.S. and Ukraine awaiting Russia's promised peace memorandum.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields near record highs, potentially triggering a carry trade unwind. Higher Japanese government bond yields could prompt Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., impacting U.S. tech stocks and strengthening the yen. Some analysts warn of a potential global financial market crisis due to increased borrowing costs and reduced global growth, while others anticipate a more gradual decline in the carry trade unwind due to eroding confidence in the U.S. dollar.

The visit underscores Merzâ€™s commitment to the war in Ukraine and reestablishing German leadership among European allies, particularly in light of diminishing U.S. support for NATO. Discussions are expected to focus on continued military assistance, specifically the long-range Taurus missile system, with Merz having previously expressed openness to exporting the system. Merz has emphasized Germany's support for Ukraine and the use of sanctions to pressure Russia into a ceasefire, highlighting the critical importance of European unity in the face of the ongoing conflict.</p>

The spacecraft broke up during re-entry into the atmosphere, with debris falling into the Indian Ocean, indicating that further engineering work is needed, particularly on the upper-stage vehicle. Despite the failure to collect data on heat shield tiles due to the uncontrolled spin, the flight showed progress in fixing ascent-related issues from previous tests.

          <p>Senior police and security leaders have voiced concerns regarding the government's proposals for early prisoner release. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued that the plans "could be of net detriment to public safety." Concerns include the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail if there is a move away from short sentences. Signatories included heads of the Metropolitan Police, MI5, the National Crime Agency, and the National Police Chiefs' Council.</p>

          <p>European businesses' optimism regarding growth and profitability in China has reached a record low, influenced by economic downturns and rising geopolitical tensions, according to an annual survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce. The survey, conducted before the intensification of the China-US trade war, revealed that only 29% of respondents were optimistic about growth prospects in China over the next two years. Market access and regulatory barriers remain widespread, with one-third of survey respondents not expecting to see meaningful improvements.</p>

Nearly three-quarters of respondents reported worsening business conditions, and the proportion of companies planning to expand operations has fallen to a record low. Despite these challenges, some European companies are increasing their reliance on Chinese components due to lower prices, which complicates efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese exports.</p>

Sir Mark argued that without significant investment, there will be no restoration of neighborhood policing and no halving of knife crime or violence against women and girls, all of which are government promises.

The report, by the London Drugs Commission, argues that current rules cannot be justified and that the criminal justice system should focus on dealers, not users. The report suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act and regulating it under the Psychoactive Substances Act, aiming to reduce racial disproportionality in policing.
