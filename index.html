        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed tax bill is encountering resistance from Republican lawmakers due to disagreements over several key issues. The primary sticking points include the amount of cuts to be made, particularly to programs like Medicaid, with some conservatives pushing for steeper reductions to address the national debt, which currently stands at $36 trillion. Another area of contention is the proposed tripling of the local tax deduction (SALT) for couples, with lawmakers from high-tax states arguing that the cap is insufficient. Negotiations are ongoing to find a compromise that can garner enough support for the bill to pass both the House and Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota saw the failure of a proposal to ban the "tush push," a play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal fell short of the required 75% majority, with the Eagles and several other teams voting against the ban. The Eagles celebrated the decision, posting "push on" graphics and highlights of the play on social media. The Packers had argued that the play was unsafe and lacked skill, but the NFL had previously stated that no injuries had been reported from its use.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially accepted a Boeing 747-8 luxury jetliner from the Qatari government, with plans to upgrade it for use as Air Force One. Experts caution that reworking the plane to meet Air Force One standards could take years and cost a significant amount of money. Democratic lawmakers and independent watchdogs argue the gift violates the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. The White House claims the plane is a gift to the Department of Defense and will follow required legal protocols.</p>
