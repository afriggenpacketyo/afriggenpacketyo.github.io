          <p>In a dramatic political standoff, Texas Republicans have voted to authorize the arrest of Democratic legislators who fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. The move empowers state troopers to locate and return the absent lawmakers to the House chamber, though the warrants are only enforceable within Texas. The Democrats left to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to pass a new congressional map that would significantly favor the GOP.</p>

          <p>New guidance from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that patients coming off obesity drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive structured support for at least a year. This advice aims to help individuals maintain their weight loss, as studies show many regain a significant portion of weight after stopping the injections. The guidance emphasizes the need for long-term behavioral changes, healthy eating, and physical activity to ensure lasting results.</p>

          <p>The global competition for rare earth minerals, essential for everything from electronics to military hardware, is intensifying, with developing nations becoming a key front line. China currently dominates the supply chain, controlling the majority of mining and over 85% of processing worldwide. This has left the United States and other Western nations vulnerable, prompting a scramble to diversify their sources and invest in new mining and processing capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed paperwork to roll back a Biden-era policy that permits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to offer abortion services. The current policy allows the VA to provide abortions in cases of sexual assault or incest, or to protect the veteran's health, even in states with bans. The proposed rule change seeks to block this access, arguing the policy is legally questionable and out of step with congressional limits on federal funding for abortions.</p>

The smoke is particularly dangerous for children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing conditions, and is linked to both immediate respiratory problems and long-term health issues.</p>
