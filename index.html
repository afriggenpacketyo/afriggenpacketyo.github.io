          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, located near her hometown in Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen. The life-size sculpture, which replaced a wooden version set on fire in 2020, was reported missing by the American artist who commissioned it, Brad Downey. Local residents speculate that the statue may have been vandalized or melted down for cash, with some expressing that they would not miss the sculpture. The statue had previously been criticized for its unrefined appearance and was seen by some as a mockery of the former first lady, who has not been seen in Sevnica since 1985, though the town has capitalized on her image with branded products.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a civilian bus in the town of Bilopillia, in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, has reportedly killed nine people and injured seven others. Ukrainian officials have condemned the attack as a cynical war crime, while Russia claims it hit a military staging area in Sumy. This incident occurred shortly after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022 in Istanbul, which resulted in an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war, but no breakthrough on ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen are stuck in South Korea after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary, and Pyongyang refuses to communicate with Seoul to arrange their repatriation. The men, who insist they want to return home, have been in South Korean custody for over three months, longer than any other reluctant defectors in history. This situation reflects the increasingly hostile relationship between North and South Korea, with Pyongyang designating the South as a "hostile state" and cutting off all communication channels. Experts suggest the fishermen may remain stranded until inter-Korean relations improve, possibly after South Korea's upcoming presidential election.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, finding that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, which led to genetic mutations that helped them adapt to extreme environments.</p>

Biden responded that he was 'well-meaning' and knew what he was doing.
