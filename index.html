          <p>As negotiations between Russia and Ukraine falter, the Trump administration is redirecting its diplomatic efforts toward the Middle East, seeking to broker deals in Gaza and with Iran. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced progress toward a temporary truce in Gaza, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution. The administration believes new terms for ensuring continued talks after an initial hostage release and ceasefire will appeal to both Israel and Hamas. Trump also revealed he advised Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu against striking Iranian nuclear facilities, citing progress in negotiations with Iran and the potential for a nuclear agreement. Optimism surrounds these developments, though challenges remain, especially with Hamas. </p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that Harvard should cap its international student enrollment to create more spots for American students. This proposal follows the Department of Homeland Security's recent attempt to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, which was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Trump expressed concern that about one-fourth of Harvard's student body is international, arguing that preference should be given to American students. The White House declined to comment on whether Trump's remarks represent a new policy, but the administration has been increasingly scrutinizing international students, particularly those involved in campus protests. </p>

          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected quarterly results, but the market response was muted, with investors noting that foreign exchange tailwinds significantly contributed to the improved outlook. The company's combined annual recurring revenue (ARR) for Data Cloud and Agentforce exceeded $1 billion, indicating progress on AI initiatives. Salesforce also announced the acquisition of Informatica, aimed at strengthening its Data Cloud and AI strategy. While Salesforce's second-quarter revenue and earnings guidance came in above expectations, investors remain cautious due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US judge indicated that the Trump administration's bid to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist, is likely unconstitutional. Judge Michael Farbiarz wrote that the governmentâ€™s justification, citing a threat to US foreign policy, could lead to arbitrary enforcement. However, Farbiarz did not order Khalil's release, citing insufficient response to another charge regarding undisclosed personal details in his residency application. Attorneys for Khalil argue his detention is an attempt to suppress free speech. </p>
