          <p>Authorities in Portugal have located a body during the search for Greg Monks, a 38-year-old Scottish man who went missing after leaving the main strip in Albufeira. Monks, who was visiting the Algarve resort with friends for a stag party, was reported missing last week. The Portuguese national Policia Judiciaria confirmed the discovery of the body in the Cerro de Aguia area, although no further details about the identification or circumstances surrounding his death have been released. The investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of death and to officially identify the body. The tone of the article is neutral and somber, reflecting the gravity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates following a weak ADP jobs report. Trump expressed his frustration on Truth Social, stating that Powell should lower the rate and criticizing the Fed's actions compared to Europe. The ADP report revealed that private payrolls increased by only 37,000 in May, significantly below the expected 110,000. Trump has consistently advocated for lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, but the Fed remains independent in its monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Vox report examines the mental and emotional impact of slaughterhouse work on employees, revealing high rates of anxiety, depression, and perpetration-induced traumatic stress (PITS). The article cites personal accounts of slaughterhouse workers who struggle with alcoholism, dissociation, and violent thoughts as a result of their daily experiences. The fast-paced and often brutal nature of slaughterhouse work can lead to desensitization and trauma, with some workers experiencing recurring nightmares and flashbacks. Researchers face challenges in gathering data due to limited access to slaughterhouse worker populations, particularly undocumented immigrants, and the lack of cooperation from meat companies, thus the full extent of the psychological impact remains largely unknown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The collapse of the Dutch government, triggered by right-wing leader Geert Wilders' withdrawal from the coalition, has created political turmoil in the Netherlands just weeks before it is set to host the NATO summit. Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) left the government due to disagreements over immigration policy and defense spending. The collapse has led to the resignation of Prime Minister Dick Schoof and the anticipation of snap elections. Experts suggest that Wilders' exit was influenced by the upcoming NATO summit and the pressure to increase defense spending, which would require tax increases or spending cuts.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a Â£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure projects across England, benefiting mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, with significant allocations for Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. The move marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. The investment aims to address regional disparities and boost growth in areas facing electoral challenges.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that UK workers are taking fewer sick days, with the average time lost per worker in 2024 being 4.4 days. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that 148.9 million working days were lost due to illness or injury, equating to 2% of total working hours. Minor illnesses remain the most frequent cause of absence, followed by musculoskeletal problems. Despite the decrease, concerns persist that many workers are going to work while ill due to the low rate of statutory sick pay.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10, after a nine-year absence. The item was discontinued in 2016 due to kitchen preparation complexities, but has been a highly requested item since then. The new Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a departure from the original grilled or fried chicken options. The company launched a promotional webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, highlighting fan requests and petitions for the wrap's return, emphasizing the fan-driven movement that led to its comeback.</p>

          <p>The National Trust has covered up a piece of art at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire after it was tampered with by a member of the public. The artwork, called Virtuous Woman, invited visitors to stitch names of women they admired onto a textile display. After someone stitched over JK Rowling's name, feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet removed the covering. The National Trust has taken the piece off display to investigate the damage and consider next steps, while Rowling has been approached for comment.</p>
