          <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, then-Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Donald Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in Department of Justice files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The briefing, which occurred weeks before the DOJ decided against releasing the files, also noted that many other high-profile individuals were named. The report specified that the files contained unverified hearsay and that being mentioned is not an indication of wrongdoing. The White House has dismissed the story as fake news, while Trump has since directed the DOJ to seek the unsealing of related grand jury transcripts amid public pressure.</p>

          <p>Three police officers in Lorain, Ohio, were seriously injured after a gunman launched what authorities are calling a targeted ambush. The incident occurred as two officers were parked eating lunch, when a 28-year-old suspect, who was reportedly lying in wait with an 'arsenal of weapons,' opened fire with a high-powered rifle. A third officer who responded to the call for backup was also shot and wounded upon arrival. Officers returned fire, and the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. The motive for the violent attack on law enforcement remains under investigation, marking a difficult day for the local community.</p>

          <p>The family of Keith McAllister, who tragically died after being pulled into an MRI machine by the force of a 20-pound chain he was wearing, has retained legal counsel. The family's attorney stated they are seeking to ensure accountability and prevent similar incidents, highlighting the critical importance of safety protocols at medical imaging facilities. McAllister's daughter clarified that, contrary to some reports, her father was invited into the MRI room by a technician to assist his wife but was not warned about the danger of metal. The incident occurred at Nassau Open MRI in Westbury, New York, and has raised serious questions about the facility's procedures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in Florida. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the request did not meet the high legal standard required for breaching grand jury secrecy, stating that the court's 'hands are tied' by existing legal precedent. This decision came shortly before reports emerged that President Trump had been previously informed his name was in the Epstein files. The ruling effectively halts one avenue for disclosure, though separate requests to unseal materials in New York are still pending, continuing the complex legal battle over the files.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to issue a subpoena compelling the Department of Justice to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein. The motion passed with bipartisan support, as three Republican representatives joined Democrats to approve the measure, which now requires the signature of Chairman James Comer to be officially issued. This action increases pressure on the DOJ for transparency regarding the Epstein investigation. Separately, the committee also issued a subpoena for a deposition from convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, scheduled to take place at the federal prison where she is incarcerated, signaling a multi-pronged congressional push for more information.</p>

The legal action responds to Owens' repeated and widely circulated claims that the first lady was born male, a conspiracy theory the Macrons label as 'outlandish' and false. The lawsuit states that Owens' campaign was designed to harass and cause pain, and that legal action became necessary after she refused multiple requests for a retraction. Owens has publicly dismissed the lawsuit, standing by her allegations and framing the legal challenge as an attack on her First Amendment rights.</p>

The research, which reviewed dozens of studies, found that a 7,000-step daily count was linked to a 47% lower risk of death and significant reductions in the risk of dementia, heart disease, and cancer mortality compared to taking only 2,000 steps. The study's authors propose that 7,000 steps could be a more realistic and achievable public health target, while still offering substantial improvements in health outcomes for the general population.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, President Trump has enacted a sweeping and aggressive overhaul of U.S. immigration policy, backed by the largest domestic enforcement funding in the nation's history. This article from NPR reviews the administration's 'shock and awe' approach, which aims to fulfill the campaign promise of carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history. The policies have moved swiftly to dismantle previous frameworks and intensify enforcement actions against migrants living in the U.S. without authorization. The changes represent one of the most significant and rapid shifts in federal policy under the current administration, impacting communities and enforcement agencies nationwide.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's public pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not about monetary policy but a dangerous push for 'fiscal dominance.' The author contends that forcing the central bank to lower interest rates would serve the executive branch's need to finance massive government borrowing, a practice historically linked to inflation and economic stagnation. While acknowledging Powell's past policy missteps, the article asserts that undermining the Fed's independence to mask reckless spending is the greater threat. The core problem, it concludes, is not Powell's leadership but the federal government's unsustainable spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of a broader strategy to lead in artificial intelligence, the White House has announced proposals aimed at limiting the export of American AI technology to China and other 'countries of concern.' The plan directs the Commerce Department to develop new export controls on critical chipmaking components to close existing loopholes. It also seeks to enhance monitoring of U.S. chip end-users and coordinate with allies to adopt similar restrictions. White House AI czar David Sacks stated that the measures are necessary because AI is a revolutionary technology with the potential to alter the global balance of power.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes which nations might intervene in a potential military conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan. The author suggests that China would find few military allies, with only North Korea bound by a treaty and Russia unlikely to offer more than economic support. On the American side, the piece argues that even close allies like Japan and the Philippines would likely offer only limited, cautious assistance, such as submarine patrols or missile strikes. The analysis concludes that there is little appetite from third-party countries to become entangled in such a conflict, reflecting a global desire to avoid a direct confrontation between the two superpowers.</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 100 international aid and human rights organizations, including Oxfam and Save the Children, has issued a dire warning of mass starvation in Gaza. In a joint statement, the groups report that their colleagues and the local population are 'wasting away' due to Israel's siege, which has severely restricted the entry of food, water, and medicine. The organizations describe record rates of acute malnutrition, particularly among children, and a collapsing humanitarian situation. They are urging global governments to take decisive action, including demanding an immediate ceasefire and the full opening of all land crossings to restore a UN-led aid response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of the word 'OK,' one of the most universally understood terms on the planet. Its origin is traced back to a linguistic fad in 1830s Boston, where it appeared as a joking abbreviation for 'oll korrect' (all correct). The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his supporters formed 'O.K. Clubs,' a nod to his nickname 'Old Kinderhook.' From this political beginning, the simple, versatile, and easily transmitted word spread globally, becoming an indispensable part of modern communication, technology, and culture.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences to stimulate the housing market. Under current law, profits from home sales are taxed once they exceed $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples. The proposal, which follows the introduction of a similar bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, aims to unlock equity for long-term homeowners and address housing shortages. While the National Association of Realtors supports reform, tax policy experts suggest that raising the existing exemption is more likely than a complete elimination of the tax.

This policy is part of a broader administration effort to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion references from federal AI guidelines.

The bill, named the CANADA Act, comes as the administration threatens a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian goods starting August 1. Supporters of the bill argue that the tariffs harm small businesses, drive up costs for consumers, and damage the long-standing economic relationship between the U.S. and Canada, its largest trading partner. The legislation aims to alleviate the economic pressure on small enterprises that rely on cross-border trade for their operations. (not investment advice)</p>
