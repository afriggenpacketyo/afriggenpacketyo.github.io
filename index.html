          <p>Producers in developed nations, particularly those in the defense sector, are recognizing the necessity to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on critical industrial metals. This action by Beijing has caused widespread concern in the industry, as they have relied on readily available exports from China for three decades. The element, vital for cutting tools, machinery, and clean energy applications, has seen commercial mining cease in the US for a decade. This article highlights the panic within the industry and the challenges faced by US defense contractors who must cease using Chinese tungsten by 2027.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden via email, a move that has ignited fury among congressional Democrats. Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, was appointed in 2016 and her term was set to expire next year. The American Accountability Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, had accused Hayden of promoting children's books with ‚Äúradical‚Äù content and literary material authored by Trump opponents. Democrats have condemned the firing as an assault on American history and the Library of Congress, with some calling for accountability for this unprecedented action.</p>

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to significantly boost its stock market, as investors remain concerned about the economic impact of ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The stimulus package, while aligned with economic priorities, is seen as a stopgap rather than a comprehensive solution. Unlike previous measures, this round is targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Investors are awaiting more fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector, which would lead to a meaningful rally.</p>

The agreement expands opportunities for American agricultural products in the UK, but some analysts see it as a political victory for Trump with limited substantive benefits.

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain that aims to increase market access for American farm exports. In return, the U.S. has agreed to arrangements such as allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. market with only a 10 percent tariff. The deal leaves a 10 percent baseline tariff in place on almost all countries, with only the country-specific part of his so-called reciprocal tariffs being negotiable.

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package, a move that would reverse a key provision of the 2017 tax cuts. The proposed change would create a new top income bracket for those earning over $2.5 million, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This move comes as Republicans face pressure to offset the cost of tax cuts and address concerns about cutting benefits for the poor.
