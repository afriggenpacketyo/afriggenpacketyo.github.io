          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, has dedicated a new monument to acknowledge the 1885 massacre where a mob killed 28 Chinese people amid labor tensions. This statue, 'Requiem,' depicts a Chinese miner and stands as a more prominent memorial than previous efforts. The town is also conducting an archaeological dig at the former Chinatown site, revealing artifacts from the violent past. This initiative aims to shed light on a dark chapter of the town's history, despite a local political climate that has recently seen increased anti-immigrant sentiment and renewed ICE contracts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hairy crab prices in China have fallen by approximately 20 yuan per kilogram compared to last year, with further declines anticipated due to increased production and weakened consumer demand. This downturn occurs just before the 'super golden week' holiday, which is often a key period for gift-giving and household spending. Industry insiders attribute the lower prices to shrinking demand for luxury gifts and a general slowdown in household consumption. The situation highlights ongoing consumption doldrums in the Chinese economy, making the holiday a critical test for domestic market recovery.</p>

          <p>As the Labour Party heads into its annual conference, leader Sir Keir Starmer expressed confidence in his government's ability to 'pull this round' despite trailing Reform UK in opinion polls. He plans to use the Liverpool conference to present Labour as a patriotic alternative to what he calls Reform UK's 'toxic divide and decline' politics, specifically criticizing Nigel Farage. Starmer renewed attacks on Farage, describing him as 'grubby' and 'unpatriotic' for allegedly talking down the UK abroad. The conference will also address Labour's stance on immigration, contrasting with Reform's proposals to abolish indefinite leave to remain.</p>

          <p>Polls have opened in Moldova for parliamentary elections, which are considered crucial for the country's future alignment, either towards the European Union or back into Russia's orbit. Pro-Russian parties, including Greater Moldova and Heart of Moldova, were disqualified due to alleged illegal and foreign funding, raising concerns about Russian interference. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu warned of Moscow's pressure and emphasized Moldova's progress towards EU membership, aiming for it by the end of the decade. The election outcome will determine the trajectory of the former Soviet republic, which has been an EU candidate since 2022.</p>

Despite BYD's calm response, its shares fell over 6% following the news, reflecting investor concerns about cooling growth, price cuts, and a recent quarterly profit decline.

This shift challenges the long-held Western 'convergence theory' that societies become more alike as they industrialize.

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3) have reinstated sweeping UN sanctions on Iran, citing its 'continued nuclear escalation' and lack of cooperation, urging Tehran to refrain from escalatory actions. These sanctions came into effect after a decade-long lifting, following Iran's increased nuclear activity since the US withdrew from the 2015 deal in 2016. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the sanctions as 'unfair and illegal' but insisted the country has no intention of developing nuclear weapons.

          <p>Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has ordered the National Bolivarian Militia to train civilians, including senior citizens, for a potential US attack, labeling recent US navy strikes in the South Caribbean as an 'undeclared war.' The US, which does not recognize Maduro's re-election, has conducted counter-narcotics operations, destroying boats and killing 17 people. While experts doubt a full-scale US invasion, the relationship has deteriorated, with Trump declaring a Venezuelan criminal gang a terrorist group. Maduro's government, despite cooperating on migrant deportations, uses combative rhetoric internally, aiming to create a 'human shield' by increasing potential human casualties in any conflict.</p>

          <p>Europe has established an overwhelming 11½-4½ lead over the USA heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, requiring only two and a half more points for retention. The second day was marred by 'thuggish, moronic and personal insults' from American galleries directed particularly at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to increased security and fan removals. European captain Luke Donald acknowledged the crowd's intensity but emphasized his team's resilience in the face of adversity. An incident between Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau also added to the day's tension, highlighting the contentious atmosphere.</p>

Garcia-Hernandez, in the U.S. without legal status and detained for DUI, remains on life support, shackled in the hospital, with ICE controlling access. The shooting, which also injured another detainee and killed a third, was carried out by a shooter who died of self-inflicted wounds, targeting ICE agents but harming detainees.

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's increasingly unfiltered and combative communication style, exemplified by recent claims about autism and public criticisms of opponents. Trump's approach treats professional disapproval as authenticity, reinforcing an image of challenging conventions and dictating terms. From controversial statements at a memorial service to a combative UN address, he consistently projects an image of being above normal political consequences. The analysis suggests that Trump appears to feel more invincible than ever, framing inconsistencies as strategic genius and legal challenges as vindication, solidifying his 'politics of the untouchable' persona.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's upcoming memoir, 'Life, Law, & Liberty,' offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the 'swing justice.' Kennedy reflects on his decisive votes in controversial cases like same-sex marriage and abortion, asserting 'The cases swung, not me' as the court grew more conservative. He expresses concern about increasing partisanship in American discourse and even in Supreme Court opinions, advocating for reasoned, respectful conversation. Kennedy also shares personal anecdotes, including a surprising friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia and his evolution on issues like juvenile death penalties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, with experts debating their scientific credibility. While some users report brighter skin and stronger hair/nails, consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth expresses skepticism about collagen peptides reaching skin cells intact. She notes that industry-funded studies often show positive results, contrasting with independent research that finds no significant effect. Experts emphasize that lifestyle factors like sun protection, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking have a far greater impact on skin health than expensive supplements. Laser stimulation and microneedling are suggested as more effective, albeit costly, alternatives for boosting collagen output.</p>
