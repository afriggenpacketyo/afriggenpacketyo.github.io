          <p>Lucy Connolly, a Northampton childminder, was sentenced to 31 months in jail for inciting racial hatred after posting a racist tweet in response to false rumors about an illegal immigrant. The tweet called for setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers and was widely shared before being deleted. Connolly's legal team argued the sentence was excessive, but the Court of Appeal disagreed, leading to a debate about free speech and the proportionality of punishments for online activity. The Free Speech Union supported Connolly, while others argued her tweet incited violence and hate, highlighting the ongoing tensions between free expression and accountability for online speech.</p>

          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City and charged with kidnapping and torturing a tourist from Italy for three weeks. Woeltz allegedly tied up the victim, shocked him with electric wires, cut his leg, and forced him to smoke crack cocaine, demanding the password to his Bitcoin account. The victim escaped and flagged down a traffic agent, leading to Woeltz's arrest, and a second individual was arrested but later released pending further investigation. Authorities found disturbing evidence at the scene, and Woeltz is considered a flight risk and ordered to remain in jail.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if elected.

Reform UK plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The move highlights policy divisions within the Labour party, as more than 10 million pensioners lost winter fuel payments when the pension top-up became restricted.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, passed away at the age of 90. Her book, "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape," published in 1975, redefined the understanding of sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, influencing the women's movement and legal reforms. The book provided a comprehensive history of sexual assault and challenged myths surrounding the issue, leading to the establishment of rape-crisis centers and changes in laws. Despite facing criticism for some of her views, Brownmiller remained a significant figure in feminist history.</p>

          <p>North Korea has detained three shipyard officials following an accident during the launch of a new warship, where parts of the destroyer's bottom were crushed. Kim Jong Un described the incident as a "criminal act," leading to an ongoing investigation. The detained officials include the chief engineer of the Chongjin shipyard, the construction head, and an administrative manager, all deemed responsible for the accident. Satellite images showed the vessel lying on its side covered by tarpaulins, indicating the severity of the damage.</p>

          <p>A series of Israeli strikes in Gaza resulted in the deaths of nearly 80 people, including nine of a doctor's ten children, according to Gaza health officials. The strikes targeted an area in Khan Younis, described by the Israeli military as a "dangerous war zone," and the military is reviewing claims of harm to uninvolved civilians. The incident has raised the war's death toll to 53,901 since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. Humanitarian aid has begun to trickle into Gaza after an 11-week blockade.</p>

          <p>A power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, leading French authorities to investigate possible arson in a fire at an electrical substation.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling a show of sovereignty and independence against threats from US President Donald Trump. This move is seen as an affirmation of Canada's unique traditions and its separation from the United States. The invitation comes at a time when Carney has heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, who has undermined Canada's sovereignty and imposed tariffs threatening its economic stability. The visit marks a rare occasion, as a British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977.</p>

          <p>Learners in the UK are struggling to afford rising driving lesson costs amidst a high cost of living, with some cutting back on essentials to pay for lessons. Driving instructors argue that the prices are fair due to increased expenses like fuel, insurance, and car maintenance. However, the practical test backlog is forcing learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills, adding to the financial burden. While the government aims to reduce test waiting times, many learners are delaying their test or limiting lesson frequency due to affordability concerns.</p>
