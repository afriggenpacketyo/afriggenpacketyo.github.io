          <p>A recent VantageScore report reveals that average credit card balances in the U.S. have climbed to $6,500, with utilization rates exceeding a concerning 30% threshold. This trend suggests many Americans are increasingly relying on credit to cover basic living expenses amid ongoing economic pressures. The article outlines several strategies for managing this debt, including consolidation loans, 0% APR balance transfers, and professional credit counseling, emphasizing the need for prompt action to avoid compounding interest charges.

Medical experts emphasize that untreated high fevers during pregnancy can pose significant risks to fetal development, including potential cardiac and central nervous system abnormalities. They reaffirm that acetaminophen remains the safest over-the-counter option for pain and fever management during pregnancy, warning that alternatives like ibuprofen could be more dangerous.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new defender, 18-year-old Giovanni Leoni, is expected to be sidelined for several months after suffering a suspected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The injury occurred during his debut match, a 2-1 Carabao Cup victory over Southampton, forcing him off the field after 81 minutes of play. Leoni, who recently joined the club from Parma, expressed his determination to return soon, while the injury leaves Liverpool with limited options at the centre-back position for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, both home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have become more affordable for homeowners. A comparison shows that for a $100,000 loan, a HELOC currently has slightly lower monthly payments due to its variable rate, which could decrease further with future cuts. However, a home equity loan offers the stability of a fixed rate, protecting borrowers from potential market volatility and making payments more predictable over the long term.

In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, parent company Alphabet stated the move reflects a commitment to free expression and applies to channels banned for rules that are no longer in effect. This decision is part of a broader trend among tech companies to roll back content moderation policies established during the pandemic and the 2020 election cycle amid political pressure.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is escalating its war strategy by using domestically produced long-range drones and missiles to strike deep within Russia, specifically targeting the nation's economic lifelines. The campaign focuses on oil refineries, pipelines, and processing plants to disrupt Russia's state income and military funding, effectively applying economic sanctions through direct action. This strategic shift reflects Ukraine's growing domestic weapons manufacturing capabilities, which allows for constant technological adaptation and reduces reliance on foreign-supplied arms with usage restrictions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas is intended to encourage companies to hire American workers, but economists predict a complex outcome. While some native-born tech workers might see short-term job gains, others argue the policy could stifle innovation and long-term economic growth by limiting access to specialized foreign talent. Research suggests that hiring H-1B workers often leads to overall job creation within firms, raising concerns that the high fee could ultimately harm the job prospects it aims to protect.</p>

          <p>Betty Reid Soskin celebrated her 104th birthday at the Bay Area middle school named in her honor, surrounded by cheering students. Soskin is renowned for becoming the oldest National Park Ranger in U.S. history, beginning her service in her 80s at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, where she shared stories of African Americans during World War II. Her work, which she continued until age 100, focused on uncovering overlooked histories, such as the Port Chicago disaster's role in desegregating the military.</p>

          <p>Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee for mayor of New York City, has claimed that he received multiple offers of money from "emissaries" of wealthy individuals to drop out of the race. Sliwa condemned the alleged offers as "unethical and illegal" and has vowed to remain in the campaign until Election Day. The situation arises in a complex four-way race, where former President Trump has previously suggested that both Sliwa and current Mayor Eric Adams should exit to create a direct contest between Democrat Zohran Mamdani and independent Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>A family of three has become the first to arrive in the United Kingdom under the new "one in, one out" migrant agreement with France. The deal stipulates that for every migrant who crossed the Channel illegally and is returned to France, the UK will accept one refugee with a valid protection claim. This arrival follows the removal of four migrants from the UK to France under the pilot scheme, which the government hopes will deter illegal crossings by disrupting the business model of people-smuggling gangs, though the plan has faced criticism.</p>

Two men reportedly suffered serious limb injuries in the attack. The Iran-backed Houthi movement, which controls parts of Yemen, claimed responsibility for the strike, stating it targeted "Israeli enemy targets." This attack is one of the most serious Houthi strikes in terms of casualties since the group began launching drones and missiles toward Israel.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is offering promotional financing rates on its F-150 pickup trucks to buyers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620, in an effort to boost sales before the end of the third quarter. The move provides these consumers with lower interest rates usually reserved for those with better credit, aiming to make the popular vehicle more affordable. While such promotions can help reduce inventory, they also carry risks, as borrowers with lower credit scores are more likely to default on loans, particularly during economic uncertainty.

It will be replaced with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken, rather than a fixed equity minimum, potentially increasing trading activity and accessibility for smaller accounts pending SEC approval.

The letter suggests Rolex may be trying to "curry favor" to secure exemptions from a 39% levy the Trump administration placed on Swiss exports. Warren drew parallels to companies like Apple and Nvidia, which have announced domestic investments after their leaders developed relationships with the president, raising concerns about special treatment for corporations.</p>

This reduction not only makes homeownership more accessible but also saves borrowers over $54,000 in total interest over the life of the loan, spurring a jump in mortgage applications.

For his allies, Kirk was a central figure who organized the MAGA movement and encouraged young conservatives to be unafraid in public spaces like college campuses. His death is being framed by some as a "George Floyd moment" for the right, fueling a desire to seize cultural control and retaliate against a perceived left-wing establishment.</p>
