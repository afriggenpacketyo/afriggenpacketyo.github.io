          <p>The Trump administration has issued a directive requiring colleges and universities to submit detailed admissions data to the Department of Education. This measure is intended to verify compliance with the 2023 Supreme Court ruling that banned affirmative action, amid concerns that institutions may still be using race as a proxy. Critics, including the American Council on Education, label the move a "fishing expedition" that oversimplifies the complex admissions process. The administration maintains this action is crucial for restoring meritocracy, though the Education Department's ability to manage the data influx is questionable due to recent staff reductions.</p>

          <p>Following a significant outbreak of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus in China's Guangdong Province, U.S. health experts are evaluating the potential for its spread. The CDC has issued a travel alert, but infectious disease specialists believe a large-scale outbreak in the United States is unlikely due to a lower prevalence of the Aedes mosquito vector. While isolated cases may occur, particularly from travelers returning from affected regions, sustained transmission is not anticipated. Experts still advise taking precautions like using bug repellent and getting vaccinated when traveling to areas where the virus is endemic.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States is demonstrating inconsistency in its approach to international maritime law, particularly concerning freedom of navigation on the high seas. The article references the U.S. Coast Guard's recent interaction with a Chinese research vessel, the Xue Long 2, in waters near Alaska, which the U.S. implied was "malign state activity." The author contends that this action contradicts the principles of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), which permits marine scientific research beyond national jurisdictions. This stance raises doubts about Washington's commitment to the rules-based order it promotes.</p>

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, New York City officials have identified the remains of three more victims using advanced DNA analysis. The victims were publicly named as Barbara Keating and Ryan Fitzgerald, with a third woman's identity withheld at her family's request. This development brings the total number of identified victims to 1,653 out of the 2,753 who perished at the World Trade Center. The ongoing effort by the city's chief medical examiner's office underscores a long-standing commitment to providing closure for the families of the deceased, even decades after the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Dean Cain, best known for playing Superman in the 1990s television series "Lois & Clark," has announced his intention to become an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. The announcement came shortly after ICE waived its age limits for new applicants as part of a major recruitment drive. Cain, who is 59, has previously served as a reserve police officer and a sworn sheriff's deputy in different jurisdictions. An ICE official confirmed that Cain will be sworn in as an honorary officer, a move the actor says is motivated by a desire to help secure the safety of all Americans.</p>

The nomination is seen as a temporary move, allowing Trump to keep his options open for the next Fed Chair appointment.

          <p>A coalition of conservation groups is celebrating a federal judge's decision to temporarily halt construction at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades. The ruling stops new infrastructure work at the site, which opponents argue threatens fragile wetlands, protected species, and sacred tribal lands. The lawsuit claims the project violated the National Environmental Policy Act by proceeding without a proper environmental review. While the detention center can continue operating, the two-week pause is seen as a significant victory for environmental and tribal advocates fighting the facility's expansion.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers star left tackle Rashawn Slater was carted off the field during practice after suffering an apparent left leg injury. The incident occurred during a team drill when Slater collapsed after being pushed backward and immediately grabbed his leg. Visibly distraught, he was unable to put any weight on the leg as he was helped by trainers. The injury is a major concern for the team, as Slater recently signed a contract making him the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history. His potential absence adds to the team's existing depth issues on the offensive line.</p>

An Italian restaurant association was so incensed it contacted the British embassy in Rome to complain. The incident has been widely covered in Italian media, highlighting the deep cultural importance Italians place on culinary authenticity and tradition.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of environmental groups, allowing their lawsuit challenging the state's cuts to rooftop solar incentives to proceed. The decision overturns a lower court ruling that had deferred to the Public Utilities Commission's (PUC) interpretation of the law. The environmental groups argue the PUC acted unlawfully in 2022 when it drastically reduced the credits solar panel owners receive for sending excess power to the grid. This ruling is a significant victory for solar advocates, affirming that the PUC's decisions are subject to standard judicial review and are not above the law.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again raised the possibility of a federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s government, citing crime as a primary justification. Following an incident involving a government staff member, Trump stated he would "have no choice but to take Federal control" if the city doesn't "get its act together." However, legal experts note that the president lacks the unilateral authority to federalize the district, as it would require an act of Congress to overturn the 1973 Home Rule Act. This threat continues a long-running conflict between the administration and D.C.'s local leadership over city governance.</p>
