        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a government shutdown looms, Republicans are accusing Democrats of risking the deadline to reinstate taxpayer-funded medical benefits for undocumented immigrants through a continuing resolution. Vice President JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson allege Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is pushing for this, a claim Democrats dispute. Democrats, in turn, attribute the potential shutdown to Republicans and their refusal to extend expiring Obamacare tax credits and reverse Medicaid cuts. The debate highlights a deep partisan divide over healthcare funding and immigration policy as the deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>Nike achieved a surprise 1% sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, exceeding expectations that projected a mid-single-digit decline. Despite this, the company's profits fell 31%, and gross margin decreased, indicating that efforts to clear old inventory are still impacting profitability. CEO Elliott Hill acknowledged progress in wholesale, running, and North America, but noted struggles in other areas like direct sales and China. The company continues its restructuring and innovation strategy, which involves short-term financial pain to achieve long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of Canada Post workers have begun a nationwide strike, halting mail and parcel deliveries, except for government social security cheques and passport processing. The strike protests recent government-authorized reforms, including ending door-to-door delivery and closing some post offices, which the union views as an "assault" on public service and jobs. This action also follows an unresolved dispute over pay and benefits from a previous walkout. The Canadian government emphasizes the need for significant changes to make the financially struggling Canada Post viable, with negotiations ongoing.</p>

Ek stated he will focus on Spotify's "long arc," including global growth opportunities in regions like Asia and Africa, and new technologies such as artificial intelligence.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts issued a scathing rebuke, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. Judge William Young stated their actions aimed to chill lawful speech and misused government powers. He criticized President Trump's "palpable misunderstanding" of free speech and the deployment of masked agents, calling it "disingenuous." The ruling upholds First Amendment rights against government retribution for disfavored speech.</p>

          <p>US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that existing tariffs of approximately 55% on Chinese imports represent a "good status quo" for the Trump administration. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York, Greer indicated no immediate plans to reduce these tariffs ahead of a November 10 trade truce expiration. While acknowledging a desire for increased bilateral trade in "non-sensitive goods," he emphasized the current tariff rate as the established "deal" with China. This stance signals continued trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

While welcomed by some Arab nations, observers warn that many specifics still need negotiation, and acceptance doesn't guarantee implementation. Netanyahu's public support in Washington contrasted with his later assertion that Israel would "remain in most of the Gaza Strip." Critics highlight the plan's lack of guarantees for Palestinians and its imposition of a transitional authority.</p>

          <p>Federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations discovered an additional 200,000 SIM cards in New Jersey, following last week's disruption of a sprawling telecommunications network. This network, previously found with over 100,000 SIM cards, was capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute and could have disabled cell phone towers. Officials believe it was connected to Chinese actors, organized crime gangs, and human trafficking rings, posing a significant threat to the UN General Assembly. Forensic analysis of the SIM cards is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has filed a first-of-its-kind civil rights lawsuit against pro-Palestinian groups and activists, alleging violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. This law has historically protected reproductive health clinics from anti-abortion harassment. The lawsuit concerns a November 2024 protest at a New Jersey synagogue, where a pro-Israel counterprotester pepper-sprayed a demonstrator. Critics express concern over the administration's novel application of the FACE Act, especially after curtailing its use for abortion clinics.</p>

          <p>Pfizer's recent acquisition, Metsera, released encouraging mid-stage trial data for its lead obesity drug candidate, MET-097i, paving the way for phase three studies. The monthly injection showed up to 14.1% average weight loss after 28 weeks, with some participants losing significantly more. Early data also suggests favorable tolerability with fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to existing weekly injections. Analysts project Metsera's pipeline could generate over $5 billion in peak annual sales. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s proposal to add autism to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has sparked significant debate. Experts warn this move would unleash a flood of claims, threatening the program's financial stability and empowering vaccine opponents, despite scientific consensus debunking a vaccine-autism link. The VICP compensates for vaccine-related injuries but has consistently rejected autism claims. Critics emphasize such a policy change would be purely political, undermining public trust in vaccines and potentially jeopardizing the national vaccine supply.</p>

          <p>A KFF analysis projects that premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans will more than double, rising 114%, if enhanced subsidies expire at year-end as scheduled. This expiration would impact 22 million enrollees, increasing average premiums from $888 to $1,906 in 2026. The issue is central to the ongoing government shutdown stalemate, with Democrats pushing for an extension and Republicans demanding separate negotiations. Compounding this are changes in tax credit calculations and insurers' proposed 18% rate hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley engaged in a heated exchange with former Biden official Gregory Jackson Jr. during a Senate Judiciary Meeting, demanding an explanation for the term "two spirit individual." The term appeared in Jackson's organization's playbook for gun violence prevention, advocating for safe space initiatives led by LGBTQ+ and "two spirit" people. Hawley pressed Jackson, who claimed unfamiliarity with the language, leading to accusations that Jackson wrote the report. The confrontation highlighted ideological clashes over terminology and policy.</p>
