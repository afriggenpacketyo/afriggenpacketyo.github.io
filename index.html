          <p>Tesla shares experienced a significant drop of 16% following President Trump's threat to revoke government contracts from Elon Musk's companies. This action stemmed from a heated exchange over a spending bill, with Trump claiming Musk was upset about the exclusion of EV credits. Musk responded by asserting his crucial role in Trump's election victory, further intensifying the conflict. The disagreement highlights a growing rift between the tech mogul and the president, impacting Tesla's market performance and raising questions about future collaborations. Optimism is low regarding the stability of the situation. </p>

Circle's CEO, Jeremy Allaire, emphasized the company's commitment to regulatory compliance and its role in mainstreaming crypto.

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously blocked a lawsuit filed by the Mexican government against U.S. gun manufacturers. The lawsuit sought to hold the manufacturers accountable for violence in Mexico, arguing that their products end up in the hands of drug cartels. The court's decision centered on the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which generally shields gunmakers from liability for the misuse of their products by third parties. This ruling limits the ability of foreign governments to seek damages from U.S. gun companies for actions that occur outside of the United States.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have surpassed 100,000 under President Trump's administration, marking a significant increase in detention efforts. The agency has intensified its operations in courthouses, worksites, and communities, leading to a surge in daily arrests compared to previous periods. This expansion aligns with the administration's focus on cracking down on illegal immigration and increasing deportations. However, these aggressive tactics have sparked controversy and outrage, as ICE detains not only criminals but also non-criminal migrants, including long-term residents and students.</p>

          <p>A Texas family is suing a BBQ joint, Bill Miller Bar-B-Q, after their four-year-old child allegedly suffered second-degree burns from its "dangerously hot" sauce. The lawsuit claims the restaurant's barbecue sauce is served at unsafe temperatures and that an employee placed an uncovered tray of sauce within reach of the child. This is the third complaint filed against the company in less than a year, with previous cases involving similar incidents of burns from the sauce. The family is seeking $1 million in damages and alleges a pattern of negligence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban has the potential to significantly disrupt international sporting events held in the United States. The proclamation implementing the ban states that exemptions could be made for athletes and coaches participating in "major" competitions. However, the extent to which these exemptions will be applied remains unclear. The ban raises concerns about the participation of athletes from affected countries in events such as the World Cup and the Olympics.</p>

          <p>Reactions to President Trump's latest travel ban have been more muted compared to the intense shock and outrage that greeted his initial travel ban. While condemnation has been voiced by Democratic senators, the denunciations seem less impactful amid a backdrop of creeping authoritarianism and ideological attacks on civic institutions. Experts believe legal challenges to the new ban are less likely to succeed due to lessons learned from previous litigation. The ban is viewed as playing out on a wider canvas of xenophobic, anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with U.S. gun manufacturers, dismissing a lawsuit brought by Mexico. Mexico argued that the companies contributed to gun violence by negligently allowing their products to flow into the hands of cartels. The Court invoked the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which generally shields gunmakers from liability for the misuse of firearms by third parties. The ruling limits the ability of foreign governments to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for harms caused by their products.</p>

The decision aims to reduce distracted driving and encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road. Mounted phones and single-swipe operations are exempted, but simply looking at a map while holding the phone constitutes a violation.</p>
