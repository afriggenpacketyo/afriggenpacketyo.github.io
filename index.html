          <p>The recent arrests of NBA figures, including coach Chauncey Billups and player Terry Rozier, in connection with an illegal gambling probe have added to a long history of betting scandals across professional sports. The article recounts numerous historical instances, from the 1919 "Black Sox Scandal" to modern cases involving MLB players, an NBA referee, and Shohei Ohtani's interpreter. These events underscore the persistent challenge sports leagues face in maintaining integrity amid the temptations of both legal and illegal wagering.

          <p>Chinese researchers at Northwestern Polytechnical University have created a "ghost" drone that mimics the appearance and movement of a jellyfish for stealthy underwater operations. Made from a transparent hydrogel material, the small, lightweight robot is designed for near-silent operation and low power consumption. Its lifelike design makes it suitable for sensitive tasks such as deep-sea covert monitoring, observing fragile ecosystems, and inspecting underwater structures without causing disruption. The innovation represents a significant advancement in biomimetic robotics for surveillance and scientific research.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford to the Caribbean as part of a significant military buildup, which Washington describes as an effort to combat drug trafficking. However, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has condemned the move, accusing the Trump administration of "fabricating a war." The deployment follows a series of US strikes on alleged narcotics vessels and statements from US officials, including the Defense Secretary, framing the campaign as a fight against "narco-terrorists." This escalation has intensified fears in Caracas that the ultimate goal is regime change.</p>

          <p>Amid a prolonged government shutdown, air traffic controller Jack Criss has started working as a DoorDash driver to cover his daughter's tuition as his paychecks have stopped. Criss described the immense financial and mental strain on himself and his colleagues, who work in a high-pressure, zero-error profession without knowing when they will be paid. Despite warnings from the Department of Transportation against taking side jobs, many essential federal employees like Criss have been forced to find alternative income and take out loans to make ends meet. The situation highlights the severe personal impact of political stalemates on federal workers.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently underperforming the S&P 500 index by the largest margin this year, with its Class B shares gaining 8.6% year-to-date compared to the index's 15.5% rise. This performance gap has widened following Buffett's announcement that he will step down as CEO at the end of the year. The article also analyzes Berkshire's decision to significantly reduce its stake in Apple, a move that has resulted in missing out on substantial gains as Apple's stock reached new highs. This has left an estimated $50 billion in potential profits unrealized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals that more than a third of Manhattan condos resold between mid-2024 and mid-2025 were sold at a loss, with median prices per square foot remaining stagnant over the last decade. This trend contrasts sharply with rising home prices in most of the U.S. When accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual share of unprofitable sales is likely even higher. Analysts attribute this "lost decade" to factors like tax law changes and pandemic-related migration, although the luxury market, particularly properties over $10 million, has continued to see profits.

The project, reportedly funded by Trump and corporate donors, is seen as a move driven by ego and a desire to leave a physical legacy.

          <h2>Despite Widespread Panic, Artificial Intelligence Has Yet to Significantly Disrupt Hollywood</h2>

          <p>While new AI tools like OpenAI's Sora 2 have generated considerable panic in Hollywood over copyright and job displacement, the technology's actual integration into the industry has been slow and challenging. Major studios like Disney have invested heavily in AI but have yet to realize significant cost savings or efficiencies, finding it difficult to fold the new tech into established, secure production pipelines. Issues surrounding copyright protection for AI-generated content and resistance from actors and guilds further complicate adoption. For now, AI remains more of a promising yet problematic curiosity than an immediate existential threat to Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Dr. Roy Meals, an 80-year-old hand surgeon, recently completed a solo hike along the entire 342-mile perimeter of Los Angeles to better understand the city he has called home for half his life. He chronicled his journey in a new book, "Walking the Line," detailing his discoveries, from historical landmarks to diverse culinary spots and unexpected encounters. Meals argues that truly knowing a place requires exploring it on foot, beyond the confines of a car. He prescribes his method to others: venture out of your own neighborhood to stay physically fit, mentally engaged, and connected to your community.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the overwhelming presence of pharmaceutical advertisements during televised sports events like the post-season baseball games. The author humorously notes that the constant mention of symptoms for conditions like psoriasis and Crohn's disease can make a healthy viewer feel ill. The article explains that while the FDA permits such ads with clear risk disclosures, their primary purpose is persuasion, not just information. This direct-to-consumer advertising targets a captive audience, potentially driving patient behavior and medical demand in ways that may not always be beneficial.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock the value of its significant holding in NuScale Power. Fluor's 39% stake in the small modular nuclear reactor company represents over 60% of its market capitalization, yet Fluor's core business trades at a steep discount compared to its peers. Starboard is urging management to separate the NuScale investment, possibly through a sale or a tax-free spinoff, to allow Fluor's main business to be revalued by the market.

          <p>Voters in Ivory Coast are heading to the polls in a presidential election where 83-year-old incumbent Alassane Ouattara is favored to win a fourth term. The run-up to the election was marked by protests and arrests after several key opposition figures, including Tidjane Thiam and former president Laurent Gbagbo, were barred from running. Ouattara is campaigning on a record of economic growth and stability, but concerns over social inequality and spillover violence from neighboring countries remain key issues. The government has deployed over 40,000 security personnel to prevent a repeat of past election-related violence.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that far-left terrorist plots outnumbered those from the far right in the first half of 2025, sparking a debate among extremism researchers. Critics argue the conclusion is premature, based on a very small number of incidents, and highlights the subjective challenges of collecting and categorizing domestic terrorism data. While the report's author notes the more striking trend was a decline in right-wing attacks, the findings are being discussed in the context of a polarized political environment and the recent assassination of a right-wing activist.</p>

          <p>China's near-total control of the global rare earth supply chain poses a significant vulnerability for Western nations, as these elements are crucial for high-tech, energy, and defense industries. Despite their name, rare earths are not scarce, but their extraction and processing are environmentally hazardous and technically complex. Recent moves by Beijing to tighten export controls have amplified concerns. While the US and its allies are seeking to diversify their supply chains, they face major hurdles, including the high cost, environmental regulations, and lack of technical expertise required to build a competitive processing industry outside of China.</p>

          <p>With a recent survey showing 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments like private equity and real estate, financial advisors recommend using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a practical way to gain exposure. Alternatives can be complex and illiquid, often requiring long lockup periods. However, ETFs that hold these assets can be traded freely, offering a more accessible and liquid option for retail investors. While interest in alternatives is growing, especially among younger investors, advisors still recommend they constitute a smaller portion of a portfolio, with traditional stocks and bonds remaining the core.

          <p>Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, defeating Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. The election was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner last month. Powell, who was sacked from the cabinet in September, ran on a platform of giving grassroots members a stronger voice and advocating for a "bolder" direction for the party in government. In her victory speech, she promised to be an ally to leader Keir Starmer but also to champion Labour values and bring critical perspectives to the party's core.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) indicates that mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group systematically used military equipment intended for Mali's armed forces. Evidence, including open-source photos and interviews, suggests Wagner fighters used Malian armored vehicles, machine guns, and drones, often without Malian soldiers present. This appropriation of equipment, some of which was supplied by countries signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty, could constitute a violation of end-user agreements and international norms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In impoverished regions of the rural South, such as East Carroll Parish in Louisiana, residents are worried about forthcoming cuts to Medicaid, a program that has been a crucial lifeline. A new federal law is set to impose stricter work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which could cause hundreds of thousands in the state to lose coverage. For many low-wage workers in areas with limited job opportunities, Medicaid is their only source of health insurance. The impending changes are expected to strain already struggling communities and reverse recent gains in health coverage achieved through Medicaid expansion.</p>
