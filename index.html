          <p>The late-night show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' has been pulled off the air indefinitely by ABC after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments about the recent shooting of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk. Kimmel remarked on air that allies of former President Trump were attempting to "score political points" from the tragedy. The decision followed a move by Nexstar Media, a major TV station owner, to stop airing the show, calling the comedian's remarks "offensive and insensitive" during a critical time in national politics.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to avoid making significant market decisions based solely on the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. He argued that the quarter-point reduction was widely expected and does not fundamentally change major market themes or long-term trends. Cramer suggested that the market's mixed reaction might even present buying opportunities in resilient sectors like technology and banking, viewing the Fed's cautious approach as prudent.

          <p>A 20-year-old suspect has been arrested for allegedly making a terrorist threat against Utah Valley University, the campus where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was recently killed. The suspect, Blake Francis Rogers, posted a video online in which he claimed to be on an "odyssey" to the university to "kill woke." Rogers later told investigators that the video was intended as a "joke" and was sent to a small group of people, but authorities acted on the threat due to heightened tensions.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates by a Quarter Point and Signals More Reductions to Come</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has implemented a quarter-percentage-point cut to its benchmark interest rate, lowering the target range to 4%-4.25%. Projections from the central bank's committee suggest that two more cuts could follow before the end of the year, with an additional reduction anticipated in 2026. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the decision as a "risk management" move, but the mixed signals about the future pace of cuts resulted in an uncertain reaction from financial markets.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration is reportedly launching a campaign to investigate progressive nonprofit organizations. Rather than viewing the killing as the act of an isolated individual, some allies of the president are framing it as part of a broader conspiracy enabled by leftist groups. This response is seen by critics as a politically motivated effort to connect a violent crime to ideological opponents and escalate scrutiny of their activities.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company, citing a prolonged dispute with its parent company, Unilever. In a public letter, Greenfield claimed Unilever has systematically silenced the ice cream brand's well-known progressive social mission out of fear of controversy. His departure underscores the ongoing tension over the brand's independence, which was intended to be protected by a special board created during the 2000 acquisition.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that Democrats are risking a government shutdown by demanding that an extension for Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies be included in the upcoming government funding bill. Republicans have proposed a stopgap measure that funds the government until November 21 but excludes the ACA provision. Johnson argues the subsidy issue should be debated separately in December, while Democratic leaders contend that failing to extend them would create a severe healthcare crisis for millions of Americans.

          <p>A political analysis of President Donald Trump's U.K. state visit has characterized the event as a highly controlled "Truman Show," designed as a lavish spectacle to impress the president while shielding him from public view and potential protests. The article questions whether the immense effort and expense will translate into tangible diplomatic or economic benefits for Britain. The true value of the visit, it suggests, will only become clear during the subsequent business and political negotiations.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Ferguson, a former Orange County Superior Court judge, has been sentenced to 35 years to life in prison for the murder of his wife, Sheryl.

While Ferguson claimed the shooting was an accident, the couple's son testified that he heard his mother say, "Why don’t you point a real gun at me?" just before the fatal shot was fired.</p>
