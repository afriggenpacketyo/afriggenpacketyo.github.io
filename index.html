          <p>Hurricane Humberto intensified into a Category 4 storm on Friday evening, rapidly strengthening over the central Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center reported no immediate watches or warnings for the U.S., though two systems in the western Atlantic could bring downstream impacts to the Southeast U.S. coast. Humberto, the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, was moving west at about 7 mph with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. Forecasters anticipate continued strengthening over open waters, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 105 miles from its center.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major storm, could potentially interact with another developing system in the western Atlantic, possibly leading to a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This occurs when two storms merge or orbit each other, with the outcome depending on their relative strengths. While unlikely to result in a full gravitational "dance" due to the developing system's weaker nature, any interaction could subtly alter their forecast paths. Officials are monitoring this situation, as the second system is expected to strengthen and track towards the Bahamas, increasing risks for the southeastern U.S.</p>

          <p>Shane Tamura, the gunman responsible for a deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting in July, was posthumously diagnosed with low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) by New York's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Tamura, a 27-year-old former high school football player, killed four people before taking his own life, leaving notes referencing CTE and requesting his brain be studied. Experts note that even low-stage CTE can cause significant brain changes affecting judgment and behavior, though it doesn't directly cause violence. This finding serves as a stark reminder of the long-term consequences of head trauma in athletes.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired approximately 20 agents who kneeled during a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., following George Floyd's death in 2020. Sources indicate that many of these agents were from the FBI's Washington Field Office and were photographed kneeling in early June 2020. While an internal review previously concluded the kneeling was a de-escalation tactic rather than a political statement, the agents were reassigned earlier this year and have now been terminated. The FBI declined to comment on the matter, leaving the specific reasons for their dismissal unconfirmed publicly.</p>

          <p>A Georgia businessman's billboard tribute to Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, has garnered national attention following Kirk's recent murder. The billboard, reading "Charlie Kirk, 1993-2025: Stand up, speak out, stay bold," led to a viral social media response and an outpouring of customer support for the Steak 'n Shake location. The restaurant owner, Wayne Robinson, stated Kirk's legacy is inspiring a "revival across the country."

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell discussed her new film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," aiming to capture the "primal" and "sexual" feeling she experienced reading it as a teenager. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the film's trailer has already sparked debate with its heightened gothic and provocative style. Fennell, known for "Promising Young Woman" and "Saltburn," described the 1847 novel as "difficult, complicated, singular, sexy, horrible, devastating." She emphasized a "profound connection" to the book, retaining much of Brontë's original dialogue while infusing her own remembered interpretations.</p>

          <p>Michele Beckwith, the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento, claims she was fired after instructing a Border Patrol chief to comply with a court injunction prohibiting indiscriminate immigration raids in California's Central Valley. Beckwith warned Chief Gregory Bovino that his agents could not arrest people without probable cause, as mandated by a federal district court ruling following a previous operation. Her employment was terminated shortly after this communication, and two days later, Bovino's agents conducted a raid in Sacramento. This incident is part of a pattern of top prosecutors being dismissed or resigning under the Trump administration amid pushes for aggressive policy enforcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to continue its freeze of over $4 billion in foreign aid, previously approved by Congress. The conservative-majority court stated that the "asserted harms" to Trump's foreign affairs conduct likely outweigh the potential harm to aid recipients, though this is not a final determination. Liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress authority over spending. This move aligns with the Trump administration's broader effort to downsize foreign aid, with critics warning of dire consequences for global public health and developing countries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Minnesota ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed election technology company Smartmatic by falsely claiming its machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge found 51 specific instances where Lindell made false statements regarding Smartmatic's interference in the results, particularly in Los Angeles County. While defamation was established, the question of whether Lindell acted with "actual malice" — necessary for damages — will be determined later, as Lindell maintains an "unwavering belief" in his claims. Smartmatic seeks "nine-figure damages," while Lindell vows to continue his fight against voting machines.</p>

He hinted that the players' eagerness to redeem themselves influenced his decision. Europe's captain, Luke Donald, conversely maintained his winning pairings.

While the government aims to end the insurgency by March 2026, rights activists express concern over the human cost, with hundreds of alleged rebels killed and civilians caught in the crossfire. Locals allege wrongdoing by security forces, claiming innocent lives are lost and the line between rebels and civilians is blurred.

          <p>Sources indicate that one of the charges in former FBI Director James Comey's indictment stems from his alleged false statements to Congress about authorizing a close friend to share information regarding an FBI investigation related to Hillary Clinton. The indictment accuses Comey of lying under oath in 2020 when he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source for news reports. "PERSON 3" is identified as Daniel Richman, Comey's friend and former personal lawyer. This charge delves into the specific details of Comey's alleged actions and testimony concerning leaks.</p>

          <p>The cause and manner of death for Travis Decker, accused of killing his three young daughters in Washington state, "may never be known," according to the Chelan County Coroner. Authorities confirmed human remains found last week belonged to Decker, who was the sole suspect in the May murders of Paityn, Evelyn, and Olivia Decker, who suffocated after their wrists were bound. Due to receiving only "minimal skeletal remains" and the time elapsed since his death, a full autopsy was impossible. Decker, a former Army soldier with survival skills, had been the subject of a monthslong manhunt.</p>

          <p>King Charles's long-held urban planning philosophies, which once faced architectural establishment criticism, are now inspiring England's next generation of new towns. The government plans to announce 12 new towns designed to be walkable, environmentally friendly, and feature "gentle density" housing. TV architect George Clarke notes a shift in mainstream architectural thinking towards designs sensitive to local place and public preferences, echoing the King's emphasis on harmony with nature and community spaces, as seen in his Poundbury and Nansledan schemes. These new developments aim to avoid past mistakes of car-centric layouts and poor public services.</p>

Trump justified these measures for "National Security and other reasons," claiming foreign manufacturers were "flooding" the U.S. market.

Trump highlighted the enduring mystery surrounding Earhart's vanished flight. While the prevailing theory suggests she ran out of fuel and crashed, other theories persist, including credible accounts of her being spotted on Saipan and taken into Japanese custody, possibly on a spy mission. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had urged the declassification, though experts like Laurie Gwen Shapiro dismiss spy theories as "nonsense."</p>
