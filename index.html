          <p>George Monbiot critiques the increasingly authoritarian approach to protest in Britain, drawing parallels to policies in other countries.  The arrest of six young women at a peaceful climate protest meeting highlights concerns about the erosion of freedom of speech and assembly.  Monbiot points to the influence of corporate lobbying and right-wing think tanks in shaping restrictive laws on protest, creating a double standard where some protests are heavily suppressed while others are ignored.

          <p>Following President Trump's new tariffs, the effective US tariff rate on Chinese goods has risen to approximately 65%, according to Citi research.
