          <p>Masked thieves, disguised as construction workers, executed a brazen daytime heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing at least nine pieces of jewelry, including crowns and necklaces, from the Napoleon and French crown jewels collections. The meticulously planned robbery involved using a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor gallery, smashing display cases with an angle grinder, and escaping on motorcycles within seven minutes. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to recover the "inestimable heritage and historical value" items and bring the perpetrators to justice. The museum was closed for investigations, highlighting the shock and serious security implications of such an audacious crime at a world-renowned institution, with experts noting the race against time to recover the items before they are broken apart and sold.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, ruled that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, alleging AI market monopolies, must remain in his court despite minimal geographic connections. Judge Mark Pittman, in an ironic order, encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, noting the division's busy docket and plaintiffs' tendency for forum-shopping in conservative districts. X, controlled by Elon Musk, accuses Apple of favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store and deprioritizing competitors like xAI's Grok. The judge's decision, while critical of venue selection practices, ultimately respected the plaintiff's choice, highlighting the complexities of legal jurisdiction and the high-stakes nature of the burgeoning AI industry's legal challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that in the current multipolar world, major powers must choose between rigid alliances leading to conflict or managed accommodation, drawing parallels to the 19th century's German emergence and the 1970s' Nixon-Zhou Enlai détente. The article highlights two distinguishing factors in today's competition: nuclear weapons making total war irrational, and technological interdependence creating immense costs for systemic rupture. It emphasizes that economic fundamentals have already established a multipolar order, and patient statecraft is crucial to avoid catastrophic miscalculation, contrasting historical failures with the potential for modern adaptation. The author suggests that despite current tensions, global interconnectedness provides strong incentives for cooperation and stability.</p>

          <p>Lara Trump, host of "My View with Lara Trump," has sparked debate by revealing her "no-wait-at-the-gate" travel strategy, aiming to arrive at the airport just as her boarding zone is called. She asserts this method maximizes personal time, avoiding unnecessary waiting at the airport, and relies on airline apps and Google flight tracking to monitor delays. While the TSA recommends arriving two to three hours before flights, Trump, who adopted this hack during campaign travel, emphasizes efficiency. The article notes that her approach has garnered mixed reactions online, with some travelers agreeing with the time-saving benefits while others express anxiety over such last-minute arrivals, highlighting a common point of contention among air passengers.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," reveals her profound fear of "dying a sexual assault slave" at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. The article details her claims of having sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including one "orgy" with Epstein and other underage girls, which Prince Andrew has always denied. Giuffre recounts being told by Ghislaine Maxwell to "do for him what you do for Jeffrey" regarding Prince Andrew, and receiving $15,000 for "servicing" him. The memoir, published after Giuffre's death by suicide, also exposes the sinister details of Epstein's trafficking, including demands for girls to appear "childlike" and experiences of being choked, beaten, and bloodied.</p>

          <p>Millions across the US participated in the "No Kings" demonstrations, protesting President Donald Trump's policies and perceived overreach of presidential authority. These peaceful rallies, held in major cities and smaller towns, surpassed previous turnouts, signaling a strong anti-Trump sentiment and a moment for likeminded Democrats, liberals, and some anti-Trump Republicans to unite. While the White House dismissed the protests, the scale of participation, coupled with Trump's net negative approval ratings, suggests a potential opportunity for Democrats to rebound from recent electoral defeats. The article explores the diverse reasons for liberal frustration and the challenges Democrats face in mounting an effective opposition, especially amidst an ongoing government shutdown and internal party divisions.</p>

          <p>The recent, spectacular robbery at the Louvre Museum, involving the theft of Napoleon-era jewels, has sparked serious questions regarding the security of French artworks. This article describes the professional gang's seven-minute operation, using a vehicle-mounted platform and disc-cutters to access the Apollo Gallery and steal eight priceless items. It highlights that criminal groups target jewels for their convertibility into cash, unlike famous paintings. The article also provides historical context, referencing past French museum thefts and the infamous 1911 Mona Lisa disappearance, emphasizing that recovering the current stolen items intact will be challenging due as thieves will likely break them apart.</p>

          <p>China has banned imports of Nvidia AI graphics cards, asserting its domestic chips can now compete on equal footing and accusing Nvidia of anti-monopoly violations. This article explains that China's significant investment in AI, including the development of platforms like DeepSeek and Alibaba's new H20-matching chip, has reduced its reliance on foreign technology. The ban follows a 2022 US block on high-end semiconductors to China, which spurred the country to accelerate its own chip manufacturing. Chinese officials claim Nvidia violated anti-monopoly laws during its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, signaling a deepening tech rivalry and a shift towards self-sufficiency.

The article details Trump's blame on Petro for encouraging illegal drug production and Petro's previous accusation of "murder" against the US for a September strike. This marks a new low in US-Colombia relations, traditionally close allies. The US has conducted multiple strikes on alleged drug boats, killing dozens, raising alarms among legal experts and Democrats about adherence to the laws of war.</p>

It also includes a controversial demand to prevent "belittling and sparking violence against conservative ideas."
