          <p>President Donald Trump issued a threatening message on social media, stating that the U.S. knows the location of Iranâ€™s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and called him an "easy target." Trump asserted that the U.S. has complete control of the skies over Iran and warned against missile attacks on civilians or American soldiers, indicating that U.S. patience is waning. This escalation comes amid ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, with Trump signaling a firm stance against Iranian actions. The president's remarks underscore the heightened stakes and potential for further conflict in the region. </p>

          <p>Downing Street acknowledged that the small boat situation in the English Channel is worsening, with over 16,000 migrants crossing this year, a 42% increase from last year. Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to collaborate on tackling the crossings, emphasizing migration as a key focus during Macron's upcoming state visit. The government pointed to good weather and the willingness of people smugglers to cram more people onto small boats as factors driving the spike in migration crossings. Ministers have been pushing for the French government to implement new rules to make it easier to intercept boats. </p>

Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin emphasized that there would be no safe spaces for industries harboring violent criminals or undermining ICE's efforts.

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer defended his decision to hold a national inquiry into grooming gangs, reversing his previous stance where he accused those calling for one of "jumping on a far right bandwagon."

Starmer stated that the inquiry must address all relevant issues, including ethnicity and the role of public officials. Baroness Casey's report also highlights poor data collection on the ethnicity of perpetrators, and suggests officials had "shied away" from the issue. </p>

          <p>Trump Mobile removed its coverage map shortly after its launch due to the body of water south of Texas being labeled as the Gulf of Mexico instead of the Trump-preferred name, Gulf of America. This issue arose after President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming the international body of water, a name other countries reject. The Trump family licensed its name to the U.S. mobile service, which appears to have used T-Mobile's network data for its coverage map. The map stirred up chatter across social media before being removed. </p>

          <p>A $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family over the opioid crisis has garnered support from 55 attorneys general across the country. The settlement would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S. The funds will be distributed over 15 years to compensate victims and abate the opioid crisis. The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was unlawful. Judge William Young stated that the cuts, targeting research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, represented unlawful discrimination. He ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said that the agency stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor. </p>
