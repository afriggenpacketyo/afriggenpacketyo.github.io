          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has declared that the FBI would be unwelcome in his state if they were to pursue Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled to prevent a vote on a redistricting plan. Pritzker argued that the Texas legislators have not violated any federal laws, rendering any FBI involvement a form of political grandstanding. This statement comes in response to calls from Texas Republicans, including Senator John Cornyn, for federal assistance in locating the lawmakers. Pritzker, along with other Democratic governors, has offered sanctuary to the Texas Democrats, framing their actions as a defense of democracy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new census that would, for the first time, exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. The directive suggests using data from the 2024 presidential election, though the connection to census-taking is unclear. This move revives a contentious effort from his first term that faced legal challenges and was ultimately blocked by the Supreme Court regarding a citizenship question. The 14th Amendment has historically been interpreted to require counting all persons in each state, making this new effort constitutionally questionable and likely to spark significant legal battles.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced strong second-quarter financial results, largely propelled by the success of its film studios. Box office hits like "A Minecraft Movie" and "F1" helped the studio segment's revenue increase by 55% to $3.8 billion. CEO David Zaslav highlighted the significant turnaround for the film division, which has been a focus of revitalization since the 2022 merger. The company projects continued momentum, with its studios expected to generate at least $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the full year, a major step toward its long-term financial goals.

          <p>A vessel carrying approximately 200 migrants, mostly from Ethiopia, sank in the Bab al-Mandab Strait, resulting in at least 92 deaths. The incident highlights the extreme dangers of the so-called Eastern Route to Yemen, which migrants use to reach wealthy Gulf states. Despite the risks of overcrowded boats, treacherous waters, and abuse by smugglers, the number of people attempting this crossing has increased. The article notes a lack of official sea rescue operations in the area, unlike the Mediterranean, leaving distressed vessels to rely on passing cargo ships whose captains are often wary of pirates.</p>

          <p>Marc Agnifilo, the lead attorney for Sean "Diddy" Combs, has refuted claims that the defense team is seeking a presidential pardon for the music mogul. This clarification comes after another of Combs' lawyers suggested such conversations had occurred with the Trump administration. Combs was recently convicted on prostitution-related charges and acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking counts, and is currently awaiting sentencing. Agnifilo stated his focus is on securing a favorable sentence, not a pardon, and denied any allegations that his client committed sexual assault, describing his relationship with a key witness as a "modern love story."</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, has given China a two-week deadline to provide details on blacked-out sections of its plans for a new, large-scale embassy in London. The proposed complex at Royal Mint Court has raised significant security concerns, including fears of espionage due to its proximity to London's financial district and potential for harassing political dissidents. The local council had previously rejected the application over safety issues, but Rayner has now taken control of the decision-making process amid a complex diplomatic landscape between the two nations.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of semiconductors, the essential microchips that power modern technology, and explains President Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on foreign-made imports. The primary goal of the tariffs is to incentivize companies to move manufacturing to the United States, addressing both economic and national security concerns. While the threat could impact a wide range of tech companies and potentially raise consumer prices, exemptions may be granted for firms that invest in U.S.-based production. Major Asian producers like Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung are central to the global supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

While the talks may serve political purposes for both leaders, such as fending off new sanctions on Moscow, the fundamental gap between the two sides remains immense.

          <h2>Trump Calls for Intel CEO's Resignation Citing Ties to Chinese Firms</h2>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him as "highly conflicted" due to his investment history with Chinese companies, some reportedly linked to the country's military. This call follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton to Intel's board raising similar national security concerns. The demand has created pressure on the chipmaker, which is a major recipient of U.S. government subsidies, and caused its stock to decline in premarket trading. Intel stated it is committed to U.S. national security and would address the senator's concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peloton announced a surprise quarterly profit, but also revealed plans to lay off 6% of its workforce as part of a new cost-cutting initiative. The connected fitness company's net income of $21.6 million was a significant improvement from a loss in the prior year, driven by better-than-expected sales and aggressive expense reductions. New CEO Peter Stern stated that operating costs remain too high, prompting a plan to save an additional $100 million in fiscal year 2026. The mixed results show progress in stabilizing the business but also underscore its ongoing challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its launch, the Giving Pledge, an initiative started by the Gateses and Warren Buffett to encourage billionaires to donate most of their wealth, has seen its momentum slow. A report by the Institute for Policy Studies found that the rate of new signatories has declined, with only 12% of current U.S. billionaires having joined. During the same period, the collective wealth of billionaires has more than doubled, growing faster than their charitable giving. The report raises questions about the effectiveness of such non-binding philanthropic commitments in addressing wealth inequality.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" warns of a potential crisis in pediatric health care. While the law aims to cut taxes and reduce waste in Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office projects it will cause 11 million Americans to lose insurance coverage. Because nearly half of all American children are enrolled in Medicaid or the related CHIP program, the effects could be devastating for pediatric care. Experts anticipate that cuts to Medicaid financing will lead to fewer insured children, reduced services, and the closure of fragile children's hospitals and clinics.</p>

          <p>An in-depth analysis argues that the famine in Gaza is not an accidental byproduct of war but a systematic and intentional strategy by Israel. The article points to statements from Israeli officials at the conflict's outset promising a "complete siege" and highlights how the sustained blockade of humanitarian aid has directly caused widespread malnutrition and death. Unlike other historical famines that may have been exacerbated by natural conditions, the situation in Gaza is described as entirely human-made. This use of starvation as a method of warfare is a war crime under international law.</p>

The announcement came from Putin's adviser, Yuri Ushakov, following a meeting between Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff. The talks are part of an effort to address the war in Ukraine ahead of a U.S. deadline for Moscow to agree to a ceasefire or face severe new sanctions. While a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was reportedly suggested, the upcoming summit will be between Putin and Trump only.</p>

The justification notes that the Cybertrucks do not sustain the expected level of damage upon major impact. The vehicles are needed for testing at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and are only required to be towable with their batteries removed.</p>
