          <h2>The Importance of Prioritizing Friendship Alongside Romantic Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 12:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how society often prioritizes romantic relationships over friendships, leading to a decline in platonic bonds when people couple up. It delves into the historical context, noting that friendships were once highly valued, even considered as intimate as marriages. The piece highlights the pressure on romantic partners to fulfill all emotional needs and suggests that maintaining strong friendships is crucial for mental well-being. It encourages intentionality in friendships, even amidst romantic commitments, and reimagining free time to include friends, thereby reducing the burden on partners and fostering a more balanced social life. The article suggests that jealousy in friendships can be a signal to value the relationship and make an effort to maintain it. </p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi defended President Trump's pardons for individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol attack, arguing that the situation is "very different" from the ongoing protests in Los Angeles. She emphasized that the LA protests involve people currently harming others, while downplaying the severity of the January 6th riot, where over 140 officers were injured. Bondi's stance contradicts her earlier statements during her confirmation hearing, where she condemned violence against law enforcement and suggested evaluating Jan. 6 pardons on a "case-to-case basis." The article highlights the hypocrisy perceived by critics, who point to the administration's aggressive response to the LA protests compared to the pardons for those who assaulted police on January 6th. </p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement regarding Gibraltar's status post-Brexit, aiming to avoid border checks between Spain and the British Overseas Territory. Under the agreement, passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the system at London's St Pancras station for Eurostar passengers. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares and EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic hailed the deal as "historic." The agreement addresses concerns about potential delays at the border due to the EU's upcoming Entry/Exit system and ensures the operational autonomy of the UK's military facilities in Gibraltar. </p>

          <p>Starbucks is piloting a banana-flavored protein cold foam at five locations in the U.S., paired with their iced latte, as part of a menu reimagining. This move reflects the growing popularity of protein-enhanced beverages and snacks. The company is testing new products through its "Starting Five" program before potentially launching them nationwide. To accommodate new items, Starbucks plans to reduce its food and beverage offerings by 30% by the end of Fiscal Year 2025. The menu redesign is part of CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" restructuring plan, aimed at boosting sales and attracting customers back to retail locations after relatively flat sales in 2024 and early 2025. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's legal team is attempting to move his appeal of the New York hush money conviction from state to federal court, arguing that the case involves "official acts" undertaken during his presidency. The defense contends that Trump, as a federal officer, is entitled to a federal forum, especially in what they describe as a unique prosecution. Prosecutors argue that it is too late to move the case after sentencing and that the purpose of removal is to decide where to hold the trial, not to divert the state criminal proceeding. The appeals court heard arguments on the matter and will take the issue under advisement, while legal experts note that even if the appeal moves to federal court, a presidential pardon would not apply as it remains a state crime. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with China, stating that China has agreed to supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US would walk back its threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. The announcement followed two days of intense talks in London aimed at resolving conflicts that emerged after a truce was agreed upon in May. Details about the new agreement were limited, but officials said it would not alter the broad outlines of the May truce. The negotiations were triggered by US concerns that China was being too slow to release exports of its magnets and rare earth minerals, which are essential for manufacturing various products. </p>

The statement followed high-level trade talks in London, where Trump said a deal was "done" but subject to final approval. China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%, consistent with the agreement made last month to temporarily reduce retaliatory duties. </p>

Some parents believe this practice teaches children about the value of money and responsible spending habits.

Building a good credit score can lead to better rates on mortgages and car loans, and some employers consider credit scores during hiring.

The bankrupt carrier cited an agreement to sell its assets to a buyer who decided not to continue the airline's flight operations. Silver Airways, which launched in 2011 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, served more than a dozen destinations across Florida, the Bahamas, and the Caribbean. The airline stated that it would refund customers' purchases through their credit card companies or travel agencies. </p>
