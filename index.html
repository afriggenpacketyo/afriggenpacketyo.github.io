          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 79 fatalities, with 41 individuals, including children and a counselor from a summer camp, still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities and causing extensive damage, particularly in Kerr County. A major disaster declaration has been signed by the president, enabling federal resources to aid in the ongoing, large-scale search and rescue operations. The disaster's scale has shocked officials, who are working around the clock to locate survivors amidst the wreckage.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys wide receiver and Pro Bowl return specialist KaVontae Turpin was arrested in Texas on misdemeanor charges of marijuana possession and unlawful carrying of a weapon. The arrest occurred just weeks before the team is scheduled to begin its training camp for the upcoming season. Turpin was booked into Collin County Jail and released the following day on bond. This incident marks another off-the-field legal issue for the player, who was previously dismissed from his college team for assault charges.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, a debate has emerged between state officials and the National Weather Service over the accuracy and clarity of the weather forecasts. While the NWS insists it issued appropriate watches and warnings, including a rare "flash flood emergency," some Texas officials argue the predictions failed to convey the catastrophic scale of the event. Experts note the inherent difficulty in forecasting the exact location and intensity of extreme rainfall. The disagreement highlights the critical communication gap between meteorological science and public emergency preparedness.</p>

          <p>According to expert Denis Simon, the future of the US-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement (STA) is a crucial indicator of the overall health of the bilateral relationship. Originally signed in 1979, the STA has been a foundational element for scientific collaboration but is now under strain due to geopolitical tensions, national security concerns, and techno-nationalism. The agreement's historical success in building trust through scientific diplomacy now clashes with modern fears of espionage and intellectual property theft. How the two nations navigate this pact reflects their broader strategic approach to engagement versus competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision within President Trump's new spending bill is being called a major victory for the anti-abortion movement, as it will bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any of its health services. Reproductive rights experts warn this will have a devastating impact, particularly in underserved communities where Planned Parenthood is often the only provider of basic healthcare, including prenatal and postnatal care. The move is seen as part of a coordinated effort to restrict access to reproductive healthcare through legislative means, going beyond just abortion services.</p>

          <p>The FBI is warning New Hampshire homeowners about a rise in quit claim deed fraud, a scam that has cost residents over $4 million in the last four years. So-called "title pirates" forge documents to illegally transfer property ownership, often targeting vacant lands, vacation homes, or properties owned by the elderly. Scammers then use the fraudulent title to sell the property or take out a mortgage without the real owner's knowledge. Authorities advise homeowners to consider title insurance and monitor their property records to guard against this threat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a public falling out with President Donald Trump over a new tax and spending law, billionaire Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." Musk, who had fiercely criticized the bill as an "insane spending bill," made the announcement on his social media platform X, stating the party was formed to "give you back your freedom." The move signals a definitive break from his former ally and could impact the 2026 midterm elections if Musk commits significant financial resources, though the viability of third parties is historically low.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas, where rainfall totals reached once-in-a-thousand-year levels, underscore the growing challenge of forecasting extreme weather events exacerbated by the climate crisis. While the National Weather Service did issue timely watches and warnings, the sheer volume of rain far exceeded initial predictions, pointing to the limitations of current models. An analysis shows that record atmospheric moisture, fueled by near-record warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, contributed to the disaster. The event serves as a stark example of how climate change is making historic weather events more frequent.</p>

He stated that most of Hamas's leadership has been killed and that the group is now struggling to maintain any semblance of governance. This internal disintegration is creating a new, lawless reality for civilians.</p>
