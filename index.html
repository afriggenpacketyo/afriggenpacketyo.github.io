Fans will also have the opportunity to celebrate the team during an open-top bus parade in central London, culminating in a ceremony outside Buckingham Palace. Despite calls for a national celebration, the government has indicated that, similar to previous wins, no bank holiday will be granted, citing the potential economic cost.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing universities based on the job prospects of specific majors rather than the institution's overall prestige. This trend reflects heightened anxiety about the domestic job market, leading students to favor practical fields like computer science, which has seen a surge in popularity due to the rise of artificial intelligence. The shift indicates that immediate employability and job security are becoming more critical than long-term aspirations or the reputation of an elite university.</p>

          <h2>OMB Director Distances Trump's Fed Criticism from Project 2025 Blueprint</h2>

          <p>White House OMB Director Russell Vought has indicated that President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve is primarily driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the specific Fed overhaul proposed in the Project 2025 blueprint. When questioned about the conservative plan's chapter on the Fed, Vought, a key architect of the overall project, claimed, "I don't even know what that chapter says." The comments come as the Trump administration continues to apply pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>House Speaker Calls Push for Epstein File Release 'Reckless' Amid GOP Divisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 20:39:48 EDT</div>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has criticized a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein, labeling the measure "reckless" for allegedly lacking sufficient victim protections. The bill's co-sponsors, Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, refuted this claim, stating their legislation was carefully crafted to redact victims' names. The internal GOP conflict highlights growing pressure on party leadership to act on the issue, with Massie warning it could become a political liability.</p>

          <p>Tyler Boebert, the 20-year-old son of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, has received a misdemeanor citation for child abuse involving his own young son. The congresswoman explained that the incident stemmed from a "miscommunication on monitoring" her grandson, who briefly got out of the house but was not injured. This event follows previous legal issues for Tyler Boebert, who pleaded guilty to attempted identity theft in a separate case last year.</p>
