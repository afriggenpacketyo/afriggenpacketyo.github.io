          <p>A recent report from Renmin University indicates that the Chinese yuan's international usage is growing, narrowing the gap with the US dollar and euro while surpassing the British pound and Japanese yen. The yuan internationalization index rose by approximately 11% in 2024, reflecting its increasing role in reshaping the global financial order. However, the report also highlights that US-dollar-backed stablecoins are viewed as a potential threat to this expansion. Geoeconomic shocks have also been noted as a disruptive factor for both China's economy and global trade systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Polish and allied NATO aircraft were activated following a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine, placing air defense and radar systems on high alert. The assault, involving over 300 drones and several missiles, resulted in at least eight injuries in Kyiv after a residential building was hit. A Russian drone also reportedly crossed into Lithuanian airspace from Belarus, prompting a search. Ukrainian officials stated the attack demonstrates Russia's lack of commitment to peace and is a test of NATO's reaction.</p>

          <p>The Amazon World zoo on the Isle of Wight has joyfully announced the birth of endangered red panda twins, a significant success for its breeding program. The cubs were born on June 17 to their mother, Xiao, and a much younger male, Flint, who was brought from Belfast Zoo in 2024. The zoo is closely monitoring the new family via CCTV, as the cubs will remain in their nest box for about three months. Red pandas are threatened by poaching and habitat loss in their native eastern Himalayas and China.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has announced that 120 aid trucks were allowed to enter Gaza, coinciding with a ten-hour pause in military operations in certain areas. This move follows intense international criticism over the severe humanitarian crisis and mass starvation in the enclave. The UN welcomed the decision but cautioned that it is insufficient to prevent famine and a catastrophic health crisis. Meanwhile, the German government is meeting to discuss its stance on the conflict, and human rights NGOs are set to release a new report on the situation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines the criminal referral against Senator Adam Schiff, which alleges he falsified documents to secure favorable mortgage terms by misrepresenting his primary residence. The author analyzes the legal complexities, including potential venue challenges in liberal-leaning districts and the statute of limitations for financial fraud. While labeling the senator's conduct as potentially "sleazy," the piece concludes that a federal or state criminal indictment is unlikely. The analysis suggests that unless explicit instructions on loan documents were violated, proving intentional bank fraud would be difficult for prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Despite forecasting a nearly 288% year-over-year increase in net profit for the first half of 2025, shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold fell. After an initial rise, the stock declined as investors appeared to lock in profits from its significant year-to-date gains. Analysts attribute the retreat to a reset in market expectations and concerns over rising gold prices, although some believe the company's valuation has become more attractive. Laopu, popular among younger consumers for its unique designs, has seen its stock skyrocket since its listing, contrasting with more sluggish overall consumer spending in China.

          <p>Georgia's two-year experience with Medicaid work requirements reveals significant bureaucratic challenges and high costs, serving as a potential warning for other states. The program, which has cost over $91 million, requires low-income adults to report 80 hours of work or other activities monthly to maintain health coverage, but has been plagued by a glitchy online portal and improper denials. Health advocates worry that these issues, which have caused eligible individuals to struggle for months to get approved, will be replicated nationwide under a new law.

This article explains that for these children, standard advice may not be effective, and a different approach is needed to foster healthy eating habits. Experts suggest parents can help by not keeping large quantities of these foods at home and instead making them available only on special occasions. This strategy helps children regulate their eating with whole foods and avoids setting them up for failure in an environment where ultra-processed options are ubiquitous.</p>

This decision jeopardizes the education of current students and halts a critical pipeline of mental health professionals to Oklahoma, where all 77 counties face a shortage.

          <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian burial offering. The print was found on the underside of a clay "soul house," a model building placed in tombs, dating from 2055 to 1650 BC. Curators believe the handprint was left by the potter who moved the object to dry before it was fired in a kiln. Described as a rare and exciting find, the artifact provides a direct human connection to the ancient craftsmen who are often overlooked in history. The item will be featured in an upcoming exhibition.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework agreement on tariffs, establishing a 15% rate on many major European exports to the US, including cars. This deal avoids a threatened 30% tariff but is higher than the previous rate and the UK's 10% tariff. In return, the EU will open its markets to American exports at zero tariff and has committed to purchasing billions in US energy and arms. While the Trump administration hails it as a major victory, Brussels views it as a necessary compromise that provides stability, though EU steel and aluminum still face a 50% tariff.

          <p>During a meeting in Europe, President Donald Trump launched into a rambling and factually inaccurate criticism of wind power, claiming it was "killing" Americans and was a "horrible thing." He falsely stated that wind turbines are almost all made in China, last only eight years, and that wind energy is the most expensive form of power. Critics and AI fact-checkers quickly debunked these claims, pointing out that Germany gets over a quarter of its energy from wind and that turbines have a lifespan of about 30 years. Trump's long-standing animosity towards wind power is believed to stem from a proposed wind farm near his Scottish golf resort.</p>

The Congolese military condemned the event as a "large-scale massacre," and the UN peacekeeping mission described the targeted attacks on defenseless civilians as revolting.

It creates a tariff disparity on the island of Ireland, disadvantaging the Republic of Ireland compared to Northern Ireland.
