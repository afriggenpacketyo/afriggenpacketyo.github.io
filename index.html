          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 10:04:13 EDT</div>

          <p>A major wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed dozens of structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, prompting evacuations and an investigation into the fire's handling. The blaze, fueled by strong winds, also caused a chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment facility, complicating firefighting efforts. No injuries have been reported, but the loss of the 1937-era lodge is a significant blow to state history. Concurrently, smoke from separate, large-scale Canadian wildfires is causing poor air quality across the Upper Midwest.</p>

          <p>Emergency crews in Kerr County, Texas, have paused their search for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flooding due to a new flood threat. The earlier disaster killed at least 132 people, and around 160 individuals remain missing in the region. Renewed heavy rains are causing the Guadalupe and San Saba Rivers to rise again, prompting new flood warnings and rescue operations in several counties. Officials are urging extreme caution, as the already saturated ground and rising water levels create life-threatening conditions, particularly around low water crossings.</p>

          <p>Security researchers have identified a campaign involving 18 browser extensions on the official Chrome and Edge web stores that were secretly tracking users' online activities. These extensions, which included tools like color pickers and volume boosters, amassed over two million installations by initially appearing legitimate before being updated with malicious code. The malware recorded every URL users visited and redirected them to fraudulent websites. The article lists the dangerous extensions and advises users to remove them, clear browser data, and run malware scans to secure their information.</p>

To show genuine empathy, one should instead focus on being fully present, which includes using open body language and eliminating distractions. The article suggests helpful techniques like repeating a key word the speaker used, embracing silence to allow for reflection, and using the phrase "Tell me more" to encourage deeper sharing.

          <p>A new analysis from the think tank Energy Innovation projects that President Trump's recently signed energy bill will cause a significant rise in U.S. household electricity costs over the next decade. The legislation rolls back clean energy tax credits and mandates expanded fossil fuel leasing, which is expected to slow the development of cheaper renewable energy sources. As a result, reliance on more expensive natural gas will increase, with the average household predicted to pay an additional $170 annually by 2035, and some states facing increases over $500.

          <p>The president of the global players' union, Fifpro, has sharply criticized FIFA's expanded Club World Cup, labeling the tournament a "fiction" and comparing FIFA's president to a Roman emperor. The union argues that the competition was created without proper dialogue or respect for player welfare, deepening inequality and precariousness for most footballers. This criticism is part of an escalating dispute, which includes potential legal action against FIFA, over the congested international match calendar and what the union sees as a lack of protection for players.</p>
