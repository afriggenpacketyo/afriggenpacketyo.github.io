          <p>The United States and Vietnam have reached a trade agreement that imposes a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports to the U.S., averting a much higher threatened rate of 46%.

The deal addresses U.S. concerns about its large trade deficit with Vietnam and accusations of transshipment, where Chinese goods are relabeled as Vietnamese.

Traders speculated about her potential resignation, which would threaten the strict "fiscal rules" she has championed to control government spending and debt.

The bill faces significant hurdles due to deep divisions within the Republican party, with various factions opposing it for different reasons. Fiscal conservatives, or "deficit hawks," are outraged that the bill could add over $3.3 trillion to the national deficit, while other members are concerned about its deep cuts to the Medicaid health insurance program.</p>

The watchdog discovered that evidence provided by the council was so heavily redacted that some pages contained only a few words, making it impossible to assess. While a new information-sharing protocol has since been agreed upon, the past failures are noted to have eroded trust, even as the report acknowledges recent significant improvements in police procedures.</p>

          <p>Urban areas can become significantly hotter than their rural surroundings, a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island" effect, which can raise temperatures by 10 to 15 degrees Celsius. This is caused by dark, heat-absorbing surfaces like asphalt and concrete, a lack of cooling vegetation, and urban layouts that trap hot air. The article explains that this effect intensifies heatwaves for the 50% of the world's population living in cities and also outlines potential solutions, including green roofs, reflective pavements, and increased urban green spaces.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old pilot in Changchun, China, attacked two of his superiors and then died by suicide after jumping from a 15th-floor window. The incident reportedly occurred after the pilot failed a performance evaluation and was deemed unqualified to fly, with an internal report citing his "lack of understanding of rules and procedures." The two colleagues who were attacked were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, and an investigation into the workplace dispute is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska defended his support for President Trump's sweeping tax and spending legislation, arguing that it provides critical tax relief for middle-class Americans. In an interview, Bacon acknowledged concerns about the bill's changes to Medicaid but stated that voting against it would amount to a significant tax hike for his constituents. His comments come as House GOP leaders race to secure enough votes from their divided caucus to pass the bill ahead of a key deadline.</p>
