          <p>A search is underway in a lake south of Manila for dozens of cockfighting enthusiasts allegedly murdered by rogue police officers in 2022. Investigators have found a bag containing what appear to be burned human bones, which the Department of Justice called a potential "significant breakthrough." The case involves allegations that as many as 100 people involved in match-fixing were killed by police working for an online cockfight operator. Fifteen officers are currently under investigation, and victims' families are hoping to find closure by recovering the remains of their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown has pleaded not guilty to two additional charges stemming from an alleged assault at a London nightclub in February 2023. The charges are for assault causing actual bodily harm and possessing an offensive weapon, specifically a bottle. This is in addition to a more serious charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, to which he pleaded not guilty last month. The case involves the alleged beating of music producer Abraham Diaw at the Tape nightclub in Mayfair, with the next hearing proceeding accordingly.</p>

          <p>Over 22 million Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace could see a significant increase in their premiums in 2026. This is because enhanced premium tax credits, which have lowered costs since 2021, are set to expire after 2025 and were not extended in a recent Republican bill. According to KFF, the average marketplace enrollee could see their premiums rise by over 75% without these credits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4.2 million people could become uninsured if the enhanced subsidies are allowed to lapse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The body of a teenage boy has been found in Powell's Pool at Sutton Park in Birmingham after he was reported missing in the water on Thursday evening. West Midlands Police stated that the death is not being treated as suspicious and that the boy's family is receiving support.

          <p>A 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, has been found alive after being missing for nearly two weeks in western Australia. She was discovered by a passerby in a remote bush area following an extensive, multi-day search operation by authorities.

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in May, marking the second straight month of decline after a 0.3% fall in April. The Office for National Statistics attributed the downturn primarily to drops in manufacturing and construction. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures "disappointing" but affirmed her commitment to boosting growth, while the Conservative opposition blamed Labour's "reckless choices." The data adds pressure on the new government, which has made economic growth a key priority amid a fragile outlook and strained public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

The delay was initiated by the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, which requested a postponement for one Social Democrat nominee, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, citing plagiarism concerns and her liberal views. This move caused an uproar among the Social Democrats and Greens, who in turn called for the vote on all three candidates to be suspended to protect the court's integrity.

The report breaks down the figure into 500,000 labor trafficking victims and 200,000 sex trafficking victims, with about 100,000 of the total being children. Researchers compiled data from 30 agencies and non-profit partners to create the report, which aims to make a "hidden crime" more visible to policymakers. The state's large population, major event hubs, and industries with vulnerable workers contribute to its susceptibility to such crimes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recently signed "big, beautiful bill" is a profound betrayal of his working-class supporters. The author contends that the legislation's $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, potential loss of health coverage for millions, and reductions in food assistance programs directly harm the people who form his base. The piece characterizes Trump's MAGA populism as a charade, suggesting that he coerced fearful Republican lawmakers into passing an unpopular bill that contradicts his own promises.

          <p>This article addresses common fears about microwave ovens, explaining that they are generally safe for both people and food. Microwaves use non-ionizing radiation, a low-energy form similar to radio waves, which does not make food radioactive or damage human DNA like ionizing radiation from nuclear reactions. In fact, the short cooking time of microwaves can help food retain more nutrients compared to methods like boiling. The primary risks associated with microwaves are burns from hot food and containers, and the potential for chemicals to leach from unsafe plastic containers when heated.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision has affirmed the authority of the Health and Human Services Secretary over no-cost preventive care, a move that could threaten services like cancer screenings and vaccines. The 6-3 ruling determined that members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are "inferior officers" who can be appointed and removed by the HHS Secretary, currently Robert F. Kennedy Jr. While the decision averted the immediate loss of these benefits for 150 million Americans, it empowers Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, to potentially alter recommendations, sparking new legal battles from medical groups.</p>

          <p>A San Diego County chef is suing foam foodware manufacturer WinCup, alleging the company continues to sell and distribute banned polystyrene foam products in California. A state law, SB 54, prohibited the sale of such items starting January 1 unless producers met a 25% recycling rate, which they did not. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of all Californians, seeks an injunction to stop sales and accuses the company of deceptive advertising by labeling the non-recyclable products with a recycling symbol. The state's enforcement agency, CalRecycle, has been criticized for its delayed action on the ban.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores whether the Democratic party needs its own version of a populist firebrand to effectively counter Donald Trump. The author points to the surprising primary victory of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York as evidence that voters may be drawn to more radical, attention-grabbing politics. The article suggests that for years, Democrats have tried to win by being the opposite of Trump—stable, decent, and moderate—but this approach may be failing in the modern media environment. It posits that a candidate who is authentically combative and proposes bold ideas might be what the party needs, despite the risk of alienating swing voters.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating an incident where a person appeared to fire a gun at federal agents during a protest against an immigration raid at a cannabis farm in Camarillo, California. Video footage captured the moment after smoke canisters were used to disperse the crowd. The FBI has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the individual's conviction. The raid, which also occurred at a second facility in Carpinteria, involved numerous arrests and resulted in several injuries. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that ten undocumented minors were found at the farm during the operation.</p>

          <p>Armed resistance groups in Myanmar are reportedly losing their technological edge in drone warfare against the country's military junta. According to a new report from ACLED, the military has been rapidly closing the gap by acquiring advanced drones and jamming technology, largely with support from China. Rebel groups, who initially leveraged commercial drones for reconnaissance and attacks, now face disrupted operations and supply chain restrictions. This shift could give the military a clear advantage in the ongoing civil war that began after the 2021 coup, potentially stalling rebel offensives.</p>

In his letter, Min Aung Hlaing praised Trump's leadership and drew parallels between the junta's seizure of power and Trump's false claims of fraud in the 2020 U.S. election.

The industry's growth is attributed to a consumer shift toward professional services, with nearly 80% of drivers now opting for them over washing cars themselves, and the cost-efficiency of automated facilities. While the city has 43 car washes, this number is comparable to other businesses like law or accounting firms. An economist suggests their large, visible structures make them seem more numerous. In response to resident concerns, the city temporarily paused new permits and has since implemented new location and building restrictions.</p>

The show follows an American, Jessica (Megan Stalter), who moves to London and falls for a jaded local musician, Felix (Will Sharpe).

While some nitpicks are possible for Londoners, the review concludes that "Too Much" is a triumphant and strange portrait of Dunham's new home city, with scripts that capture bizarre but realistic conversations.</p>
