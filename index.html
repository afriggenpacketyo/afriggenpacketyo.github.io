          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland to El Salvador, has been brought back to the United States to face criminal charges. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts of illegally transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S., alleging his involvement in a years-long conspiracy. The indictment claims Abrego Garcia participated in over 100 trips, transporting thousands of individuals, including some MS-13 members, from Texas to other parts of the country. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador for returning Abrego Garcia, who will be deported again upon completion of his sentence if convicted.</p>

She circumvents the ban by employing her student nurses and midwives at her clinic, allowing them to continue their training. Shefajo fears that without a new generation of female healthcare providers, maternal mortality rates will rise, and women will be left without access to essential medical care.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mark Dybul, who led George W. Bush's PEPFAR program to combat AIDS, expresses concern about the program's future as President Trump seeks to rescind $400 million allocated to PEPFAR. These cuts would significantly reduce efforts to combat HIV and other infectious diseases, reversing the progress made in saving lives and building health systems in hard-hit countries. Dybul emphasizes that while PEPFAR was not intended to be a permanent program, sustained support is crucial to prevent the loss of hard-won gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>

Analysts suggest that the market volatility is largely driven by the investor base's perception of Tesla as a "nothing matters stock."

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at mitigating national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to enhance drone detection and identification, and to combat unlawful uses such as spying and drug smuggling. This initiative is particularly important in light of upcoming large-scale events like the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The executive order also seeks to promote U.S. development and commercial use of drone technology, including deliveries and other applications.</p>

          <p>Amazon is reportedly investing in automating approximately $200 billion in logistics costs, which includes using AI-powered humanoid robots for deliveries. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that these robots, which are being tested at a San Francisco "humanoid park," could reduce delivery times and labor costs. The firm sees this as a key driver of "more durable market share gains" in Amazon's logistics network. The analysts project that increased automation in warehouses could lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030, positioning Amazon as a leader in leveraging physical AI robots for financial returns.

          <p>President Trump has announced that top U.S. economic officials will meet with their Chinese counterparts in London next week to discuss trade. The meeting follows a phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Stocks rose after the announcement, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both advancing. The talks aim to address the frayed trading relationship between the two countries, following a recent phone call where both leaders extended invitations to visit each other's capitals.
