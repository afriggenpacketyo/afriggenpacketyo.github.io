          <p>Following a deadly terror attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, India launched strikes on multiple sites in Pakistan, including areas within Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Punjab Province. The Indian government described the operation as a measured response targeting terrorist camps, while Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed retaliation. This escalation of the long-standing conflict between the two nuclear powers has prompted international concern and calls for restraint, with both sides taking actions that heighten tensions in the disputed region. The article details the locations targeted and the reactions from both governments, including President Trump's comment calling the situation 'a shame'.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece discusses the ethical and potential legal issues surrounding Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures, including the creation of meme coins and a stablecoin project called World Liberty Financial Inc. Experts like Eswar Prasad and Lawrence Lessig argue that Trump's actions represent an unprecedented level of conflict of interest, as he appears to be using his presidential position to enrich himself and his family. The article highlights instances where Trump's announcements have directly influenced the value of his crypto assets, raising concerns about bribery and violations of the Constitution's emoluments clauses. Furthermore, the article suggests that Trump's crypto dealings could jeopardize pending legislation related to the cryptocurrency industry and potentially lead to impeachment proceedings if Democrats regain control of the House.

          <p>Federal wildlife officials are investigating the stabbing of a 300-pound elephant pup seal on an Oregon beach and are seeking the public's help in identifying the attacker. The incident occurred on March 16 in Neskowin, Oregon, and the seal has since recovered and been moved to a secluded beach in Washington State. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released a description and sketch of the suspect, who is described as a white man, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall, with black-and-white hair and a large gap between his front teeth. The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits harming wild elephant seals, with violations punishable by up to a year in jail and a $100,000 fine.</p>

          <p>Asia's largest economies have approved a new rapid financing mechanism that will use regional currencies, including the Chinese yuan, signaling a potential shift away from the US dollar. This scheme is part of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM), a currency swap arrangement among ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and South Korea. The move aims to shield these economies from the financial volatility caused by US President Donald Trump's global tariff war, which has affected the US Treasuries market and Asian currencies. This could represent a longer-term trend towards a regional monetary system that relies less on the dollar and gives China a greater role.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has formally revoked some layoff notices, reinstating staff at the CDC and FDA, including those working for the World Trade Center Health Program.

While some FDA food safety labs also had their layoffs reversed, not all workers promised reinstatement have received notices, and the status of CDC's National Center for Environmental Health employees remains uncertain.

          <p>This Atlantic article analyzes the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to financially hobble elite universities, noting a shift in justification from addressing anti-Semitism to broadly targeting liberal institutions. The author points to a hostile letter from Education Secretary Linda McMahon to Harvard University, which omits any mention of anti-Semitism and instead lists a range of grievances, including admitting students critical of America and hiring former Democratic mayors. The article argues that this reveals the administration's true motive: punishing universities for being liberal. The shift comes after the administration successfully extracted concessions from Columbia University by threatening to withhold funding over alleged failures to address anti-Semitism.</p>

CEO Charles Liang cited customer hesitation due to the transition between AI platforms and tariff-related uncertainty as factors affecting performance. The company's revenue grew 19% year over year, but net income declined significantly. The macroeconomic environment and trade regulations are expected to continue weighing on Super Micro's results, leading the company to refrain from providing fiscal 2026 guidance.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a conciliatory tone during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite months of criticizing Canada and suggesting it become the 51st state. Trump praised Canada and its people, a stark contrast to his earlier bellicose posts on social media. Carney, elected on an anti-Trump platform, maintained a firm stance, asserting that Canada is not for sale. The meeting covered various topics, including trade, foreign affairs, and Trump's upcoming announcements, with both leaders aiming to de-escalate tensions and foster a more amicable relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared a cease-fire with the Houthis in Yemen, stating they have agreed to stop targeting American ships in exchange for the U.S. halting its aerial war. This announcement, made during a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister, surprised some of his own team. While the U.S. has extracted itself from the conflict, it remains unclear whether the Houthis will end their war with Israel or if the truce applies to other Western allies. Analysts question how the Houthis will justify dealing with the U.S. given their anti-American stance and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, suggesting the agreement may be linked to new nuclear talks with Iran and Trump's upcoming trip to the Gulf.</p>

          <p>Percival Everett's novel 'James,' a reimagining of 'Huckleberry Finn,' won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction after the Pulitzer committee's board failed to reach a consensus on the initial three finalists. The board then considered a fourth option, 'James,' which received the necessary majority vote. This unusual process highlights a procedural backstop designed to give the board more choices when it faces an impasse. The three finalists, Rita Bullwinkel’s “Headshot,” Stacey Levine’s “Mice 1961,” and Gayl Jones’s “The Unicorn Woman,” represent bold and experimental work on the fringes of American fiction.</p>

          <p>Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, plans to shut down a direct communications channel between the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem's Office of Palestinian Affairs and agencies in Washington. This decision effectively ends the special status of the Office of Palestinian Affairs, which had been sending cables to Washington without needing approval from embassy leaders. The move is one of Huckabee’s most significant decisions since arriving in Israel and was made after consulting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The State Department stated that the responsibilities of the Palestinian Affairs office will be merged fully into the embassy, but maintains that this change is not a reflection on outreach to the people of the West Bank or Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is focusing on logistical and technical issues in its efforts to deport international students involved in campus unrest related to the war in Gaza, avoiding key constitutional questions regarding free speech. During a hearing on the fate of two students, a government lawyer declined to state whether the students' speech is protected by the Constitution. This strategy has frustrated immigration lawyers and slowed some cases, as students' fates are determined by logistical factors rather than core constitutional claims. The government's tactics include moving students out of state and delaying communication with their lawyers, raising concerns about due process and potential violations of First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, but the company will take a $1.5 billion hit to revenue due to chip export controls. The company expects about $700 million in lost revenue during the current quarter and $1.5 billion in total through the end of AMD's fiscal year because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company's artificial intelligence chips during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, CEO Lisa Su stated that AMD's leadership product portfolio would offset these challenges. The company's data center segment saw strong growth due to demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs.</p>
