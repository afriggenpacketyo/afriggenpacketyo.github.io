          <h2>Potential Credibility Issues Arise for Donald Trump's Future Federal Reserve Chair Nominee</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 12:17:18 EDT</div>

          <p>The next Federal Reserve chair under a potential Trump administration could face significant credibility challenges. Analysts worry that any nominee would be perceived as being chosen to execute political demands for lower interest rates, undermining the Fed's traditional independence. The concept of a "shadow chair" being appointed to pressure current Chair Jerome Powell further complicates the situation, raising concerns about market stability and the central bank's institutional integrity. This political pressure deviates from the Fed's dual mandate of stable inflation and full employment, focusing instead on reducing government debt-servicing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has expressed optimism about finalizing a trade deal framework with the United States within days, even as the Trump administration threatens a new wave of tariffs. President Trump announced forthcoming levies on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals and issued tariff notices to numerous countries, escalating global trade tensions. Despite the aggressive U.S. posture, EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic indicated that significant progress has been made in negotiations. The potential deal aims to de-escalate a trade war that has created economic uncertainty, though some European officials remain cautious about the complicated talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researchers Forecast an Above-Average 2025 Atlantic Hurricane Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 12:14:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colorado State University researchers are predicting an active 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, with 16 named storms, eight of which are expected to become hurricanes. Of those, three are forecast to become major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher, driven primarily by warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures. The forecast anticipates hurricane activity to be about 125% of the seasonal average from 1991-2020. While this is slightly less intense than the 2024 prediction, the above-average forecast still poses a significant risk to coastal communities. Uncertainty remains regarding the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle, which will influence storm development later in the season.</p>

          <p>Search and rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have claimed at least 119 lives, with over 170 people still reported missing. The disaster was caused by the Guadalupe River swelling approximately 26 feet in under an hour, devastating communities, including a girls' summer camp in Kerr County where numerous campers and counselors died. A federal disaster has been declared, allowing FEMA to assist local and state responders who are navigating challenging conditions. The tragedy has prompted scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and the region's emergency preparedness for such an extreme event.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has strongly criticized Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, labeling him a "communist" and warning of a dire future for the city under his leadership. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic-socialist, secured a surprise primary victory with a platform focused on affordability, including proposals for free bus fares and tuition-free CUNY. His win has highlighted a divide within the Democratic Party between its progressive and moderate wings. While top Democrats have defended Mamdani from Trump's attacks, they have not yet formally endorsed him, reflecting the complex political landscape his candidacy has created.</p>

          <p>Following a recent conflict with Israel, attention has turned to the succession of Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The process of selecting a new leader is now seen as more urgent, with analysts suggesting contingency plans are in place for a smooth transition. Potential successors range from Khamenei's son, Mojtaba, to more reform-minded figures, though the choice remains secret to prevent political attacks. Some experts speculate that due to recent military and economic setbacks, the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps might favor a non-clerical leader, potentially signaling a significant shift in the nature of the Islamic Republic's governance.</p>

Legal scholars quoted in the article question the legality of such widespread destruction under international law, arguing it goes beyond military necessity.

          <p>The Trump administration's invitation to five African leaders from Senegal, Mauritania, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia for a White House meeting signals a strategic shift in U.S. policy toward the continent. Analysts suggest the focus is on transactional diplomacy centered on migration control, counter-terrorism, and access to critical minerals, as the U.S. competes with China and Russia for influence. The invited nations are located along key migration and trafficking routes and possess valuable resources like oil, manganese, and gas. This "give and take" approach marks a departure from previous administrations' focus on development aid, reflecting a more "America First" foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are making preparations for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump later this month. The visit is expected to be to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire for the opening of a new course. This would be Trump's first trip to Scotland since his 2024 election victory, and it is anticipated to require a significant policing operation. His last presidential visit in 2018 was met with large-scale protests across the country. While a separate full state visit to the UK is planned for later in the year, this specific trip is focused on his private business interests.</p>

          <p>According to newly reported audio from a 2024 donor meeting, Donald Trump claimed he had personally threatened to "bomb the sh-- out of Moscow" to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. In the same recording, Trump asserted he made similar threats to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding a potential invasion of Taiwan. Trump suggested that while Putin may have only partially believed the threat, it was a factor in his strategic calculations. The audio, detailed in a forthcoming book, offers a glimpse into Trump's candid, behind-the-scenes rhetoric and his unconventional approach to foreign policy and deterrence during his presidency.</p>

Laurent Mekies, formerly of Racing Bulls, will take over as the new team principal.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) alleges the son tried to recruit a Ukrainian national involved in the missile's development to obtain the secret documentation. The Neptune missile is a domestically produced weapon famously used to sink Russia's Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, in 2022. The arrests highlight ongoing concerns about Chinese espionage and its support for Russia's war effort, despite Beijing's official stance of neutrality.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of articles has raised alarms about declining literacy among American youth, creating a conflicted discourse. This analysis explores the two main threads of this anxiety: anecdotal reports from college professors about unprepared students and declining national reading test scores for elementary schoolers. While generational complaints about youth are common, data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) does show a real decline in reading proficiency since 2013, particularly among lower-achieving students. Experts debate the causes, citing factors from screen time to teaching methods, and question whether standardized tests fully capture the complex ways modern youth engage with language.</p>

Emergency crews rescued more than 50 other people from the floodwaters. The event highlights the heightened risk of flash flooding in areas recently affected by wildfires, as the charred landscape is less able to absorb heavy rainfall.

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon stated the policy deprives girls of opportunities and ignores safety.

The scandal involved an estimated 30,000 people being infected with HIV and hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products in the 1970s and 80s.
