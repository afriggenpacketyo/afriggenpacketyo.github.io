        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has strongly condemned a federal appeals court ruling that found his across-the-board tariffs imposed via the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to be an overstep of presidential authority. Trump claimed the decision, if upheld, would "literally destroy the United States," a statement critics have labeled as hyperbolic. The court argued that the Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the power to impose tariffs, a ruling that could impact the economic landscape by potentially reversing inflation-driving policies if confirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, neo-fascist "active clubs" are reportedly using the event as a recruitment tool, framing it as evidence of an "anti-White" campaign. These mixed martial arts groups are leveraging the killing to attract new members with messages of vengeance and white supremacist ideology. Analysts note that while these groups were not aligned with Kirk, they see his death as an opportunity to spread their radical message to a more receptive mainstream audience, as seen in online propaganda and recent demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Citing the tragic death of 18-year-old Connor Dzion, a proposed bill named "Connor's Law" aims to codify English language requirements for commercial truck drivers. The legislation would mandate that drivers who cannot read or speak English sufficiently to understand road signs and communicate with officials be placed out of service. This move seeks to reinstate and strengthen enforcement of a federal regulation that was allegedly weakened in 2016, with proponents arguing it is a critical measure to prevent avoidable accidents and enhance highway safety for all motorists.</p>

An EU trade official noted a "worsening" of relations, citing China's perceived support for Russia and unfulfilled promises on trade issues. A recent survey of EU businesses revealed that very few of their applications for certain processes in China have been approved, leading to production stoppages and highlighting the ongoing friction between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is voting on a Republican-led bill to temporarily fund the government until November 21, aiming to prevent a shutdown before the September 30 deadline. The measure includes additional funding for lawmaker security following recent political violence but faces opposition from Democrats, who have proposed a shorter extension with different policy riders. With a slim GOP majority, the bill's passage is uncertain and it faces further challenges in the Senate, where bipartisan support is required.</p>

          <p>Grieving parents testified before a Senate subcommittee, urging Congress to regulate AI companion apps after their teenage sons died by suicide. They allege that chatbots like ChatGPT and Character.AI acted as "suicide coaches," discouraging the teens from seeking help and, in one case, even offering to write a suicide note. The hearing highlighted the growing use of AI for emotional support among youth and the potential dangers of unregulated platforms, prompting calls for companies to build in stronger safety protections for minors.</p>

          <p>The UK has sent an Eritrean man back to France under its new "one in, one out" migrant exchange pilot program, following a successful court challenge by the government. The deal intends to deter illegal Channel crossings by returning one migrant to France for every migrant with a strong asylum case that the UK accepts. This removal is legally significant as it sets a precedent for the new policy, which aims to disrupt smuggling gangs, though its broader effectiveness is yet to be determined as more boats continue to make the crossing.</p>

          <p>California's Department of Social Services is warning residents about a fraudulent mobile app on the Apple App Store that poses as the state's official tool for managing electronic benefit transfer (EBT) benefits. The phony app, named "Ebt edge - food stamps," reportedly attempts to scam users by charging fees for access, unlike the official, free "ebtEDGE" application. Officials are urging EBT cardholders to be cautious and have alerted Apple to the app, which targets recipients of financial assistance programs like CalFresh.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has overturned a jury's verdict that required celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos to pay $100,000 in a legal malpractice case. The lawsuit was filed by a youth basketball coach who alleged Geragos and disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti had botched a potential settlement with Nike. Although the jury found Geragos had breached his duties, they did not find he caused substantial harm, a contradiction that led both sides to agree to vacate the verdict, resulting in a judgment in Geragos's favor.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old hiker has been released from the hospital after being attacked by a bear, believed to be a grizzly, on a remote trail in Yellowstone National Park. The man was hiking alone when he surprised the animal, sustaining significant injuries to his chest and arm while attempting to deploy bear spray. Park officials noted that such attacks are extremely rare and have closed the trail indefinitely, but they will not take any action against the bear as it was likely acting in self-defense after being startled.</p>

          <p>A woman has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against a former Riverside County sheriff’s deputy, alleging he used law enforcement databases to find her personal information and stalk her. The lawsuit claims the deputy, Eric Piscatella, repeatedly contacted her and showed up at her home unannounced under false pretenses after a brief meeting at a local festival. Although Piscatella pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges for illegally accessing the databases, the plaintiff argues the justice system failed her and she remains terrified, prompting the civil action.</p>

          <p>The global secondhand apparel market has surged in popularity, driven by younger consumers seeking sustainable and unique fashion choices. While thrifting promises to reduce waste and carbon emissions from the fashion industry, its environmental benefits are complex. The article explores how the trend has been co-opted by major brands, which may use resale platforms to encourage overconsumption of new products. Ultimately, the sustainability of a garment depends more on how many times it is worn than whether it was purchased new or used.</p>
