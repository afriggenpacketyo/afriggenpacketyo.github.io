          <p>Senator Rand Paul criticized the Trump administration's investment in Intel, calling it a move towards socialism. The government acquired a 10% stake in Intel by purchasing 433.3 million shares at $20.47 each. Paul voiced concerns about government involvement in the free market, contrasting with Senator Bernie Sanders' view that taxpayers should receive something in return for corporate welfare. Trump defended the stake as a "great Deal for America and Intel," but Paul worries about the diminishing free market movement within the Republican Party.</p>

          <p>Newsmax has filed a lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the media giant of acting as a monopoly to suppress right-leaning competitors. The suit alleges Fox uses strategies to coerce distributors into marginalizing other right-leaning news channels, imposing financial penalties for carrying competing channels. Newsmax seeks an injunction barring Fox's exclusionary agreements and is demanding damages amounting to three times the amount allegedly sustained, plus interest. The lawsuit claims Fox's practices harm competition and consumers in the United States.</p>

          <p>Due to changes in FEMA under the Trump administration, federal government expertise in disaster management is shifting to private companies. Former FEMA employees are taking jobs as disaster consultants, as states lacking emergency-management expertise will likely hire private contractors. This exodus from the public to the private sector is unique in its scope. While contractors can help people during disasters, issues like exorbitant rates and difficulty tracking spending may arise.</p>

The study found global carbon storage capacity was 10 times less than prior estimates after excluding areas with potential leaks or earthquakes. This suggests carbon capture and storage can only reduce warming by 0.7 degrees Celsius, far less than previous estimates. Researchers emphasize the importance of prioritizing emissions reductions alongside carbon storage.</p>
