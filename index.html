          <p>A father and son, identified as Terry and Brendan McMillan, were killed in a stabbing incident at a business in Bermondsey, south-east London. The attack, which occurred on a Monday afternoon, also left another man in life-threatening condition. A 31-year-old suspect has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Local authorities have established a crime scene and a local Member of Parliament described the event as a targeted, isolated incident, though it has left the community feeling terrified and uneasy.</p>

          <p>A gunman killed four people and wounded a fifth in a Midtown Manhattan office building that houses the NFL headquarters. Police sources indicate the shooter, Shane Tamura, left a note mentioning chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and blaming football for his condition, asking for his brain to be studied. After taking the wrong elevator, he opened fire in the offices of Rudin Management before dying by suicide. The incident has prompted renewed calls for a national assault weapons ban from New York's governor.</p>

          <p>Despite anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve's July meeting, credit card interest rates are not expected to decrease. Experts suggest that even if the Fed enacts a future rate cut, its impact on high consumer credit card rates, currently averaging over 21%, would be negligible. The article advises that borrowers with significant debt should not wait for central bank action. Instead, they should explore alternative solutions like debt management programs, forgiveness options, or consolidation loans to regain financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence firm Anthropic is reportedly in discussions to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion in a new funding round led by Iconiq Capital. This investment would value the OpenAI competitor at approximately $170 billion, a significant increase from its $61.5 billion valuation in March. The move reflects intense investor interest in leading AI companies and a strategic shift for Anthropic, which had previously avoided funding from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds but now appears to be reconsidering to maintain its competitive edge in the costly AI development race.

          <p>The largest rail workers' union in the United States, SMART Transportation Division, plans to oppose the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cited deep concerns over Union Pacific's labor practices and a troubling safety record, alleging the company prioritizes profits over worker and public safety. In contrast, the union noted that Norfolk Southern has recently adopted more progressive labor policies. This opposition adds a significant hurdle to the creation of the nation's first coast-to-coast freight rail operator, which requires approval from the Surface Transportation Board.</p>

This has led to disappointment among his base on issues like immigration, foreign policy, and China, as Trump's actions do not always align with the rigid "America First" platform his supporters expected, revealing a movement defined more by personality than consistent policy.</p>

          <p>Three private seat holders at London's Royal Albert Hall have lost a High Court bid for £500,000 in damages against the venue's operator. The plaintiffs claimed the hall's corporation had unlawfully excluded them from more performances than permitted by the rules governing their historic seating rights, which date back to the venue's construction. A judge dismissed their request for a summary judgment, ruling that the complex dispute over property rights and historical governance requires a full trial to be properly resolved. The case highlights the unique ownership structure of the iconic venue.</p>

          <p>This financial commentary argues that the UK government must act decisively to prevent pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca from moving its primary stock market listing to the United States. AstraZeneca's CEO, Pascal Soriot, recently praised the U.S. innovation environment while declining to commit to the London listing, fueling speculation of a potential move. The author contends that such a defection would severely damage London's status as a financial hub and the UK's ambition to be a "life sciences superpower." The government is urged to address industry concerns, particularly regarding medicine pricing, to retain the country's largest public company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast has announced he will run for a fourth term in the upcoming October presidential election. The 83-year-old leader's decision is highly controversial, as the opposition argues it violates constitutional term limits. Ouattara was able to run for a third term in 2020 only after a constitutional reset, a move that led to a boycotted election and deadly unrest. The announcement raises tensions in the West African nation, especially after several prominent opposition candidates have already been excluded from the race on legal grounds.</p>
