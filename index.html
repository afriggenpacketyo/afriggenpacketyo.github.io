          <p>Lowe's exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter earnings expectations, driven by increased demand for home projects, though larger renovations remain soft. The home improvement retailer also announced a significant strategic move, acquiring Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion to strengthen its business with professional contractors. CEO Marvin Ellison expressed caution about the broader housing market due to high mortgage rates but stated the company is positioning itself for future growth when conditions improve. The company has revised its full-year sales outlook upward to reflect its recent acquisitions.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old man from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting a police officer with a crossbow. The incident occurred in May 2024 when officers responded to a neighbor dispute, during which the man also stabbed another individual. The officer, who was struck in the leg by a crossbow bolt, has since made a full recovery and returned to duty. The judge described the man as a significant risk, noting he appeared to be hunting the officer during the attack.</p>

          <p>Emergency officials in North Carolina have issued evacuation orders for barrier islands, including the Outer Banks, as Category 2 Hurricane Erin approaches the East Coast. While the storm is expected to remain offshore, it is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents from Florida to New England, prompting beach closures and swimming bans. Authorities are urging residents in designated zones to evacuate immediately due to the risk of coastal flooding and impassable roads. The storm's impact is expected to peak through Wednesday and Thursday, with tropical storm conditions anticipated for coastal North Carolina and Virginia.</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley has filed a legal claim against the city, accusing Mayor Karen Bass of orchestrating a defamatory campaign to oust her. Crowley alleges the mayor used her as a scapegoat to shift blame for the city's handling of the catastrophic Palisades Fire, which occurred while the mayor was abroad. The claim asserts that Bass falsely accused Crowley of incompetence and misrepresented budget cuts that had weakened the department's readiness. Crowley is seeking unspecified damages, arguing her dismissal was retaliatory and violated her First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's CFO, Sarah Friar, revealed that the company is experiencing tremendous revenue growth, logging its first $1 billion month in July and projecting $12.7 billion in revenue for the year. Despite this financial success, the company faces a significant challenge in being 'constantly under compute' due to the voracious demand for GPUs to power its AI models. This has prompted massive investments in data infrastructure, including the 'Stargate' project, and partnerships with Microsoft, Oracle, and Coreweave. The demand highlights the immense operational costs and infrastructure needs required to scale advanced artificial intelligence systems.</p>

          <p>Moscow Police Chief Anthony Dahlinger is challenging reports that a surviving roommate overheard Bryan Kohberger mention victim Kaylee Goncalves by name during the 2022 Idaho student murders. The disputed claim appeared in a second-hand account within documents released by Idaho State Police.

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for the immediate resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The demand follows a call from the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, for the Department of Justice to launch a criminal mortgage fraud investigation into Cook. Pulte alleges that Cook falsified bank documents and property records to secure more favorable loan terms on two properties. This development represents an escalation of Trump's pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, which has previously focused primarily on Chairman Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap known as Mo Chara, appeared in a London court facing a charge under the Terrorism Act.

After the hearing, which was met by a large crowd of supporters, the rapper was released on unconditional bail, with the chief magistrate set to rule on the case's future in September.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have created a 'superfood' supplement designed to protect honeybees from threats like climate change and habitat loss. The new food contains all the essential nutrients bees need, including specific lipids called sterols that were previously difficult to manufacture but are vital for their development. In trials, bee colonies fed the supplement produced up to 15 times more offspring that reached adulthood. This breakthrough could provide a complete nutritional source for bees when natural pollen is scarce, helping to support global honeybee populations, which are crucial for pollinating crops.</p>

          <p>A study from the University of Florida and University College London found that daily leisure reading among American adults has plummeted by over 40% since 2003. Analyzing data from the American Time Use Survey, researchers identified a steady decline, with the percentage of adults reading for pleasure on a typical day dropping from 28% in 2004 to 16% in 2023. The decline is attributed to digital distractions, a general decrease in leisure time, and uneven access to books. The trend raises concerns about public well-being, as reading for pleasure is linked to positive mental health outcomes.</p>

          <p>A High Court decision to block a hotel in Epping, UK, from housing asylum seekers could set a precedent for other local councils to challenge the government's accommodation strategy. The ruling was based on the argument that the hotel's change of use breached local planning controls and negatively impacted the community's character, citing protests and fear of crime. While the decision does not end the nationwide use of hotels for asylum seekers, it may empower other councils to pursue similar legal action if they can provide evidence of harm. The Home Office is concerned this could encourage more protests and complicate efforts to house approximately 32,000 asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the US Open, which will be her final tournament, tennis star Petra Kvitova has announced she is ready to retire. The 35-year-old two-time Wimbledon champion reflected on her career, acknowledging that while she could have potentially won more, she is content with her achievements. Kvitova famously returned to the sport after a career-threatening knife attack in 2016, which she considers the start of her 'second career.' Now a mother, she stated that the emotional and physical demands of the tour have become too tiring and she looks forward to spending more time with her family.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Explain How Potential Interest Rate Cuts Could Affect HELOC Payments</h2>

          <p>Homeowners with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the coming months. Because HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a Fed rate cut usually translates to lower interest charges. However, the timing of this relief can vary depending on the lender's adjustment schedule and the borrower's billing cycle. Experts advise homeowners to review their loan terms to understand their specific rate index, margin, and any potential rate floors that could limit savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As President Trump engages in diplomacy regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, BBC Verify has analyzed his recent claims of having ended six or seven wars during his second term. The analysis reviews several conflicts, including those involving Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, and Armenia and Azerbaijan. While Trump's intervention played a role in de-escalating some tensions, the report notes that many of the resulting agreements are fragile ceasefires rather than permanent peace deals. In some cases, such as with Serbia and Kosovo, no active war was taking place for him to end.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has unveiled a controversial proposal to restructure the country's professional game by reducing the number of regional teams from four to two. The WRU's chief executive described the move as a 'radical step' necessary to ensure the financial sustainability and competitiveness of Welsh rugby. This preferred model would provide the two remaining clubs with significantly larger playing budgets, comparable to those in England and France. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the existing regional teams, and a consultation period will begin before a final decision is made in October.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates in the coming fall season will be shaped by several key economic factors, according to financial experts. The Federal Reserve's future policy decisions and commentary, rather than direct rate changes, will be a primary driver, with markets often pricing in expected moves in advance. Crucial data on inflation and the labor market will heavily influence the Fed's stance, with cooling inflation potentially leading to lower rates. Additionally, investor activity in mortgage-backed securities and 10-year Treasury bonds, as well as broader geopolitical events, will play a significant role in determining the direction of rates.

          <p>Some farmers in Florida are reducing their crop production due to a significant labor shortage, which they attribute to President Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement policies. Many agricultural workers, a large portion of whom are undocumented, have reportedly left the state or gone into hiding for fear of deportation. While the H2A agricultural visa program provides a legal pathway for workers, farmers say rising costs make it unaffordable to rely on exclusively. The situation is creating economic pressure on the state's agricultural sector and raising concerns about the nation's food supply chain.</p>

Prison experts have called the transfer to a facility known for its amenities 'truly unheard of' for an inmate convicted of such crimes. The move has fueled speculation about a potential deal and has been described as a 'slap in the face' to the victims of her and Epstein's abuse.</p>

The ongoing war in Ukraine continues to disrupt supply chains for agricultural inputs, while domestic pressures like rising minimum wage and energy costs are being passed on to consumers.
