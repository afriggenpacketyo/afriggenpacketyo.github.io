          <p>ABC News terminated its agreement with national correspondent Terry Moran after he made a social media post calling President Trump and advisor Stephen Miller "world-class haters," which the network deemed a violation of its objectivity policies. Moran's post focused on Miller's capacity for hatred, describing it as his primary characteristic. The decision comes after ABC News previously settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump over comments made by George Stephanopoulos. Miller responded to Moran's comments by accusing journalists of being radicals who have been unmasked, while other officials condemned the post as unacceptable, and the network defended its commitment to trusted journalism.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares have rebounded after a dip caused by a feud between Elon Musk and President Trump, fueled by the unveiling of robotaxi testing in Austin, Texas. Musk shared a video showcasing Tesla's driverless vehicles operating without human supervision, signaling progress in the company's autonomous driving technology. Tesla is listed as "testing" on Austin's official autonomous vehicle website, joining other companies like Waymo and Amazon's Zoox in the city. The stock's recovery reflects investor optimism regarding Tesla's potential in the robotaxi market and a possible reconciliation between Musk and Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic mayoral primary.

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second consecutive night of serious unrest, with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks directed at police officers. Law enforcement responded by deploying water cannon, firing baton rounds, and using riot dogs to control the crowds in the Clonavon Terrace area. The violence followed an earlier peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault, with some politicians linking the unrest to tensions arising from migrant integration. Jim Allister, a North Antrim MP, faced criticism for comments suggesting that an "oversubscription of migrants" contributed to the tensions.</p>

This directive follows a federal judge's temporary block on President Trump's executive order for mass firings across federal agencies, raising questions about potential violations of the court injunction.

Trump administration officials maintain that the scale of the protests justifies the deployments, but Newsom contends that the unrest is not comparable to past events in Los Angeles.

          <p>US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides official government recommendations on immunizations. Kennedy cited conflicts of interest within the committee as undermining public trust in vaccinations. The move has drawn criticism from doctors, health experts, and senators who fear it will negatively impact public health. Kennedy's decision appears to contradict assurances he gave during his confirmation hearings that the ACIP would be maintained without changes.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is seeking to pause a ruling that mandates due process for deported Venezuelans. The emergency request was submitted a day before the Trump administration was required to outline how nearly 140 Venezuelans deported to El Salvador could challenge their expulsion. This legal battle highlights ongoing tensions surrounding immigration policy and the rights of asylum seekers. The outcome of the Justice Department's request will determine the immediate fate of these deported individuals.</p>
