          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial procedural vote on a comprehensive tax and spending package strongly supported by the Trump administration. The bill's passage remains uncertain due to lingering policy disputes among Republicans over Medicaid cuts, state and local tax deductions, and a proposed debt ceiling increase. Despite pressure from the White House to pass the legislation by July 4th, several GOP senators remain opposed, creating a narrow path for approval. The legislation, which includes significant tax cuts and funding for administration priorities, faces unified opposition from Democrats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to former Microsoft AI head Harry Shum, China is rapidly advancing in artificial intelligence algorithms, even as it lags significantly behind the United States in chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the chip production gap is substantial, but China can innovate by focusing on algorithm engineering to overcome computing power constraints. He cited the Chinese startup DeepSeek as a prime example, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI using far fewer resources. This highlights a strategic shift in China's approach to competing in the global AI race.</p>

The woman was in waist-deep water when the incident occurred, resulting in non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot. While she did not see the animal, experts who analyzed the bite marks believe they are consistent with those of a young sand tiger shark. Following the event, swimming was temporarily suspended as authorities conducted drone searches for marine life, with normal beach activities resuming the next morning after safety checks.</p>

Its success is attributed to its complex plot, high production value, and integration of traditional Chinese cultural elements like shadow puppetry.

The agreement, approved by 72% of Unifor members, includes a 15.75% wage increase, enhanced benefits, and new protections related to automation. The strike and subsequent lockout had forced the company to halt all parcel deliveries on June 20.

The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court.

          <p>A recent arrest in Southern California highlights a growing trend of individuals impersonating federal immigration officers, a phenomenon experts say is exacerbated by the tactics of real agents. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents increasingly wear masks and plainclothes during raids, it becomes easier for imposters to deceive the public. Several cases have emerged nationwide where individuals posing as ICE officers have committed crimes, including kidnapping and sexual assault. Critics argue that the lack of clear identification for federal agents poses a significant public safety threat and undermines community trust in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>As the tenth anniversary of nationwide same-sex marriage legalization approaches, a Maryland couple who were pioneers in the state's fight for marriage equality are reflecting on their journey. Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage. Although their initial court case was unsuccessful, their advocacy helped pave the way for the state to legalize marriage equality in 2012. They express concern over new legal challenges to marriage rights, viewing them as cruel and disheartening efforts that threaten to roll back hard-won protections for the LGBTQ community.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a custom printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which sought a way to make products more accessible. The students' invention can punch braille onto materials that commercial printers cannot handle and was specifically designed to be operated by BISM's employees, many of whom have low or no vision. The printer has already produced 400 labels for a special fundraising beer.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved record highs this week, a surprising outcome given the recent U.S. military action against Iran's nuclear facilities. The market rallied after initial fears of a wider conflict subsided, with a significant drop in oil prices signaling to investors that the event would not systemically impact economic growth or inflation. This de-escalation, combined with investor speculation about potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, fueled the positive momentum on Wall Street. The article notes that while risks remain, the market's focus has shifted back to economic fundamentals and corporate earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recently concluded Supreme Court term delivered significant wins for conservative-led states and bolstered President Trump's claims of executive power. The court's 6-3 conservative majority issued rulings that expanded states' authority to regulate transgender medical treatments, deny Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood, and enforce online age-verification laws. Additionally, the court sided with the administration by reining in the power of district judges to issue nationwide injunctions. This term reflects a states-rights brand of conservatism and a judiciary hesitant to rule directly against the president's broad assertions of authority, focusing instead on procedural checks.</p>

After analyzing the DNA of over 130 skeletons, scientists found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line, indicating husbands may have moved into their wives' homes. The study also revealed that grave goods were five times more common for females than for males, suggesting preferential treatment. These findings challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in ancient civilizations and point to a system where identity and status were passed down through mothers.</p>

          <p>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) held a party congress to bid farewell to former Chancellor Olaf Scholz and reflect on its recent poor election performance. In his farewell speech, Scholz defended his government's policies and warned against illusions about Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine, calling for solidarity in financing defense. The congress also saw the re-election of Lars Klingbeil as co-leader, though with significantly reduced support, and the election of BÃ¤rbel Bas as the new co-chair. The event marks a period of transition and soul-searching for the center-left party as it charts its future course.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders are leveraging the primary victory of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race to portray the national Democratic party as radical and out of touch. Following Mamdani's upset win over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, top Republicans have labeled him a "communist" and are attempting to tie his progressive platform to all Democrats. While some moderate Democrats have distanced themselves from Mamdani, several Muslim members of Congress have condemned what they call Islamophobic and racist attacks against him from some Republicans, highlighting deep divisions both between and within the parties.</p>
