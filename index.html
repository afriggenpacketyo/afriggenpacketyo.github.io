          <p>The European Union is allocating ‚Ç¨5.5 million in emergency funding to support Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) following the broadcaster's loss of US public funding due to the Trump administration's accusations of liberal bias. EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the importance of Radio Free Europe in countering authoritarian regimes, noting its historical role in delivering news to people under communist rule. The funding will prioritize regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus, aiming to maintain independent journalism in areas heavily reliant on external news sources, though it won't cover all of RFE's 27 languages and 23 countries. Radio Free Europe's lawyers are challenging the funding cuts in court.</p>

          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, defeating the incumbent Ed Gainey, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city under its current progressive leadership. O'Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, but the Democratic primary win is considered tantamount to winning the mayoral election in Pittsburgh. Gainey, the city‚Äôs first Black mayor, focused on affordable housing but faced criticism for police leadership turnover and basic service complaints. O'Connor positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would focus on rebuilding the city's tax base and adopting a conciliatory approach toward powerful institutions.</p>

          <p>A new book, 'Original Sin: President Biden‚Äôs Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,' alleges that the political and media establishment in Washington concealed Biden's declining mental health during his presidency. The article draws parallels between this alleged cover-up and the historical practice of ageing leaders, including US presidents, hiding their true health status from the public. It suggests that US presidential powers resemble those of a dictator, albeit with term limits, making the health of the president a matter of significant public and political concern. The recent disclosure of Biden's aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis further fuels the debate, with some experts suggesting the condition was known long before its public announcement.</p>

Van Hollen expressed regret for voting to confirm Rubio, accusing him of betraying principles related to defending democracy and human rights abroad. Rubio defended his actions, claiming Van Hollen's regret confirmed he was doing a good job, and ridiculed the senator for visiting a deportee in El Salvador, falsely claiming he had a margarita with a gang member.</p>

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to replace Eto with Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former environment minister. Eto's comments came shortly after the Agriculture Ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year. The resignation comes as Ishiba faces a House of Councillors election and amid public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising rice prices.</p>

Kent sought to modify the assessment after it contradicted Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the gang. The final memo still contradicted Trump's claim, which was used to justify deporting people accused of being gang members without due process.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced sharp criticism from his former Senate Democratic colleagues during a hearing on the State Department budget, with Democrats expressing disappointment over his support for President Trump's policies, particularly the cuts to U.S. foreign aid programs. Senator Chris Van Hollen stated his regret for voting to confirm Rubio, accusing him of betraying principles. Rubio defended his actions, asserting that the cuts aimed to improve efficiency and that the U.S. would continue to provide more foreign aid than other countries combined. Democrats also accused Rubio of making misleading claims about foreign aid spending and of supporting the deportation of migrants without due process.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia has defended his approach to negotiating a comprehensive peace deal while continuing to wage war in Ukraine, with his hard-line position withstanding pressure for an immediate cease-fire. President Trump welcomed direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, effectively breaking with his earlier promise to swiftly end the conflict. However, Trump emphasized that American economic rapprochement with Russia would come after peace in Ukraine, potentially confining Russia to economic purgatory. Putin is likely guided by a belief that time is on his side, continuing diplomatic overtures without showing any willingness to compromise.</p>

The "ultra-rapid" genetic testing method, developed at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has a 100% success rate in diagnosing tumour types in as little as 90 minutes. This allows for more informed surgical decisions and faster treatment for patients. Several other NHS hospitals are also setting up their own testing alongside their existing regimes to gather more evidence about its effectiveness.</p>
