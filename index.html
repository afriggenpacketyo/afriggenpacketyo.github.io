          <h2>Chevron's Stock Declines Amid Lower Profits and Reduced Buyback Pace Due to Falling Oil Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 07:26:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a downturn following the announcement of a profit decline attributed to the slump in oil prices, influenced by President Trump's tariffs and increased OPEC+ supply. The company plans to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its stock in the second quarter, a decrease from the $3.9 billion repurchased in the first quarter. Chevron's first-quarter net income fell by over 30% to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, from $5.5 billion, or $2.97 per share, in the same period last year, with U.S. production profits also declining due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices. The oil major's U.S. refining business saw a profit of $103 million after a loss in the previous quarter, though earnings declined 77% year-over-year due to reduced margins on refined product sales.

          <p>Activists involved with the Freedom Flotilla Coalition reported that their ship, The Conscience, was attacked by drones in international waters off Malta, alleging Israeli involvement. The ship, carrying activists including Greta Thunberg, intended to challenge Israel's blockade of Gaza, but the attack caused significant damage, halting the mission. The Maltese government confirmed the safety of the crew and activists, stating that the fire onboard was brought under control, while the NGO called for Israeli ambassadors to be summoned to answer for the attack. Thunberg, who was meant to board the ship, asserted that human rights activists will continue to demand a free Palestine and the opening of a humanitarian corridor.</p>

Zhao secured all eight frames on Friday morning, becoming only the fourth player to achieve an 8-0 session win against O'Sullivan at the Crucible. O'Sullivan, who has openly discussed difficulties with his cue, made changes after Thursday's session, but these adjustments did not yield the desired results. Zhao, competing as an amateur, showcased clinical potting skills, suggesting he could become the first Chinese player to win the title in Sheffield.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has decided to postpone plans for a new misogyny law until after next year's Holyrood election, citing insufficient time to address the Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of a woman. Instead, the government will amend existing hate crime legislation to include protections based on sex, and it is also dropping plans to outlaw conversion therapy. A new misogyny law was initially proposed following recommendations from an expert group in 2022, but the government now says more time is needed to determine its application, including assessing the implications of the Supreme Court judgment. The government said it remained committed to ensuring people are protected from misogynistic abuse.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have announced a joint economic investment deal granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals, potentially bolstering Ukraine's defense and addressing U.S. concerns over rare earth mineral access amid trade disputes with China. The agreement, described as an equal partnership, involves the development of mineral, oil, and gas projects, with the U.S. providing financial or military assistance and Ukraine contributing royalties from future licenses. The deal covers 55 minerals, including rare earth elements, titanium, lithium, and uranium, but excludes resources currently generating revenue for Ukraine. Experts note that Ukraine possesses the workforce and metallurgical expertise to develop these resources, contrasting with the long-term infrastructure development required in places like Greenland.</p>

While Harvard can withstand financial penalties due to its large endowment, other institutions are more vulnerable. Kirp argues that universities should band together, issuing a clear message against assaults on academic freedom and launching a campaign to demonstrate their value to society. Wealthier universities should also support less affluent institutions with legal assistance, creating a ‚ÄúNATO for higher education‚Äù to deter government overreach.</p>

The International Energy Agency has warned that no new major fossil fuel projects can proceed if global temperature limits are to be met.

          <p>Ireland's privacy regulator has fined TikTok 530 million euros ($601.3 million) for violating the EU's GDPR data protection law by sending European user data to China. The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) found that TikTok failed to ensure an equivalent level of data protection for EEA users' personal data remotely accessed by staff in China. The regulator has ordered TikTok to comply with GDPR within six months and may suspend data transfers to China if compliance is not achieved. The DPC also found that TikTok provided inaccurate information regarding the storage of European users' data on servers in China.</p>

          <p>China is considering an offer from the U.S. to engage in trade negotiations, following claims by President Trump that talks were already underway. China‚Äôs commerce ministry stated that Washington needs to show ‚Äúsincerity‚Äù and avoid ‚Äúcoercion and extortion‚Äù in any potential negotiations. Despite the ongoing trade war, both countries have introduced exceptions to tariffs to mitigate economic impact. China has repeatedly accused the U.S. of bullying in its approach to trade policies, as the two countries continue to impose retaliatory tariffs on each other's goods.</p>

          <p>As cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine begin, civilian deaths have increased compared to the same period last year, according to a U.N. report. In the first 24 days of April, 848 civilians were killed or wounded, a 46 percent increase over the previous year, as Russia has been targeting cities more intensively. While President Trump initiated the cease-fire talks in February, analysts suggest the increase in violence is a result of armies jockeying for position before a truce, as was the case in 2014 and 2015.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to end federal funding for NPR and PBS, accusing them of political bias, which has been refuted by NPR's CEO. A federal judge ruled that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants was unlawful. Trump nominated Mike Waltz as ambassador to the United Nations, following Waltz taking the blame for adding a journalist to a Signal group chat where top officials discussed plans to strike Yemen. The order regarding NPR and PBS could significantly impact local stations, particularly those in rural areas that rely heavily on federal funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump ended a rule that allowed cheap Chinese goods to bypass U.S. tariffs, closing a loophole that U.S. businesses claimed gave China an unfair advantage. The move will raise prices for American consumers on platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu. The Trump administration is negotiating with over a dozen other nations before a July 8 deadline, seeking to lower their tariffs on American exports and cut red tape for U.S. businesses. The biggest challenge remains the trade standoff with China, as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods now stand at 145%.</p>

Transgender women and girls can still participate in open and mixed cricket categories, with the ECB emphasizing that abuse and discrimination have no place in the sport. This decision follows a similar announcement from the English Football Association (FA), which also restricts transgender women from participating in women's football.</p>

Authorities are investigating the crime, with revenge as a possible motive. The Jalisco New Generation cartel, headed by Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, is one of Mexico's most powerful criminal gangs, and the U.S. government has imposed economic sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the cartel's drug trafficking and fuel theft network.</p>

Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.
