          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll finds that while Americans overwhelmingly deem political violence unacceptable, a majority also anticipates it will increase in the coming years. This concern is bipartisan and contributes to pessimism about national unity, even though most people believe politics, not personal differences, drives division. The survey also highlights a reluctance among citizens to express political views publicly, with fewer than half feeling comfortable doing so, potentially due to fear of negative repercussions.</p>

          <p>The developer of ICEBlock, an app for tracking sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, is appealing to Apple to reinstate the application on its online store. The creator argues the app is a tool for exercising constitutional rights and compares it to traffic apps like Waze, which allow users to report police presence. The removal followed pressure from the Trump administration, which cited safety risks for law enforcement officers and potential misuse by individuals with violent intent.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-backed peace proposal, agreeing to release the remaining Israeli hostages but requesting changes to other parts of the plan. The group's statement expressed readiness to begin negotiations for a prisoner exchange and an end to the war, which former President Trump described as an encouraging development. However, the response did not explicitly accept key U.S. demands, such as the complete disarmament of Hamas and its exclusion from the future governance of Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, presented by former President Trump and backed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, faces significant obstacles despite its ambitious goals. The proposal calls for a hostage release, a phased Israeli withdrawal, and the establishment of a temporary Palestinian government, but fundamental disagreements remain. Analysts suggest both Hamas and factions within the Israeli government are unlikely to fully accept terms that require them to relinquish core strategic leverage or political power, making a swift end to the conflict improbable.</p>

          <p>Several quantum computing stocks, including Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum, saw double-digit gains this week, continuing a strong year for the sector. The surge was driven by positive developments, such as Rigetti securing $5.7 million in purchase orders and a new 300 million euro investment in a quantum venture fund in Denmark. This investor enthusiasm reflects growing confidence in the technology, which is also being heavily backed by tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon for its potential to solve highly complex problems.

One of the deceased victims, Adrian Daulby, was tragically hit by police gunfire while helping to secure the synagogue doors.
