          <p>May Davis Mailman, a longtime Trump insider and senior policy strategist, has left her White House position, marking the most high-profile voluntary departure of the second term. She served in various roles during Trump's first term and was considered a key figure in establishing the new administration's inner workings. Mailman plans to start a government affairs firm but will continue as a special government employee to finalize some policy projects. Her departure is notable as she is known to be close to Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 30 Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled to Illinois to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by Donald Trump, could create five new Republican-leaning districts. The Democrats accuse the GOP of holding disaster relief hostage to push through the gerrymandered plan, while Republicans, including the state's attorney general, have called for their arrest. This action stalls the legislative session, impacting other key issues on the agenda.</p>

This incident is the latest in a series of violent events in the region, which has seen a rise in settler attacks and Israeli military operations since the October 7th Hamas attack.

          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, reportedly negotiated for the release of billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a batch of President Trump's nominees. The funds were designated for entities like the National Institutes of Health and the World Food Program. However, after several days of talks, President Trump rejected the deal, leaving many nominations, including ambassadors, stalled until at least September. The negotiations highlight the intense political maneuvering and friction between the White House and Senate Democrats.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey retreat. The intercepting aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention and escorted the plane out of the restricted zone. This was one of five unauthorized incursions over the weekend, prompting NORAD to remind general aviation pilots to check for flight restrictions before takeoff. The agency emphasized that such protocols are mandatory for North American flight safety.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly advocating for a "military solution" to rescue the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to an Israeli official. This push comes amid a perceived lack of progress in diplomatic negotiations, with a growing belief in Israel that Hamas is not interested in a deal. The news coincides with ongoing protests in Tel Aviv, where families of hostages are demanding government action to secure their release. Meanwhile, concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continue to mount.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming an increasingly popular option for women seeking to preserve their fertility, often described as revolutionary as the birth control pill for providing reproductive choice. The procedure allows women to store their younger, healthier eggs for future use, mitigating the pressure of the "biological clock." However, the process is expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars, and does not guarantee a future pregnancy, with potential drop-offs at each stage from thawing to implantation. Bioethicists caution that it's a gamble and raises questions about societal pressures on women.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report with downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, while critics, including a former Trump-appointed BLS commissioner, called the firing "groundless" and a dangerous precedent. The administration's action has fueled fears that it is attempting to undermine the credibility of government economic data and "cook the books" for political gain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent court filing, Trump administration lawyers have denied that a daily quota for immigration arrests exists, despite previous public statements from White House officials about setting such a goal. Senior adviser Stephen Miller had previously stated a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day. The denial came in a lawsuit alleging unconstitutional immigration sweeps in California. The government's filing claims that while the idea may have been discussed, no such directive was ever issued as official policy to ICE or DHS.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. The growth is fueled by favorable economics, as solar has become cheaper than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval process for many solar projects. However, the future of this boom is uncertain, as a new federal bill accelerates the rollback of solar tax credits, which is expected to significantly dampen rooftop solar installations. Grid constraints are also emerging as a new challenge. (not investment advice)</p>
