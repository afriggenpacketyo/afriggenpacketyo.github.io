        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI's annual Unified Crime Report indicates a significant nationwide decrease in crime across all categories for 2024, including violent crimes like murder and property crimes such as motor vehicle theft. This continues a downward trend from the spike observed after the COVID-19 pandemic, with the overall property crime rate hitting its lowest level since 1961. However, the report also notes an increase in law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty. While experts credit various factors for the decline, the FBI refrains from specifying a single cause for the positive shift in crime statistics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. credit card debt has climbed to $1.21 trillion, matching last year's record high. This increase coincides with elevated delinquency rates, particularly among subprime borrowers and younger cardholders who may have overextended themselves during recent periods of high inflation. While many consumers manage their balances effectively, analysts express concern that a significant portion of the population is vulnerable to financial distress. The data highlights a growing divide between those who pay in full and those carrying substantial, high-interest debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering a plan for the full occupation of the Gaza Strip as the next phase of the ongoing war, now in its 22nd month. The prime minister met with the army chief to discuss several military options, though details have not been publicly disclosed. This potential escalation has drawn criticism, including from former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who warned it would lead to an endless war with heavy casualties and endanger the remaining hostages. Any plan for a full takeover would require approval from Israel's Security Cabinet, which is expected to convene shortly.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has concluded with the arrest of Austin Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect accused of killing four of his family members in Tennessee. The investigation began after an infant was found abandoned in a yard, which led authorities to discover the bodies of Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend. Drummond, who was considered armed and dangerous, was captured following the release of recent surveillance footage showing him with a rifle. He now faces four counts of first-degree murder and other charges related to the killings.</p>

          <p>The Office of Personnel Management has officially ended the requirement for federal employees to submit a weekly list of five accomplishments, a practice initiated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The directive, which included a threat of termination for non-compliance, was part of an effort to reduce the federal workforce. However, the policy faced immediate resistance from multiple agencies, with many instructing their staff to ignore it from the outset. The OPM stated that managers have other existing tools to monitor team productivity, rendering the controversial process unnecessary.</p>

          <p>A major political battle is unfolding in Texas as state Republicans, backed by President Trump, propose redrawing congressional maps mid-decade to secure up to five additional House seats.

The proposed changes target traditionally Democratic districts in major urban areas like Austin, Dallas, and Houston. In protest, Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to deny a voting quorum, prompting the governor to order their arrest and return to the state capitol.</p>

          <p>In an unusual legal agreement, media mogul Rupert Murdoch will provide President Donald Trump with regular, sworn updates on his health to delay a deposition in a $10 billion defamation lawsuit. Trump sued Murdoch over a Wall Street Journal article concerning the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and his lawyers had pushed for an immediate deposition, citing the 94-year-old's age and health. The deal postpones the deposition until a judge rules on a motion to dismiss the case. This arrangement highlights a tense turn in the relationship between Trump and the head of the media empire that has long supported him.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs economist reports that generative AI is already making a tangible impact on the U.S. labor market, starting with younger workers in the technology sector. While widespread job displacement has not yet occurred, there has been a noticeable pullback in tech hiring that has disproportionately affected employees aged 20 to 30, whose unemployment rate has jumped significantly. This trend is attributed to tech companies pausing junior-level hiring as they begin to integrate AI, which can handle many routine tasks. The analysis suggests this is an early sign of a broader labor market transition driven by automation.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Health is alerting the public to the dangers of consuming unpasteurized raw milk after an outbreak sickened 21 people, including six young children. The infections, caused by E. coli and campylobacter bacteria, have been traced to a single farm and resulted in seven hospitalizations. Although selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, a loophole that allows it to reach consumers. Health agencies like the FDA and CDC maintain that pasteurization is necessary to kill harmful bacteria, while proponents of raw milk claim unproven health benefits.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the catastrophic implosion of the Titan submersible, which killed all five people on board in June 2023, was preventable. The extensive report found that owner OceanGate operated with a 'toxic' safety culture and used 'intimidation tactics' to evade regulatory scrutiny for years. Investigators determined the vessel's design and testing were fundamentally flawed and that the company continued operations despite incidents that likely compromised the hull's integrity. The report largely blames founder Stockton Rush, whose negligence and overconfidence created an environment where safety concerns were fatally ignored.</p>

This article argues the controversy's staying power stems from Sweeney's embodiment of a classic Hollywood ideal that carries complex historical baggage related to race, gender, and sexuality.

          <p>Tennessee has executed Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, despite legal challenges and concerns over his implanted heart defibrillator. Witnesses reported that Black appeared to be in significant pain shortly after the lethal injection began. His attorneys had argued that the device could shock his heart during the procedure, causing unnecessary suffering, but the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to deactivate it. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. His legal team plans to review data from the device as part of an autopsy.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and numerous former attorneys general and FBI directors as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. The bipartisan effort seeks depositions and documents to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. This move follows the Justice Department's recent conclusion that it would not release further information, a decision that has fueled demands from Congress for greater transparency and accountability.</p>

Duckworth argues that the current 90-second evacuation rule may be unrealistic, citing video evidence that the recent incident took far longer. She is requesting data on several recent evacuations and an update on congressionally mandated safety testing, which was supposed to use more realistic scenarios. The senator and other safety advocates are concerned that current standards do not reflect the realities of modern air travel.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to wildlife management, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is using audio from the intense argument scene in the 2019 film 'Marriage Story' to scare wolves away from cattle in Oregon. After a series of livestock killings, the USDA began using drones equipped with thermal cameras and loudspeakers to haze the predators. When a wolf is detected, the drone plays alarming sounds, including the heated exchange between actors Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, to create a negative association with humans. This unconventional method has reportedly been effective in reducing cattle predation.</p>

This demographic trend places Germany below the European Union average and reflects the country's aging population. The figure was only slightly bolstered by the recent immigration of young people, primarily from Ukraine, without whom the share would have been even lower at 8.5%. The data highlights a long-term demographic shift, with the former East German states showing the lowest proportions of young residents in the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration's planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could ultimately rise as high as 250%. In a television interview, he stated that an initial 'small tariff' would be imposed, with the rate potentially increasing to 150% and then 250% within a year and a half. This threat is part of the president's strategy to incentivize drug companies to move their manufacturing operations back to the United States. The pharmaceutical industry has warned that such high tariffs could disrupt supply chains, drive up costs for patients, and deter investment. (not investment advice)</p>

In Germany, refugees receive 'citizen's money,' which is equivalent to welfare for unemployed Germans, making it one of the most generous systems. In contrast, Poland offers no monthly payments, focusing instead on access to jobs and services. Other countries like Belgium offer high monthly stipends, while Hungary has tightened its rules, and the UK uses a complex system of host payments and universal credits, highlighting the lack of a uniform EU-wide approach.</p>
