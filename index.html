          <p>EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the EU is actively working to end its reliance on rare earth elements from China, which are crucial for technology like smartphones and EVs. China, the world's top producer, recently imposed new export curbs amidst trade disputes, causing economic damage to some EU companies. The EU's strategy involves seeking short-term solutions with Beijing while also developing long-term independence through recycling, domestic production, and partnerships with other resource-rich nations like Australia and Canada. The goal is to secure a stable supply of critical raw materials for European industries.</p>

          <p>The New York Times identified Timothy Mellon, an heir to a prominent Gilded Age family, as the anonymous donor who gave $130 million to pay U.S. military salaries during the government shutdown. President Trump had previously praised the donor as a "patriot" without naming him. However, the donation amounts to only about $100 per service member and may violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds not appropriated by Congress. Mellon is a long-time Trump supporter, having previously contributed millions to a pro-Trump super PAC.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, who was pardoned by President Trump for his role in the January 6th Capitol riot, has been arrested and charged with making a terroristic threat. He allegedly sent text messages threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City. Moynihan, who pleaded not guilty, was previously convicted of obstructing an official proceeding after being on the Senate floor during the riot. This arrest highlights growing concerns about recidivism among pardoned rioters and the increasing number of threats against members of Congress.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history on the Klamath River, the ecosystem is showing remarkable signs of recovery, with salmon returning to headwaters for the first time in a century. A group of 28 Indigenous teenagers celebrated this milestone by becoming the first to kayak the river's full 310-mile length in over 100 years. This journey, part of the "Paddle Tribal Waters" program, not only reconnected the youth with their heritage but also inspired other Indigenous-led river conservation movements worldwide. The project serves as a powerful example of successful environmental restoration and collective action.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which would allow for redrawing congressional districts outside the usual schedule, is being promoted by Democrats as a way to "fight fire with fire" against Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas. Governor Gavin Newsom and other prominent Democrats are framing the vote as a chance for Californians to oppose former President Trump's political influence. The measure proposes suspending the state's independent redistricting commission to create five additional safe Democratic seats, counteracting recent Republican gains elsewhere. Polling suggests the anti-Trump messaging is resonating with voters, making the proposition likely to pass despite concerns about partisan power grabs.</p>

          <p>A commentary in a key Chinese Communist Party publication suggests that digital currencies are becoming a powerful tool in global geopolitics and could be "militarized." The article highlights how cryptocurrencies offer fast, secure, and anonymous transactions, making them suitable for military applications in times of conflict. The author points to a Pentagon blockchain initiative as evidence that the U.S. is already exploring digital currencies as a strategic tool for financial defense. This perspective indicates China may be considering the use of digital assets to bypass economic sanctions and enhance its strategic capabilities.</p>

          <p>Located near the White House, The Octagon is one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes, completed in 1801 for the prominent Tayloe family. The building temporarily housed President James Madison and First Lady Dolley Madison after the White House was burned by the British in 1814; it was here that Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812. The house, which gets its name from its octagonal entrance room, has a storied past that includes serving as a school and tenement housing. It is also known for reports of paranormal activity, with tales of unexplained events and a supposed visit from Jackie Kennedy Onassis before she became first lady.</p>

          <p>A new four-year study found that E. coli from contaminated meat may be responsible for nearly 20% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a group of Southern California patients. Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the infections back to E. coli strains found in grocery store meats, with turkey and chicken being the most common sources. The study suggests this is a widespread issue in the U.S. and highlights a link between food safety and common infections. Experts believe better agricultural and food processing practices, such as stronger hygiene standards and animal vaccinations, could significantly reduce this public health risk.</p>

          <p>The recent demolition of the White House's historic East Wing to make way for a new, privately-funded $300 million ballroom has caused shock and criticism. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the move, noting the structure's historical significance and the memories associated with it. Commentators suggested the act reflects former President Trump's tendency to defy presidential norms and disregard historical preservation. The rapid deconstruction was seen by some as a symbolic act of thumbing his nose at the idea of checks and balances and the traditional reverence for the White House.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly ended trade negotiations with Canada, a move that experts warn could affect prices for cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The decision was reportedly a response to a Canadian TV ad that used a Ronald Reagan speech to caution against high tariffs. This halt in talks could keep existing 35% tariffs on many Canadian goods and 50% levies on steel and aluminum in place for an extended period. Since Canada is the top exporter of steel and aluminum to the U.S., prolonged tariffs are likely to increase manufacturing costs, which could then be passed on to American consumers.</p>

An article in Xinhua news agency stated that Xi "personally headed" the drafting team and played a "decisive role" in its formulation, pouring significant effort into the process. The plan was reportedly based on extensive investigations conducted during Xi's tours across China throughout the year. This high level of personal involvement underscores Xi's consolidation of power and his direct influence over China's long-term economic and strategic direction.</p>

          <p>In a new BBC interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris has strongly suggested she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028, stating she is "not done" with her life of service. When asked directly if she would be the next president, she responded "possibly," her clearest indication yet of future ambitions. Harris dismissed current polls that show her with low favorability, arguing that she has defied polling expectations throughout her career. In the interview, she also criticized former President Trump as a "tyrant" who has weaponized the justice system.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Seattle-area mansion for $63 million, earning a profit of over $25 million on the property he purchased in 2019. This move comes as Bezos, who now primarily resides in Miami, continues to reduce his ownership stake in Amazon, which has fallen below 10%. The sale occurs amidst an ongoing legal dispute where Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez, are seeking to have her brother, Michael Sánchez, cover over $190,000 in legal fees from a defamation lawsuit he lost. The lawsuit stemmed from allegations that Michael Sánchez leaked private texts about their affair.</p>

Her victory over Bridget Phillipson, who was seen as closer to Starmer, is viewed as an expression of the party's anxiety over its current political standing. While not a landslide, the result places a prominent figure from a different wing of the party in a key leadership role. Powell has indicated her critiques will be mostly private, but her election reflects the internal challenges and recent turmoil facing the Labour Party.</p>
