            <p>President Trump privately admitted awareness that his tariff plan could trigger a recession but aimed to avoid a depression, according to sources familiar with the conversations. Trump was willing to accept economic "pain" for the policy, influenced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's advice and negotiations with multiple countries. Bond yields had soared and equities plummeted before Trump rolled back some tariffs, prompting a market rebound. Kevin Hassett, director of the U.S. National Economic Council, noted the bond market decline contributed to Trump's decision, emphasizing the role of investor concerns in the policy shift.

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% annually in March, slightly below forecasts, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's inflation control efforts. Monthly prices decreased by 0.1%, the first drop in five years, driven by lower fuel and travel costs, reflecting slower international demand amid Trump's trade policies. Experts suggest easing inflation, combined with a pause in tariffs, could alleviate concerns for the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. However, existing tariffs, particularly on China, are expected to drive inflation higher later in the year, potentially weighing on economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is facing backlash for laying off nearly half of its staff working on developmental disabilities and birth defects, eliminating teams focused on adults with cognitive disabilities and sickle cell disease. The cuts will halt critical research and disrupt life-saving public health programs, disproportionately affecting Black families affected by sickle cell disease. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed openness to restoring some programs, but the layoffs have sparked concerns about the administration's commitment to addressing chronic disease and supporting vulnerable populations. The cuts also impact data collection, early hearing detection programs, and partnerships with the Special Olympics.</p>

            <h2>Are Torpedo Bats Just Superstition or a Data-Driven Innovation?</h2>

            <p>The recent surge in popularity of torpedo bats, with their unconventional bowling-pin shape, has sparked debate about whether they represent a genuine innovation or mere superstition. While proponents claim the design optimizes weight distribution for power, physicists argue that the overall weight distribution across the bat's barrel is more critical. Some believe the altered weight distribution could improve bat control, while others suggest it may disrupt established swings. The phenomenon highlights the complex interplay between data-driven analysis and traditional baseball intuition.</p>
