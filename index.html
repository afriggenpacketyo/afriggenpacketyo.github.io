          <p>A new report from the VA's Office of Inspector General indicates that staffing shortages at Veterans Health Administration facilities have increased by 50% in the current fiscal year. The report highlights severe shortages of medical officers and nurses at the vast majority of facilities, a finding based on questionnaires sent to 139 locations. In response, the Department of Veterans Affairs has contested the report's methodology, calling the findings subjective, unreliable, and not based on actual vacancy data. Critics of the administration, however, point to the report as evidence of policies that are undermining the VA workforce and harming veterans' access to care.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, is experiencing unprecedented flooding after a glacial ice dam on the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive volume of water. The Mendenhall River crested at a record 16.65 feet, surpassing previous highs and prompting evacuations in vulnerable areas. This annual event, caused by climate change-related glacial retreat, has intensified in recent years, destroying homes and infrastructure. Authorities have deployed temporary barriers, but a long-term solution is still years away as these outburst floods are expected to continue for decades.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to ask Congress for long-term extensions to maintain federal control over Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, beyond the current 30-day limit. This move is part of a broader initiative to address crime in the nation's capital, which includes the deployment of the National Guard. While the president asserted that Republicans would unanimously approve the extension, it would likely require bipartisan support in the Senate. The push for extended federal oversight comes despite local police data showing a significant year-over-year decrease in violent crime in the district.</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a 45-year-old woman from Wisconsin, has been found guilty by a U.K. court for her role in a 2019 murder plot in Birmingham, England. Prosecutors stated that Betro, disguised in a niqab, attempted to shoot a man at point-blank range, but the handgun jammed, allowing the target to escape. The attempted killing was part of a violent family feud, with Betro allegedly hired by two other men who have since been jailed. Betro, who was extradited from Armenia, denied the charges, claiming it was a case of mistaken identity and a series of coincidences.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave fell 17% after the company announced a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analyst expectations. The negative financial report comes just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce further stock volatility. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, beating forecasts, and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance. However, some analysts noted concerns over a delay in capital expenditures, suggesting potential uncertainty in deployment timing.</p>

Reports suggest Russia may demand the remainder of Donetsk and Luhansk in exchange for halting its offensive, a deal Ukraine vehemently opposes after immense military and civilian losses.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the state will proceed with drawing new congressional maps, which he claims will help Democrats regain control of the U.S. House and effectively "END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY." This move is a direct retaliation against Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas, which could give the GOP additional seats. Newsom's announcement suggests a significant escalation in the national partisan battle over redistricting, with control of Congress hanging in the balance. Draft maps from the California legislature are expected to be released soon.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares to meet with Vladimir Putin, many Ukrainians remain wary of negotiations that exclude their country, viewing them as a potential path to forced capitulation. According to a recent poll, a vast majority of Ukrainians reject making concessions to Russia, and analysts believe Putin's negotiating stance remains unchanged, aimed at Ukraine's surrender. Ukrainian politicians and experts emphasize that any deal struck without their participation will be unenforceable, as Ukraine's constitution forbids ceding territory and its European partners are unlikely to accept terms dictated by Trump and Putin alone.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has released its 2024 human rights reports after significant revisions by Trump administration political appointees, altering the long-standing focus of the documents. The new reports have removed entire categories, including systemic discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, violence against women, corruption, and threats to fair trials. Furthermore, reports on specific countries have been rewritten to soften criticism of dictatorships like El Salvador while introducing harsh assessments of democratic allies like Germany. Critics argue this politically motivated overhaul abandons objective standards and undermines the credibility of U.S. human rights advocacy.</p>

The case went cold for over two decades until 2014, when investigators used genetic genealogy to link DNA from the crime scenes to the Miller surname. This led them to Bryan Miller, who had a prior juvenile record for a stabbing. An undercover sting operation at a restaurant successfully obtained his DNA, confirming he was the killer and leading to his arrest and eventual death sentence.</p>

The budget carrier cited adverse market conditions, including weak domestic leisure travel demand and a challenging pricing environment, for its continued financial difficulties. As the airline is not improving quickly enough to meet creditor agreements, it faces potential defaults if it cannot secure more liquidity.

          <p>This article explores how much of a retirement portfolio one should consider investing in an annuity, particularly given the current economic environment of elevated interest rates and potential future rate cuts. Experts suggest an allocation of 20% to 50%, depending on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, health, and existing guaranteed income sources like Social Security. The primary goal is to create a secure income floor to cover essential expenses. With interest rates potentially declining, now may be an opportune time to lock in higher payouts offered by current annuity contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

The victims, two adults and a child, died when a tree, uprooted from the saturated ground, fell onto their car. The heavy rainfall prompted the Hamilton County mayor to declare a state of emergency, as roads were closed and numerous residents were rescued from swamped vehicles and homes. A search is also underway for a man who was reportedly swept away by floodwaters in the area.</p>

          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have reported seeing rabbits with disturbing black, horn-like growths, sometimes resembling tentacles, protruding from their heads and faces. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have identified the cause as shope papillomavirus (SPV), a virus specific to rabbits that causes wart-like tumors. While the growths can look alarming, the virus is not harmful to humans or other animals and typically does not hurt the rabbits unless it obstructs their vision or mouth. Researchers believe this phenomenon may have inspired the legend of the North American jackalope.</p>

The president had criticized the bank's analysis on social media, but the economist reiterated that their models show the burden shifting from exporters to consumers, potentially pushing a key inflation gauge to 3.2% by year's end. The firm's research indicates that by the fall, consumers could be shouldering about two-thirds of the costs from recent tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
