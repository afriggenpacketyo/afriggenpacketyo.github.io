          <p>A federal jury convicted Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputy Trevor Kirk of using excessive force, but the conviction was later undermined by the U.S. Attorney's office, leading to a misdemeanor plea deal.

The case involved Kirk assaulting and pepper-spraying a woman outside a supermarket in Lancaster, and the subsequent handling of the case has drawn criticism and led to resignations within the U.S. Attorney's office.</p>
