          <p>Real estate technology company Opendoor saw its stock price increase by 75% on Thursday following a major leadership overhaul. The company appointed Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and brought back co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman, signaling a return to its original "founder mode." This change comes after a period of investor pressure and follows a remarkable year for the stock, which has risen over 500% from near-delisting levels. The new leadership aims to leverage artificial intelligence to simplify the home buying and selling process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) temporarily shut down a women's food distribution site on Thursday following what it described as a credible threat from Hamas. A GHF spokesperson reported that hundreds of military-aged men gathered near the site, and the organization received intelligence that Hamas operatives planned to infiltrate the distribution, potentially disguised as women. This disruption, which the GHF says was forced by Hamas, endangers the flow of aid to civilians and adds to the growing pressure on humanitarian operations in the region.</p>

          <p>A majority of Brazil's Supreme Court justices have found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of orchestrating a military coup plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. The court determined that while the plot did not secure enough military support, it incited the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings by his followers. Convicted on five charges including attempting to stage a coup and leading a criminal organization, the 70-year-old former leader faces a potential sentence of several decades in prison.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson from his post as ambassador to the United States after newly revealed emails detailed his supportive relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The emails, sent as Epstein faced charges in 2008, showed Mandelson offering encouragement, which the Prime Minister's office called "reprehensible." The sacking has prompted political criticism over Mandelson's initial appointment and comes just days before a scheduled state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, creating an awkward diplomatic situation.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering a bill to ban PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in products like cookware, which has created a conflict between environmental advocates and prominent celebrity chefs.

          <p>A recent inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that tariffs are increasingly translating into higher prices for American consumers on everyday items. Prices rose for tariff-sensitive goods such as apparel, electronics, auto parts, and furniture, contributing to inflation running near 3%. This trend challenges the administration's insistence that tariffs would not drive up costs and creates a difficult situation for the Federal Reserve. The rising prices for necessities are squeezing household budgets at a time when the labor market is also showing signs of weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>GE Vernova's CEO acknowledged challenges for its wind energy business, projecting a 10-15% revenue decline in 2026 due to soft orders and the current administration's stance against wind projects. Despite this, the company's CEO expressed optimism about growth in its gas power and electrification segments. In other market news, Boeing's stock received a lift after Southwest Airlines increased its delivery expectations for the year. The update provides a mixed but insightful look into the performance and outlook of two major industrial companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Pasadena resident has shared his experience of being detained for 13 days in a temporary ICE processing center in downtown Los Angeles, a facility meant for holds of less than 12 hours.

          <p>President Trump's recurring public threats to revoke the U.S. citizenship of political opponents are drawing concern from legal experts, who see it as a departure from the historical use of denaturalization. While stripping birthright citizenship is legally almost impossible, the administration has directed the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue denaturalization for naturalized citizens. Experts argue this transforms a legal process for rare cases of fraud into a tool of political intimidation, creating a chilling effect and undermining the security that citizenship is meant to provide.</p>

          <p>With inflation remaining elevated, retirees living on fixed incomes face a significant challenge in preserving their purchasing power. This article explores how annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream, but cautions that traditional fixed annuities can be eroded by rising costs over time. It suggests considering options like variable annuities, indexed annuities, or adding an inflation protection rider to a contract. These strategies can help payments keep pace with the cost of living, though they may involve higher risk or a lower initial payout. (not investment advice)</p>
