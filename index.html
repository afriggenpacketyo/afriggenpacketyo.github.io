          <p>The UK government's Spending Review details budget allocations for the next three years.  Significant funding increases are earmarked for schools, particularly those needing repairs, and the NHS, though concerns remain about whether these increases will be sufficient to meet growing demands.  Ambitious transport infrastructure projects are announced, but their implementation is projected for the 2030s.  Social housing receives substantial investment, hailed as a 'game changer', while policing and border security also see increased funding.</p>

While the trend is positive, there are indications that central bank purchases might slow down in the coming months.
