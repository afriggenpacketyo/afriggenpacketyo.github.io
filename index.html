        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the current monthly cost of a $75,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), noting that recent interest rate cuts have made this form of borrowing more affordable. It compares current payment estimates for 10- and 15-year terms to costs from earlier in 2025 and the summer of 2024, highlighting the savings for homeowners. The piece suggests that with the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting rates, the variable nature of a HELOC could lead to even lower payments in the future without the need for refinancing.

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals soared over 250% in premarket trading following a White House announcement of a partnership that includes a $35.6 million investment, making the U.S. government a 10% shareholder. This move is part of a broader U.S. strategy to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper and cobalt by developing the Ambler mining district in Alaska. The decision reverses a previous rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development despite environmental concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal has rewarded goalkeeper David Raya with an improved contract, reflecting his key role in the team under manager Mikel Arteta. While the length of his contract, which expires in 2028 with an option to extend, remains unchanged, the new terms provide the Spanish international with a significant pay increase. This agreement, reportedly struck earlier in the summer but not officially announced by the club, solidifies his status as a valued player for the foreseeable future and signals the club's confidence in his abilities.</p>

          <p>In a humorous critique, a columnist expresses frustration with the party invitation app Partiful, describing its Y2K-inspired design as a "purple mess" and its features as annoying. The author laments the fragmentation of social media functions that were once centralized on platforms like Facebook, pointing out Partiful's passive-aggressive prompts to commit to events. As a solution to the digital clutter and social pressure, the writer ironically suggests a return to handwritten invitations, arguing the sheer effort involved would mercifully reduce the number of parties being thrown.</p>

Raoul's office is challenging the move, arguing that such a deployment violates state sovereignty and could escalate tensions rather than improve public safety. This reflects a broader conflict between the Trump administration and Democratic-led cities over the use of federal and military power for domestic law enforcement purposes and states' rights.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has pushed back against suggestions that her party's annual conference lacks energy, insisting there is a "buzz" among attendees. Despite visible empty seats during major speeches, Badenoch argued that the main hall's attendance is not the best measure of enthusiasm, pointing to packed fringe events. She attributed the lower presence of corporate lobbyists to the party being in opposition, claiming the conference is now more focused on grassroots members who are "thrilled" with recent policy announcements and party direction.</p>

          <p>Dr. Neville Lawrence, the father of Stephen Lawrence, has stated that David Norris, one of the two men convicted for his son's racist murder in 1993, should not be released from prison until he identifies the other killers involved. As Norris faces a public Parole Board hearing, Dr. Lawrence insists that revealing the names of his accomplices is essential to prove he has changed and is no longer a threat to the public. The case remains a landmark in British justice, and the family continues to fight for full accountability three decades after the attack.</p>

          <p>Paul Mosley, who was convicted of manslaughter for his role in a 2012 house fire in Derby that killed six children, has died. Mosley was an accomplice to the children's parents, Mick and Mairead Philpott, in a plot to set the fire to frame Mick Philpott's mistress and gain custody of her children. Mosley had served half of his 17-year sentence and was out on license at the time of his death. The case was one of the UK's most shocking and tragic criminal cases in recent memory.</p>

          <p>As the war between Israel and Hamas enters its third year, the conflict remains a systematic and brutal campaign, marked by widespread destruction in Gaza and a death toll exceeding 67,000 Palestinians. Israel's military operations have expanded to other countries in the region, while it faces international accusations of genocide, which it denies. Despite the ongoing violence, a new 20-point peace plan proposed by the Trump administration has created a potential path forward, with negotiators from both sides set to meet in Egypt for further talks.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, pine martens have been released in Exmoor National Park as part of a major conservation effort. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project introduced 19 of the cat-sized mammals, sourced from Scotland, to secret locations within the park last month. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar for monitoring, and conservationists hope their return will help restore balance to the woodland ecosystem, marking a positive step for nature recovery in the region and a success for rewilding initiatives.</p>

The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for the area and noted that moisture from the system could bring heavy rainfall to the Southwestern U.S. later in the week.</p>

          <p>A recent report on the January firestorms in Los Angeles County reveals systemic failures in emergency response, echoing the same issues identified after the 2018 Woolsey fire. The investigation found that unclear chains of command, outdated protocols, and inadequate staffing hampered coordination and led to critical delays in issuing evacuation orders, contributing to the loss of life and property. Despite previous promises to fix these problems, experts argue that after-action reports often fail to address the underlying structural and bureaucratic issues, leading to a cycle of repeated mistakes.</p>
