        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting has announced the immediate return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to its ABC stations, effectively ending a controversial preemption that began due to remarks made by host Jimmy Kimmel concerning the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The show had been temporarily suspended by Sinclair and Nexstar affiliates following Kimmel's comments related to the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Sinclair's statement emphasized its commitment to ensuring programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience, while also honoring obligations to air national network content. Although Sinclair's 38 ABC stations will resume airing the program, Nexstar, operating about 30 ABC affiliates, has not yet indicated if or when it will follow suit. The preemption had drawn significant attention, with Kimmel's show still attracting a large broadcast audience on other affiliates.</p>

          <p>Hackers calling themselves Radiant are threatening to publish additional private data of thousands of nursery children and their families online unless a ransom is paid, following an initial release of 20 children's profiles. The Kido nursery chain confirmed the breach occurred via a software service called Famly, which is widely used by other childcare organizations. Famly, however, asserts its own security was not compromised and that the incident was isolated to Kido's hosted data. Parents have expressed profound distress, with one mother receiving a direct threatening phone call from the hackers, demanding she pressure Kido to pay. The Met Police are currently investigating this "barbaric new low" in cybercrime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the intense and prolonged feud between Donald Trump and former FBI Director James Comey, detailing their interactions from 2016 through 2025. It highlights pivotal moments, including Comey's controversial handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, his public confirmation of the FBI's inquiry into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia, and his subsequent abrupt firing by Trump in 2017. The conflict escalated with Comey's book, critical of Trump's leadership, and culminated in his recent indictment for making a false statement and obstructing a congressional proceeding related to his 2020 testimony. Trump's celebratory reaction to the indictment underscores the deep animosity defining their decade-long political and personal conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has found hip-hop producer Metro Boomin, known as Leland Tyler Wayne, not liable in his civil sexual assault case, concluding nearly a year of intense litigation. The Grammy-nominated artist expressed profound relief, stating he is "grateful and thankful to God" to finally put the "nonsense" behind him after being cleared of all four actionable claims brought by Vanessa LeMaistre. LeMaistre had alleged a sexual assault occurred in September 2016, accusing Wayne of impregnating her and leading to an abortion. Wayne's legal team consistently and vehemently denied the allegations, dismissing the complaint as a "pure shakedown," a position ultimately supported by the jury's verdict. LeMaistre's attorney, while disappointed, indicated plans to appeal the outcome.</p>

Major investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake, are reportedly involved in the potential transaction, with an official announcement anticipated as early as next week. If finalized, this leveraged buyout would set a new record as the largest in Wall Street history, surpassing the approximately $45 billion deal for TXU Energy in 2007. EA, renowned for popular franchises such as The Sims, Madden NFL, and FC (formerly FIFA), has already seen its stock climb 32% for the year with these latest gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A remarkably rare orange lobster, estimated to be a one-in-30-million find, has been successfully rescued from a New York supermarket and released back into the wild. Shopper Kyle Brancato spotted the uniquely colored crustacean, affectionately nicknamed Jean-Clawed Van Damme, moving among other lobsters for sale at a Tops grocery store and decided to purchase it with the explicit goal of setting it free. With crucial assistance from Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium, the lobster was safely returned to the open waters of the Long Island Sound. This heartwarming and unusual rescue occurred just a day before National Lobster Day, offering a positive contrast to the typical fate of thousands of lobsters during peak harvesting season.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been officially readmitted to the Labour Party, ending a year-long suspension imposed after they rebelled against the government's two-child benefit cap. They were among seven left-wing MPs who voted against an SNP motion to scrap the cap shortly after Labour's 2024 landslide victory, with six now having rejoined as the party begins to soften its stance on the controversial policy. Begum used her return to criticize Labour for suspending MPs who vote with their conscience, while the Resolution Foundation estimates that abolishing the cap would cost £3.5 billion and lift 470,000 children out of poverty. The issue is expected to be a central theme at Labour's upcoming annual conference in Liverpool.</p>

          <p>Famed former Salomon Brothers bond trader Howard Rubin, along with his ex-personal assistant Jennifer Powers, was arrested Friday morning on severe charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts spanning a decade.

Prosecutors are requesting Rubin be held without bail, citing his extraordinary wealth and overseas accounts. Rubin was previously found liable in a civil trial in 2022 for sex trafficking six women, ordered to pay $3.85 million in damages, and is currently appealing that judgment.</p>

Despite an animated celebration, players and manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the unique obstacles, including early-season injuries, a significant second-half slump, and numerous bullpen collapses, suggesting a potential "World Series hangover" effect from their previous championship. Roberts highlighted the physical and mental exhaustion that comes with trying to repeat, a feat not accomplished since the Yankees' three-peat in 1998-2000.

          <p>President Donald Trump has explicitly intensified his campaign of retribution against perceived political adversaries, stating there will be "others" following the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Comey, a long-standing target since he oversaw the FBI's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election, faces charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his 2020 congressional testimony. The charges were brought by a newly appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, after her predecessor reportedly expressed internal doubts about the case. Additionally, federal prosecutors received directives to prepare investigations into George Soros's Open Society Foundations. Critics, including Democrats, accuse Trump of weaponizing the Justice Department for political ends, while the FBI director disputes politicization.</p>

This article argues that Comey, a Republican with a career trajectory similar to many conservative justices, represents a target close to their own professional backgrounds. The author highlights the irony that Comey's actions in 2016 likely paved the way for Trump's presidency, yet Trump's vindictiveness knows no bounds, extending even to those who benefited him. The piece urges the Supreme Court to resist granting Trump sweeping authority in pending cases, warning that failure to restrain him now could lead to the justices themselves becoming future targets of political prosecution.</p>

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, this article outlines three compelling and timely reasons for savers to consider opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) account in early October. Firstly, securing a CD now allows for immediate interest compounding, meaning the reliable and predictable fixed rates, currently around 4.50%, will begin generating returns sooner. Secondly, with the CME Group's FedWatch tool indicating an 85.5% chance of another Fed rate cut by the end of October, acting proactively ensures savers lock in more attractive rates before potential declines. Lastly, many banks may preemptively reduce their rates even before an official Fed announcement, making prompt action crucial to maximize interest-earning opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amidst troubling national trends of rising credit card delinquencies and high consumer debt, this article provides essential guidance on the critical timeline and escalating consequences of late credit card payments. While most major credit card issuers typically offer a brief grace period of one to five days before applying a late fee, the true financial damage begins at 30 days past due, when late payments can be reported to credit bureaus, significantly impacting one's credit score. By 60 days, penalty APRs, potentially as high as 29.99% or more, may be imposed, and at 90 days, aggressive collection efforts intensify, with accounts flagged for closure. Beyond 120 to 180 days, debt is often charged off and sold to collection agencies, leaving a lasting negative mark on credit reports for seven years. Proactive communication with issuers and exploring hardship programs are crucial to mitigate severe financial repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article critically examines the pervasive and often hollow tactic of defending attacks on free speech by accusing critics of hypocrisy, particularly evident in the current political climate surrounding the Trump administration. It argues that this approach, frequently employed by both conservatives and progressives, serves as a "dodge" that sidesteps principled defenses of liberal norms in favor of justifying one's own illiberal actions. The author asserts that charges of hypocrisy are only useful for judging individuals, not for evaluating the validity of ideas, and that the notion of "everyone does it" merely rationalizes the abandonment of fundamental principles. The piece advocates for a consistent and unwavering commitment to defending free speech, regardless of the political source of the censorship, and cautions against assuming opponents lack genuine beliefs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to the 45th Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York resulted in stringent security measures that caused significant delays and widespread frustration for thousands of attending fans. Many spectators, some of whom arrived as early as 3 am, were denied glimpses of the opening tee shots due to heavy congestion at entry points and airport-style security protocols near the first hole. Traffic issues exacerbated the situation, forcing numerous attendees to abandon tournament shuttle buses and walk through residential areas to reach Bethpage. This marks the first instance of a sitting president attending the Ryder Cup, and while Trump was greeted with cheers upon his arrival, the heightened security apparatus undeniably marred the initial fan experience, leading to audible complaints from tournament staff.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent and often controversial figure in the Black Liberation Army and step-aunt of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, has died in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 78, with Cuban officials citing health conditions and advanced age. Born JoAnne Deborah Byron, Shakur became a potent symbol of resistance and Black liberation after her conviction for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper in 1977. She subsequently escaped from prison two years later and was granted political asylum in Cuba by Fidel Castro's government. Her 1987 memoir, "Assata: An Autobiography," detailed her journey through Black nationalist movements, advocating for armed resistance against systemic racism and oppression. Her death marks the end of a life defined by activism, controversy, and decades in exile, deeply affecting her daughter and numerous supporters.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced a significant step towards restoring trust in Boeing, allowing the manufacturer to resume self-certifying some of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft before they are delivered to customers. This decision marks a crucial turning point after years of intense scrutiny and safety crises that led the FAA to take over all airworthiness certifications for these models, following two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2019 and persistent production defects in 787s since 2022. The FAA stated that this move follows a "thorough review of Boeing's ongoing production quality" and will enable its inspectors to focus additional surveillance on the broader production process. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism about stabilizing the 737 Max production rate at 38 per month and evaluating potential increases with the FAA.</p>

          <p>A-list comedians, including Dave Chappelle, Aziz Ansari, and Pete Davidson, are facing increasing criticism from their industry peers for their scheduled participation in the controversial Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia. The nation has been under intense scrutiny for years due to widespread human rights abuses. This festival is part of Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030 plan, aimed at diversifying its economy and elevating its global profile through substantial investments in the entertainment sector. Watchdog groups like Human Rights Watch argue that such events constitute "sportswashing," designed to deflect attention from the kingdom's repression of free speech and other pervasive violations. Prominent comedians such as Marc Maron, Zach Woods, and Shane Gillis have publicly condemned the festival, with Gillis reportedly declining a significant performance offer on principled grounds.</p>

          <p>The opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black was marked by an initially raucous atmosphere that quickly turned subdued as Team Europe dominated the United States in the fourball session. Thousands of fans, some arriving as early as 3 am, created chaotic scenes around the course, but their energy waned as the European pairings, including Jon Rahm/Tyrrell Hatton and Rory McIlroy/Tommy Fleetwood, delivered precise and commanding performances. Despite Bryson DeChambeau's dramatic opening drive for Team USA, Europe absorbed the early American punch, capitalizing on a rain-softened course. By the session's end, Europe held a commanding 3-1 lead, silencing the partisan American crowd and setting a challenging tone for the remainder of the highly anticipated tournament.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, stands accused of fatally stabbing his twin sister Meghan in her sleep, but his defense hinges on the rare claim that he was sleepwalking during the tragic incident. Benjamin immediately called 911 after realizing what had happened, stating, "I just killed my sister… I thought it was a dream." Both his family and investigators were unable to find any motive for the unfathomable act. A neurologist and sleep disorder expert, Dr. Jerald Simmons, after examining Benjamin and his family's history of sleepwalking, concluded that Benjamin likely committed the act during a slow-wave sleep episode. Despite this expert finding, prosecutors questioned his account and charged him with intentional murder, leading to a trial that presents a heartbreaking and complex legal defense.</p>

Michaels, having acquired Joann's intellectual property and private label brands in June, is also expanding its party goods section, aiming to solidify its position as North America's largest specialty fabric and party retailer. This transformative move capitalizes on the market void left by the recent closures of both Joann and Party City, strategically positioning Michaels for a potentially busy holiday season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed breakdown of the estimated monthly costs for a $150,000 home equity loan, particularly relevant following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. Home equity loans offer a fixed interest rate, ensuring predictable monthly payments, and current average rates are slightly more favorable than earlier in the year. For a 10-year repayment period at an average rate of 8.34%, the monthly payment would be approximately $1,846.97. Opting for a 15-year term at an average rate of 8.21% would result in monthly payments around $1,451.72. While the immediate savings compared to earlier 2025 rates are modest, the potential for further rate cuts later this year and into 2026 could make this a increasingly attractive borrowing option for homeowners.

          <p>Costco reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, which surpassed analyst expectations, though minor misses in same-store sales growth, membership renewal rates, and gross margin led to a slight 2% dip in its stock. Despite this, Wall Street analysts largely maintained "outperform" or "buy" ratings, making only marginal downward adjustments to price targets while expressing overall optimism. They highlighted several positive indicators, including robust membership fee growth and a significant increase in online signups, particularly among younger demographics, which are seen as crucial for long-term member retention. Although the stock's high price-to-earnings multiple presents a challenge for new investments, analysts emphasize Costco's strong value proposition as an inflation-fighter and its consistent operational execution, solidifying its status as a core holding.

These invaluable fossils, known collectively as the Dubois Collection, were originally extracted by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois in 1891, a period when Indonesia was under Dutch colonial rule. The decision follows a recommendation from the Dutch Independent Colonial Collections Committee, which concluded that the items were likely removed against the will of the local population, constituting an act of historical injustice. This initiative is part of a broader, ongoing effort by the Netherlands to confront and rectify its colonial past, having previously returned other significant artifacts to Indonesia and the ancient Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, marking a positive step towards reconciliation.</p>

The backlog has grown substantially, with a mere 5,600 applications processed in August, a situation exacerbated by the Trump administration's termination of nearly half the Education Department staff in March.

The home run, hit during the Mariners' division-clinching game, sparked widespread positive reactions online, drawing comparisons to a previous, less generous fan incident. Mariners security quickly authenticated the ball, and Marcus, prioritizing the player's ownership of the milestone, willingly exchanged it for a signed bat and an invitation to batting practice. In a further gesture, the Mariners successfully tracked down Mutti-Driscoll, rewarding his exceptional generosity with his own signed bat and a special meet-and-greet with Raleigh, creating a truly feel-good story for baseball fans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has successfully seized over $220 million worth of cocaine in a series of recent interdictions targeting alleged drug-smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico, Central, and South America. During August and September, the crew of the USCG Cutter Midgett alone intercepted four different vessels, confiscating approximately 21,126 pounds of cocaine. Separately, the USCG Cutter Diligence seized an additional 8,700 pounds of cocaine north of Panama in early September. The Coast Guard released a striking image of one alleged drug boat on fire, explaining that such vessels are intentionally sunk after narcotics are removed to prevent maritime accidents. These operations highlight that approximately 80% of illicit narcotics destined for the United States are intercepted at sea, predominantly in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

This short-notice, large-scale gathering follows President Trump's earlier executive order renaming the Defense Department as the Department of War and Hegseth's previous public statements about his intent to significantly reduce the number of flag officers.
