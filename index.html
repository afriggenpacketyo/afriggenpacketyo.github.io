          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a court order requiring the reinstatement of U.S. Department of Education employees who were terminated as part of a planned agency dismantling. Administration officials argue that a U.S. District Judge in Boston lacked the authority to mandate the rehiring of over 1,300 affected workers. This action follows a federal appeals court's refusal to lift the judge's ruling, which came after 21 states and the American Federation of Teachers sued the administration over the staff cuts and the executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department. The original reduction in force was announced on March 11, leading to immediate legal challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. employers added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' forecasts and signaling resilience in the labor market despite concerns over tariffs and economic uncertainty. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2% for the third consecutive month, matching economists' expectations. While job growth was slightly weaker compared to previous months, the report suggests the labor market is holding up, with the health care and leisure and hospitality industries experiencing the largest gains. Experts caution that the economy could slow in the coming months, but the latest jobs report alleviates immediate concerns about an imminent recession. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that fecal microbial transplants (FMTs), a method hailed for restoring gut microbiomes, may carry unintended health risks. Researchers found that mismatches between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut environment could negatively impact the recipientâ€™s immune and metabolic functions. The study, conducted on mice and human tissue samples, revealed that newly introduced gut flora could "terraform" the entire intestinal tract, leading to modifications in the recipient's tissues. Experts suggest greater care should be taken to design fecal transplants that use specific, targeted microbes for the intestines, though further research is needed to conclusively assess potential negative health outcomes in patients.</p>

These measures aim to stabilize UBS and may lead to fewer share buybacks and the full capitalization of its foreign units. While UBS supports most of the regulatory proposals in principle, it disagrees with the "extreme" increase in capital requirements, estimating that it would need to hold around $42 billion in additional CET1 capital in total.

          <p>The stock market rebounded on Friday, driven by a positive nonfarm payrolls report, which indicated the labor market remained stable with 139,000 jobs added in May and the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. This report eased investor concerns following suboptimal labor market data earlier in the week, as the U.S. economy relies heavily on private consumption, which is sustained by low unemployment. Analysts suggest the jobs data wasn't weak enough to signal a recession, but also not too strong to prevent potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. The market's reaction underscores the importance of the job market to investor sentiment and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to arm "clans in Gaza" to fight Hamas has drawn criticism, with opponents warning of potential negative consequences for Israel. Former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman accused Netanyahu of providing weapons to a criminal gang, while Netanyahu defended the move as a way to save Israeli soldiers' lives. The armed group, Popular Forces of Palestine, denied receiving weapons from Israel. Opposition leader Yair Lapid cautioned against repeating past mistakes, referencing Israel's earlier support for Hamas, highlighting the risks of arming groups in Gaza without strategic planning.</p>

This action follows concerns from senators and California lawmakers who suggest a settlement could be a bribe and disrupt fair competition among news organizations.

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for fire coverage, operates with a high level of secrecy, withholding financial data and keeping board meetings private. This lack of transparency is concerning because new rules require all property insurance holders to cover the FAIR Plan's debts. An audit revealed the FAIR Plan is more secretive than similar plans in other states, and despite directives to increase transparency, little has changed. The plan's structure and operations raise questions about accountability and public oversight, especially as it grows in prominence and relies on assessments from member companies.</p>
