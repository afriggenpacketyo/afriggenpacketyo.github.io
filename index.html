          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of parents living in the U.S. unlawfully or temporarily. The judge certified a class-action lawsuit and issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the plaintiffs demonstrated a clear risk of irreparable harm. The White House criticized the ruling as an overreach, vowing to fight the decision. The case centers on the interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, a cornerstone of U.S. law for over a century.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated his country will respond with "reciprocity" to a new 50% tariff imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The tariff, set to begin August 1, was justified by Trump as retaliation for the prosecution of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and an "unfair trade relationship." Da Silva countered Trump's claims, noting the U.S. actually holds a trade surplus with Brazil and asserting that his country's sovereign institutions will not be dictated to. The move is part of a broader U.S. strategy of imposing steep new tariffs on numerous countries.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the expansion of the company's robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with plans for a Bay Area launch pending regulatory approval. Additionally, Musk stated that the Grok artificial intelligence chatbot, developed by his xAI company, will be integrated into Tesla vehicles soon. These developments come during a period of volatility for Musk's companies, marked by a public feud with President Trump and the recent departure of X CEO Linda Yaccarino. The announcements appeared to boost investor confidence, with Tesla's stock seeing a modest increase.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's Outlook email service experienced a significant, hours-long outage that affected users worldwide across its web, mobile, and desktop platforms. The disruption began Wednesday evening and continued into Thursday, preventing many from accessing their email accounts. Microsoft's 365 Status account on X acknowledged the issue, attributing it to a problematic configuration change. The company later announced it was deploying a fix globally to resolve the impact for all affected users and restore normal service.</p>

          <p>Police in south Belfast have announced they will not assist contractors in dismantling a controversial bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. The decision came after a risk assessment concluded that intervention posed a greater danger than allowing the event to proceed. The bonfire's proximity to a major electricity substation raised concerns about the power supply to two major hospitals, and asbestos was also found at the site. The decision has drawn criticism from some local politicians while being welcomed as a "common sense" approach by others, highlighting deep cultural and political divisions.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates near all-time highs, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness as a potential solution for overwhelming balances. This strategy involves negotiating with creditors to settle a debt for less than the total amount owed, typically via a lump-sum payment. The article suggests this path could be beneficial if you are paying more in interest than principal, are eligible for a significant balance reduction, or face a lengthy repayment timeline under current terms. While it can offer substantial savings, it's important to consider the associated fees and potential impact on your credit score. (not investment advice)</p>

A calculation shows that in most short-term scenarios (3, 6, and 12 months), a CD currently offers slightly higher, guaranteed returns than a money market account, making it a potentially more profitable, if less liquid, option for savers.

          <p>Russia has significantly intensified its aerial attacks on Ukraine, using vast, coordinated waves of hundreds of drones and missiles to overwhelm air defenses and terrorize civilians. These attacks, featuring modified Shahed drones with greater range and payload, are spreading fear and eroding morale in cities like Kyiv, far from the front lines. Experts warn that Russia's increasing production capabilities could soon allow for even larger assaults. The strategy forces Ukraine to expend precious and sophisticated air defense resources, highlighting the vast disparity in military resources between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the interim administrator of NASA. The appointment comes weeks after the president withdrew the nomination of entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who had been recommended by Elon Musk. Trump cited Isaacman's past political donations to Democrats and the potential conflict of interest due to his friendship with Musk, whose company SpaceX is a major NASA contractor. Duffy, a former congressman, will temporarily lead the agency as it pursues ambitious goals, including returning astronauts to the moon and a future mission to Mars.</p>

          <p>Varda Space Industries, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in space, has raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. The company's mission is to leverage the microgravity environment of orbit, which allows certain drug crystals to form in ways not possible on Earth. Varda has already successfully launched and returned a capsule that created a drug in space and plans to use the new capital to increase its flight cadence and expand its research. The funding signals strong investor confidence in the emerging field of in-orbit manufacturing and the orbital economy.</p>

          <p>As catastrophic floodwaters rose in Kerr County, Texas, on July 4, crucial emergency alerts were reportedly delayed due to a need for supervisory approval. A former county IT director who monitored emergency radio traffic said a firefighter's request to activate the CodeRED alert system was put on hold for authorization. This delay occurred while the river was rising rapidly and first responders were already conducting rescues. The incident raises serious questions about the efficiency and protocol of the local emergency response system during a fast-moving, life-threatening disaster.</p>

          <p>A new, non-addictive painkiller called Journavx is offering hope for patients with severe pain, but access remains a significant challenge. The drug, the first new type of painkiller in over two decades, is expensive, and insurance coverage is limited. The FDA has only approved it for short-term acute pain, such as post-surgery, leaving chronic pain sufferers without coverage. Even for approved uses, high co-pays and narrow coverage windows prevent many patients and doctors from utilizing what could be a crucial alternative to opioids, frustrating those seeking safer pain management options.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's nomination of Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize is a cynical and absurd publicity stunt. The author contends that Netanyahu is exploiting Trump's desire for flattery to distract from and prolong the war in Gaza, thereby securing his own political survival. The piece suggests the nomination is a tactic to delay a ceasefire and avoid accountability for his government's security failures and his own corruption trial. It frames the move as a strategic manipulation rather than a genuine recognition of peacemaking efforts.</p>

          <p>Kevin Stein, the CEO of TransDigm Group, a company previously accused by a Pentagon audit of making millions in excess profits from defense contracts, has become a significant political donor to both parties. In 2019, TransDigm voluntarily repaid $16.1 million after bipartisan congressional scrutiny. However, after a 2021 audit alleged a further $20.8 million in excess profits, the company did not issue a refund. Campaign finance records show Stein has since made large donations, raising concerns about corporate influence and accountability for companies that profit excessively from taxpayer-funded government contracts.</p>

          <p>Following the catastrophic floods in Central Texas, false claims blaming the disaster on cloud seeding have circulated widely online. Meteorologists and other experts have definitively stated that the weather modification technique, which can enhance rainfall in existing clouds by a small margin, is not powerful enough to have caused or contributed to the massive deluge. A small cloud seeding operation did occur 150 miles away two days before the flood, but experts confirm it had no connection to the disaster, which was caused by a convergence of storms.</p>
