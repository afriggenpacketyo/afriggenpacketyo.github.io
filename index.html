          <p>President Trump has officially pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud, following appeals from their daughter Savannah Chrisley. Savannah expressed gratitude to Trump for reuniting her family after the couple's sentencing in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution. The charges against the Chrisleys stemmed from a fifteen-year fraud spree involving false information provided to banks and fabricated bank statements. Savannah Chrisley confirmed that a new reality series is in the works with Lifetime, continuing the family's story in the public eye.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has paused exports of critical U.S. technologies to China, including those related to jet engines and semiconductors, in response to China's restrictions on critical mineral exports to the United States, which had threatened to cripple U.S. company supply chains. This action escalates the trade conflict between the two largest economies, potentially impacting companies relying on foreign technologies. The restrictions affect COMAC, a Chinese state-owned aerospace manufacturer, and its development of the C919 aircraft, which relies on U.S. and European suppliers for parts. While China has restarted some rare earth magnet shipments, concerns about access to critical Chinese supplies remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 for leading a criminal enterprise while incarcerated, in addition to a prior 200-year sentence for a 1973 murder. His attorneys stated that Hoover has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at a maximum-security prison in Colorado. While the commutation releases him from federal custody, Hoover still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois.</p>

Other officials, including Kristi Noem and Corey Lewandowski, also spoke at the meeting, but took a milder approach than Miller, who sources described as stern with agents. A DHS spokesperson said that the department is delivering on President Trump and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe.</p>

          <p>Canada has ordered the culling of 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm after some died from the H5N1 avian flu, sparking objections from U.S. officials including Robert F.

Most veterinarians, however, believe keeping potentially infected birds alive poses a public health risk, as a U.S. outbreak has already killed millions of birds and infected dozens of people. The farm owners lost a legal battle to keep the birds alive for antibody testing, arguing their scientific value.</p>

          <p>A group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in Tesla have sent a letter demanding that Elon Musk work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker. The investors cite Tesla's stock price volatility, declining sales, human rights concerns, and a plummeting global reputation as reasons for concern. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business and a policy limiting directors' outside board commitments. Tesla's brand value and reputation have declined since 2024, largely due to Musk's rhetoric and political activities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's impatience and demand for quick policy changes are undermining his agenda, leading to conflicts with the law and courts. His short attention span and frustration when things don't work quickly result in impulsive decisions and premature declarations of victory. Trump's unrealistic expectations have caused him to clash with foreign leaders and attempt to bypass due process in enforcing immigration laws. This pattern of impatience makes him an unreliable and weak negotiator, hindering the achievement of actual trade agreements.</p>
