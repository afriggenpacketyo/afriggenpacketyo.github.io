          <p>Premier Li Qiang has called on Jiangsu province, a key manufacturing hub in China, to enhance its efforts in technology, trade, and consumption to bolster the country’s economic growth. During a three-day visit, Li emphasized embracing innovative development, stimulating demand, fostering entrepreneurship, and deepening reform. Jiangsu, one of China’s most advanced manufacturing provinces, is tasked with stabilizing growth amid sluggish domestic demand and external pressures, such as increased U.S. tariffs, and Li highlighted the need to adopt AI and clean energy technologies to upgrade traditional industries. The premier’s statements come as China seeks to address economic challenges and maintain its growth trajectory. Optimism surrounds the nation's ability to improve its financial state.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in a trial that garnered significant public interest. The case, which involved a fervent TikTok following and multiple documentaries, centered on the circumstances surrounding O'Keefe's death in January 2022. Read's supporters, often seen wearing pink, believed she was framed by the police, while others saw the trial as a reflection of a flawed criminal justice system. The trial's frenzy was fueled by Read's ability to create a compelling narrative and engage with her supporters due to her ability to post bail, which allowed her to remain out of custody during the proceedings.</p>

Jarrín, along with player Kiké Hernández and María Valenzuela, daughter of former pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, have spoken out while the Dodgers organization has remained largely silent. The silence contrasts with the actions of other Los Angeles teams like Angel City FC and LAFC, who have openly supported the immigrant community.

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. has finalized a $14.1 billion deal to acquire United States Steel Corp. as a wholly owned subsidiary, a move that comes after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed his initial opposition. The acquisition will provide Japan's largest steelmaker with greater access to the U.S. market for high-grade steel. U.S. Steel will issue a golden share to the U.S. government, granting veto power over key management decisions. This development occurs amid ongoing discussions about tariffs and trade policies.

          <p>3D-printed guns are becoming more prevalent, raising concerns about their potential use by criminals and extremists. These untraceable firearms can be assembled using 3D printers, downloadable blueprints, and basic materials. BBC Trending's investigation found advertisements for guns on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram, some directing users to channels where weapons are sold. The technology has advanced, with models capable of firing multiple rounds, leading to fears that these guns could become the "weapon of choice" for individuals planning violence. The spread of information and blueprints online enables individuals to become DIY gunsmiths.</p>

          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog has requested international assistance in dismantling Iran's nuclear program, asserting that Iran was nearing the capability to build atomic weapons. Herzog stated that while Israel has not explicitly requested U.S. participation in its offensive against Iran, intervention from other nations would be welcomed. He also shared intelligence with the U.S. prior to the attacks, claiming it revealed Iran's intentions to develop nuclear weapons. The Israeli president suggested the conflict could destabilize Iran's regime and potentially resolve the conflict in Gaza, though analysts warn that U.S. involvement could escalate the situation.</p>

A new study indicates that the remaining "carbon budget" has shrunk to 130 billion tonnes. This reduction is due to continued record emissions and improvements in scientific estimates. The current rate of warming is about 0.27C per decade, and if emissions remain high, the planet is on track to reach 1.5C of warming around 2030, urging rapid and stringent emissions cuts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK due to their limited benefits relative to cost. These drugs are the first to slow the disease's progression, potentially giving patients more time living independently. NICE concluded that funding these drugs would be a poor use of taxpayer money and could lead to cuts in other essential services. While the drugs show promise, the cost and modest benefits have led to concerns about their overall value and impact on the healthcare system.</p>
