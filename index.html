          <p>The winning numbers for the estimated $700 million Powerball jackpot were drawn on Saturday night, revealing 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, and Powerball 18. This drawing marked the 36th consecutive round without a grand prize winner, pushing the jackpot to its highest point this year. Despite no top winner, the drawing produced several significant prizes, including a $2 million prize for a Tennessee player and two $1 million winners. Participants can choose between annual installments over 29 years or a lump-sum cash payment of $316.3 million before taxes. The game continues to engage players across 45 states, offering additional options like Power Play to multiply non-jackpot winnings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-1 defeat to the San Diego Padres, losing their lead in the National League West standings. Padres pitcher Nestor Cortes dominated, delivering six scoreless innings and retiring his first 16 batters, a stark contrast to Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow's struggles in the fourth inning. This loss marked the second consecutive night the Dodgers' offense was stifled, managing only two hits after recording just one hit the previous night. The series outcome has significantly shifted the division lead, with the Padres now holding a one-game advantage over the Dodgers, who appeared overmatched throughout the weekend.</p>

Despite a 2019 court order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador due to a "well-founded fear" of gang persecution, he was sent there in March, where he claims to have been tortured. After his return to the U.S. in June, he was charged with trafficking undocumented migrants, a charge his lawyers argue is vindictive. Following his recent release, immigration authorities have given him an ultimatum: accept a plea for deportation to Costa Rica or face removal to Uganda, a country he has no known ties to.</p>

          <p>Authorities in New Orleans have arrested a 26-year-old suspect for gross littering after surveillance footage captured him illegally dumping trash along a highway. This incident highlights a rising issue of illegal dumping, particularly of tires and other waste, near the Michoud Boulevard exit on Interstate 10. The installation of cameras by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has led to 81 citations for littering, with nearly half in New Orleans. The public has reacted positively to the arrest, expressing satisfaction that action is finally being taken against environmental disregard, which pollutes waterways, engenders wildlife, and lowers community health standards.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plummeted, shedding nearly $100 million in market value after the company unveiled a new logo that removes the traditional overall-clad man. This redesign is part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's broader strategy to modernize the 55-year-old chain, which she described as "not as relevant as we once were," through updated menus and store aesthetics. The rebrand has drawn criticism from conservative commentators who labeled it "woke," and marketing experts who warned of alienating long-time customers. While the company stated its values remain unchanged and "Uncle Herschel" will still feature in restaurants, the significant market reaction underscores investor concerns about the strategic direction and potential brand identity shifts.

The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed the test demonstrated the "superior combat capability" of the "improved" missile weapon systems, particularly their effectiveness against aerial targets. This missile test occurred amidst heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, following South Korea's military firing warning shots at North Korean troops who briefly crossed the Demilitarized Zone. The event also coincides with ongoing joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which Kim Jong Un has previously criticized as "hostile and confrontational."</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to overhaul its asylum appeals system by establishing a new independent body staffed by adjudicators, aiming to expedite case hearings and reduce reliance on hotels for asylum seekers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that while initial application decisions have improved, "unacceptable delays" persist in appeals, with 51,000 cases currently awaiting a decision, costing taxpayers for accommodation. The move comes amid increasing public and political pressure to end hotel use for migrants, with recent protests and a High Court ruling in Epping highlighting local frustrations. Ministers are committed to closing all asylum hotels in a "properly managed way," promising further details in the autumn to address the systemic challenges.</p>

This move is part of a Trump administration effort to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin, reversing a previous Biden administration authorization. The "review mechanism," reportedly developed by Elbridge Colby, also applies to British Storm Shadow missiles due to their reliance on US targeting data. While the White House stated no change in military posture, Trump previously called the decision to allow such strikes a mistake. This policy shift comes amidst broader efforts to control munitions to Ukraine as US stocks diminish.</p>

New York City secured the No. 4 spot, praised for its walkability, vibrant nightlife, diverse food scene, and rich culture, though affordability remains a significant concern for 46% of Gen Z respondents. Melbourne, Australia, ranked No. 2, was lauded as Australia's culture capital, with 77% of Gen Z describing it as diverse and inclusive, and 91% rating its quality of life highly.

          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system, celebrating its 10th anniversary, continues to be a popular avenue for public engagement, though its effectiveness in driving policy change is debated. While some petitions, like "Finn's Law" for police service animals, have directly led to legislative changes, many others, even those with millions of signatures, have not. The system allows backbench MPs to debate issues that gain over 100,000 signatures, but often results in ministerial speeches without concrete action. Critics argue the system provides an "illusion of a feedback loop" and is often treated as a joke, yet its chair defends it as a "bridge between the public and Parliament" that extends democracy beyond the ballot box.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing trend of "preventative botox," with young adults in their twenties and early thirties opting for anti-wrinkle injections to pre-empt the formation of lines. Sydney Brown, 25, began injections at 23, with her plastic surgeon mother performing the treatments, believing it helps her look less tired and may reduce the need for more invasive surgery later. While practitioners like Dr. Javed Hussain support this approach, arguing it slows aging by reducing muscle contraction, some experts like Nora Nugent, President of BAAPS, advise against starting too early, calling it a waste of money and cautioning against peer pressure. Concerns are also raised about potential complications from unscrupulous practitioners and the long-term effects of early, continuous use.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he would swiftly sign a contentious GOP redistricting bill after its passage by the state Senate, concluding a weeks-long standoff in the House. The Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw Texas's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to bolster the party's majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, a move supported by former President Trump. Democrats have vowed legal challenges, arguing the map undermines fair representation and dilutes minority voting power. The effort has sparked a nationwide debate, with California Governor Gavin Newsom introducing a counter-redistricting plan to "fight fire with fire" and prevent what he calls an attempt to rig future elections.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza killed at least 33 people, including those sheltering in tents and seeking food aid, as the world's leading authority on food crises declared famine in Gaza City. This rare pronouncement has intensified global pleas for Israel to halt its 22-month offensive, prompted by Hamas' October 7, 2023, attacks. Despite Israel's denouncement of the famine declaration and its claims of sufficient aid, UN and aid agencies report insufficient food reaching the population, with nearly half a million facing catastrophic hunger. Efforts for a ceasefire are on hold as Israel prepares for a wide-scale operation in Gaza City, a move many Israelis fear could endanger the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a move confirmed by senior defense officials without a stated reason. Democratic Senator Mark Warner criticized the decision, calling it another instance of the Trump administration treating intelligence as a loyalty test. The DIA had previously issued an assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities had set back Tehran's program by only months, contradicting President Trump's claim of "completely and totally obliterated" facilities. DIA employees were reportedly caught off guard and expressed widespread concern about the politicization of their work, with two other military officials also removed from their posts.</p>

          <p>The United States immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since Donald Trump took office in January, marking the first decline in over 50 years, according to a Pew Research Center study. The number dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June, with the foreign-born share of the labor force also decreasing. The study attributes this to various policy changes, including Joe Biden’s 2024 asylum restrictions and Trump’s 181 executive actions targeting immigration, alongside a declining survey response rate among immigrants. This significant shift reflects a period of intensified immigration enforcement and policy changes impacting immigrant communities nationwide.</p>

The French zoo, which closed in January ahead of a December law banning whales in shows, has been unable to agree with the government and activists on a new home for the orcas. Footage obtained by TideBreakers shows trainers stimulating the 11-year-old Keijo, a practice Marineland managers confirm is to relieve his sexual urges and prevent aggression. Activists express concern over the practice and the lack of progress in finding a suitable, safe environment for the captive orcas.</p>

This effort aims to understand the ancestry of the region's early inhabitants, supporting the claim of an independent urban civilization in southern India dating back to 580 BC, challenging previous narratives focused solely on the north. The reconstructed faces primarily show features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, suggesting global migration and population mixing.

Concurrently, the Kremlin's oil and gas revenue plunged 27% year-on-year in July, leading to widening budget deficits and a depletion of its National Wealth Fund.
