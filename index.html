          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is actively reviewing social media posts from military personnel related to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Several officers have already been suspended pending investigation into comments that appeared to mock or celebrate the killing. The situation presents a complex legal challenge, as officials must navigate the balance between service members' free speech rights and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which prohibits conduct that discredits the armed forces. The review highlights the tense political climate and its impact within the military.</p>

          <p>A suspect has been taken into custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's field office in Pittsburgh in what authorities described as a targeted attack. No injuries were reported in the early morning incident. The FBI stated that the individual, who is believed to have a history of mental health issues, had previously visited the office to file a complaint that was determined to not have a federal nexus. Investigators are still determining a motive for the attack on the federal facility.</p>

          <p>A resolution to censure Representative Ilhan Omar for her comments following the assassination of Charlie Kirk was narrowly blocked in the House. The measure failed after four Republican members voted with Democrats to table it, preventing a direct vote on the censure itself. The resolution, brought forward by Representative Nancy Mace, accused Omar of disparaging the conservative activist's legacy. This vote illustrates the deep political divisions and continued fallout surrounding Kirk's death and the subsequent reactions from public figures.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva declared that he has "no relationship" with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing a lack of communication and criticizing recently imposed tariffs. Lula described the 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as a political move that would ultimately harm American consumers by increasing prices. He contrasted the broken communication with the Trump administration against his positive relationships with previous U.S. presidents and other global leaders, highlighting significant diplomatic friction between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The CDC's vaccine advisory committee, ACIP, is set to hold a high-stakes meeting under intense political pressure and public scrutiny. This follows the replacement of its members with appointees who have previously questioned vaccine safety, raising concerns within the public health community. The panel is expected to vote on crucial recommendations for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, and MMRV vaccines. The outcome of the meeting is viewed as a critical indicator of whether scientific consensus or political ideology will guide the nation's future vaccination strategy.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has become the first sitting U.S. senator to publicly label Israel's military actions in Gaza as a genocide. In a statement, Sanders said the conclusion was "inescapable," citing the high number of civilian casualties and statements from Israeli officials as evidence of intent. This marks a significant evolution in his position on the conflict. He called for an immediate end to U.S. military aid to the Israeli government and urged for a ceasefire and a massive increase in humanitarian assistance.</p>

          <p>Florida is scheduled to carry out its 12th execution of 2025, setting a modern record for the state. David Pittman, convicted for the 1990 murders of his estranged wife's parents and sister, is set to receive a lethal injection. Governor Ron DeSantis has signed more death warrants this year than any of his predecessors, accelerating the pace of executions in the state. Pittman's final appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, based on claims of intellectual disability, were denied, clearing the way for the execution to proceed.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how recent Republican tax legislation is creating a more complex and inequitable tax code by introducing targeted loopholes for specific groups. Provisions like tax-free tips, deductions for overtime pay, and shelters for pass-through businesses result in people with similar incomes paying vastly different tax rates. The author argues that this approach erodes the overall tax base and leaves traditionally salaried, middle-class professionals to bear a more predictable and potentially disproportionate share of the tax burden.

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers star edge rusher Khalil Mack is expected to be placed on injured reserve after suffering a dislocated left elbow, sidelining him for at least four weeks. The injury occurred during the team's game against the Raiders. While the absence of a key defensive player is a significant blow, the diagnosis came as a relief to the team, as initial fears were for a season-ending injury. Younger players on the roster will now have to step into larger roles to compensate for his absence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, its first reduction since December, primarily due to concerns over a deteriorating labor market. Despite inflation remaining above the 2% target, recent data showing weak job gains has prompted the central bank to act to stimulate the economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the "downside risks to employment" have increased, shifting the bank's policy focus. The move aims to support job growth while navigating continued political pressure from the White House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large new study of nearly 34,000 veterans has found a link between taking nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, and a reduced risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers. The protective effect was most pronounced in individuals who had already been diagnosed with skin cancer, with some seeing a risk reduction of over 50%. Dermatologists are calling the findings significant, suggesting that the widely available, over-the-counter supplement should be more routinely recommended to patients as a secondary preventative measure against common skin cancers.</p>

The discovery was made by the team at Atlantic Wreck Salvage, who were able to positively identify the vessel by matching its unique features, such as a double drum trawl winch, with historical records. The find provides closure nearly a century after the maritime tragedy.</p>

          <p>A report from Bloomberg News has revealed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signed mortgage documents in 2007 agreeing to make two separate properties his "principal residence" at the same time. This is a similar action to the one President Trump has cited as potential mortgage fraud in his effort to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. While mortgage experts quoted in the report see no evidence of wrongdoing by Bessent, the revelation highlights a potential double standard within the administration's scrutiny of financial officials.</p>
