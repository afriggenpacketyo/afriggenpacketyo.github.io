          <p>A targeted act of violence at a Michigan church tragically left four people dead and eight injured during a Sunday morning worship service. The suspect, 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove into the church, opened fire with an assault rifle, and started a fire before being killed by police. Authorities are investigating the motive, with the FBI leading the case, which has also involved responding to additional bomb threats in the community. State and federal officials, including Governor Whitmer and President Trump, expressed condolences and condemned the violence, emphasizing the sanctity of places of worship and the need for peace and healing for all involved.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the reelection race, citing constant media speculation about his future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold campaign funds. His departure sets up a three-way contest between Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa, following a tumultuous year marked by a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration. Adams maintained he was "wrongfully charged" for fighting for the city. Political leaders acknowledged his service, while opponents linked his exit to broader political influence, particularly from Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Deliveries of China’s C919 narrowbody passenger jet to major domestic airlines appear to be falling behind schedule, according to company financial reports.

Market speculation suggests potential disruptions to the model's engine supply are causing these delays. The Shanghai-based manufacturer, Comac, aims to challenge Western giants in the aviation market but faces turbulence in its supply chain.</p>

          <p>The Village of Broadview has launched a criminal investigation after a CBS News Chicago reporter's truck was hit by a pepper ball fired by an ICE agent near a detention facility. Reporter Asal Rezaei stated she was alone with no active protest, and the chemical agent engulfed her truck, causing her to vomit. The incident, which occurred without verbal identification as press, has prompted the Broadview Police Chief to demand full cooperation from the Department of Homeland Security in their investigation.</p>

          <p>Team Europe clinched a hard-fought 15-13 victory over the United States in the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, New York, securing their first away win since 2012.

Tyrrell Hatton secured the winning half-point, while Shane Lowry's crucial birdie putt ensured Europe would at least retain the trophy. Captain Luke Donald solidified his legendary status by leading Europe to back-to-back home and away victories.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Joshua Cole, has been arrested by the FBI for allegedly threatening a local gay pride event in Abilene, referencing the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Cole reportedly commented on Facebook, "fk their parade" and expressed a desire to "pay them back for taking out Charlie Kirk." He admitted to owning a firearm and not believing the pride event should be allowed. Authorities consider the threats specific and not idle, leading to his detention due to prior criminal history and perceived danger to the community.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its windmills, will introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. This measure aims to control overtourism, as the small village with only 100 residents hosted 2.6 million visitors last year, leading to privacy infringements for residents. The fee will include museum and windmill access, with revenues intended for maintenance and infrastructure. Local businesses, however, fear a significant loss of shoppers due to the increased cost for families.</p>

          <p>Weight-loss injections, increasingly popular, are creating a two-tier system where access is largely determined by wealth, according to this article. While some are available on the NHS, strict criteria and a "postcode lottery" mean thousands miss out, with over 90% of users paying privately. With potential price hikes, concerns are rising that good health could become a luxury, exacerbating existing health inequalities where obesity rates are higher in deprived areas. Experts call for wider NHS access and addressing systemic issues in the food industry.</p>

          <p>The New York Mets' playoff aspirations ended with a 4-0 loss to the Miami Marlins, completing a stunning months-long collapse for the star-studded team. Despite holding the best record in MLB in mid-June with a $322.6 million payroll, a series of pitching woes and a 38-55 record in the second half led to their elimination. This marks a familiar outcome for Mets fans, reminiscent of past late-season failures, leaving the team to reflect on what star outfielder Juan Soto called a "failure" of a season.</p>
