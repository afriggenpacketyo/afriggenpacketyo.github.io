          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with its plan to create a National Garden of American Heroes, announcing a grant program through the National Endowment for the Humanities. The garden will feature life-size statues of 250 notable Americans, ranging from historical figures like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln to more contemporary individuals like Kobe Bryant and Julia Child. Artists who are American citizens can submit preliminary concepts for the statues, with selected artists receiving up to $200,000 per statue; the statues must be realistic in style, according to the executive order.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the U.S. government to expedite permits for companies to engage in seabed mining, both in U.S. territorial waters and international waters. This decision disregards a decades-old international treaty ratified by nearly every major coastal nation except the United States, likely causing controversy with both allies and rivals. The order instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to facilitate mining permits, positioning the U.S. as a leader in seabed mineral exploration and development.</p>

While the Department of Homeland Security claims "exigent circumstances" justified the warrantless arrest, Khalil's lawyers deny he posed a flight risk.

DNC Chair Ken Martin stated that no DNC officer should attempt to influence primary elections and announced plans to introduce reforms requiring party officers to remain neutral in Democratic primaries.

          <p>Intel CFO David Zinsner stated that President Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other countries have increased the likelihood of an economic slowdown and recession. Intel reported better-than-expected first-quarter results due to some customers stockpiling chips ahead of tariffs, but its revenue and profit guidance fell below expectations. Zinsner noted that the tariff environment makes it harder to predict Intel's performance and anticipates a potential shrinkage in the total market for its chips if consumers reduce spending on new computers.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that the cost of users adding polite phrases like "Please" and "Thank you" to chatbot prompts amounts to tens of millions of dollars. Every interaction with a chatbot incurs costs in terms of energy and server resources, and additional words increase these expenses. While the costs are significant, Altman suggests that maintaining politeness in interactions with AI is worthwhile.</p>

          <p>A review of "The Accountant 2" criticizes the film for subtracting everything that made the original 2016 movie enjoyable, turning smart fun into a dull and banal experience. Ben Affleck returns as Christian Wolff, but the sequel lacks the subtle humor, romance, and astute supporting characters of the first film. The reviewer finds the plot uninspired, the jokes clunky, and the action sequences generic, lamenting the transformation of the protagonist into a stereotypical action hero.</p>
