          <p>An executive who worked on "American Idol," Robin Kaye, and her husband Thomas Deluca were shot and killed in their Encino home. Los Angeles police have arrested a 22-year-old suspect in connection with the double homicide. Investigators believe the suspect entered the home through an unlocked door and was confronted by the couple when they returned, leading to the fatal shooting. A spokesperson for the show expressed devastation over the loss of Kaye, who had been a respected music supervisor for the program for over a decade.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, about half the force deployed there. The Pentagon stated the withdrawal was due to subsiding "lawlessness," which stemmed from protests against federal immigration enforcement actions. The initial deployment was contentious, with California Governor Gavin Newsom suing the administration, calling it an illegal power grab. Newsom is now calling for the remaining troops to be sent home as well.</p>

          <p>An NYPD drone captured four youths, including a 12-year-old, engaging in the dangerous act of "subway surfing" atop a moving express train in the Bronx. The drone team transmitted images to officers on the ground, who were able to stop the train and apprehend the minors. According to the NYPD, this incident marked the 200th subway surfing apprehension made by the drone team since its operations began in late 2023. The department credits the drone program with potentially saving hundreds of lives by intervening in such high-risk behavior.</p>

          <p>An article in the state-run People's Daily newspaper has urged China's local governments to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece argues that tailored local laws create a stable and open system for market entities to operate within the rule of law. Since 2015, legislative authority has been expanded to hundreds of Chinese cities, allowing them to draft laws on urban development, environmental protection, and heritage preservation. This reflects a shift from relying on top-down orders to using legal frameworks to manage economic issues.</p>

Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been lost due to warming waters and disease. The Honduran corals, adapted to tougher conditions, were brought to Miami labs to create a hybrid "Flonduran" species.

          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that U.S. inflation accelerated in June, rising 2.7% on an annual basis, the highest rate since February.

The data suggests that new tariffs may be starting to impact consumer prices, a possibility the Federal Reserve has been monitoring.

          <p>An independent review commissioned by the UK's Health Secretary has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." The goal is to avoid patient confusion and clarify their role, as they are not doctors. The review, led by Professor Gillian Leng, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges and states that associates should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns over patient safety and a lack of clarity about the responsibilities of these roles within the NHS.</p>

          <p>The iconic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major five-year renovation starting in 2027. The £50 million project will involve moving 1,300 tropical plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and repairing the 175-year-old iron structure, which has been damaged by the hot, humid conditions inside. A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with heat pumps. The ambitious project will require temporarily relocating some of Kew's most precious and ancient plant specimens.</p>

          <h2>Advertisement for Trip Drinks Banned Over Unauthorized Health Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an ad for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims, including that its products can "help you feel calm" and reduce stress. The watchdog found that claims about the "calming" effects of ingredients like magnesium, L-theanine, and ashwagandha were not on the official register of permitted health claims for food products. The ASA ruled that the ad implied the drink could reduce anxiety, a prohibited claim, and that it must not appear again in its current form.</p>

          <p>Former Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has sharply criticized former Prime Minister David Cameron's approach to the 2016 Brexit referendum, calling it "extremely cavalier." In a BBC podcast interview, Smith argued it was "unforgivable" that such a fundamental question was put to the public without a clear plan for either outcome, likening it to "some sort of Eton game." He stated that critical issues, like the Irish border, should have been foreseen and addressed, and that the failure to do so led to years of political disaster and polarization.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who was executed for assassinating President Park Chung-hee in 1979. The case re-examines whether Kim's act was treason or a patriotic effort to end a brutal dictatorship and restore democracy. Kim claimed he acted to prevent further bloodshed by Park's authoritarian regime, while prosecutors at the time argued it was a coup attempt. The retrial was granted after new evidence suggested Kim was tortured during the original investigation, raising questions about the legitimacy of his conviction.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, alleging he misled lenders about his primary residence to secure a cheaper mortgage. The claim is based on a Fannie Mae memo that noted "possible occupancy misrepresentation" but did not conclude a crime was committed. Schiff, a long-time political adversary of Trump, vehemently denied the allegation, calling it a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and an effort to distract from the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.</p>

          <p>According to media reports, President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a call if his forces could hit Moscow, to which Zelenskyy reportedly replied they could if given the weapons. The White House has pushed back, saying the comments were taken out of context. Later, when asked by journalists, Trump stated that Ukraine "shouldn't" target the Russian capital. The exchange comes as Trump has shifted his tone on the war, giving Russia a 50-day ultimatum to agree to a peace deal or face severe tariffs.</p>

          <p>A package of three cryptocurrency regulation bills, strongly endorsed by President Trump, failed to clear a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives. Thirteen Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the rule for debate, blocking the legislation from moving forward for now. The surprise failure is a setback for the crypto industry and a rare instance of House Republicans defying a direct request from Trump. One of the stalled bills was the "Genius Act," which aimed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins and had passed the Senate with bipartisan support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has struck down a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have prevented medical debt from appearing on consumer credit reports. The Biden-era policy was designed to stop healthcare expenses from negatively impacting credit scores, which affect access to loans and housing. The judge sided with credit unions who sued the agency, arguing the CFPB had overstepped its authority. Consumer advocates called the ruling a disappointing setback, while credit industry groups praised it for protecting the integrity of the lending system.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has seen a significant increase in officer-involved shootings this year, with 25 incidents so far, nearly equaling the 29 shootings recorded for all of 2024. This marks the highest total at this point in the year since 2018. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell attributed the rise in part to more suspects being armed with real or replica firearms, making threat assessment difficult for officers. The spike in police shootings is occurring even as the city's overall violent crime and homicide rates are dropping.</p>
