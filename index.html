          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have included numerous delays and cancellations. He attributes the problems to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, DOGE cuts at the FAA, and outdated technology. Schumer also questioned why Newark wasn't included in a bonus offered to air traffic controllers. The FAA acknowledged the issues, citing an antiquated air traffic control system and telecommunications equipment problems, with U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expected to release a plan to revamp the system this week.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of the State Supreme Court race, rejecting Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin's efforts to invalidate thousands of votes. Judge Richard E. Myers II ruled that discarding the challenged ballots would violate the constitutional due process rights of the voters. The ruling favors Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who won by 734 votes after two recounts. Griffin has seven days to appeal the decision, which election experts warn could set a precedent for future election challenges.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released after being detained during a citizenship interview, stated that President Trump "will not silence me." Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained under a rarely used law related to adverse foreign policy consequences due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. He denied allegations of antisemitism and argued his detention violated his First Amendment rights. Mahdawi's case, along with those of other student activists, has raised concerns about the Trump administration's approach to free speech and immigration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Treasury Department report indicates that the IRS has lost almost one-third of its tax auditors due to the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cost-cutting measures. The IRS lost 31% of its revenue agents who perform audits through March. Experts warn that this reduction could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, especially from wealthy taxpayers and corporations. The Treasury Department claims the Biden Administration grew the IRS too much and that these cuts are simply a roll back of wasteful hiring surges.</p>
