          <p>Chinese influencer Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu collaborated with Baidu to test AI-generated avatars for livestreaming on Baidu's e-commerce platform "Youxuan." The digital avatars, trained on five years of video data to mimic their human counterparts' style and jokes, engaged with viewers in real-time for over six hours, generating 55 million yuan ($7.65 million) in sales. This exceeded Luo's previous livestreaming attempt, which lasted four hours and resulted in fewer orders. Luo expressed astonishment at the success of the digital human effect, highlighting the potential of AI in the influencer marketing space. The performance suggests that AI avatars can effectively replicate and even enhance the persuasive capabilities of human influencers. The optimism score for this article reflects the positive implications of AI technology in the business sector.</p>

          <p>The skeletal remains of Mary Notarangelo, a 73-year-old retired police detective, were discovered inside her Glastonbury, Connecticut home seven months after she was reported missing. Notarangelo was last heard from in June 2024, and police conducted multiple searches of her home, but were unable to locate her due to the extreme hoarding conditions. An environmental services crew found her remains in February 2025 while removing piles of trash, using an excavator to clear debris from behind her front door. The home contained cages of dead birds, a live cat, and mice, with authorities describing the conditions as among the worst they had ever seen. The optimism score reflects the somber nature of the discovery and the tragic circumstances surrounding Notarangelo's death.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering a strike on Iran's nuclear site at Fordo, believing it is necessary to disable it due to the risk of weapons production. He approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, pending potential negotiations. The U.K. is engaging in active diplomacy to find a resolution. Iran has prepared missiles for strikes on U.S. bases if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign. The optimism score reflects the escalating tensions and potential for military conflict.</p>
