          <p>Kim Keon Hee, South Korea's former First Lady and spouse of the recently ousted President Yun Suk Yeol, has been formally indicted on multiple serious charges, including bribery, stock manipulation, and violating the Political Funds Act. This historic legal action, marking the first time a first lady in the nation faces such an indictment, is a central component of a broader investigation into former President Yoon's controversial martial law declaration last December, which plunged the country into political crisis. Prosecutors allege she improperly received polling data and luxury gifts, using her influence for political favors, claims her legal team strongly refutes as baseless. The unfolding legal proceedings could see her imprisoned for years if the charges are proven in court.</p>

          <p>Elderly Chinese survivors, often referred to as "comfort women," continue to face prolonged delays as they await judicial action on landmark lawsuits filed against the Japanese government. Eight survivors from Hunan province, now averaging 96 years old, are collectively demanding a formal apology and 2 million yuan (US$276,000) in compensation for each victim, highlighting the profound and lasting impact of their wartime suffering. Despite the significant historical importance of these cases, the provincial high courts in Shanxi and Hunan have neither responded nor provided any timeline for taking up the lawsuits. Their legal team stresses the critical urgency of securing both recognition and restitution for these plaintiffs before it is too late.</p>

          <p>Florida has carried out the execution of Curtis Windom, 59, for the 1992 triple murder of his girlfriend, her mother, and a man he alleged owed him money, making it the state's 11th execution this year. The lethal injection proceeded after his final appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was rejected, despite arguments about his mental health struggles. This event highlights the profound and often conflicting emotions of the victims' families, some of whom sought closure while others expressed continued love for Windom and campaigned against the execution. Governor Ron DeSantis has overseen numerous death warrants, contributing to Florida's leading execution rate nationwide.</p>

The match was an emotional ordeal, publicly revealing her struggle with a recently remade serve, which led to seven double faults in the first set. Gauff managed to reset during a medical timeout, practicing her serve and drawing inspiration from the presence of Simone Biles in the stands.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets presented a mixed picture on Friday, diverging from Wall Street's performance as investors carefully assessed a range of regional economic data and significant political developments. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix experienced slight declines after Tokyo's core consumer prices showed a slower increase in August, though still exceeding the Bank of Japan's 2% target. South Korea's Kospi also registered a loss following reports of former First Lady Kim Keon Hee's indictment on corruption charges, which contributed to a weakening of the South Korean won. Additionally, the article highlights the upcoming meeting between India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, indicating potential bilateral discussions.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially terminated its de minimis tariff exemption for low-value items shipped from abroad, effective Friday, meaning all goods entering the country are now subject to duties. This significant policy shift, which abolishes an exemption that had been in place since 1938, aims to counteract the massive increase in duty-free imports, which critics argued harmed U.S. retailers, allowed unchecked potentially unsafe items, and facilitated drug smuggling. The new regulations introduce flat duty options for postal service shippers during a six-month transition period. This change has already led dozens of foreign postal companies across various continents to suspend parcel shipping to the U.S., citing a lack of adequate time to implement the necessary procedural adjustments.</p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a staunch appointee of President Donald Trump, has submitted a second criminal referral to the Department of Justice targeting Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook.

The action intensifies the ongoing political battle, as President Trump is actively attempting to remove Cook from her position at the central bank, with Pulte serving as a prominent critic of the Fed's current interest rate policies. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, has already initiated a lawsuit to legally block her unprecedented dismissal.</p>

Officials confirmed that Westman, whose mother previously worked at the school, had attended the institution and left a note, though a definitive motive may never be fully known.

          <p>Sean Charles Dunn, a former Department of Justice employee, has been charged with misdemeanor assault for throwing a "Subway" sandwich at a federal Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington, D.C. This reduced charge follows repeated failures by prosecutors to persuade a grand jury to indict him on a felony assault charge, a rare occurrence for DOJ prosecutors. The incident, during which Dunn allegedly yelled obscenities at federal officers deployed by President Trump to address local crime, resulted in his immediate termination from the DOJ. This case, alongside another recent instance where a grand jury balked at a felony indictment, underscores the challenges prosecutors face in securing convictions for alleged assaults on federal law enforcement personnel.</p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, he publicly advocated for unproven treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, and disseminated conspiratorial theories regarding the virus's origins. His selection, following the contentious firing of Dr. Susan Monarez, has sparked considerable criticism among healthcare professionals who express deep concern for the agency's scientific integrity and the future of its vaccine recommendations.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, continues its struggle to secure full Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding for crucial rebuilding efforts, including $34 million for sewage and stormwater system upgrades. Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich describes a constant battle with FEMA, which has denied requests for increased funds due to rising costs and has previously tried to claw back money. The ongoing disputes highlight FEMA's bureaucratic challenges and broader issues within the agency, including staff reductions and a review council established by President Trump, as other Katrina relief projects across the Gulf Coast also remain unfinished. The city remains cautiously optimistic about eventual funding, despite the protracted process.</p>

The blaze, which originated on the winery's property, continues to pose a significant threat to hundreds of buildings and numerous vineyards in the region. While the official cause remains under investigation by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, a source familiar with the discussions indicates the possibility of discarded ashes as the spark, though the winery denies any controlled burns took place. This ongoing inquiry underscores the extreme vulnerability of California's renowned wine country to wildfires and the intense scrutiny surrounding their origins and potential liabilities.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is implementing a significant change to its "customer of size" policy, which will no longer guarantee refunds for extra seats purchased by plus-size travelers, effective January 27. This policy alteration, part of broader operational updates preparing for assigned seating next year, has been widely criticized as "heartbreaking" by advocates who argue it will create substantial financial burdens and accessibility barriers. Previously, Southwest was unique in offering guaranteed refunds if an open seat was available, a policy cherished for promoting dignity and easing travel anxiety. Critics contend this reversal, potentially driven by corporate financial cutbacks, undermines the airline's long-standing reputation for inclusivity and disproportionately impacts plus-size passengers.</p>

This revised account raises further international condemnation and allegations of potential violations of international law, as Israel's narrative of the incident has evolved, with the IDF stating it targeted a Hamas camera without providing evidence.
