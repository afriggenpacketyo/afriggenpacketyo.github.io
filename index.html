          <p>During a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, President Trump warned House Republicans not to "f--- around with Medicaid" as he urged them to pass a major tax bill. The movement on the tax bill has been hampered by some Republicans who want cuts to the Medicaid health-care coverage program, which covers primarily low-income people. Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program cover nearly 80 million Americans, making it a significant part of the healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced plans to significantly scale back his political spending, stating he doesn't currently see a reason to invest in politics after contributing at least $277 million to Republican causes in the 2024 cycle. Speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk didn't entirely rule out future political spending, saying he would consider it if he saw a reason. He has faced scrutiny for his leadership in government cuts as part of his informal role overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency. The article also mentions benefits for Musk's companies, including Starlink's approval for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the reaction in Ukraine to President Trump appearing to step back from efforts to end the war with Russia. Ukrainians expressed disappointment but also a sense of resignation, emphasizing the need to rely on themselves and their allies. Many Ukrainians believe that Russia is using diplomatic negotiations as a cover for intensified attacks, with the situation in combat zones worsening. Despite the disappointment, Ukraine aims to prevent a further fracturing of its relationship with the United States, and President Zelensky has sent a letter to Mr. Trump outlining a proposal for a free-trade agreement.</p>

          <p>This New York Times news analysis discusses how President Putin has maintained his approach to negotiating a comprehensive peace deal while continuing to wage war in Ukraine. While he has withstood pressure for an immediate cease-fire, his push for normalizing relations with the United States appears uncertain. President Trump emphasized that American economic rapprochement with Russia would come after peace in Ukraine, which could delay Russia's chances of relief from Western sanctions. Despite this, the Kremlin said that the war in Ukraine had been just one of the issues discussed by Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump, and that the leaders remained committed to a broader reset.</p>

McPhail added that keeping prices stable could also help its business and that it's a great opportunity for the company to take market share.

It also tells the stories of attorneys who have advocated for clergy abuse survivors after the New Orleans church faced so many clerical molestation claims that it filed for federal bankruptcy protection.

Breaches included the lack of an emergency plan or a risk assessment, and the only warning signs related to shallow water, despite depths reaching 4.67m.

          <p>Ahmed Ebid, an Egyptian fisherman based in the UK, has been jailed for 25 years for helping smuggle more than 3,000 migrants into Europe. Ebid was involved in smuggling nearly 3,800 people from North Africa to Italy, with some making their way to Britain. The court heard that Ebid bribed officials and ordered threats of violence towards the migrants as part of a £12 million operation. He admitted facilitating illegal immigration to the EU but disputed the importance of his role. Ebid had described himself on Facebook as "Captain Ahmed" and notebooks in his home included Mediterranean Sea navigational details and lists of payments related to crossings.</p>

          <p>Potential ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia are in the spotlight after a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said Ukraine and Russia would "immediately" begin negotiations towards a ceasefire, but Putin was more reserved. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is open to further talks with Moscow, but has rejected demands to withdraw troops from four regions partially occupied by Russia. Trump has vowed to bring the war to a swift end by engaging directly with Putin, a goal which has proven elusive.</p>

          <p>Ryanair has ordered some flight attendants in Spain to repay salary increases of up to €3,000 following a legal dispute with their union. A pay rise had been agreed with the Spanish union, CCOO, and it applied to all flight attendants regardless of what union they belonged to. Union Sindical Obrera won a court case in March to nullify the deal. Ryanair has written to Union Sindical Obrera to say it will be informing its members how much they owe. The airline has told the affected flight attendants "that the money will be simply deducted from the payslip until the debt is paid".</p>

It criticizes the Democrats for prioritizing party unity over addressing legitimate concerns about Biden's health and for failing to articulate a clear vision beyond opposition to Trump.
