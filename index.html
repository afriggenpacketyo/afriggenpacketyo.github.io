        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temperatures across the UK are predicted to climb to 30C (86F) on Thursday, with the potential for the first heatwave of 2025 to be declared by the weekend. The heat is attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where temperatures could reach nearly 40C in parts of France and Spain. According to the Met Office, a heatwave is declared when threshold temperatures are met for at least three consecutive days, varying from 25C in the north and west to 28C in eastern England. A Met Office study also indicates a rapidly increasing risk of 40C temperatures in the UK, with a 50:50 chance within the next 12 years. </p>

          <p>The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran presents significant security and economic challenges for Pakistan, particularly in the restive Balochistan province which shares a border with Iran. The closure of border crossings has already disrupted trade, and further escalation could exacerbate separatist movements and strain Pakistan's security apparatus. Economically, the conflict threatens to disrupt global oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz, potentially leading to soaring energy prices and deepening Pakistan's existing fiscal crisis. Sectarian tensions within Pakistan, a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with a significant Shiite population, could also be inflamed by the conflict.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits decreased to 245,000 last week, remaining near historically low levels, according to the Labor Department. While weekly claims serve as a proxy for layoffs and have remained stable, recent weeks have seen claims at the higher end of the range, suggesting a potential slowdown in the US job market. Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on imports, is contributing to economic concerns among businesses and consumers. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current interest rates, wary of the inflationary pressures potentially fueled by these tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

French police are struggling to intercept these boats, which launch from hidden locations and cruise along the coastline, collecting migrants out of reach of law enforcement. While the French government intends to revise rules to allow police to intervene more forcefully, officers fear legal repercussions if they cause drownings. This new method gives smugglers more control but can disadvantage women and children who struggle to board the boats.</p>
