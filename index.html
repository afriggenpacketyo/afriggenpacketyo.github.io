        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to public pressure and misinformation concerns, the UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued interim guidance encouraging forces to consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases. The move aims to enhance transparency and counter false narratives, particularly those that spread rapidly on social media. While the government supports the change, some critics, including former officers, warn it could create an expectation for disclosure in every case and potentially fuel more speculation or social unrest. The decision to release such details will ultimately remain with individual police forces, balancing public interest with the need for a fair trial.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has released its 2024 Human Rights Report, which features significant changes in its assessment of various countries, reflecting the Trump administration's foreign policy priorities. The report softens criticism of allies like Israel and El Salvador while increasing scrutiny of Brazil and South Africa, with whom Washington has had disagreements. It also introduces new sections on "Western values" and omits previous focuses on LGBTQ+ rights. Human rights organizations have criticized the report, which was delayed for months, for being politically motivated and mischaracterizing or omitting well-documented abuses to align with an "America First" agenda.</p>

          <p>The recent killing of Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif in an Israeli airstrike has drawn international condemnation and highlighted the severe restrictions on reporting from the Gaza Strip. The Israeli Defense Forces claimed al-Sharif was a "terrorist," an allegation dismissed by the UN and press freedom organizations as part of a smear campaign. With foreign journalists largely barred from entering Gaza independently, the international media relies heavily on local Palestinian reporters who face immense danger. This incident underscores the ongoing blockade of information and the risks journalists undertake to cover the conflict and its humanitarian toll.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent announced a 15% year-on-year increase in its second-quarter revenue, reaching $25.7 billion, largely propelled by strong performance in its domestic gaming division and strategic investments in artificial intelligence. The company's domestic games revenue grew 17%, boosted by popular titles like "Honor of Kings" and the new release "Delta Force." Tencent also significantly increased its capital expenditures by 119% to invest in AI upgrades across its advertising, gaming, and social media platforms. The positive results reflect the company's focus on leveraging AI to enhance its core services and drive future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Musk had threatened legal action, alleging Apple made it impossible for other apps, like his own X and Grok, to compete. The dispute marks another chapter in the ongoing rivalry between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who co-founded the company before their relationship soured. While Apple announced a partnership with ChatGPT, it maintains that its app rankings and features are based on objective criteria, not preferential treatment.</p>

Authorities have issued urgent evacuation warnings, anticipating the Mendenhall River will crest at a new record high. This annual event, exacerbated by a retreating glacier due to climate change, has caused significant damage in recent years, destroying homes and property. In preparation, officials have installed temporary barriers to protect hundreds of homes, but the long-term threat of these increasingly severe outburst floods remains a major concern for the community.</p>

          <p>Polish prosecutors have indicted a group of six individuals, including three Polish and three Belarusian citizens, on charges of sabotage allegedly commissioned by foreign intelligence services. The charges stem from an investigation into a Ukrainian citizen previously jailed for planning sabotage for Russia. The group is accused of activities aimed at creating public unrest, including arson attacks on a storage facility and a warehouse. This development comes as Poland, a key hub for aid to Ukraine, continues to assert it is a prime target for disruptive operations by Russia and Belarus.</p>

          <p>Leaked text messages and emails from the Upper Guadalupe River Authority (UGRA) reveal significant confusion and a delayed understanding of the severity of the deadly Fourth of July flood in Kerr County, Texas. The communications show officials were initially unaware of the unfolding tragedy at Camp Mystic, where numerous children and a UGRA board member died. The documents also highlight prior knowledge of flood risks and a decision not to pursue a $1 million grant for a warning system due to cost-sharing requirements. The revelations raise serious questions about the agency's preparedness and response to a disaster that claimed over 130 lives.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding is a dangerous falsehood that prioritizes fossil fuel industry interests over public health and safety. The author contends that eliminating the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles and power plants will worsen the climate crisis, leading to more destructive weather events. The piece refutes the EPA's claim that the rule change will save consumers money, stating that the long-term costs of climate-related disasters far outweigh any short-term savings on products.

The author suggests that a united front from the U.S. and its European allies, emphasizing a "halt the fighting first" approach, is crucial. For a ceasefire to be effective, it must include strict enforcement mechanisms like international monitors and snap-back sanctions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "dog," one of the most common in the English language, has a surprisingly mysterious origin that linguists have yet to definitively solve. Before the 1500s, the standard term was "hound," derived from the Old English "hund." The word "dog" appeared over a millennium ago, often as an insult, but its etymological roots are unclear, with theories linking it to Old English words for color or strength. The shift from "hound" to "dog" illustrates how language evolves, as the affectionate bond between humans and their canine companions likely repurposed the term into the beloved standard we use today.</p>

Housing advocates and experts criticize the approach, arguing it criminalizes homelessness without addressing the root causes, such as the lack of available shelter beds and affordable housing.

          <p>A new study has resolved a long-standing genetic mystery about the origin of the potato, revealing it was born from an ancient interbreeding event between the ancestors of tomatoes and another plant group called Etuberosum. This hybridization, which occurred around 9 million years ago, uniquely combined genes that allowed the new plant lineage to grow tubers. This evolutionary development happened at a perfect time, enabling the potato to thrive in the newly forming high-altitude habitats of the Andes. The research not only clarifies the potato's family tree but could also help in breeding more resilient varieties in the future.</p>

          <p>Offering a good pep talk is a valuable life skill that doesn't always require giving advice, according to authors and comedians Josh Linden and Paula Skaggs. The key is to be specific, listen to what the person truly needs, and validate their feelings. Effective encouragement can be for small, everyday challenges, not just major life events. Sometimes, the best approach is simply to bear witness to someone's struggle and remind them of truths they already know, showing support without trying to solve their problems. Even a simple, heartfelt message can provide a meaningful boost of courage and motivation.</p>

          <p>Four years after the collapse of property giant Evergrande triggered a massive debt crisis in China, millions of homebuyers are still suffering the consequences. Many who prepaid for their homes are stranded, with construction projects frozen or developers delivering "barely liveable" properties that lack basic utilities and fail safety inspections. The situation highlights the long-lasting shadow of the housing market crash, which has left countless families in severe financial distress and stuck in unfinished or substandard homes. The crisis continues to be a source of significant social and economic strain across the country.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals the profound and often overlooked impacts of climate change on maternal and child health, exposing tens of millions to severe risks. Extreme heat, air pollution from fossil fuels, and malnutrition from crop failures are linked to higher rates of preterm births, stillbirths, and infant mortality, particularly in the world's poorest regions. The research indicates that one billion children are already at "extremely high risk" from environmental shocks. While the crisis is already severe, the report emphasizes that solutions like improving public health infrastructure and implementing climate adaptation plans can save lives now.</p>

          <p>The White House has tempered expectations for the upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, describing the meeting as a "listening exercise" rather than a forum for a definitive peace deal. This shift in tone comes as Russia intensifies its military offensive in Ukraine, likely to gain leverage, and as European allies express concern that Trump might push Ukraine into territorial concessions. The administration's comments suggest an acknowledgement of the complexities and the low probability of a major breakthrough, positioning the summit as an initial step to gauge the Russian leader's intentions regarding the war.</p>

          <p>Beijing has announced it is cutting all ties with Czech President Petr Pavel after he met with the Dalai Lama during a personal visit to India. China's foreign ministry stated it "strongly deplores and firmly opposes" the meeting, which it considers a serious provocation, and has ceased all engagement with President Pavel directly. The meeting was the first time a sitting Czech president had met with the Tibetan spiritual leader. This diplomatic freeze marks a significant escalation in tensions, as China continues to react strongly against any official contact with the Dalai Lama by foreign governments.</p>

          <p>France, Germany, and the U.K. have informed the United Nations that they are prepared to trigger "snapback" sanctions against Iran if it fails to resume diplomatic talks over its nuclear program. This mechanism, part of the original 2015 nuclear deal, would automatically reimpose all U.N. sanctions. The warning comes two months after Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and as Iran enriches uranium to its highest levels ever.

This specific criticism of a key ally is part of a broader shift in the report's focus under the Trump administration, which human rights groups have condemned as politically motivated.

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding the use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology by providing 10 new surveillance vans to seven police forces across England. The technology, which scans faces in public and checks them against wanted lists, is intended to help locate suspects for serious crimes. The government points to its success in London, where it led to 580 arrests in a year. However, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have called the expansion alarming and a move toward a "total surveillance society," raising concerns about privacy and the lack of a specific legal framework.</p>

          <p>Over 15% of local councils in the UK have reduced the temperature of their public swimming pools in the last five years, with the majority citing soaring energy costs as the primary reason. A BBC investigation found that 39 councils had lowered temperatures, though none went below the recommended guidelines. While councils state these are necessary cost-saving measures, some swimmers, particularly those with health conditions like muscular dystrophy, say the colder water has made it impossible for them to continue using the pools for essential exercise, negatively impacting their health and well-being.</p>
