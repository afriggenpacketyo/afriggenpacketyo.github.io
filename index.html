          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that Israeli strikes impacted two centrifuge facilities in Iran, specifically the TESA Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Center. These sites, previously under IAEA monitoring as part of the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), were involved in manufacturing and testing centrifuge components. The IAEA stated that one building at the Tehran site, used for advanced centrifuge rotor production, was hit, while two buildings at Karaj, where different centrifuge components were made, were destroyed. The strikes raise concerns about potential disruptions to Iran's nuclear program and regional stability. </p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable rocket, signaling its entry into the space sector with plans for a suborbital launch by 2029. The prototype, six meters tall, achieved an altitude of nearly 300 meters and landed close to its designated spot during the test in Hokkaido, Japan. Honda aims to utilize technologies from its existing products and automated driving systems to develop reusable rockets for satellite launches and environmental monitoring. The move positions Honda among other companies, like SpaceX, in the growing field of reusable rocket technology.</p>

          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are creatively altering products to qualify for lower duty rates, a practice known as "tariff engineering." This involves changing materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into different harmonized system codes. For example, companies add cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry, or fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles to categorize them as slippers. While legal, this practice is easier for sectors like garments and footwear than heavily regulated industries like aerospace or automotive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.K. Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions in England and Wales, marking the biggest reform to British abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The new legislation prevents women from being investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies, regardless of the term. This change addresses situations where women have ended pregnancies outside of clinical settings, such as by purchasing pills online. The law does not change rules governing abortions in clinical settings and still needs approval in the House of Lords.</p>

This 20-foot-long, 30,000-pound bomb can penetrate 200 feet into a target before exploding, making it capable of damaging Iran's Fordo facility. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, the only platform capable of delivering the GBU-57, would take 15 hours to reach Iran from its base in Missouri.

          <p>The U.S. and European Union are facing difficulties in reaching a trade deal due to several sticking points, including big tech regulation and taxation. The EU's regulation of tech companies has drawn criticism from the U.S., while disagreements over value-added taxes persist. A broader issue is the lack of trust and alignment on negotiations, with the U.S. seeking concessions and the EU favoring a more traditional reciprocal approach. The failure to reach a deal could result in increased tariffs between the two regions. (not investment advice)</p>
