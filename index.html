          <p>Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by majority decision, winning their trilogy series of fights at Madison Square Garden. The bout followed two previous encounters, both won by Taylor, with this final match solidifying her dominance. The atmosphere was electric, with strong support for both the Irish champion and the Puerto Rican challenger. Despite a hard-fought contest with aggressive exchanges, two of the three judges scored the fight in favor of Taylor, who celebrated the victory emphatically.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations in Qatar for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release are on the brink of failure, according to Palestinian officials. Key disagreements persist over the mechanisms for humanitarian aid distribution and the extent of Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza. Palestinian sources accuse the Israeli delegation of stalling the talks to manage diplomatic appearances during Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to Washington. Mediators warn that without significant US pressure for concessions, the talks could break down entirely, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Jane Ragsdale, the well-known owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls, was among those killed in the catastrophic floods in Kerrville, Texas. Ragsdale, who had run the camp for decades, was a beloved and influential figure in the community, remembered for her generosity, leadership, and dedication to educating young women. While her camp was between sessions, she was the sole fatality at that location. Friends and community leaders are mourning the loss of a person they describe as embodying the spirit of the region.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests the growing alignment between some US tech leaders and the 'Make America Great Again' movement could create an uneasy alliance, particularly regarding China policy. While many tech figures backing former President Trump advocate for continued pressure to contain China's technological development, internal tensions could undermine these efforts. Chinese scholars observe this trend, questioning whether tech leaders will shift from their traditional stances to a more aggressive, interventionist posture, potentially escalating threats against China.</p>

A separate, larger blaze, the White Sage Fire, is burning north of the park, also prompting evacuations.

This action starved the engines of fuel, leading to a total power loss from which the aircraft could not recover in its 40 seconds of flight.

          <p>A mother in central Gaza has shared her grief after an Israeli airstrike killed two of her young sons and her teenage niece as they waited for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic. The strike, which killed 16 people in total, occurred before the clinic opened. The Israeli military stated it targeted a "Hamas terrorist" and that the incident was under review. The family's tragedy highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where shortages of food and medicine force civilians to risk their lives seeking basic necessities.</p>

          <p>King Charles convened his first "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and activists to celebrate his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a fire ceremony and discussions centered on the interconnectedness of all life and the wisdom of pre-industrial cultures. The King's long-held belief system, which advocates for sustainable practices and rejects consumer culture, was the central theme. The gathering aimed to translate these philosophical ideas into practical, positive action for a more sustainable future.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle the historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague is facing significant public and expert criticism. The authority argues a new, wider bridge with a third track is necessary to handle projected growth in rail traffic. However, a coalition of architects and preservationists, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, insists the iconic steel structure can and should be repaired in place. The debate highlights the classic conflict between modern infrastructure needs and the preservation of a city's architectural heritage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 employees, including 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, as part of a large-scale reorganization under the Trump administration. The cuts are part of a plan to reduce the department's U.S. workforce by about 15% and consolidate numerous offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the move undermines national security by weakening the diplomatic corps. The layoffs heavily impacted bureaus focused on refugees, human rights, and foreign assistance, such as the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.</p>

The OBR warned of "daunting" risks and unsustainable debt levels, while recent figures showed a dip in economic growth. This combination puts pressure on the government to make tough fiscal decisions, with analysts predicting potential tax increases of £10bn to £20bn to stabilize the public finances and maintain borrowing limits.

The analysis in this article suggests the outcome will depend on who better manages the pressure of the occasion.
