          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a decisive eight-wicket victory over India in a rain-affected One-Day International at Lord's, leveling the series at one game apiece. After the match was shortened to 29 overs per side, India struggled to a score of 144-8. England successfully chased a revised target of 115 from 24 overs with 18 balls to spare, thanks to a strong performance from Amy Jones, who finished with 46 not out. The series will now be decided in the final match on Tuesday at Chester-le-Street.</p>

          <h2>Trump Calls for Release of Epstein Files While Labeling Proponents 'Troublemakers'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has called for the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein but also disparaged those demanding transparency as 'troublemakers' and 'radical left lunatics.' This article explores the context of his statement, noting that a former federal prosecutor believes the testimony may not reveal significant new information due to the limited nature of grand jury proceedings. The analysis suggests that prosecutors typically present a minimal amount of evidence to secure an indictment, meaning the unsealed documents might not satisfy public curiosity or quell conspiracy theories surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>A potential transfer of Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford to Barcelona has advanced, with an agreement in principle reportedly reached for an initial loan with an option to buy. Rashford has been seeking a new challenge and has been training separately from the main squad under United's new head coach. For Manchester United, the move would provide significant salary relief, aiding their efforts to fund new signings. Barcelona's sporting director has previously expressed admiration for Rashford, who himself has spoken positively about the prospect of playing for the Spanish club.</p>

          <p>A government report has concluded that the collapse of a five-story apartment building in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers, was an avoidable tragedy. The investigation revealed multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and the ignoring of serious structural defects that were known for up to a year before the incident. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that red flags were continually raised, with one safety officer even resigning in protest, yet work continued. The government is now calling for criminal accountability for those found negligent.</p>

          <p>A pregnant woman called into "The Ramsey Show" for financial advice, revealing that her family struggles to afford groceries despite her husband's $156,000 salary due to his spending of up to $700 per month on tobacco and marijuana. She expressed hesitation to pay off a car loan, fearing the freed-up cash would also be consumed by his habits. Host Dave Ramsey urged the caller to address the situation as a potential addiction rather than a simple budgeting problem, suggesting that more serious interventions and financial boundaries may be necessary to ensure the family's well-being and stability.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise faster than initially anticipated. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings, reporting that his knee feels great. While the original timeline suggested a six-week absence, manager Dave Roberts is now optimistic about a much sooner return. Muncy's recovery is crucial for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly since their slugging infielder was placed on the injured list.</p>

The ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting in front of a large home crowd. The team was upgraded from silver after the original winners, the United States, were disqualified due to a 2008 doping confession from team member Antonio Pettigrew.

          <p>Russia has launched another major air assault across Ukraine, striking ten different regions and killing at least three people in the Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa areas. President Zelenskyy stated that over 340 drones and 35 missiles were deployed in the overnight attack. While Ukraine's military reported intercepting the majority of the projectiles, strikes still caused significant damage to residential buildings and critical infrastructure, particularly in the cities of Pavlohrad and Sumy. The attacks underscore Ukraine's urgent and continuous need for enhanced air defense systems from its international allies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government, under the direction of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has reportedly revoked the visas of eight Brazilian supreme court judges, escalating a campaign in support of former president Jair Bolsonaro. This action is viewed as a response to the court's investigation into Bolsonaro's alleged coup attempt. The move has been denounced by Brazil's President Lula da Silva as unacceptable interference in the country's sovereignty and justice system. This follows other pressure tactics, including President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.</p>

          <p>The recent week in financial markets saw positive momentum, driven by a combination of strong corporate earnings and signs of moderating inflation. The June Consumer Price Index met expectations, though persistently high shelter costs remain a concern for the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, wholesale inflation, measured by the Producer Price Index, came in slightly below forecasts, suggesting price pressures may be easing. While the impact of tariffs is still being monitored, the overall economic data supports the market's belief that the Fed will likely hold interest rates steady in the near term.

          <p>A federal filing reveals that Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This designation is typically for firms majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and can provide preferential access to federal contracts. The filing was made shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box on the form was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, asserting the company never applied for or received any federal benefits.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential chaos that would unfold if President Trump were to attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Legal experts assert that a president cannot remove a Fed chair without establishing "cause," a high legal bar that would almost certainly trigger a prolonged court battle and significant market uncertainty. Such an unprecedented move would threaten the central bank's political independence, which is crucial for economic stability. It could also backfire by increasing inflation fears and driving up long-term interest rates, contrary to the president's stated goals. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that a more effective strategy for success is to find the intersection of what you are good at and what can be profitable. Galloway shares his own journey, where he abandoned his passion for athletics to pursue business, ultimately finding success through his skills in entrepreneurship. The article suggests that enduring rejection and being open to pivoting are more crucial to building a successful career than blindly following a passion.</p>
