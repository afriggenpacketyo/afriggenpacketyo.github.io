            <p>An article by Kenan Malik discusses the complexities of viewpoint diversity in universities, highlighting the contradictions within Donald Trump's demands for Harvard University to hire faculty based on political views while simultaneously insisting on abolishing ideological litmus tests in admissions. Malik argues that Trump's approach is a form of social engineering that undermines scholarly objectivity. The author suggests that while viewpoint diversity is important, imposing political identities and using political beliefs as criteria for recruitment can exacerbate the problem it seeks to solve, potentially creating a more fragmented and Balkanized academic environment.</p>
