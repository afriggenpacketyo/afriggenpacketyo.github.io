          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded directives in Washington, D.C., that limited cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents. This move reverses the city's "sanctuary" policies, allowing the Metropolitan Police Department to fully assist agencies like ICE. The directive also appoints the head of the DEA as an emergency police chief, giving the federal government direct control over the city's law enforcement for a 30-day period. D.C. officials, including the mayor and the city's attorney general, have challenged the legality of Bondi's order, arguing it is an unlawful overreach of federal power.</p>

          <p>The conclusion of the national security trial for 77-year-old Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and newspaper founder Jimmy Lai has been delayed after his lawyer reported he was experiencing heart palpitations. The judges postponed the final arguments until Monday to allow Lai to receive medical treatment first. Lai faces charges of colluding with foreign forces and could be sentenced to life in prison in a landmark case widely seen as a test of press freedom and judicial independence in Hong Kong. His detention has drawn international concern, with groups like Reporters Without Borders highlighting his deteriorating health after over 1,680 days in custody.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of losing momentum in July, as key data for retail sales and industrial output fell short of analyst expectations. Retail sales grew by 3.7% from a year earlier, a slowdown from June and below the forecasted 4.6%, indicating persistent weak domestic demand. Industrial output also grew at its weakest pace since last November, while fixed-asset investment slowed, with the property investment slump worsening. Officials attributed the performance to a challenging external environment and extreme weather, though analysts also point to the effects of policies aimed at curbing excess production capacity.

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after the discovery and removal of 177 World War Two-era bombs buried beneath it. The first device was found by a worker installing new equipment in January, leading to a specialist ordnance disposal team being called in. The bombs, which were practice devices that still carried a charge, were found carefully stacked in rows. It is believed they were deliberately buried after the war, possibly by soldiers from a nearby ordnance depot, at a time when health and safety standards were far less stringent.</p>

Many young men feel that nobody truly knows them and that society is indifferent to their well-being, which correlates with an increase in misogynistic beliefs. The article argues that men must take responsibility for changing this narrative by moving away from an identity based on "domination" and toward one based on community and care. It suggests that cultivating deeper friendships and creating offline "third spaces" are crucial steps to shatter the self-imposed walls of isolation.</p>

At least two people were exposed to the powder, but officials stated there was no remaining threat to the public or employees.

          <p>The hastily arranged summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, has brought international attention to the sparsely populated state, sparking a mix of hope and apprehension among its residents. While some, like the state's governor, view the face-to-face meeting as a necessary step toward peace, others express deep concern that Trump is legitimizing an international criminal and may make concessions at Ukraine's expense. The one-on-one nature of the meeting, excluding Ukrainian President Zelensky, has drawn particular criticism.

The recommendations now suggest that individuals with systolic blood pressure in the 130-139 range should start with lifestyle changes, and begin medication if there is no improvement after three to six months. A significant change from previous advice is the new recommendation to forgo alcohol entirely, citing mounting evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure.

          <p>Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, has written to the prime minister to request the authority to appoint party members to the House of Lords. Farage argues that his party's significant vote share in the last general election and recent local election successes warrant representation in the upper chamber. He pointed out a "democratic disparity," noting that parties with fewer votes and MPs, such as the Liberal Democrats and Green Party, currently have peers while Reform UK has none. While prime ministers have the discretion to make such appointments, there is no constitutional requirement to do so for opposition parties.</p>

He may also appeal to Trump's transactional nature by offering incentives like new arms control pacts or joint economic projects.

          <p>Shares of Guangzhou Innogen Pharmaceutical Group surged in their Hong Kong trading debut, opening at nearly four times their initial public offering price. The successful IPO reflects strong investor demand for China's pharmaceutical sector, particularly for companies developing anti-obesity drugs. Innogen's chairman highlighted the significant unmet clinical demand and commercial opportunities for the company's metabolic drugs. The strong performance is part of a broader rally for biotech companies in Hong Kong, which have seen valuations rise significantly throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old man in a quiet Van Nuys neighborhood was arrested after tormenting residents for two months by blaring a large train horn he had affixed to a tree in his backyard. Police had previously visited the man, Gary Boyadzhyan, who described the disruptive blasts as a "cry for help" related to personal and legal issues. Despite promising officers he would stop, he sounded the horn again hours later, leading to his arrest on suspicion of disturbing the peace. Neighbors had expressed a mixture of annoyance at the window-rattling noise and concern for the man's well-being.</p>

          <p>Instagram users are expressing frustration after their accounts were erroneously suspended by parent company Meta, often for alleged breaches of child sexual exploitation rules. Many users have lost access to personal photos and seen their businesses disrupted, with little recourse or explanation from the company. While Meta has acknowledged some issues with Facebook Groups, it has not admitted to a wider problem, though it has often reinstated accounts after being contacted by the media. Users suspect the platform's AI moderation tools are unfairly banning people, with appeals also being handled by automated systems.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities. The runway-independent aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of standard warships, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. This technological breakthrough could effectively transform any destroyer or frigate in the Chinese navy into a miniature aircraft carrier, significantly expanding its aerial operational range. The project team claims the drone is far superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in use, representing a major advance in military hardware.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Teresa Youngblut, the 21-year-old woman accused of murdering a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont in January. A grand jury indicted Youngblut on a murder charge for the fatal shooting of Agent David Maland during a traffic stop. Authorities allege that Youngblut opened fire on agents, leading to a shootout that also resulted in the death of her companion. The Justice Department stated it will not stand for such attacks on law enforcement, and authorities have reportedly linked the incident to a radical cult-like group.</p>

          <p>Families in the Los Angeles immigrant community are experiencing heightened fear and uncertainty as the new school year starts, due to an increase in federal immigration enforcement actions. Some undocumented parents are reportedly hesitant to send their children to school, fearing separation. The Los Angeles Unified School District, where one in five students is part of an immigrant family, has established "safe zones" around 100 schools to monitor for federal activity. The concerns follow several recent incidents, including the mistaken detention of a 15-year-old student near his high school, prompting calls for limits on enforcement near educational institutions.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state to move to in the U.S. for 2025. The state scored poorly across several key metrics, including affordability, safety, economic strength, education, and healthcare access. Oregon was specifically cited as the third-worst state for affordability and among the most vulnerable to environmental risks like wildfires and drought. The ranking suggests that Oregon faces significant challenges in attracting and retaining residents compared to top-ranked states like Utah and New Hampshire.</p>

          <p>Police in Serbia used tear gas against anti-government protesters in Belgrade and Novi Sad as demonstrations against President Aleksandar Vucic's government continued. In Novi Sad, protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling party, leading to clashes and arrests. The violence is the latest escalation in months of student-led protests, initially sparked by a deadly infrastructure collapse blamed on corruption, which have since grown to demand early elections. President Vucic has accused the protesters of inciting violence, while EU and UN officials have expressed deep concern over the government's repressive response to the demonstrations.</p>
