          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, identified as O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico despite expressing fears for his safety. The judge, Brian Murphy, criticized the government's handling of the case, noting that O.C.G. is gay and feared persecution in Guatemala, and had been raped and held captive in Mexico. The judge found that the deportation lacked due process and ordered the government to investigate how it claimed O.C.G. did not fear deportation, after a Department of Homeland Security official cited a software tool as the source of the statement. This ruling adds to a series of court findings against the Trump administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>This New York Times Op-Doc presents a short documentary about Kim Lalonde, a carnival worker in Quebec who dreams of pursuing other passions but hesitates to leave the close-knit carnival community and his best friend.

Director Isabelle Grignon-Francke captures the lives of individuals seeking escape and hope within the vibrant, yet transient, environment of amusement parks and fairgrounds. The piece delves into the complexities of kinship, new possibilities, and the universal human experience of dreaming of a different life.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi, an Iranian director previously imprisoned and banned from filmmaking, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his film *It Was Just an Accident*, a revenge thriller critical of oppressive regimes. Panahi, who was cheered as he urged fellow Iranians to set aside their differences and problems, called for freedom in Iran and for an end to restrictions on personal expression. The film, shot in secret and based on Panahi's prison experiences, tells the story of ordinary Iranians confronting a man they believe tortured them. Despite the risk of prosecution, Panahi vowed to return to Tehran after the festival.</p>

          <p>Singer Billy Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition involving the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid. The condition, exacerbated by recent performances, has led to problems with hearing, vision, and balance. Joel is undergoing physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during his recovery. NPH, typically seen in older adults, can cause gait issues, urinary incontinence, and cognitive difficulties, and is often mistaken for dementia, but can be treated with a surgical procedure called shunting to regulate fluid in the brain.</p>

          <p>Russian aerial attacks across Ukraine have resulted in at least 13 deaths and 56 injuries since Friday, with Kyiv being targeted by 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, stating that the world is increasingly certain that Moscow is prolonging the war. The overnight barrage damaged homes, businesses, schools, and a clinic, and occurred as Russia and Ukraine participate in prisoner swaps. Zelenskyy called for additional sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy to push Moscow toward a ceasefire, while also announcing the return of 307 Ukrainian prisoners as part of an exchange deal with the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza after weeks of blockade, humanitarian agencies warn of imminent famine due to insufficient supplies and logistical challenges. Although hundreds of trucks of food and medical supplies are ready, movement to distribution points is slow, obstructed by security clearance delays, damaged roads, and lack of fuel. International organizations like UNRWA and WFP are struggling to provide essential aid to the population of approximately 2 million, with the situation exacerbated by looting and high food prices. The FAO projects that the entire population in Gaza will face crisis or worse acute food insecurity by September 2025, with a risk of famine in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. The outage, affecting approximately 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas, was attributed to arson at an electricity substation and damage to an electricity pylon. Despite the disruption, organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an alternative power supply. French authorities have launched investigations into the suspected sabotage.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller "It Was Just an Accident" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant victory for the Iranian director who had been banned from leaving Iran for over 15 years. Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who was imprisoned in Iran three years ago, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. The win extends Neon's streak of backing the last six Palme d'Or winners. The closing ceremony followed a major power outage in southeastern France, suspected to be arson, but power was restored hours before the event.</p>

Fetterman said he feels unfairly shamed into fulfilling senatorial duties and attributes his absenteeism to a decision to spend more time at home. He believes his openness about mental health has been "weaponized" against him, leading to unflattering reports and questions about his ability to perform his job, which he largely blames his decision to speak out two years ago about his mental health struggles.</p>

          <p>French authorities have determined that a power outage in Cannes, which briefly disrupted the film festival, was caused by acts of sabotage, including arson at a substation and damage to a transmission tower.
