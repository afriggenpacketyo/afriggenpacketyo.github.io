          <p>The Justice Department has initiated an investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This probe comes after charges against current New York City Mayor Eric Adams were dropped, adding political complexity as both Adams and Cuomo are vying for the mayoral position. Cuomo's spokesperson claims the former governor testified truthfully and views the investigation as politically motivated lawfare and election interference. The investigation's timing raises questions about its potential impact on the upcoming mayoral primary. </p>

Authorities have arrested a maintenance worker accused of aiding the inmates' escape, and the sheriff's office has suspended three workers amid an internal investigation.

This initiative aligns with the Trump administration's focus on immigration integrity and addresses concerns about the industry's impact on the immigration system.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve COVID vaccines for adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions this fall, but may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. This decision marks a shift from the previous policy of recommending annual COVID shots for everyone aged 6 months and older. Some experts worry that the new criteria are overly restrictive and will deny access to people who want to be vaccinated, while others support the agency's rationale. The agency anticipates the need for new clinical trials in which participants under 65 are randomly assigned to receive the new shots or a placebo. </p>

          <h2>Review Urges Universities to Prevent Student Suicides</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 20:52:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review commissioned by the Department for Education in England urges universities to enhance efforts to prevent student suicides. The report, examining 169 cases, recommends safety checks of student halls, discouragement of tributes at suicide locations, and improved support for struggling students. Families should also be more involved in investigations. While some students feel supported by university staff, the review highlights the need for better access to mental health services. The family of Natasha Abrahart, who died by suicide in 2018, criticizes the review as superficial and calls for a legal duty of care for universities. </p>

          <p>Japan's export growth slowed for a second consecutive month, according to recent government data, as the country grapples with the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Export growth was 2%, the slowest since October of the previous year. The country's imports also shrank, but less than anticipated. Japan is currently subject to a 25% levy on auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S. and faces baseline tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on most trade partners. </p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed his chief spokesman to lead a review of the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The review aims to ensure accountability among senior military officials for the chaotic operation. The selection of a chief spokesman to lead the inquiry is unusual, reflecting skepticism about the military holding itself accountable. The review's scope is narrow, likely excluding decisions leading up to the withdrawal, such as the deal made with the Taliban in 2020. </p>

Kira Tiller, who has epileptic seizures, advocated for accommodations after realizing the lack of emergency plans impacted many disabled students.
