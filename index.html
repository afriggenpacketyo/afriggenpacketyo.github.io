          <p>A devastating fire has significantly damaged the Clayborn Temple in Memphis, a landmark deeply connected to the US civil rights movement and Martin Luther King Jr. The temple served as the headquarters for the 1968 sanitation workers' strike and was designated a national treasure in 2018. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the fire, which has prompted widespread grief and calls for restoration. Memphis Mayor Paul Young emphasized the temple's importance as a symbol of struggle, hope, and triumph, vowing to rebuild and honor its legacy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) against National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts, abandoning a proposed $2.25 million settlement for harmed borrowers.

This increase aligns with a broader trend among S&P 500 companies, where security costs for top executives are rising due to heightened threats.

          <p>Democrats in Congress are warning that cuts to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), orchestrated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will be "catastrophic" for workers' rights. The DOGE has targeted the NLRB for cuts and ended leases in several states, prompting concerns that the agency's enforcement mechanisms will be rendered ineffective. This comes amid existing understaffing and budget constraints at the NLRB, raising fears about the protection of workers' rights.</p>
