          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that doctors will soon be advised against prescribing Tylenol to pregnant women, citing a disputed connection to autism. Medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, have strongly refuted the claim, emphasizing that acetaminophen is considered the safest pain reliever for expectant mothers. The administration, alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., plans to issue a physician's notice and initiate a label change, despite conflicting scientific studies on the matter. This move has been criticized by organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as not being supported by the full body of scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>Algerian writer Kamel Daoud, now living under police protection in France, has released his latest novel, "Houris," which explores the massacres of the Algerian civil war in the 1990s. The book, which won the prestigious Prix Goncourt, is banned in Algeria, where discussing the war is legally forbidden, and has resulted in international arrest warrants being issued against him. Daoud's novel focuses on a female protagonist to highlight the disproportionate suffering of women during the conflict, a perspective that has drawn criticism and accusations of Islamophobia. He continues to write despite the danger, following in the footsteps of his friend and fellow author Boualem Sansal, who was recently imprisoned in Algeria.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is returning to ABC after a brief suspension, a move widely seen as a response to a significant public relations backlash against the network and its parent company, Disney. Kimmel was suspended for comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which were deemed insensitive and inaccurate. The suspension drew widespread criticism from free speech advocates, celebrities, and even FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's initial pressure was walked back. This article argues that ABC's reversal was inevitable to mitigate the damage to its reputation, positioning Kimmel as the victor in a debacle that has tarnished the image of Disney and its executives.</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, a 10% increase from the previous year, despite policy rollbacks by the Trump administration. A report from Zero Carbon Analytics indicates that the sector maintains strong momentum, with low-carbon energy expected to attract about $2.2 trillion this year, double the investment in fossil fuels. The analysis also found that major corporations are continuing to pursue their net-zero commitments, with companies representing 70% of top global revenue actively working on climate plans. While progress is evident, the report stresses that both countries and companies must accelerate their actions to bridge the gap between climate aspirations and implementation.

The German luxury carmaker has significantly reduced its profit margin forecast for 2025 due to US import tariffs, a slowdown in the Chinese luxury market, and the slower-than-expected adoption of electric mobility. This strategic shift reflects broader difficulties for European auto manufacturers who are facing intense competition from Chinese EV brands and a sluggish economy. The decision marks a notable slowdown in Porsche's electrification strategy, a decade after unveiling its first electric concept car. (not investment advice)</p>

Elements like direct, long-ball play, the use of a tall striker, and a heavy emphasis on set-pieces are becoming more common, moving away from the possession-based game that has recently dominated. Allardyce reflects on being "ahead of the game" with methods like watching from the stands for a better tactical overview, which coaches like PSG's Luis Enrique now use.

The suspect, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, was initially arrested on local charges and released on bail before being re-arrested by the FBI on federal charges, including interfering with a radio communications station. A handwritten note found references FBI officials and Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting a possible motive, which remains under investigation. The incident has been condemned by officials, including California's governor, as an attack on democracy and the free press.</p>

          <h2>Kamala Harris Memoir Details Key Moments from Her Presidential Campaign</h2>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reflects on her brief presidential campaign, arguing that more time and less interference from then-President Biden's staff could have led to a different outcome. The book details several key moments, including a distracting pre-debate phone call from Biden about rumors she was bad-mouthing him. Harris also reveals that her first choice for a running mate was Pete Buttigieg, and she describes Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as having an "unrealistic expectation" for the role of vice president. She also reflects on a significant gaffe during an appearance on "The View," which she admits was a "gift to the Trump campaign."</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Sean "Diddy" Combs are requesting a sentence of no more than 14 months for his conviction on prostitution-related charges, which would result in his immediate release. In a submission to a federal judge, they argue that Combs has been sufficiently punished, citing the destruction of his career, reputation, and businesses during his 13 months in a notorious jail. The filing details the harrowing conditions of his incarceration, including an alleged threat from another inmate with a shiv, and the "devastating consequences" for his family. Combs was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges, which his lawyers argue should heavily influence the judge's sentencing decision on October 3.</p>

          <p>Alaa Abdel Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist, has been released from prison in Egypt after nearly six years of imprisonment. He was pardoned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi following a request from the National Council for Human Rights. Abdel Fattah, a key figure in the 2011 uprising, was sentenced to five years in 2019 for "spreading false news." His release follows a long campaign by his family, including an extensive hunger strike by his mother, and widespread international pressure from human rights groups and the UK government. He has been reunited with his family, though it remains unclear if he will be permitted to travel to the UK.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Europe is struggling to define its foreign policy towards China, having lost the predictable guidance of a strong transatlantic relationship. The potential for a Trump presidency creates uncertainty, as he may bully Europe on China policy while not offering reciprocal support on issues like Ukraine. The article outlines Europe's dilemmas, including how to handle Chinese green technology, trade protectionism, and influence in the Global South. It concludes that with China prioritizing its strategic partnership with Russia over its relationship with Europe, and the US becoming an unreliable ally, Europe is left in a precarious position without any easy solutions.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian, a prominent academic at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, is urging China to develop its own unique knowledge system for foreign relations, distinct from dominant Western theories. In an interview with People's Daily, he argued that such a system is strategically necessary to more effectively explain China's global role and foreign policy to the world. This call for "intellectual autonomy" aligns with Beijing's Global Governance Initiative, which promotes a multipolar world order. The argument posits that for too long, international relations have been interpreted solely through a Western lens, and a China-centric framework is needed to articulate its own perspective.</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old Washington, D.C. man has been arrested on federal charges after allegedly shining a laser pointer at the presidential helicopter, Marine One, while President Trump was on board. According to a Secret Service affidavit, the suspect, Jacob Samuel Winkler, aimed the laser at the aircraft as it flew overhead, creating a potential risk of collision by disorienting the pilot. The felony charge of aiming a laser at an aircraft carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. After his arrest, Winkler reportedly made statements suggesting he should apologize to the president, and told investigators he did not know it was illegal to point the laser at Marine One.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes Stephen Miller's eulogy for Charlie Kirk, describing it as a "battle cry" that distills the pure ideology of the Trump administration. The author argues that Miller's speech framed the political landscape as a Manichean struggle between the absolute good of Trump's supporters and the pure evil of their opponents, who he claimed are "nothing." The piece contrasts Miller's rhetoric of destruction with Barack Obama's eulogy after the Charleston church shooting, which focused on forgiveness and reconciliation. The author concludes that Miller's speech reveals an administration whose instinct is to use tragedy as a pretext to delegitimize and seek revenge on its political foes.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne is creating a new ITV drama titled "The Hack," which will chronicle the UK's phone hacking scandal. The series stars David Tennant as the Guardian reporter Nick Davies, who was instrumental in exposing the illegal practices at the News of the World tabloid. Thorne praised the "remarkable" work of the journalists who held their own industry to account, noting that the story goes beyond bad behavior to reveal a troubling relationship between the press, police, and politicians. The drama, made by the same team behind "Mr Bates vs The Post Office," aims to uncover the detailed complexities of the scandal from the perspectives of both the journalist and a police detective.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes China's decision to reject stripped-down versions of Nvidia's advanced AI chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The author argues that by ordering tech companies to halt purchases of these chips, Beijing is signaling a major shift from technological dependence to a determined push for self-reliance. Accepting the less powerful chips would have been seen as accepting a U.S.-dictated technological inferiority. The U.S. policy, intended as a compromise, instead strengthened the case within China for indigenous innovation, turning what was once a distant goal into a national strategic necessity.</p>
