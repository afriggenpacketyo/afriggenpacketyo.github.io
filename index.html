          <p>A worldwide movement to protect children online, exemplified by the U.K.'s Online Safety Act, is compelling tech companies to implement stricter age verification and content filtering systems. This regulatory pressure has fueled the development of AI-powered safety technologies, such as Yoti's facial age estimation software, which is being adopted by platforms like Pornhub, Spotify, and X. While these measures aim to shield minors from harmful material, they have also sparked significant debate regarding user privacy and data security, creating a new marketplace for digital identity and safety service providers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has blocked Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials from attending the UN General Assembly by revoking their visas. The U.S. cited actions undermining peace efforts, a decision praised by Israel but criticized by the Palestinian Authority as a violation of the UN Headquarters Agreement. This move comes as international efforts, led by France, are underway to recognize a Palestinian state, which the current U.S. administration opposes, further heightening diplomatic tensions over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's recent struggles, highlighted by a Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town, are being linked to the rigid tactical system of manager Ruben Amorim. This article analyzes how his 5-2-3 positional play, which relies on creating numerical overloads, is often neutralized by opponents using man-to-man marking. The system's lack of encouragement for individual dribbling and player roaming makes United's attacks predictable and vulnerable, raising questions about whether Amorim needs to adapt his methods for the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the world's most sanctioned nations, North Korea has significantly increased its wine imports from China. In the first seven months of 2025, the country purchased over 157,000 liters of Chinese wine, more than double the volume from the previous year, making it China's second-largest wine buyer by volume. This trend highlights North Korea's heavy reliance on China for consumer goods, as alcohol is not included on the United Nations' list of banned luxury items.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean—have set a new world record for the fastest non-stop, unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean. They completed the 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia in just over 139 days, beating the previous record by more than 20 days. The trio endured severe storms, with one brother being swept overboard and rescued, and have raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar, demonstrating remarkable endurance and resilience.</p>

          <p>Randy "Duke" Cunningham, who was a highly decorated Navy flying ace in the Vietnam War before serving eight terms in Congress, has died at 83. His political career ended in a major scandal when he pleaded guilty in 2005 to accepting $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors, for which he served over seven years in prison. Cunningham's case was one of the largest bribery scandals in congressional history and ultimately led to the creation of the Office of Congressional Ethics.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile section of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. The scenic route, which provides access to popular hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, required $7.9 million in repairs to fix collapsed pavement, rock slides, and drainage systems. While the reopening is celebrated by the local hiking community for improving access, it coincides with heightened fire danger warnings for the area.</p>
