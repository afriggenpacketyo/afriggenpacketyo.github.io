          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 12:28:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is defending his decision to hold a national inquiry into grooming gangs, a reversal from his previous stance where he accused those calling for one of "jumping on a far right bandwagon." The inquiry, led by Dame Louise Casey, aims to create a "national reset" on the issue, urging officials to be open to scrutiny and change. Starmer explained that his initial comments were directed at politicians who had previously failed to act on the issue while in power. The inquiry will investigate the ethnicity of perpetrators and the role of public officials, ensuring no stone is left unturned in addressing child sexual abuse, and Baroness Casey also stressed the importance of charging adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 with the most serious charge of sexual assault. The optimism score is based on the fact that the inquiry will investigate the ethnicity of perpetrators and the role of public officials, ensuring no stone is left unturned in addressing child sexual abuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing new cost cuts due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making break-even operating margins this year unlikely, according to CEO Joanna Geraghty. The airline will cut off-peak flights, trim unprofitable routes, and pause plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets. Geraghty noted that the company is relying on borrowed cash to maintain operations, expressing hope for a rebound in demand and bookings. The carrier is also assessing its hiring plans and could combine some leadership roles and rein in travel spending.

          <p>After five years of military rule under General Assimi Goita, Mali faces ongoing challenges, including increasing jihadist attacks and restrictions on political freedoms. Despite the initial justification for the coup being improved security, terrorism has intensified and spread to new regions, and the fight against Islamist rebels is stalled. Political parties have been dissolved, and opposition voices face increasing threats, raising concerns about dictatorial rule and suppression of free speech. While some observers note improvements in addressing corruption, the economy struggles, and education initiatives suffer due to Western countries suspending their work amid increasing Russian involvement. The optimism score is based on the fact that Mali is in control of its territory.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt on the rise, this article outlines steps to mitigate the damage caused by late payments. At 30 days late, making the minimum payment promptly and contacting the credit card company to request a waiver of the late fee can help avoid credit score damage. At 60 days late, it is advised to reach out to the creditor again, consider balance transfers or personal loans, and aggressively track the budget. At 90 days late, it is important to contact a credit counselor, explore debt settlement, and understand rights regarding debt collectors.

          <p>In Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial, Judge Arun Subramanian warned both the defense and prosecution about violating the courtâ€™s sealing order after information about a private proceeding was leaked. The judge emphasized that any further violations could result in contempt charges, holding lead counsel personally responsible for their teams' conduct. Juror No. 6 was dismissed due to inconsistencies in residency statements, and Combs' legal team's request for a mistrial based on the juror's ethnicity was denied. The U.S. Attorney's Office is open to further questioning of a second juror due to possible communications with a former colleague regarding jury service.

          <p>Republicans are proposing to eliminate economic hardship and unemployment deferments for federal student loan borrowers, potentially leading more people to default on their loans. These deferments allow borrowers to pause monthly payments during periods of joblessness or financial setbacks, often without accruing interest.

While Israel's strikes have targeted Khamenei's inner circle, experts note that Iran's clerical regime has a structured process for leadership succession. Even if the entire theocratic system were to collapse, it would not guarantee a more favorable government, and internal tensions are more likely to cause a regime to fall.

          <p>A $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family over the opioid crisis has garnered support from 55 attorneys general across the country. The settlement aims to end the Sacklers' control of Purdue and prevent them from selling opioids in the U.S., with funds distributed over 15 years to compensate victims and combat the opioid crisis. Purdue stated the settlement funds will be used to "compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives." The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids.

          <h2>Voltage Surge Causes Blackout in Spain and Portugal</h2>

          <p>A report released by Spanish investigators revealed that a power surge caused a hours-long blackout on the Iberian peninsula in late April. Spanish Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen attributed the blackout to a combination of technical faults and planning issues, with the problem originating from a "voltage surge" in southern Spain. The power system was experiencing "insufficient voltage control capacity," partly due to a programming error, leading to a chain reaction of protective shutdowns. There were no indications of a cyberattack causing the blackout. The optimism score is based on the fact that the blackout was not caused by a cyberattack.</p>

The company has already replaced artificial dyes in some products, such as Kraft Mac & Cheese, and some products, such as Heinz Tomato Ketchup, have never contained dyes. This decision aligns with a push from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to eliminate artificial dyes from the nation's food supply. The FDA is also working to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026 through voluntary efforts from the food industry.

          <p>Germany has recorded a new high in Islamophobic incidents, with 3,080 cases of attacks and discrimination documented in 2024, a 60% increase from the previous year, according to a report by the organization Claim. On average, more than eight incidents occurred per day, with verbal attacks making up the largest share. The report also registered an increase in severe offenses, including killings and cases of bodily harm. Claim noted that anti-Muslim incidents surged after Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, mirroring a rise in antisemitic incidents. The optimism score is based on the fact that the report highlights a rise in not only the number of incidents but also in the normalization, escalation, and brutality of anti-Muslim racism.</p>

          <p>R. Kelly was reportedly rushed to a hospital after medically overdosing in prison, according to new court documents filed by his lawyers. The 58-year-old allegedly collapsed at the federal correctional institute in Butner, North Carolina, and was transported to Duke University hospital. Kelly's lawyers allege he had been placed in solitary confinement and given medication by prison staff, and they requested a temporary furlough to home detention. Federal prosecutors have opposed this request, labeling Kelly a "prolific child molester" who has never taken responsibility for his actions.

          <p>President Donald Trump said his early departure from the Group of Seven summit was owed to "much bigger" things than planning a ceasefire between Tel Aviv and Tehran, after urging people to "immediately evacuate Tehran." The conflict also prompted a joint statement from G7 leaders, affirming support for Israel, while calling for a resolution to the escalating tensions in the Middle East. Trump's latest social media post was in response to French President Emmanuel Macron's comments on Monday that Trump had made an offer for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. In their joint statement, leaders of the world's largest advanced economies called for a resolution to the "Iranian crisis" and a "broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza."</p>

          <p>Following President Donald Trump's early departure from the G7 summit to address the Israel-Iran conflict, political analyst Catherine ClÃ¼ver Ashbrook discussed Trump's options for handling the situation. Despite Trump's denial of seeking a ceasefire, he signed a G7 statement urging resolution of the Iranian crisis. Ashbrook noted that Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is preparing for talks with Iranian leaders to address Iran's nuclear program. She also suggested that Trump might be considering providing B2 bomber support to Israel, potentially as part of a strategy to encourage Iran to negotiate. The question remains whether Israel's campaign is solely aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear capabilities or if it intends to pursue regime change. The optimism score is based on the fact that the US and Iran had been pursing nuclear talks in the run-up to Israel's attacks.</p>

This agreement signals that Trump could potentially block the company from relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh or transferring jobs outside the U.S. The golden share, described as "perpetual" by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also prevents U.S. Steel from changing its name without Trump's approval. The president has the authority to appoint one of the corporate board's independent directors and can veto the other two choices.
