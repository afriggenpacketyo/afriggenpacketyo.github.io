          <h2>Trump Considers Reopening and Expanding Alcatraz Prison</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 14:30:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has suggested reopening and significantly expanding Alcatraz prison, citing concerns about violent offenders. He envisions it as a symbol of law, order, and justice, directing federal agencies to assess the proposal. Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, currently serves as a popular tourist destination managed by the National Park Service. Trump's proposal faces practical and financial hurdles, with critics questioning the feasibility of repurposing the island and the need for such a facility given existing prison infrastructure. The suggestion also follows Trump's previous calls to send accused gang members to foreign prisons without due process.</p>

          <p>Soybean and corn farmers in Iowa are facing increased economic uncertainty due to high costs, low crop prices, and the impact of trade tariffs. President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports have led to retaliatory taxes on U.S. goods, affecting the agricultural sector. Farmers are drawing parallels to the 1980s farm crisis, with concerns about loan defaults and equipment replacement. Despite these challenges, many farmers remain optimistic that President Trump will provide support, while also acknowledging the need for a safety net to protect family farms.</p>
