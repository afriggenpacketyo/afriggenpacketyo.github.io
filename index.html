        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consolidating credit card debt this June could be a smart move, as credit card interest rates are likely to remain high, while rates on alternatives like home equity borrowing products could fall further. The average credit card interest rate is around 21%, and with the Federal Reserve unlikely to issue a rate cut in June, these rates are expected to stay elevated. Consolidating with a HELOC or a debt consolidation personal loan can save on interest costs and allow for larger payments toward the principal. The article recommends speaking with a financial advisor to build a personalized debt consolidation plan. (not investment advice)</p>
