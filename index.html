          <p>A SkyWest pilot performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 bomber during landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the military aircraft was not communicated by the control tower, which lacks radar, leading to the surprise encounter. The FAA, Air Force, and the airline are all investigating the incident, which occurred over the North Dakota State Fair where the B-52 was performing a pre-approved flyover. The airline confirmed all 76 passengers and four crew members landed safely.</p>

          <p>Following the death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Bill Cosby shared his memories of his former on-screen son in an interview. Cosby described Warner, who played Theo Huxtable, as a consummate professional with whom he maintained a close, mentor-like relationship long after the show concluded. Warner, 54, tragically drowned in Costa Rica during a family vacation. The article notes Cosby's own history of sexual assault accusations and his overturned conviction.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from cutting Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood. The defunding measure was part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" signed into law by the president. Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the law likely unconstitutionally punishes Planned Parenthood affiliates that do not perform abortions, causing potential irreparable harm to patients who rely on their non-abortion services. The administration is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs have a potential positive side effect. It suggests the tariffs are compelling nations like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers and protectionist policies. The piece posits that by exposing this hypocrisy, the tariffs could spur significant domestic economic reforms that ultimately boost global commerce. The author notes that progress is being seen in Canada and China, while the EU's focus may be shifting elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Epstein accuser Annie Farmer is urging the government to release all information related to the case, stating that if there is "nothing to hide," the files should be made public. In a BBC interview, she expressed exhaustion over the case's politicization and her feeling of being "used" in media cycles that yield few results. Farmer remains skeptical of the Trump administration's handling of the files, citing the president's past association with Epstein and the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey. She emphasized that real crimes were committed and victims are still seeking answers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has removed a Wall Street Journal reporter from the press pool for the president's trip to Scotland. This action is viewed as retaliation for the newspaper's recent article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, which prompted a $10 billion libel lawsuit from the president. The White House Correspondents’ Association condemned the move as an attempt to punish a media outlet for unfavorable coverage, calling it a defiance of the First Amendment. The administration asserted its authority to control press pool access, a shift from the previous tradition of the WHCA managing it.</p>

These old shells provide an ideal surface for new baby oysters to grow, which in turn helps filter the water, prevent erosion, and create habitats for hundreds of other species.

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, resulting in slightly shorter days and prompting discussions about an unprecedented timekeeping adjustment. This acceleration, caused by factors like atmospheric changes and the planet's liquid core, could eventually require the removal of a second—a "negative leap second"—from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep atomic clocks synchronized with Earth's rotation. While climate change-induced ice melt is currently counteracting this effect by slowing the spin, the trend has raised concerns about potential disruptions to computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise time.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's unprecedented and aggressive approach toward the federal judiciary, which some legal experts describe as a significant assault on the separation of powers. The president's frequent use of executive orders has led to numerous legal challenges and nationwide injunctions from district judges, whom the administration has publicly attacked and accused of overreach. In turn, a series of favorable Supreme Court rulings have emboldened the administration, curbing the power of lower courts to block its agenda. This ongoing conflict is raising fundamental questions about judicial authority and the long-term balance of power in the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>The head of Sport England has formally expressed deep concern that the recent wave of racist and sexist online abuse directed at England's women's football team, the Lionesses, could undermine female sports participation. In a letter to the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, the agency warned that the "toxic culture" on social media threatens progress made in championing women in sports. The letter calls for stronger enforcement of the Online Safety Act to tackle targeted misogyny and racism, highlighting the abuse faced by players like defender Jess Carter during the recent tournament.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its immigration enforcement by targeting sanctuary cities with an increased presence of ICE agents. Border czar Tom Homan announced the plan to "flood the zone" in cities like New York, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, following the shooting of an off-duty officer allegedly by an undocumented person. Homan stated that if local jails won't cooperate, agents will make arrests in the community, potentially detaining others present who are in the country illegally. The move represents a new, more aggressive phase in the administration's nationwide deportation campaign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece from The Atlantic argues that the Trump presidency is animated not by a coherent governing philosophy, but by a culture of small-minded pettiness and retribution. The author cites several examples, including the renaming of military bases, barring a former intelligence director from a CIA event, and the pressure to fire the Fed Chairman, as evidence of a vengeful style that has replaced substantive policymaking. The article suggests that this approach, driven by personal grievances and emotional reactions, taints the executive branch and dictates decisions on both domestic and critical foreign policy issues, such as the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will begin using military facilities in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants, according to correspondence with the Pentagon. The Defense Department approved the request to use Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey for detention operations through September 2025. The plan also includes expanding detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to find space for a growing number of detainees amid its intensified immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>This article examines the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, positioning him as a key figure in President Trump's ongoing effort to reshape the federal courts. Unlike the first term's focus on originalist judges vetted by the Federalist Society, Bove's nomination is seen as representing a new phase, potentially prioritizing different criteria aligned with the current administration's political agenda. The piece suggests that as the nominations process restarts, Bove's controversial candidacy signals a potential shift in the type of judge the administration seeks to appoint to the federal bench. The brief article frames his nomination as a significant development in the conservative legal movement.</p>

          <p>The same federal judge who presided over Donald Trump's dropped lawsuit against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has been assigned to his new $10 billion libel case against Rupert Murdoch. Judge Darrin Gayles' assignment raises the possibility that Trump could again face a deposition under oath, a step he avoided in the Cohen case by withdrawing the suit. The new lawsuit concerns a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's latest tax bill will increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. The legislation makes permanent the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, while savings from stricter requirements for Medicaid and food stamps are projected to offset only a fraction of the lost revenue. The CBO also projects the bill will result in 10 million fewer Americans having health insurance by 2034. The bill allocates nearly $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement and a southern border wall. (not investment advice)</p>
