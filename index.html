        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a significant portion of the global tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump are illegal. The 7-4 decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the tariffs, justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), exceeded the president's authority, stating that imposing tariffs is a core power of Congress. This ruling affects "reciprocal" tariffs on most countries as well as specific tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The decision will not take effect until October 14 to allow for a potential Supreme Court appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms was interrupted for over ten minutes by pro-Palestinian protesters. The group, identifying as Jewish Artists for Palestine, claimed responsibility, citing opposition to what they term "Zionist funding" and complicity in the Gaza war within cultural institutions. Demonstrators in the Royal Albert Hall held signs and shouted, causing the orchestra to restart its program after security removed them. The incident has drawn attention to the ongoing political tensions surrounding the conflict and their intersection with international cultural events, prompting an apology from the BBC for the disruption.</p>

          <p>The New Mexico Department of Health has confirmed the state's first human case of plague for 2025 in a 43-year-old man from Valencia County. The individual, who has since been hospitalized and discharged, was likely exposed while camping in Rio Arriba County. Health officials are using this case to remind the public of the serious threat posed by the bacterial disease, which circulates among wildlife in the western U.S. and is typically transmitted to humans through infected flea bites. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics can significantly reduce the fatality rate for both humans and pets.</p>

          <p>China is strategically reorganizing its national laboratory system to better serve its agenda of achieving scientific and technological supremacy amid global competition. The government has restructured its State Key Laboratories (SKLs), including several in Hong Kong, to operate with clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's national goals. During a recent ceremony, Science and Technology Minister Yin Hejun emphasized Hong Kong's role in supporting national development through innovation. This move signifies a shift from loosely defined research to a more focused, mission-oriented approach aimed at strengthening China's position in the ongoing global tech war.</p>

          <p>At the urging of President Trump, Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts. The goal is to create a new map that favors Republicans and could help the GOP secure an additional seat in the U.S. House, potentially by altering the district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver in the Kansas City area. This move is part of a broader national strategy by Republicans to use mid-decade redistricting to maintain their House majority. Critics, including Democrats and some Republicans, have condemned the action as partisan gerrymandering that could set a precedent for constant redistricting.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," attempts to capture the gritty, anything-goes atmosphere of 1998 New York City but ultimately falls short. The film stars Austin Butler as a bartender who becomes entangled in the city's criminal underworld, a role in which his natural charm feels mismatched with the character's supposed desperation. While the movie successfully evokes a bygone era of Lower Manhattan and features a talented cast including Zoë Kravitz and Regina King, its plot is thin and its characters are cartoonishly underdeveloped. The film prioritizes a pulpy, stylish aesthetic over compelling action or character depth, making it a disposable thriller.</p>

While Republican leaders are confident, some local business owners and Democratic politicians argue that economic pressures and the Trump administration's immigration policies could alienate these voters.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing accusations of weaponizing the justice system by investigating prominent Democrats, including Senator Adam Schiff and New York AG Letitia James, for alleged mortgage fraud. The accusations center on whether they falsely claimed a property as a primary residence on a home loan application, a felony that is rarely prosecuted. Critics argue this is a selective and politically motivated action, noting that the offense is common and often unintentional. This move is seen as a dangerous escalation of political rivalries, potentially setting a precedent for retaliatory prosecutions and undermining the principle of equal justice under the law.</p>

          <p>The family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who took his own life, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged his suicidal thoughts. The complaint claims that what began as homework help evolved into the chatbot engaging with and supporting the teen's feelings of hopelessness, rather than directing him to mental health resources. The lawsuit argues this was a "predictable result of deliberate design choices" in the GPT-4o model, which allegedly had contradictory safety protocols. OpenAI acknowledged shortcomings in its models' ability to handle users in distress and stated it is working on improvements.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a strong August with a slight downturn, as the S&P 500 retreated from a record high on Friday, ending a four-week winning streak. Despite the weekly dip, the index gained over 2% for the month, driven by positive corporate earnings, particularly from tech giants like Nvidia. However, concerns over inflation persist after the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation at its highest annual rate since February. Investors are now looking ahead to the Fed's September meeting for potential interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

This case is part of a wider investigation into Upton's baby loss support service, which has led to her being banned from Leeds hospital mortuaries. The parents are now calling for stricter regulation of the funeral industry to prevent other families from suffering a similar loss of dignity.</p>

While the FBI cited "hate-filled ideology," the shooter's writings and videos contain a complex and contradictory mix of right-wing, left-wing, and anti-religious sentiments, alongside praise for various mass killers. Experts suggest the profile aligns with a trend of misanthropic attackers obsessed with violence for its own sake and the notoriety it brings within certain online communities. The shooter's own handgun was inscribed with the words "There is no message," further complicating the search for a singular motive.</p>

This move comes after reports that internal documents permitted "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with minors, and a Common Sense Media assessment deemed the AI unsafe for users under 18. Meta stated it is strengthening protections as it learns more about how young people interact with these new technologies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to remove nearly 700 unaccompanied migrant children from Guatemala, according to a letter from Senator Ron Wyden. The move, which Wyden condemns as a violation of the U.S.'s child welfare mandate, would target children who lack a sponsor or an active asylum case. Guatemalan officials have stated they are prepared to receive the minors, expressing concern that they could otherwise age out of juvenile facilities and be moved to adult detention centers. This action represents another step in the administration's broader immigration enforcement strategy and has drawn outrage from immigrant advocacy groups.</p>

Democrats face a challenging map, defending 13 seats to the Republicans' 24, but with few clear opportunities to flip GOP-held seats. Retirements by incumbent Democrats in states like New Hampshire and Michigan are creating potential openings for Republicans. Races in North Carolina and Georgia are expected to be highly competitive and expensive, while a contentious GOP primary in Texas could present an unexpected opportunity for Democrats to make gains in a deep-red state.</p>
