          <p>The Palestinian embassy in Egypt announced the Rafah border crossing would reopen, a claim promptly rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, which stated the opening depends on Hamas's compliance with returning deceased hostages. Concurrently, the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit, 76, was identified after being returned by Hamas, marking the tenth such repatriation under the current agreement. The agreement stipulates that Israel must return the bodies of 15 Palestinians for each deceased Israeli hostage received. The Gaza Health Ministry has alleged signs of abuse on some returned bodies, a claim the Israeli military has dismissed as propaganda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activists are organizing a second wave of "No Kings" protests across the United States to challenge what they describe as abuses of power by the Trump administration, including immigration policies and the deployment of troops in cities. Organizers, including the ACLU and Indivisible, anticipate millions of participants at over 2,600 planned events nationwide. In response, Republican leaders have labeled the demonstrations as "Hate America" rallies, with House Speaker Mike Johnson suggesting they will attract extremists. Organizers have refuted these claims, stating the protests are a patriotic exercise of free speech against authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>As millions are expected to participate in nationwide "No Kings" protests against the Trump administration, prominent Democratic figures have voiced their support for the movement. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and former Vice President Kamala Harris encouraged Americans to peacefully protest, framing the rallies as a patriotic exercise of free speech. Conversely, conservative allies of President Trump, such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, have dismissed the events as a "hate America rally." The demonstrations, organized by a coalition of over 300 groups, are a response to administration policies on immigration, healthcare, and environmental protection amid an ongoing government shutdown.</p>

          <p>The acclaimed and enigmatic musician D'Angelo, born Michael Eugene Archer, has passed away at the age of 51 following a battle with pancreatic cancer. A pivotal figure in the neo-soul movement, he was celebrated for his albums "Brown Sugar" and the Grammy-winning "Voodoo," which blended funk, R&B, and gospel influences. D'Angelo was known for his musical genius as well as his reclusiveness, having retreated from the public eye for over a decade, partly due to discomfort with his public image. His final album, "Black Messiah," released in 2014, was noted for its musical complexity and potent social commentary on racial strife in America.</p>

          <p>Amid rising Halloween costume prices, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families by creating and donating costumes for free. For nine years, he has been sourcing materials from thrift stores, using his creativity to wash, sew, and redesign them into unique outfits for children. With the average cost of a single costume increasing by 11% this year to over $37, Waggoner's initiative provides a crucial service for families facing financial constraints. He spends over $5,000 of his own money annually on the project but feels the reward is in helping children experience the joy of the holiday, regardless of their family's financial situation.</p>

Roberts expressed that his late sister, who died by suicide earlier this year, would have been proud of the recent developments, viewing them as a form of vindication for survivors of sexual assault. Prince Andrew settled a civil case with Ms. Giuffre in 2022 but has consistently denied all allegations against him.</p>

He presented a plan to the Wrens City Council for a youth-led body that would mirror the structure of the actual council, with a mayor and council members. Thomas believes this initiative will give the city's large youth population a positive and active voice in community events and local governance. His long-term goal is to use the Wrens model to establish a similar youth commission at the county level, fostering future leaders for the community and beyond.</p>

          <p>A new study from Macromedia University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg reveals a significant bias in German media, where foreign crime suspects are mentioned about three times more often than their actual share in police statistics. Journalism professor Thomas Hestermann, who led the research, noted that this "drastic distortion" has intensified since the 2015 migrant arrivals and contributes to a skewed public perception of crime. The study found this pattern consistent across various media outlets, regardless of their political leaning. Criminologists suggest this "migrantization" of crime stems from an overemphasis on culture, while the study's author advocates for more diversity in newsrooms to correct the imbalance.</p>

In a letter pleading for help, Santos described himself as a "proud believer" in Trump's America First vision.

          <p>Lady Annabel Goldsmith, a prominent socialite and the namesake of the iconic London nightclub Annabel's, has passed away at the age of 91. Born into an aristocratic family, she became a central figure in London's social scene in the 1960s. The mother of six children from two marriages, her family includes politician Zac Goldsmith and journalist Jemima Khan. Her youngest son, Ben Goldsmith, described her as "quite simply irreplaceable" and noted the "immense hole" she leaves in their lives.

          <p>Britain's Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, in a decision made in consultation with King Charles III. The move comes as excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who accused Andrew of sexual assault when she was a minor, are being released. In a statement, the prince said the continued accusations were a distraction from the Royal Family's work and that he must "go a step further" than just stepping back from public life. While he will remain a prince by birthright, he will give up associated honors and titles.</p>

In a social media post, Trump urged the two nations to "make a DEAL" and "let History decide," suggesting that property lines have been defined by the conflict. Zelenskyy confirmed that discussions about the U.S. providing long-range Tomahawk missiles were kept private to avoid potential escalation.

This included shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, known as the dohyo.

          <p>A Los Angeles-based group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth is creating a safe space for Black men to address their mental health, a critical need given rising suicide rates in this demographic. Founded by Desmond Carter, the bi-monthly meetings in Leimert Park allow men to be vulnerable and discuss issues like stress, depression, and the pressures of masculinity without judgment. Black men are less likely to seek mental health support and often face substandard care due to systemic disparities. Initiatives like Carter's serve as a vital preventative measure, aiming to break generational cycles and foster emotional expression in a supportive community.</p>

Instead, her trip was organized by a non-profit, International Student Conferences, demonstrating how even routine educational exchanges are now complicated by geopolitical tensions. The experience underscores the challenges students face in pursuing cross-cultural engagement amidst high-level political friction between the two global powers.</p>

Key lessons include discussing online privacy, understanding the value of time spent offline, and setting firm rules, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight. Twenge also suggests that a child's first phone should be a basic, non-internet-connected device to help them build healthy habits before engaging with the complexities of the online world.</p>
