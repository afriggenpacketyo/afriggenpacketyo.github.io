        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing peace talks, Russia launched a large-scale aerial attack on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 18 deaths, including three children, and numerous injuries across the country. Ukrainian officials condemned the strikes as evidence that Moscow is not interested in a truce, while Russia claimed to have targeted military-industrial complexes. The attack marked the fourth consecutive night of intense bombardments, and Ukraine continues to conduct its own drone strikes into Russia. President Zelenskyy appealed to the United States and other nations to apply stronger pressure on Russia to end the war.</p>

          <p>A philosophy professor at West Point resigned in protest of the Trump administration's executive order ending diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the armed forces. Graham Parsons, who focused on military ethics, said West Point began eliminating courses and censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology. Parsons felt he could no longer pursue important questions and called the administration's actions a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education. He objected to President Trump wearing his signature red Make America Great Again hat while cadets saluted him.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson indicated that he believes there are enough GOP senators opposed to the House's budget bill to stall its progress in the Senate. Johnson expressed concerns about the bill's lack of focus on spending reduction and deficit reduction, urging President Trump to prioritize these issues. Johnson's remarks highlight the potential challenges facing the domestic policy package, which narrowly passed the House.

          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG) development in the Asia Pacific. This investment contradicts Japan's climate-friendly promises and its role in the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which promotes cooperation on net-zero emissions. Critics argue that Japan's reliance on LNG as a "transitional fuel" and its loopholes in the G7 pledge amount to greenwashing. Japan benefits from LNG investments by securing access to supply and reselling surplus LNG to overseas markets.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert suggests a new approach called "emotionally safe parenting," emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This style focuses on creating a safe environment where children feel comfortable expressing emotions without judgment. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, avoid shaming, view misbehavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. The framework involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame.</p>

          <p>A year after a contested presidential election, Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, is calling for voters to participate in legislative and gubernatorial elections. The previous election was marred by allegations of falsified results and a subsequent crackdown on protesters. With no independent monitors present, many Venezuelans believe the results will be manipulated again. The vote has divided opposition activists, with some calling for abstention and others advocating for participation as a form of protest.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and potential deportation.

However, due to her undocumented status, she was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The incident sparked outrage and criticism, with many supporting Arias-Cristobal's release and condemning the actions of Ice and local authorities.</p>

Outraged by the impersonal telegrams delivered during the Vietnam War, Moore successfully lobbied for in-person notifications and support for grieving families. Her efforts led to the current military protocol of sending uniformed service members to personally inform families of a soldier's death and offer assistance. In 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore in her honor, marking the first time an American military base had been named for a civilian.</p>

However, Trump's meeting with the new Syrian leader and his plan to lift sanctions have led to a near cessation of Israeli strikes, signaling a potential shift in regional dynamics.</p>
