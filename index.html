            <p>The UK government invoked emergency legislation to prevent the closure of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, a move characterized as 'history-making' by some newspapers. The government took control of the plant from its Chinese owners after concerns that vital fuel shipments could be intercepted, potentially causing irreversible damage to the blast furnaces. While the Ministry of Defence initially denied involvement, the intervention highlights the government's commitment to preserving a key industry and preventing significant job losses in the region. This situation underscores the complexities of international trade and the strategic importance of domestic steel production. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>President Trump provided a major exemption for big tech from tariffs on China and other countries, benefiting Southeast Asian tech exports. Meanwhile, the US military is increasing its presence on the Mexico border.
