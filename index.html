          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts announced that Shohei Ohtani's pitching return is anticipated after the All-Star break. Ohtani, recovering from elbow surgery performed in September 2023, is set to face batters in a simulated game, marking a significant step in his rehabilitation. The Dodgers initially considered an earlier pitching return but prioritized Ohtani's hitting during spring training while carefully managing his pitching rehab to ensure a full recovery. Roberts emphasized the need to gradually build Ohtani's stamina back to five or six innings before his official return to the mound, meaning that his return will be delayed until later in the season. The team is focused on a gradual and safe return to pitching for the star player.</p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) in Malibu has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend after being closed due to the Palisades Fire, which impacted the local community significantly. The closure had isolated Malibu, affecting local businesses and residents, however, the reopening is expected to revitalize the area, though some residents express concerns about increased traffic and insensitive tourists. While over 60% of the debris has been cleared, the area still bears visible scars of the fire, including damaged structures and charred landscapes. Local businesses are hopeful for a strong summer season, though some question whether the reopened road will bring genuine support or just gawkers.</p>

          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., has issued an apology for inaccurately describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials. The false claim appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, leading to strong public criticism and prompting swift action from patients, victims groups, and the Environment Ministry. The company has removed the video and corrected the inaccurate phrasing on its website. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning, affecting thousands who consumed contaminated seafood near Minamata Bay in Kumamoto Prefecture, and the government recognized the cause in 1968.</p>

          <p>The UK's South Western Railways has become the first private operator to return to public ownership, marking the beginning of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire rail network by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed this as a watershed moment, aiming to end 30 years of fragmentation and improve services for passengers. The move is expected to save up to £150 million in compensation fees paid to rail operators. While rail unions support the takeover, the Conservatives criticize the move, and the Labour government said renationalization will save up to £150 million ($203 million or €178 million) in compensation fees paid to rail operators.</p>

          <p>A study by Georgia State University professor Taylor Shelton reveals that three corporations own nearly 38,000 homes in metro Atlanta, impacting the housing market and community dynamics. Many of these homes are considered “starter homes,” with Paulding and Henry counties being particularly affected, where corporate landlords own a substantial percentage of single-family homes and rental units. Concerns arise that corporate control allows for price manipulation, junk fees, and neglected maintenance, with other studies indicating larger landlords are more likely to have code complaints. Senator Jon Ossoff has launched an investigation into these corporations, but there is no timeline for any legislation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Doctors in Japan are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, citing violations of human rights, as many facilities still limit patient visitations despite the government downgrading the threat of the virus. Some hospitals restrict visits to only a few family members, while others prohibit children, even in palliative care wards. An infectious disease specialist criticized these measures as excessive and contradictory, pointing out that pets are sometimes allowed while grandchildren are not. The health ministry recommends balancing visitation opportunities with infection control, but specific policies are left to individual facilities, leading to inconsistent and often strict practices.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their canine companions. The research found that owners with higher job stress had dogs who exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and restlessness. This connection is driven by rumination, as owners who mentally bring work home are more likely to have stressed-out dogs, highlighting the concept of emotional contagion between humans and their pets. The study suggests that avoiding work-related thoughts at home could benefit the well-being of both owners and their dogs.</p>

          <p>The fifth anniversary of George Floyd's murder was marked with both celebration and somber reflection on America's racial divides. In Minneapolis, the site of his death has become a memorial, while events commemorating his life took on a tone of celebration and activism. However, the US Department of Justice's decision to roll back investigations into police forces has sparked concern, with activists emphasizing that true healing has not yet occurred and that racial divisions remain deeply entrenched in American society. Despite some progress, there is recognition that more work is needed to achieve genuine racial equality and justice.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has drafted a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States. According to internal agency documents, the EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from these plants do not significantly contribute to dangerous pollution or climate change, a claim disputed by scientists. The proposed regulation is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to undermine established climate science, although power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. in 2022.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist whose book “Against Our Will: Men, Women and sexual assault” redefined the understanding of sexual assault, has died at the age of 90. Her book, published in 1975, challenged the notion of sexual assault as an act of passion, framing it instead as a crime of power and violence, leading to legal reforms that made it easier to prosecute perpetrators. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and controversy, particularly for its assertion that sexual assault was a tool by which all men keep all women in a state of fear. The book also led to debates about pornography and its role in sexual violence.</p>
