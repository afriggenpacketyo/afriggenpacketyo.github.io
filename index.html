          <h2>Trump Administration Announces Broad Tariffs on Key Imported Goods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 20:31:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a new round of tariffs, effective October 1, targeting several key imported goods. These include a substantial 100% duty on branded pharmaceutical products, which can be avoided if companies establish manufacturing plants within the U.S. Further tariffs of 30% will apply to heavy trucks and upholstered furniture, alongside a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities. While intended to safeguard American industries, these tariffs are projected to escalate consumer costs for essential goods like medicines and housing, potentially impacting voters. Recent economic data suggests that these duties are now contributing to rising inflation, contrasting with earlier claims that they would not. The article notes a lack of evidence that these tariffs are creating manufacturing jobs, with recent reports indicating job losses in these sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer's acquisition of Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, a developer of next-generation weight-loss drugs, is anticipated to stimulate increased research and investment in innovative products within China. Analysts suggest this deal, along with other major pharmaceutical firm acquisitions, signals that large players are committed to differentiated innovation in the obesity drug market. The transaction includes an upfront cash payment and future milestone-based payments, reflecting the high value placed on Metsera's pre-human testing candidates. These candidates aim for improved efficacy and tolerability with fewer injections compared to existing market products. The article indicates that while the deal encourages current developers, it's unlikely to attract many new entrants to the field. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Democrats Reject White House Layoff Threats Amidst Looming Government Shutdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 20:28:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic leaders in Congress have dismissed the White House's recent threat of mass federal workforce layoffs, should a government shutdown occur, as an "intimidation" tactic. With the October 1 funding deadline approaching, Democrats remain firm in their push for key health care priorities in exchange for funding. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer both condemned the White House's actions, accusing the administration of using scare tactics rather than negotiating. President Trump canceled a meeting with Democratic leaders, further escalating tensions. Democrats assert that if a shutdown happens, it will be due to Republican unwillingness to reach a bipartisan agreement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo instructing federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs, or "reduction-in-force" notices, if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill by the October 1 deadline. This move escalates the stakes in the ongoing funding dispute, with the memo specifying that employees in discretionary programs or those not aligned with presidential priorities could be affected. While essential services like Social Security and military operations would continue, the prospect of permanent layoffs is unusual for government shutdowns. Democratic leaders swiftly condemned the memo as an "intimidation tactic," accusing the Trump administration of weaponizing federal employment.</p>

Milam maintained his innocence, claiming his then-girlfriend, Jesseca Carson (later convicted of capital murder), led the event. His appeals, citing unreliable bite-mark evidence and questions about his intellectual disability, were repeatedly denied. Milam expressed thanks to supporters and urged acceptance of Jesus Christ in his final statement before being pronounced dead by lethal injection.</p>

          <p>Parents of Cile Steward, an 8-year-old girl still missing after devastating floods killed 27 campers and counselors at Camp Mystic in Texas, have vehemently criticized the camp's decision to reopen a sister site in 2026. They labeled the move "unthinkable" while their daughter remains unrecovered, accusing camp leadership of insensitivity and a lack of consultation with affected families. The families demand that the camp prioritize the recovery of missing children and fully account for its role in the tragedy. Camp Mystic stated the reopened site is separate and undamaged, emphasizing its commitment to its mission and plans for a memorial, but parents insist their grief and safety concerns are being ignored.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted on charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his 2020 Senate Judiciary Committee testimony. This development follows public demands from President Trump for the Justice Department to prosecute his political adversaries, including Comey. The indictment comes after the controversial replacement of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, who reportedly doubted the case, with Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump defense attorney. The investigation reportedly stemmed from the discovery of sensitive documents related to the 2016 Russia probe by FBI Director Kash Patel, examining Comey's testimony regarding Russian interference and alleged media leaks.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a presidential memorandum aimed at establishing a comprehensive strategy to combat "organized political violence and domestic terrorism," which critics fear could lead to a broad crackdown on his political opponents. Trump vaguely suggested targeting funders like George Soros and Reid Hoffman, claiming they finance "anarchists and agitators." White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller hailed it as an "all-of-government" effort to dismantle "leftwing terrorism." Legal experts, however, question the memo's legal weight, noting it doesn't create new crimes but could be used to pursue ideological opponents. Opponents argue it attempts to apply terrorism charges to protected activities under the Bill of Rights.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted a significant divide in the current U.S. economy, noting a robust segment driven by the artificial intelligence boom contrasting with a struggling consumer sector. He argued that the AI-centric economy, propelled by Big Tech giants and massive investments like CoreWeave's $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI, is largely unaffected by interest rates. Conversely, consumer-oriented industries such as autos, housing, and retail are underperforming, with companies like CarMax, KB Home, and Starbucks reporting disappointing results. Cramer suggested that despite strong GDP growth, rate cuts are necessary to support the broader economy, as the tech sector's gains do not widely intersect with the daily lives of most workers.

This disagreement threatens access to popular shows and sports, including "Sunday Night Football."

          <p>Cities globally are experiencing a significant surge in rat populations, dubbed "Ratmageddon," leading to health concerns and property damage. Factors contributing to this increase include warmer winters, which prevent rats from hibernating and boost breeding, alongside human behaviors such as increased fast-food waste and less frequent rubbish collection. Urban expansion also creates more habitats for these adaptable rodents. Control efforts are hampered by rats' "neophobia" – their fear of new things – and developing resistance to traditional poisons. Experts like New York City's former "Rat Tsar" emphasize that cutting off food sources through better waste management is crucial for sustained reduction, urging communities to address environmental factors.</p>

          <p>Hollywood is experiencing a significant division over the Israel-Gaza conflict, manifested through two opposing open letters. One letter, signed by over 5,000 actors and filmmakers, pledges to boycott Israeli film groups, alleging their implication in "sexual assault and apartheid against the Palestinian people." In response, more than 1,200 other Hollywood figures, including prominent industry leaders, signed a counter-letter rejecting the boycott. This second letter condemns the initial pledge as "misinformation" and "antisemitic propaganda," urging the entertainment industry to stand against Hamas and call for the release of hostages. Filmmakers for Palestine dismissed the counter-letter as "thinly veiled anti-Palestinian racism," highlighting the deep ideological rift within the industry.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 238 into law, providing victims of the January 7 firestorms with up to one year of mortgage relief. This urgency measure, effective immediately, allows borrowers to halt mortgage payments without late fees or penalties by simply attesting to financial hardship caused by the fires. The relief is extended in 90-day increments and prohibits mortgage servicers from initiating foreclosures. This new law offers more generous terms than previous voluntary forbearance programs, providing crucial support to thousands of homeowners struggling with rebuilding costs and insurance claims. It aims to ease financial burdens as many survivors face difficulties accessing temporary housing payments.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares declined over 4% after new data revealed a continuing sales slump in Europe, with registrations falling 23% year-over-year in August, despite a 26% rise in the region's overall EV market. Analysts anticipate a potential boost for Tesla's third-quarter deliveries as U.S. consumers rush to purchase EVs before a federal tax credit expires. The article suggests that CEO Elon Musk's political activism, including endorsing Germany's far-right AfD party and appearing at a violent anti-immigrant rally, may be damaging the Tesla brand and dampening its appeal. To counter this and increased competition, Tesla is reportedly developing a more affordable new model. (not investment advice)</p>

While this dry spell is Watkins' joint-longest at Villa, Emery's focus is on his overall contribution to the team's performance.
