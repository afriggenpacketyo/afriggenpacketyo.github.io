          <p>The US men's national team lost 2-0 to South Korea in a friendly match, continuing a period of poor form just months before hosting the World Cup. Coach Mauricio Pochettino's experimental lineup struggled with defensive communication, leading to goals from South Korea's Son Heung-min and Lee Dong-gyeong. Despite creating some chances, the US team failed to capitalize on opportunities, raising concerns about their readiness for the upcoming global tournament and their ability to perform under pressure on home soil.</p>

The incident occurred in a non-residential area, and fortunately, no injuries were reported on the ground. While the exact number of victims has not been confirmed, the helicopter model typically seats one pilot and four passengers.

          <p>The volume of postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by more than 80% after the Trump administration eliminated a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The Universal Postal Union reported that the new rules, which require customs duties on parcels valued under $800, have caused major operational disruptions. Many foreign postal operators and carriers are reportedly unable or unwilling to collect these new duties, leading to a near-halt in shipments. The change aims to close a loophole but was implemented with little time for international partners to adapt.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating in Chicago as the city prepares for potential expanded immigration enforcement and the deployment of federal agents. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have strongly condemned President Trump's recent social media posts, which they interpret as threats to use federal force within the city. In response to the anticipated ICE activity, a major Mexican Independence Day festival has been postponed due to community safety concerns. The Department of Homeland Security stated its enforcement actions target criminals who seek refuge in sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to introduce its new Entry/Exit System (EES), a digital border control program, starting this autumn for travelers from non-EU countries like the UK. The system will replace manual passport stamping with a process that registers biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon first entry. This registration will be valid for three years. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long run, there are concerns it could cause significant delays and long queues during its initial rollout at key travel hubs.</p>

          <p>A Mexican citizen, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez, who was deported from the United States to South Sudan in July, has now been repatriated to Mexico. He was part of a group of eight men with serious criminal convictions in the U.S. who were sent to the East African nation, despite none of them being South Sudanese citizens. The practice of deporting migrants to third-party countries has been criticized by rights groups as a violation of international law. South Sudan's foreign ministry stated the repatriation was conducted in cooperation with the Mexican Embassy.</p>

          <p>Investigators have determined that a snapped cable was the primary cause of the deadly funicular railway crash in Lisbon that killed sixteen people. According to the national transport safety office, the cable connecting the two carriages gave way, causing the upper car to derail and crash into a building at high speed. The brakeman's attempts to apply emergency brakes were unsuccessful. The cable was reportedly only halfway through its expected operational lifespan, and the investigation is ongoing to determine the full cause of the failure.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate often called the "godfather of AI," predicts that artificial intelligence will lead to widespread unemployment and a dramatic increase in wealth inequality. In a recent interview, he argued that under the current capitalist system, the rich will use AI to replace workers, thereby boosting profits while making most people poorer. Hinton dismissed universal basic income as an inadequate solution, stating it fails to address the loss of human dignity associated with unemployment. He continues to warn about the broader societal risks of AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has set a new record for the fastest lap in Formula 1 history while securing pole position at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. His average speed of 164.466 mph surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars' lower drag, a recently resurfaced track with better grip, and Monza's high-speed layout. Verstappen expressed satisfaction with the achievement but remained focused on the upcoming race, anticipating a strong challenge from McLaren.</p>
