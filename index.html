          <p>President Trump used his social media platform to pressure the oil industry to maintain lower prices, warning that high prices would play into the hands of the enemy, as tensions rise in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. U.S. crude oil prices saw a slight decrease following Trump's post, while a White House spokesperson stated that producers must heed the President's warning. Trump also addressed the Department of Energy, urging them to increase drilling activities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nader Hashemi, associate professor at Georgetown University, argues that the U.S. bombing of Iran is motivated by the elimination of the Iran-led Axis of Resistance and the establishment of Israeli regional hegemony. He contends that claims of Iran being close to constructing a nuclear weapon are unfounded. Hashemi suggests the attack is driven by political opportunity, given Iran's internal and regional weaknesses. He asserts that Iran's real threat to Israel lies in its ideological opposition to Israeli and American policy in the region.</p>

          <p>Apple's recent underperformance has raised questions about the tech sector's role as a safe haven during market volatility, as it has often been considered in recent years. While the broader tech sector has bounced back strongly from the early 2025 selloff, Apple has traded below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. Investors are primarily buying the broad stock market on dips, which inherently includes a significant allocation to tech. Despite volatility, analysts suggest that geopolitical events still present buying opportunities in the tech sector due to the potential of the AI revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue that the measure could lead to lost tax revenue and disproportionately benefit high-income households. Labour's Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the proposal a "tax cut for foreign billionaires" and said Reform would have to either raise taxes or cut public services such as the NHS to compensate for the loss in revenue.

          <p>The Trump administration stated that Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported and then brought back to the US on criminal charges, will "never go free," despite a judge ordering his release. Ábrego García was deported in March but later charged with human smuggling. Although a judge ordered his release from legal custody while awaiting trial, immigration officials retain the power to detain him. The Department of Homeland Security reiterated its stance that Ábrego García is a dangerous criminal illegal alien.</p>

          <p>A survey indicates that a majority of couples overspend on their weddings, often due to the pressure to create a picture-perfect event. Wedding experts suggest focusing on a few key priorities to guide spending decisions and relying on vendors' expertise to find cost-effective solutions. Consider trimming the guest list, having the wedding on an off-season day, and communicating budget constraints openly with vendors. Asking for cash gifts is also recommended, but it's important not to rely on it as a primary source of funding.</p>
