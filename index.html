          <p>A tense, closed-door White House meeting reportedly saw FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino become enraged over the Justice Department's review of the Jeffrey Epstein case, leading him to consider resignation. The conflict stems from a DOJ/FBI memo which stated no incriminating "client list" was found, a conclusion that sparked fury among some supporters who were promised full transparency. The memo's release and the subsequent fallout have created a significant fracture within and between the FBI and DOJ leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 30% tariff on all imported goods from the European Union and Mexico, set to take effect on August 1. The move is justified as a necessary step to address long-standing trade deficits that the administration views as a threat. President Trump also warned that if the EU or Mexico were to retaliate with their own tariffs, the US would increase its rate further, escalating the global trade conflict.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising trade war costs, companies are increasingly using U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce taxes on imported goods. This strategy allows businesses to store materials and assemble products in a duty-free bubble, only paying tariffs when the final product enters U.S. commerce. While this tactic helps preserve cash flow, recent executive orders have eliminated some key benefits, creating new financial challenges for manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that in the years preceding the catastrophic Texas flood, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted multiple appeals to remove dozens of buildings at Camp Mystic from its 100-year flood map. This action significantly loosened regulatory oversight and flood insurance requirements for the camp, which was operating and expanding in a region known as "flash flood alley." Experts expressed alarm at the exemptions, noting the obvious and severe flood risk was apparent regardless of the official map designation.</p>

Commentators observed that while the administration can be effective at mobilizing resources, it has diverged from the traditional presidential role of offering on-the-ground empathy to victims. The current strategy appears to favor a scaled-back federal presence, placing greater reliance on state and local officials to manage the crisis.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece posits that as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have receded from the political forefront, Eric and Lara Trump are stepping into the void to become the new prominent power couple within the Trump dynasty. The article highlights Eric's own expressed interest in a future presidential run and Lara's active political ambitions, including her past role as RNC co-chair and a potential 2026 Senate campaign. The author frames this shift as the next chapter of nepotism and self-empowerment within the family.</p>

          <p>According to a professional negotiation expert, successfully securing a pay raise is rarely achieved in a single meeting but is typically a collaborative process that unfolds over several weeks. The article advises that the most effective time to initiate these conversations is during a mid-year check-in, before annual budgets are finalized. Key strategies for success include being patient while your manager consults with others, clearly documenting discussions, and maintaining consistent, professional follow-up.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) new policy allowing most travelers to keep their shoes on during airport security checks marks a significant symbolic shift away from the era of post-9/11 "security theater." The change is made possible by the widespread rollout of advanced CT scanners that can more reliably detect threats, as well as a fundamental change in the nature of global terrorism.

          <p>This article makes a strong case for allowing children more freedom to engage in unstructured, "wild" physical activities like climbing, wrestling, and exploring. Citing an injury-prevention expert, it argues that this type of free play is essential for developing a robust "movement vocabulary," which can reduce the risk of sports injuries later in life. The author contends that modern parenting norms and societal structures are overly restricting children's natural impulse to move, to their long-term physical detriment.</p>
