          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal is intensifying as it churns towards the southeastern U.S. coast, prompting authorities to extend tropical storm warnings as far north as Surf City, North Carolina. With maximum sustained winds now at 60 mph, the storm is projected to make landfall before sunrise on Sunday, bringing significant weather impacts. Forecasters are predicting heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with localized amounts potentially reaching 6 inches, creating a high risk of flash flooding across the coastal Carolinas through Monday. The system is also generating life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along a large stretch of the East Coast.</p>

          <p>The tech industry is grappling with the story of Soham Parekh, a software engineer exposed for simultaneously working at multiple Silicon Valley startups, an act that has ignited a debate on modern work ethics. Several founders confirmed hiring and subsequently firing Parekh after discovering his deception. In an interview, Parekh admitted to the practice but cited "extremely dire financial circumstances" as his motivation, not greed, for undertaking the grueling schedule. This incident serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the extremes of hustle culture, the potential for exploitation in remote work, and the controversial practice of "overemployment."</p>

          <p>An American man has been arrested in Mexico on serious weapons charges after being found in possession of multiple firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment. According to Mexican authorities, the unidentified individual was also carrying a credential with the inscription "CIA," adding a layer of intrigue to the case. The Secretariat of Security of the State of Mexico released images of the seized military-grade weapons. While the U.S. State Department has acknowledged the arrest and is ready to provide consular assistance, no further details on the man's identity or motives have been released.</p>

          <p>In a surprising jailhouse interview, convicted murderer Robert Baker has asserted that his former lover, Monica Sementilli, played no part in the 2017 killing of her husband, Fabio Sementilli. Baker, who is serving a life sentence after pleading no contest, insisted to a "48 Hours" producer that Monica was completely unaware of the murder plot. This bombshell claim comes as Monica Sementilli faces her own trial for conspiracy. Her defense team is expected to leverage Baker's testimony in an attempt to prove her innocence and secure an acquittal from the jury.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has found Monica Sementilli guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy, concluding she masterminded the 2017 killing of her husband, Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued that she and her lover, Robert Baker, plotted the murder to appear like a robbery-gone-wrong, aiming to collect on a substantial life insurance policy. Key evidence included her suspicious behavior on the day of the crime, secret communications with Baker, and damning testimony from a co-conspirator. She was sentenced to life in prison without parole, despite her daughters' support and Baker's claims of her innocence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Chinese researchers reveals that genetic factors significantly influence the brain's "criticality," which is the essential balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural activity. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research establishes a strong link between this critical balance and a person's cognitive abilities, suggesting they share a common genetic foundation. These findings are pivotal as they position brain criticality as a heritable biological phenotype. This opens up broad new avenues for exploring its role in normal brain function and its potential dysfunction in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>

Prosecutors allege her body was moved at least twice, having been buried in a shallow grave long after she had decomposed at another location. Furthermore, toxicology reports found a potent wildlife tranquilizer compound in her bone marrow, a substance only Barry had access to in the area. This evidence bolsters the prosecution's theory that he drugged his wife before killing her, despite his persistent claims of innocence.</p>

As the UN's largest financial contributor, a significant reduction in U.S. support would devastate key agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme, which are already struggling. This move is part of a broader trend of rising nationalism and a retreat from multilateralism, threatening the rules-based international order.

          <p>New regulations within the Chinese Communist Party suggest that President Xi Jinping may be delegating more authority to his deputies, a move that could have significant implications for governance and succession. The rules aim to standardize the policy coordination and review process for the party's powerful central commissions and leading groups. These top-level bodies are now instructed to focus on overarching strategic planning and oversight. Analysts are interpreting this shift as a potential effort by Xi to streamline decision-making or possibly begin laying the groundwork for an eventual transfer of power.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers began their California Classic summer league schedule with an 89-84 loss to the Golden State Warriors, despite holding a significant lead in the first half. Cole Swider was a bright spot for the Lakers, leading all scorers with 24 points, while DJ Steward contributed 20. The team's highly-touted rookie, Bronny James, did not play in the game.
