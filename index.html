            <p>During Aston Villa's Champions League quarter-final match against Paris St-Germain, a system malfunction resulted in the Europa League anthem being played instead of the Champions League anthem. The error, attributed to a crash in the automated system, caused amusement and confusion among players, but UEFA regulations do not penalize incorrect anthem usage. Despite the anthem gaffe, Aston Villa won the second leg 3-2, but PSG progressed on aggregate. This incident highlights the technical challenges and occasional mishaps that can occur even in high-profile sporting events, adding a touch of unexpected humor to the proceedings.</p>

            <p>Stephanie Turner is taking a break from USA Fencing after being placed on a 12-month probation for kneeling in protest against trans athlete Redmond Sullivan. Turner's protest at the Cherry Blossom Open garnered significant attention, prompting a federal investigation into USA Fencing's policies. While on probation, Turner can still compete but chooses not to, focusing instead on advocating for banning trans athletes from women's sports. She will testify against USA Fencing at a hearing addressing gender eligibility policies, and she aims to collaborate with other activists like Riley Gaines to further her cause.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with demands from the Trump administration, including directions on governance, hiring, and teaching, leading to the freezing of $2.2 billion in federal funds. President Alan Garber stated that no government should dictate what private universities can teach, prompting accusations from the education department of a "troubling entitlement mindset." While Harvard has agreed to engage with the administration's task force to combat antisemitism, it has drawn the line at the White House's sweeping demands.

            <p>Economists are raising concerns about a potential recession in the US, driven by President Trump's tariffs impacting consumer demand. Consumer sentiment has declined sharply, with a University of Michigan survey showing an 11% drop in April. The bond market is also signaling investor unease, and gas prices are decreasing, potentially indicating a broader economic slowdown. These indicators suggest that the US economy is facing significant challenges due to trade policies and market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts predict inflation to fall to near its 2% target by 2026, potentially prompting the Bank of England to consider an interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>
