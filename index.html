          <p>The House of Representatives is preparing to vote on a major tax and immigration package backed by President Trump after it narrowly passed the Senate with a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The legislation includes approximately $4 trillion in tax cuts, new border security funding, and significant reductions to clean energy initiatives and social programs like Medicaid. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade and could result in nearly 12 million people losing their health insurance. House Speaker Mike Johnson aims for a vote soon, despite facing potential opposition from fiscal conservatives within his party. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a Â£2.65 billion deal to acquire TSB from its current owner, Sabadell, a move that could see the TSB brand name vanish from UK high streets. If the deal is approved by shareholders and regulators, Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which would create Britain's third-largest bank. While Santander's UK chief executive stated no final decisions have been made, he noted the company typically uses the Santander brand globally. The acquisition is expected to result in "efficiencies savings," likely leading to job cuts in duplicated back-office roles and the closure of overlapping bank branches.</p>

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security initiative has revealed extensive abuse and exploitation of unaccompanied migrant children who were placed with sponsors during the previous administration. Launched in February, the program found cases where sponsors subjected minors to forced labor, neglect, and sexual abuse, with some sponsors having prior criminal records for serious offenses. According to DHS officials, the prior administration's failure to implement robust vetting and safeguards allowed vulnerable children to fall into the hands of criminals. The initiative is now focused on locating these at-risk children, ensuring their safety, and holding accountable those who exploited the system.</p>

          <p>North Korea has officially opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a large-scale beach resort on its eastern coast designed to accommodate nearly 20,000 people. State media reported that domestic tourists were filled with "overwhelming emotion" at the resort's "grandeur and splendor," a project personally championed by leader Kim Jong Un. The development is part of a broader effort to boost the nation's tourism industry and acquire foreign currency, with Russian tourists also expected to visit soon. This opening marks a step toward reopening the country to visitors after years of pandemic-related closures, though tourism remains highly restricted and politically sensitive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A landmark inquiry in the Australian state of Victoria has found that British colonists committed genocide against the Indigenous population. The Yoorrook Justice Commission's report detailed how mass killings, disease, and cultural erasure caused the local Indigenous population to decline by 75% in the two decades following colonization in the 1830s. The commission issued 100 recommendations to redress the harm, including potential reparations, an overhaul of the education system, and a government apology. While the Victorian government has pledged to consider the findings, the report's release highlights the ongoing and often contentious national dialogue in Australia regarding its colonial past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has found that the fire at an electrical substation that caused a major shutdown at Heathrow Airport was due to a problem first detected in 2018. The report states that an elevated moisture reading, indicating an "imminent fault," was recorded but went unaddressed by National Grid, with necessary maintenance being deferred. The subsequent power failure affected nearly 67,000 customers, including the airport, leading to thousands of canceled flights and raising serious questions about the resilience of the UK's critical infrastructure. Ofgem, the energy regulator, has now opened an enforcement investigation into potential license breaches by National Grid.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama has announced that he will have a successor, ending years of speculation that he might be the last to hold the title. In a recorded statement, the 90-year-old spiritual leader affirmed that the process of finding his reincarnation will follow past Buddhist traditions and should be managed by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which he founded. He implicitly warned China, which claims the authority to approve the next leader, to not interfere in the sacred process. The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese control and is expected to be met with opposition from Beijing, potentially leading to rival successors.</p>

Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year prison sentence, arguing his crimes were "senseless" and "sadistic." Saenz's defense is requesting a 45-year term, citing his remorse and a traumatic upbringing, though prosecutors contend he has remained deeply involved in gang activities while incarcerated.</p>

          <p>Ryland Headley, 92, has been sentenced to life in prison for the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in 1967, a crime that went unsolved for nearly six decades. The case was cracked after cold case detectives found a DNA match on the victim's skirt, linking Headley to the crime with "billion to one" certainty. Headley was previously convicted of other sexual assaults on elderly women in the 1970s. Following this conviction, police in Suffolk have confirmed they will now consider him a suspect in several other unsolved homicide and sexual assault cases from the period.</p>

          <p>The U.S. semiconductor industry could receive a significant boost from President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, which passed the Senate on Tuesday. The legislation increases the investment tax credit for building chip manufacturing plants in the U.S. from 25% to 35%, a more generous provision than previously drafted. This expansion of incentives, which builds upon the 2022 CHIPS Act, is part of Washington's ongoing effort to onshore the advanced semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. Companies like Intel and TSMC could benefit if the bill, which now returns to the House for reconciliation, becomes law. (not investment advice)</p>

The chaotic episode has been compared to the parliamentary turmoil of the Brexit years and has left the Prime Minister looking weakened despite his large majority.

          <p>Hundreds of protesters, including nurses and healthcare advocates, gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim to oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, proposes significant cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid while extending tax cuts. Protesters argued the bill is "harmful and cruel," highlighting that over a third of Californians rely on Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program. Kim, who supported a House version of the bill, could be a critical vote as the House prepares to consider the legislation, and her constituents urged her to reject the cuts.</p>

          <p>The "Quad" nationsâ€”the United States, Japan, India, and Australiaâ€”have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals essential for new technologies. The joint statement emphasized the need to reduce reliance on any single country, a clear reference to China's current dominance in the mineral processing and refining market. The group expressed concerns that this over-reliance exposes their industries to potential economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The initiative aims to diversify supply chains and strengthen strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific region, marking a key area of cooperation among the four democracies.</p>
