          <p>President Trump indicated via social media that he is considering making Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, companies which play a vital role in America's housing financial system by buying mortgages from lenders and bundling them into mortgage-backed securities. Trump stated that the companies are performing well financially and that he would discuss the matter with his economic advisors. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the mortgage market, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The president said he would make a decision in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson rescinded the agency's strategic plan, a comprehensive policy document outlining the disaster relief agency's priorities, less than two weeks before the start of hurricane season. Richardson stated that the plan had no connection to FEMA's mission, and a new strategy will be developed. One FEMA official described the strategic plan as the agency's "organizational backbone", and stated that FEMA will operate as triage instead of mitigating future damage. President Trump has suggested transforming FEMA into a "support agency" or scrapping it entirely.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has jumped to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. The price of bitcoin rose to as high as $109,857. Cumulative inflows into exchange-traded funds that track the price of bitcoin surpassed $40 billion last week and have seen just two days of outflows in May.

          <p>The Trump administration's deportation of a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to El Salvador despite a judge's order prohibiting it, has sparked internal clashes among officials at the State, Justice, and Homeland Security Departments. The documents reveal the administration's early efforts to develop a strategy for a case that has become a major test of President Trump’s mass deportation effort. The government considered portraying Mr. Abrego Garcia as a "leader" of the violent street gang MS-13, even though they could find no evidence to support the claim.
