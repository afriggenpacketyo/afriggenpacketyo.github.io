        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife officials have confirmed the presence of the highly invasive Chinese mitten crab in the Pacific Northwest for the first time, after a commercial fisherman caught one in the Lower Columbia River. These crabs, known for their ability to climb over 13-foot structures and cause infrastructure damage, previously wreaked havoc in the San Francisco Bay Area. Officials are concerned about potential ecological and economic impacts, urging the public to report any sightings. Oregon and Washington wildlife agencies are collaborating with NOAA to assess the extent of the crab population in the region and will set up trap lines and collect water samples to look for environmental genetic markers specific to the mitten crab.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in President Trump's administration has been marked by sweeping changes and controversy. Tasked with cutting government waste, Musk has overseen agency shutdowns and workforce reductions, leading to legal challenges and criticism. Despite promises of $2 trillion in savings, DOGE's actual cuts have fallen far short, with many claims of cost savings disputed. Musk's business interests, particularly Tesla and SpaceX, have also raised conflict-of-interest concerns, as they benefit from federal programs while he simultaneously slashes government spending.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's earlier distancing from Project 2025, a policy blueprint by the Heritage Foundation, many of his administration's recent actions align closely with its recommendations. These actions include dismantling the Department of Education, ending diversity and inclusion initiatives, shifting FEMA costs to states, targeting NPR and PBS, restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and reinstating service members discharged for refusing COVID-19 vaccines. These measures reflect a broader effort to reduce the size and scope of the federal government and assert presidential power, mirroring Project 2025's vision for an overhaul of the executive branch.</p>

          <p>A digital archive, the Vietnam War Song Project (VWSP), has collected over 6,000 Vietnam War-related songs, with over 700 identified as English-language protest songs released during the core war years (1964-1973). Artists like Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and John Lennon voiced opposition to the war, permeating diverse genres of popular music. These songs became vital parts of pop culture, influencing public opinion and energizing anti-war movements. After the war, films like 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon' continued to shape pop culture, while artists like Bruce Springsteen reignited public debate, demonstrating the lasting impact of protest music on American society.</p>

          <p>A massive power outage struck Spain and Portugal, leaving millions without electricity and disrupting daily life, but the cause remains a mystery. The Spanish government has launched a special commission to investigate the incident, ruling out a lack of nuclear power generation but not a cyberattack. While initial reports suggested a problem in the wider European grid or extreme temperature variations, these explanations have not been confirmed. European officials have dismissed sabotage as a likely cause, but the incident has raised concerns amid heightened vigilance over Russian hybrid warfare tactics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will provide tariff relief to U.S. automakers by preventing tariffs from stacking on top of each other. The 25% tariff on finished foreign-made cars and parts will remain, but the announcement will prevent tariffs from stacking on top of other tariffs Trump has imposed, such as steel and aluminum. The move will be retroactive, meaning manufacturers will be reimbursed for the tariffs theyâ€™ve already paid. The move is aimed at giving automakers time to move their supply chains for parts back to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk will offer its weight loss drug Wegovy through telehealth providers Hims & Hers Health, Ro, and LifeMD to expand access to the treatment, now that it is no longer in short supply in the U.S. Shares of Hims & Hers soared 30% following the announcement. The move aims to capture more patients now that many compounding pharmacies are legally restricted from making cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy. The partnerships make the experience seamless for patients, allowing them to access Wegovy and Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare, directly through their telehealth providers.</p>

          <p>The White House has criticized Amazon's plan to display tariff-related price increases on its website next to a product's cost, labeling it "a hostile and political act." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt questioned why Amazon did not do this during the Biden administration's period of high inflation. Leavitt also pointed to Amazon's partnership with a Chinese propaganda arm and encouraged Americans to buy American-made products. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has stated the company will try to keep prices as low as possible for customers and that they are in constant communication with the Trump administration.</p>

The trend reflects a renewed embrace of Christian faith and a desire for connection with others, according to some wearers. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Attorney General Pam Bondi are among those who frequently wear cross necklaces, citing their Christian upbringing and faith. However, some observers note that the symbol's increasing visibility in the political sphere has introduced partisan implications.</p>

This incident follows a series of recent attacks in the region, including the murder of a mother searching for missing relatives and the killing of the state's municipal police chief. Drug cartels in Mexico have often targeted politicians and mayoral candidates, aiming to control local police and extort money from municipal governments. Western Mexico is home to the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which was designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. President.</p>

          <p>The White House confirmed plans for the Trump administration to soften the impact of automotive tariffs, as the car industry grapples with regulatory uncertainty and additional costs due to the levies. Current tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures will prevent other adjacent levies, such as an additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, from "stacking" on top of the others. There will be an ability for some reimbursements on auto parts tariffs.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that common chemicals found in everyday plastic products, specifically phthalates like DEHP, may be associated with cardiovascular disease worldwide, with the highest impacts in Asia, the Middle East, and the Pacific. Researchers estimate that exposure to DEHP could have contributed to 350,000 deaths in 2018. While the study cannot definitively prove that DEHP directly causes heart disease, previous research has shown negative impacts of phthalates on reproductive health and the immune system.

While some speculate that interaction with chatbots may lead to more terse human communication, others suggest that AI's tendency to write long could lead to more verbose writing. Linguists predict that AI could lead to a standardization of English, with people's writing becoming more homogenized to whatever the standard of these language models is. However, some believe this may spark a countermovement, with people deliberately leaning into their own linguistic mannerisms to differentiate themselves.</p>
