          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges, accused of receiving 217 million won (€134,000, $152,000) in exchange for facilitating the employment of his son-in-law at an airline, according to prosecutors. This development occurs just weeks before South Korea's general election, adding a layer of political tension to the legal proceedings.

          <p>A bill in California aims to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels, sparking a battle between utility companies, solar owners, and environmental groups. Assembly Bill 942, proposed by a former Edison executive, would limit credits to 10 years and end them upon the sale of the house, a reversal of the original 20-year incentive. Proponents argue it addresses inequities for non-solar ratepayers, while opponents claim it undermines the state's commitment to renewable energy and benefits utility profits. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between promoting solar energy and managing the costs and benefits for all electricity consumers.</p>

          <p>A report by England's NHS safety watchdog reveals that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients. Medication errors, poor decision-making, and disrespectful behavior are linked to fatigued staff. The report cites examples of errors in pregnancy scans and chemotherapy treatments, with staff shortages, long hours, and lack of breaks contributing to the problem. The watchdog urges the government and NHS England to implement better systems for monitoring fatigue and to raise awareness about it as a safety issue.</p>

The discovery, made using seismic imaging techniques, indicates that the magma reservoir is actively releasing gas but remains stable, suggesting that an eruption is unlikely in the immediate future.
