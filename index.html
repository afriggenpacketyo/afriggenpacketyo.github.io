          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a case for substantially lowering the central bank's key interest rate, arguing it is currently about two percentage points too high. He contends that policy changes in areas like immigration and taxation, along with cooling rental costs, have created a new economic landscape that warrants a more aggressive rate cut to avoid risking the Fed's employment mandate. Miran's stance places him in dissent against the more cautious consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee, which recently approved a smaller quarter-point reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

This health setback occurs as he continues to undergo treatment for stage 3 colorectal cancer, which was diagnosed in 2023. Van Der Beek expressed his disappointment on social media but noted that he is currently in a "healing phase" of his cancer battle.

Mamdani stated his decision was a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over press freedom, linking the network's action to pressure from the Trump administration. The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" followed comments the host made regarding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, making the situation a focal point in debates over media independence and political influence.</p>

          <p>An elk nicknamed Emil, who became a social media sensation after wandering across Central Europe for months, has been safely captured in Austria. The young male traveled nearly 500 kilometers through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, attracting a large online following. Wildlife officials tranquilized him near a motorway, fitted him with a GPS tag, and released him near the Czech border. It is hoped that he will now integrate with the small local elk population in the Sumava forest region.</p>

          <p>Michelob Ultra has surpassed Modelo Especial to become the best-selling beer in the U.S. by sales in retail channels, bars, and restaurants. This shift marks a significant change in the beer market, as Modelo had previously taken the top spot from Bud Light following a conservative backlash against the brand. Modelo's decline coincides with challenges faced by its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending from its core Hispanic consumer base. The change in leadership reflects evolving consumer tastes and the lasting impact of brand controversies.</p>

          <p>Ahead of an expected announcement from the Trump administration linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism, medical experts and the drug's maker are pushing back strongly. Kenvue, the manufacturer, stated that sound science shows no causal link and emphasized that acetaminophen is the safest pain relief option for pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other major studies support this, finding no evidence of increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Experts worry that such claims could lead expectant mothers to use riskier alternatives or avoid necessary treatment for conditions like high fever.</p>

          <p>The memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk highlighted a potential crossroads for the MAGA movement, showcasing a mixture of religious revivalism and aggressive political rallying. A defining moment was a speech by Kirk's widow, Erika, who preached love and forgiveness for her husband's killer. In sharp contrast, other speakers, including Donald Trump, used the event to promise retribution against political opponents, with one advisor warning, "You have no idea the dragon you have awakened." The event served as a platform for both reconciliation and conflict, revealing deep tensions within the movement.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has teased the upcoming launch of new, powerful features for ChatGPT that will be more expensive to operate. He indicated that because of the high computational costs, some of these new capabilities will initially be available only to higher-tier subscribers or may come with additional fees. While the specific features were not revealed, the announcement signals a move towards more advanced and resource-intensive AI offerings. Altman reiterated OpenAI's long-term goal of reducing the cost of intelligence and making services widely available.</p>

          <p>A raid on a suspected militant compound in Pakistan's northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has resulted in the deaths of more than 20 people, including at least 10 civilians. Security officials stated the operation targeted a location where the Pakistani Taliban allegedly stored bomb-making materials, and that an explosion contributed to the destruction of nearby homes. The incident has triggered a protest of around 2,000 people and condemnation from local politicians, who described the raid as an attack on unarmed civilians. The high number of non-combatant casualties has caused significant local outcry.</p>

          <p>While the national median household income remained relatively flat, seven of the 50 largest cities in the U.S. experienced a decline between 2023 and 2024, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data. Minneapolis saw the most significant drop, with incomes falling by over 4% to $77,732. Other cities that saw declines include Denver, Seattle, and Austin, though their median incomes remain above the national average. Analysts suggest these trends in large cities can be influenced by various economic and demographic shifts, indicating potential financial strain in certain urban areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest level in nearly three years. For a borrower with a $1 million mortgage, this translates to substantial savings, with a monthly principal and interest payment now around $6,079, compared to nearly $6,700 at the higher rates seen in January. This reduction saves a homeowner approximately $600 per month and over $200,000 in total interest over the life of the loan, making homeownership and refinancing more affordable.

This follows several setbacks for Pfizer's own in-house obesity drug candidates.

          <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has proposed that encouraging people to work past the traditional retirement age of 65 could be a solution to America's looming retirement crisis. In his annual letter, he argued that longer lifespans are straining Social Security and that the concept of retiring at 65 is outdated. However, this suggestion has been criticized by labor economists, who point out that many older workers are forced into retirement due to health issues or caregiving responsibilities.
