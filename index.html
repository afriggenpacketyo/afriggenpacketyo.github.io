          <p>Politicians from Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party are facing accusations of spying for Russia by filing parliamentary questions on sensitive issues. The accusations surfaced amidst concerns about a planned visit to Moscow by a prominent AfD leader. Interior Minister Georg Maier suggests the AfD is acting on a Kremlin agenda, citing numerous inquiries into critical infrastructure and police capabilities. The AfD has dismissed these allegations as conspiracy theories, but other political figures have expressed concerns about the party's ties to Russia and potential influence.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares experienced a drop following a third-quarter earnings miss, primarily attributed to an ongoing tax dispute in Brazil. The dispute involves a 10% tax on specific payments from Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, an expense not previously factored into Netflix's forecast. Despite this setback, Netflix reported a 17% increase in revenue, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue. The company anticipates continued revenue growth in the fourth quarter and is expanding its consumer reach through partnerships with toy companies for its animated film "KPop Demon Hunters." The company is also exploring opportunities in live experiences, publishing, beauty, lifestyle, and food and beverages related to the film, aiming for further growth. The optimism score for this article is 65.</p>

          <p>A drone attack in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, has delayed the planned reopening of the main airport after being closed for over a year and a half due to the ongoing civil war. The attack, apparently launched by the RSF paramilitary forces, occurred despite the Civil Aviation authority's announcement of domestic flights resuming. The RSF had previously warned they would target any aircraft suspected of supporting the Sudanese army. The government, which relocated to Port Sudan, aims to demonstrate control over Khartoum and encourage the return of international flights. The optimism score for this article is 25.</p>
