            <p>Miles Harford, a Colorado funeral home owner, pleaded guilty to abuse of a corpse and theft after improperly storing cremated remains and keeping a body in a hearse for over a year. He faces up to 18 months in prison under the plea agreement, which dismissed other charges. The case follows other incidents of mishandling of remains in Colorado, leading to stricter regulations in the funeral home industry. This incident involved Harford giving families remains that weren't of their loved ones, compounding the distress caused by the improper storage. The discovery of these actions has prompted a wave of regulatory reforms aimed at preventing future occurrences.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump stated that Volodymyr Zelensky shares blame for the deaths in the Ukraine war, alongside Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden, following a deadly Russian attack on Sumy. Trump questioned Zelensky's competence, claiming he provoked the conflict by seeking missiles against a larger adversary. Zelensky previously urged Trump to visit Ukraine before negotiating with Putin. The Sumy attack resulted in at least 35 deaths and 117 injuries, with Russia claiming to have targeted Ukrainian soldiers. Trump insisted he wants to end the conflict, signaling upcoming proposals.</p>

He also emphasized that Europe needs to better fortify its own self defense and that the US is committed to the tariff strategy as a long-term play to lower trade deficits.</p>

            <p>A Chinese research team has identified a mechanism by which breast cancer cells utilize the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and proliferate. The findings suggest a potential new approach to precision therapy by targeting arginine metabolism in tumors. The study reveals that the metabolic interaction between cancer cells and macrophages plays a crucial role in arginine-driven breast cancer progression. This discovery could lead to innovative treatments that starve tumors of this essential building block for protein, potentially halting the spread of the disease.</p>

            <p>The US education department is freezing $2.3bn in federal funds to Harvard University after the school refused to comply with demands to crack down on antisemitism and DEI programs. Harvard's president stated that the university would not comply with the Trump administration's demands, citing academic freedom. The administration called for broad government and leadership reforms, a requirement that Harvard institute what it calls “merit-based” admissions and hiring policies as well as conduct an audit of the study body, faculty and leadership on their views about diversity. This decision has sparked controversy and legal challenges, with some alumni supporting Harvard's stance.</p>

            <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist involved in protests at Columbia University, was detained by federal agents during his citizenship interview. His attorneys claim the Trump administration detained him in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinians. Mahdawi's detention follows the detention of fellow activist Mahmoud Khalil, who is also facing deportation. Betar USA, a pro-Israel group, had previously listed Mahdawi on their "deport list". His lawyers say he has backed a "peaceful political solution" to the Palestinian conflict.</p>

            <p>A federal funding freeze by the Trump administration has halted key infrastructure projects in tribal communities across the country. Over 22 tribes and nonprofits have had approximately $350 million in federal funding frozen, often without notice.

Tribes are now facing uncertainty about addressing issues like thawing permafrost, riverbank erosion, and wildfire prevention.</p>

As a whole, the three decisions appear to form a growing patchwork of district-level protections to limit the use of the Alien Enemies Act in lieu of a nationwide order. The decision marks the third time in the last week that a federal judge has limited deportations under the Alien Enemies Act since the Supreme Court lifted a nationwide order</p>
