        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging application that functions without an internet connection. The app operates on a decentralized Bluetooth mesh network, allowing users to communicate directly between nearby devices. Messages are encrypted, ephemeral, and are not stored on any central servers, reflecting Dorsey's continued push for privacy-focused and censorship-resistant technology. Bitchat is designed to work even during internet outages or government-imposed shutdowns, offering a resilient communication tool for users in such environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has strongly criticized Democrats, particularly Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for attributing the death toll in the Texas flash floods to the Trump administration. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt labeled the accusations a "depraved lie," asserting that the National Weather Service issued timely and accurate warnings. Leavitt provided a timeline of flood watches and warnings to counter claims that vacancies within the NWS in Texas contributed to the tragedy. The statement emphasized that President Trump will visit the affected region later in the week to support the community.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis examines the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into either short-term or long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) in the current economic climate. While short-term CDs currently offer higher interest rates, the compounding effect over a longer duration means long-term CDs ultimately yield a greater return. For example, a five-year CD at 4.20% would earn significantly more than a one-year CD at 4.40%. The article advises savers to consider their ability to lock away funds for an extended period, as early withdrawal penalties could negate the interest gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 25% blanket tariff on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. President Trump revealed the policy in letters sent to the leaders of both nations, stating the move is necessary to correct persistent trade deficits. The new tariffs mark an end to a 90-day pause on higher rates that was implemented in April. The announcement prompted a downturn in U.S. financial markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 400 points as investors reacted to the escalation in trade tensions with two key U.S. partners.

The text explains that bankruptcy is a legal tool designed to provide a fresh start from unmanageable debt.

The group, formerly an al-Qaeda affiliate, played a key role in the offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, and its leader is now Syria's interim president. This move aligns with broader efforts by Western nations, including the U.S. and U.K., to reset relations with Syria and support its recovery after years of civil war.

While officials claim these checks are political symbolism with little real effect on migration, they impose significant economic costs, disrupting supply chains and cross-border commerce.

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Central Texas was caused by an extreme weather event where some areas received over 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. This deluge, fueled by remnant moisture from a former tropical storm, caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The Texas Hill Country is naturally susceptible to flash floods due to its topography and soil composition, which causes water to run off rather than be absorbed. Forecasters warn that the devastated region could see an additional three to five inches of rain, with flood watches remaining in effect for multiple cities.</p>

The columnist argues the story lacked newsworthiness and played into right-wing narratives, especially since the information came from a hacked source with questionable motives.

          <p>A memorial service at St. Paul's Cathedral marked the 20th anniversary of the July 7, 2005, London bombings, honoring the 52 people who were killed. During the solemn ceremony, family members and a survivor read the names of the victims as thousands of white petals fell from the cathedral's dome. The service was attended by survivors, victims' families, members of the Royal Family, the prime minister, and emergency service workers who responded to the coordinated attacks on the city's transport system. The event served as a moment of national reflection and unity against the hatred that motivated the attacks.</p>

          <p>On CNBC, Jim Cramer suggested that chipmaker Nvidia might soon be able to resume selling certain AI chips to China, following the U.S. government's easing of export restrictions on chip design firms. He also addressed a recent downgrade of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike by Piper Sandler, which moved the stock to a neutral rating after it hit the analyst's price target. Cramer noted that his investment club has been periodically taking profits from the high-valued stock. The discussion occurred as the broader market saw a slight downturn amid anticipation of new trade policy announcements from the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Farmers in the United Kingdom are warning that the countryside is like a "tinder box" and that a major wildfire is a "disaster waiting to happen" as the country faces another heatwave. They argue that government incentives to remove grazing animals, like sheep, from upland areas are leading to a dangerous buildup of dry vegetation that acts as fuel. With temperatures expected to climb into the 30s Celsius and land already scorched by fires earlier this year, farmers' unions are urging for a review of land management policies and for the public to exercise extreme caution to prevent further outbreaks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk after the tech billionaire announced the formation of a new political party called the "American Party." Trump called the move "ridiculous" and said Musk had gone "completely off the rails," suggesting that third parties only create disruption and chaos. The announcement marks a significant falling out between the two, who had previously enjoyed a close relationship. The rift appears to stem from disagreements over a recent tax and spending bill that eliminated tax credits for electric vehicles, a key part of Musk's business empire.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a provision in a new domestic policy bill that strips its health centers of Medicaid funding. The organization argues the provision is unconstitutional and is designed to punish them for providing abortion services, which they call a "backdoor abortion ban." The lawsuit claims that losing Medicaid reimbursements would have catastrophic consequences, potentially forcing nearly 200 clinics to close and severely limiting access to healthcare for millions of low-income patients. Planned Parenthood provides an estimated 38% of abortions in the U.S.</p>

The destruction of the hotel, which once served as a presidential palace and was a hub for artists and intellectuals, is being mourned as a symbolic loss of Haiti's cultural heritage. The incident is part of a wider pattern of violence as gangs continue to seize control of once-peaceful communities in the capital.</p>

The report also highlights national security concerns, as rising interest payments could squeeze defense spending and diminish America's standing with foreign creditors.

          <p>The Formula 1-themed movie starring Brad Pitt has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. The film, distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, has out-grossed previous Apple-produced films like "Napoleon" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." Its success is partly attributed to a strong partnership with IMAX, which secured a three-week exclusive run and contributed over 20% of the film's total gross. While the movie had a high production and marketing budget, its box office performance marks a significant milestone for Apple's growing ambitions in the film industry.</p>
