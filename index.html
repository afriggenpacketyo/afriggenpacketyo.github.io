          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), initially a regional security forum, is evolving into a significant economic and political bloc challenging the Western-led global order. Now representing 40% of the world's population and nearly a quarter of global GDP, the SCO's influence is expanding with new members like Iran. This article suggests that the group's growing momentum, particularly with the economic expansion of China and India, is prompting a strategic response from the United States. The transformation from a security pact to a multipolar platform signals a potential shift in global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>A state watchdog panel has publicly admonished Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Enrique Monguia for serious judicial misconduct. The commission found that Judge Monguia repeatedly made inappropriate and threatening remarks, including threatening to shoot attorneys and others in his courtroom. He also engaged in a pattern of discourteous and biased comments toward defendants, crime victims, and prospective jurors, constituting an abuse of his authority. While Monguia did not contest the admonishment, he expressed remorse and acknowledged his actions were improper, stating he has taken steps to address his behavior.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the 2026 Group of 20 (G20) summit will be hosted at his golf resort in Doral, Florida, reviving a plan from his first term. The decision has previously raised ethical concerns about potential conflicts of interest, though the White House stated the resort would host the event at cost, without profit. The summit's agenda will reportedly focus on economic prosperity through deregulation and energy policies. This move confirms the administration's intention to use the property for a major international event, after a similar plan for the G7 in 2020 was withdrawn amid criticism.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the iconic Italian designer who passed away at 91, is remembered for revolutionizing Hollywood fashion and transforming the red carpet into a global runway. Before Armani, celebrity fashion was often chaotic, but he pioneered the practice of dressing stars for major events, harnessing celebrity power to build his brand. His unstructured, elegant suits defined an era of effortless style, famously worn by Richard Gere in "American Gigolo" and embraced by countless stars at the Academy Awards. Armani's strategic vision created a powerful synergy between fashion and film that continues to shape the industry today.</p>

The 22-year-old Spaniard demonstrated superior stamina and composure, overcoming the 38-year-old Serbian tennis legend 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2. Although Djokovic showed flashes of his renowned skill, he struggled physically as the match progressed, ultimately unable to keep pace with Alcaraz's consistent power.

          <p>Authorities in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, discovered a man secretly living in the crawl space of a condominium complex. The resident, 40-year-old Beniamin Bucur, had outfitted the space with a bed, televisions, and other electronics by tapping into the condo's power source. The condo's owner had previously heard strange noises but was unaware of the occupant until a witness reported suspicious activity. Deputies breached the locked crawl space door, on which Bucur had changed the locks, and arrested him on charges including burglary and methamphetamine possession.</p>

The findings have triggered a public backlash, a probe by the national medical regulator, and product recalls in a country with the world's highest skin cancer rates.

As a result, the quality of clinical data from China has improved dramatically, with a rising number of approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

This slowdown is attributed partly to the Trump administration's tariffs and economic uncertainty, prompting concerns about potential stagflation.

The new FTC leadership has dismissed the appeal of that ruling, arguing the ban was an overreach of its authority.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing significant governance challenges due to its inability to fill numerous key government positions, forcing it to rely on a small group of advisors holding multiple acting roles. This practice of "dual-hatting" has led to short-staffing, potential conflicts of interest, and questions about the effective execution of statutory and political goals. Examples include a top economic adviser nominated for the Federal Reserve board while planning to remain at the White House. This article argues that the skeleton-crew approach undermines governance, especially for an administration seeking to implement an intrusive and expansive agenda.</p>

          <p>Officials in the Chicago area are bracing for an expanded U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation set to begin over the weekend. According to Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, up to 300 ICE agents could be deployed in the region for approximately 30 days. In response, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has stated the city does not want or need "militarized immigration enforcement." The increased federal presence follows President Trump's repeated threats to send National Guard troops to the city to address crime, a move local leaders have consistently opposed.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C.'s top federal prosecutor, Jeanine Pirro, is in a public dispute with Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui over the handling of criminal cases related to President Trump's crime crackdown. Judge Faruqui criticized prosecutors for bringing weak cases that grand juries have refused to indict, accusing the office of trying to inflate statistics. In response, Pirro accused the judge of being politically motivated and overly compassionate toward defendants with illegal guns. This rare public conflict highlights tensions within the justice system over the administration's aggressive enforcement strategy in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a formidable Category 4 storm, is currently moving across the Pacific Ocean on a westward path toward Hawaii. The National Hurricane Center has warned that swells generated by the storm could reach the islands by the end of the weekend, creating life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents. While no coastal warnings are in effect yet, forecasters anticipate that the storm could bring direct impacts, including heavy rain and high winds, to Hawaii early next week. The storm is expected to begin a slow weakening trend over the weekend but remains a significant threat to be monitored.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami striker Luis Suarez has been suspended for six matches by the Leagues Cup disciplinary committee for spitting at a member of the Seattle Sounders' staff. The incident occurred after a heated melee following Inter Miami's 3-0 loss in the tournament final on August 31. The 38-year-old Uruguayan, who has a history of controversial on-field behavior, apologized for his actions in a statement. The suspension will apply only to next year's Leagues Cup tournament, though Major League Soccer may impose additional punishments for the unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's moves to cut funding and dismantle U.S.-backed international broadcasters like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe represent a unilateral disarmament in the global information war, this article contends. These institutions have long provided independent, evidence-based news to people in repressive countries, countering state propaganda from nations like China and Russia. By appointing ideologues to oversee these agencies and slashing their budgets, the U.S. is creating a vacuum that autocratic powers are eagerly filling. The policy shift effectively abandons a decades-long bipartisan consensus on promoting free speech and democracy abroad.</p>

          <p>Close relatives of Bill Pulte, the federal official who accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of housing fraud, have themselves claimed primary residence tax exemptions on two different homes in Michigan and Florida. Public records show that Pulte's father and stepmother have maintained "homestead exemptions" in both states since 2020, a practice generally not permitted. After being contacted by Reuters, tax officials in Michigan revoked the exemption on the family's property there, which was also being rented out in violation of the rules. The revelation creates a parallel to the very accusations Pulte has publicly leveled against Cook.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of crime data in Chicago offers context to President Trump's claims about the city's violence levels. While Chicago did record the highest total number of homicides of any U.S. city last year, its homicide rate per capita was lower than several other major cities like Memphis and Baltimore. Furthermore, overall violent crime in Chicago has been falling, down 11% in 2024 from the previous year and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels. The article highlights that while absolute numbers can be alarming, per capita rates provide a more representative comparison between cities of different sizes.</p>

Barrett explained that her direct response was a professional reaction to a "spirited argument" from her colleague, emphasizing that their disagreements are confined to legal interpretation and do not affect their personal relationship. Quoting her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, she stated, "I attack ideas. I don't attack people."

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has paused a mandate requiring 20% of new vehicle sales in Canada to be electric by 2026, citing economic challenges and the impact of U.S. trade policies. The move comes as Canada's economy shows signs of weakening, with recent job losses and a rising unemployment rate. While the short-term target is suspended, longer-term goals of 60% electric sales by 2030 and 100% by 2035 remain in place. The government also announced a new "Buy Canadian" policy to prioritize domestic goods for federal contracts to support local industries. (not investment advice)</p>
