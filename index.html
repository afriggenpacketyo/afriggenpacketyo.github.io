          <h2>Japan Considers Reusing Fukushima Soil at Government Grounds</h2>

          <p>The Japanese government is exploring the possibility of reusing soil removed from areas surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities. This initiative aims to establish a precedent for soil recycling outside of Fukushima Prefecture, as previous demonstration projects in Tokyo and its vicinity faced local opposition. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry based on prior demonstration projects, would likely be used for flowerbeds and similar purposes in Tokyo's Kasumigaseki district. Japan aims to reduce the overall amount of soil requiring disposal by recycling soil with relatively low radioactivity for public works projects. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn that the UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves may need to raise taxes in the autumn after government borrowing figures disappointed. April's borrowing was Â£20.2bn, the fourth highest since 1993, which could hinder Reeves' ability to meet spending and borrowing rules. Capital Economics suggests tax rises are becoming inevitable due to weaker economic growth forecasts impacting tax receipts. Prime Minister Starmer's partial reversal of winter fuel payment cuts and increased defense spending needs add to the financial strain, making tax increases more likely. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>The German economy is struggling to recover, facing a period of sluggishness with little chance of a rapid upturn, according to economic experts. Germany has been experiencing economic decline for two years, exacerbated by high electricity prices, labor shortages, and bureaucracy. The government plans to introduce measures to ease the burden on companies, including reducing electricity tax and reforming the labor market. However, experts caution against subsidies for non-viable jobs and emphasize the need for new business models and infrastructure investments to modernize the economy. </p>

State media reported a "serious accident" occurred in Chongjin, where the ship lost balance during the launch, causing hull damage. Kim Jong-un deemed the incident a "criminal act" caused by carelessness and "unscientific empiricism," vowing to punish those responsible. South Korean military officials confirmed the ship was lying on its side in the water, and analysts suggest repairs could be extensive and time-consuming. </p>

He highlighted areas with strong potential for cooperation, such as energy, space, pandemic preparedness, and, most importantly, the green transition.

The agreement would transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while allowing the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years. The legal action was brought due to concerns that Chagossians are still prevented from returning to Diego Garcia, the largest island, under the proposed deal. </p>

The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield has surpassed 5%, and the 10-year Treasury yield has climbed significantly.

          <h2>David French Reflects on Justice Souter's Example of Knowing When to Step Down</h2>

          <p>David French reflects on the example set by Justice David Souter, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2009, and contrasts it with the current trend of politicians and judges remaining in power for too long. He argues that the desire to cling to power is a human trait, amplified by enablers who benefit from a leader's influence. French suggests that a culture obsessed with career success makes it difficult for individuals to step aside, and highlights the importance of valuing family and personal virtues over professional achievements. He praises Justice Souter for prioritizing a life beyond the court and encourages leaders to do their duty and then allow the next generation to take its turn. </p>

          <p>Calley Means, a former lobbyist turned health care entrepreneur, has become a key figure in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. As a top adviser to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Means coordinated a report on chronic disease among children, focusing on environmental toxins and corporate influences. Means, who consulted for companies like Coca-Cola, now calls out what he sees as insidious tactics harming American children. While some scientists agree with the movement's focus on children's health, others criticize what they see as an overly simplified picture of complex causes of chronic disease. </p>

          <p>President Trump is set to release a report identifying key drivers of chronic disease in children, led by Health Secretary Robert F.

While not offering specific policy prescriptions, the report aims to declare a health crisis and provide a blueprint for further investigation. The report is already facing pushback from Republicans and the agriculture industry due to concerns about Kennedy's stance against agricultural chemicals. </p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing backlash for their plan to honor President Trump by naming a newborn savings account program after him. Initially called "money account for growth and advancement" (MAGA), the program was renamed the "Trump Account." Critics, while supporting the concept of providing funds for babies, have criticized the name as "incredibly creepy" and inappropriate. Democrats have previously proposed similar plans without naming them after political figures. </p>

          <p>Following Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis and Representative Gerry Connolly's death, some Democrats are calling for elected officials to seek an earlier "escape hatch from politics." The party is struggling with the issue of age, with leaders acknowledging the problem but remaining hesitant to directly call out aging colleagues. The release of a book detailing how Biden's advisers shut down discussions of his age-related limitations has reignited the debate.

While the likelihood of secession is slim due to constitutional hurdles, the movement reflects deep grievances and a desire for greater autonomy. The referendum is driven by concerns over federal policies perceived as hostile to Alberta's energy sector and a sense of cultural divergence from the rest of Canada. </p>

The research involved collecting DNA samples from hundreds of cat owners, who eagerly participated in the study. The findings reveal that the mutation activates the ARHGAP36 gene, which is not normally active in pigment cells, and intersects with the pathway responsible for red hair in humans, but in a different way. </p>
