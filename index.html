          <p>A boiler room explosion at a NYCHA high-rise in the Bronx caused a corner of the 20-story building to collapse. Miraculously, no injuries or fatalities were reported among the residents of the Mitchel Houses complex. Officials are investigating the cause, with initial theories pointing to an issue with the heating system's pilot light. The incident has displaced 140 residents from 38 apartments and raised concerns about the building's structural integrity, as records show it had active violations for unsafe facades.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old girl, reportedly driving a stolen pickup truck while intoxicated, crashed on an Arizona highway with an 11-year-old passenger. The incident began with reports of a wrong-way driver on I-40, with the vehicle reaching speeds over 100 mph before hitting a guardrail and flipping multiple times. Both children were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. A blood test revealed the driver's blood alcohol concentration was 0.183, more than double the legal limit for an adult, and she is expected to face DUI and other charges.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's declared war on drug cartels, Ecuador is escalating its law enforcement actions with significant support from the United States. Although not a drug producer, Ecuador is a key transit country, and the U.S. is providing resources, technology, and military assistance to help combat criminal networks. This partnership has led to an increase in police raids and intelligence gathering aimed at disrupting the drug supply chain. The collaboration reflects the Trump administration's strategy of pressuring partner nations to take a more aggressive stance against drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order declaring that any armed attack on Qatar will be considered a threat to the security of the United States. The order commits the U.S. to take all necessary measures, including potential military action, to defend the Gulf nation. This unprecedented security guarantee reportedly comes in response to a recent Israeli bombing in Doha that targeted Hamas leaders. The move strengthens the U.S.-Qatar defense partnership at a time of heightened regional tension, with Qatar hosting the largest American military base in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has officially shut down after lawmakers could not reach a deal to extend funding beyond the September 30 deadline. The impasse stems from a stalemate between the two parties, with Democrats insisting that a funding bill include an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. Republicans have argued that healthcare negotiations should be separate from the government funding process. With neither side willing to concede, spending authority expired, leading to the furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and the suspension of non-essential government services.</p>

          <p>The Southern California city of Huntington Beach has formally declared itself a "non-sanctuary" city, a move that directly opposes California's statewide sanctuary policies. Led by its pro-Trump mayor, the city council unanimously approved the initiative, which signals a willingness for local police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents. While California state law restricts such cooperation, the declaration is a strong political statement against the state's left-leaning immigration policies. The city joins a small but growing number of jurisdictions nationwide pushing back against sanctuary laws.</p>

          <p>Five years after its debut, Waymo's driverless robotaxi service is still encountering operational issues, as highlighted by recent viral incidents. In one case, a Waymo vehicle in Atlanta was filmed driving past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing, a serious traffic violation. In another, a vehicle in the San Francisco area was pulled over for an illegal U-turn, though no ticket could be issued. While Waymo argues its safety data shows fewer serious crashes than human drivers, these events underscore the ongoing challenges in refining autonomous technology for complex, real-world scenarios.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders used a novel approach to handle media questions about his position on the team's depth chart by remaining completely silent. When asked about fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel being promoted to starting quarterback while he remained third-string, Sanders moved his mouth and gestured as if answering but produced no sound. This pantomimed response came after Sanders had previously made comments suggesting he was capable of playing better than many current NFL quarterbacks. His silent protest is being interpreted as a creative way to avoid controversy or fines.</p>

Despite being a less heralded signing than others, stars like LeBron James have highlighted his potential to contribute. LaRavia, a career 42.9% three-point shooter, is expected to be a "three-and-D" player who can complement the team's stars by spacing the floor and providing defensive energy. Coach JJ Redick has praised his commitment, and LaRavia aims to be an influential connector for a team with championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Supreme Court has set a 2026 execution date for Christa Gail Pike, who has been on death row for over 30 years. Pike was 18 in 1995 when she was convicted of the brutal murder of a 19-year-old romantic rival, an attack that included torture and the carving of a pentagram into the victim's chest. If the execution proceeds, she will be the first woman executed in the state in more than two centuries. Her attorneys argue that her young age and undiagnosed mental health issues at the time of the crime would likely have prevented a death sentence today.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to look at the market's top-performing stocks from the third quarter as a guide for the remainder of the year. He noted that fund managers often buy these recent winners to bolster their portfolios, suggesting that companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, and Warner Bros. Discovery could see continued gains. However, Cramer cautioned that while these stocks may continue to inch higher, the most significant gains for the year may have already occurred. His analysis pointed to the AI boom and potential corporate takeovers as key drivers for some of the quarter's biggest winners. (not investment advice)</p>

Contrary to some claims, common vegetable and sunflower oils are not unhealthy and are high in beneficial polyunsaturated fats when used to replace saturated fats like butter. The article also clarifies that modern margarines are safe and can help reduce bad cholesterol, and that while extra virgin olive oil is not ideal for deep frying due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying.</p>

An analysis found that 21 of Russia's 38 large refineries have been hit since January, with attacks soaring in August and September. The strikes, some reaching deep into Russian territory, have forced at least 10 refineries to suspend operations. This campaign is a key part of Ukraine's strategy to damage Russia's economy and undermine its ability to fund the war, impacting both military logistics and civilian life.</p>
