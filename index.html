          <p>The new German government, a coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD, has begun its term facing significant challenges. The economy is struggling, and the far-right AfD poses a strong opposition. The government aims to strengthen the economy, limit illegal migration, and restore order, but faces resistance from within, particularly regarding social policy cuts. Chancellor Merz emphasizes closer European cooperation and plans to establish a National Security Council. The government also intends to implement stricter border controls to address asylum-seeker issues, which has already drawn criticism from neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a plan to encourage undocumented immigrants to self-deport, including offering $1,000 bonuses and paid travel. This initiative, dubbed "Project Homecoming," aims to make it easier for individuals to leave the U.S. voluntarily. Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies, supplementing current efforts by deputizing state and local law enforcement. Trump has stated that those who stay in America illegally face punishments, including jail time, financial penalties, and deportation.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, during a joint visit to Kyiv, pressured Russia to agree to a 30-day cease-fire in Ukraine, threatening new sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if Russia does not comply.

Ukraine's foreign minister indicated that Ukraine and its allies are ready for a full unconditional cease-fire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days, starting on Monday, but the Kremlin dismissed the threat of new sanctions.</p>

The Teal Wand allows women to collect a sample at home and mail it in for lab analysis.

The test is expected to be available first in California starting in June, with plans to expand across the country.</p>

          <p>European leaders have urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine starting on Monday, threatening Russia with "massive" sanctions if it does not comply. The announcement was made at a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Kyiv, with leaders from France, Germany, the UK, and Poland hosted by Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia has so far insisted that before considering a ceasefire, the West must first halt its military aid to Ukraine. Macron said the planned truce would be monitored mainly by the US, with help from European countries.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket booster malfunction, reentered the atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean.

While the United States focused on Mars, the Soviet Union dedicated resources to Venus, achieving several milestones in planetary exploration.

          <p>After days of intense fighting, India and Pakistan agreed to a cease-fire, though reports of violence persisted in some areas. President Trump announced the agreement, claiming U.S. mediation, a claim India disputed. The conflict, marked by missile and drone strikes, began after militants killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir. Both sides have presented conflicting accounts of the attacks, making it difficult to verify the precise nature and location of the incidents.</p>

Rising sea levels and extreme weather events threaten coastal stopover locations, while ocean acidification impacts the crustaceans that migratory birds rely on for sustenance. Warmer temperatures can disrupt migration routes, leading to conflicts with resident animals. The article emphasizes the importance of international treaties and bird-friendly habitats to minimize risks for migrating birds and maintain ecosystem health.</p>
