        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with several quantum computing companies, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, about acquiring equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This strategy aligns with recent government investments in other sectors deemed vital to national security, such as rare earth minerals and advanced semiconductors. The policy reflects a growing trend of direct federal intervention to bolster key domestic industries and maintain a technological advantage, particularly in competition with China. This approach aims to ensure the government benefits from the growth it helps finance in strategically critical fields. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's top leadership has outlined a five-year plan focused on stimulating domestic consumption and advancing homegrown technology amid ongoing tensions with the United States. The policy emphasizes balancing consumption with effective investment to expand internal demand, a shift from previous years' heavy reliance on investment-led growth. While the government aims to create new demand through new supply, it is avoiding direct cash handouts to consumers, instead favoring targeted subsidies and public service investments. Analysts express some skepticism, noting a lack of new fiscal commitments may limit the policy's impact on boosting consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has imposed sanctions on two state-linked Chinese oil refineries and a Hong Kong-based trader for their role in supporting Russia's war economy. These entities are part of a larger package targeting 15 Chinese and Hong Kong-registered companies involved in illicit trade with Russia. Beijing responded sharply, stating it does not provide lethal weapons and maintains strict export controls, arguing that normal trade with Russia continues with many countries, including the US and those in Europe. The sanctioned companies include subsidiaries of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has not yet issued a formal endorsement for Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia, maintaining a degree of distance similar to his approach with Governor Glenn Youngkin's successful 2021 campaign. While Trump has fully endorsed Attorney General Jason Miyares for reelection, his comments about Earle-Sears have been complimentary but indirect. This strategy may be an attempt to appeal to moderate voters in a closely divided state where a direct association with Trump could be a liability. Earle-Sears has expressed gratitude for Trump's support, while her running mate has emphasized running an independent campaign.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has announced that resident doctors in England will stage a five-day strike starting November 14 after negotiations with the government broke down. This marks the 13th strike in a long-running dispute over pay and working conditions since March 2023. The BMA states that despite recent pay raises, resident doctors' real-term pay remains significantly lower than in 2008 due to inflation. The walkout is expected to cause major disruptions to both emergency and routine care, with senior doctors stepping in to provide cover across the National Health Service.</p>

          <p>Bonnie Chan, the CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), has warned that ongoing geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty could dampen the outlook for initial public offerings (IPOs). Speaking at a financial forum in Shanghai, Chan noted that despite some recent large listings, it is too early to declare a full recovery for the market. Her cautionary tone comes as a tariff truce between the U.S. and China is set to expire, with President Trump threatening further tariffs on Chinese goods. To mitigate risks, Chan stated that the HKEX plans to diversify its revenue by strengthening its fixed-income product offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former British paratrooper, known only as Soldier F, has been acquitted of murder and attempted murder charges related to the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Northern Ireland. The veteran was accused of killing two men, James Wray and William McKinney, during a civil rights march where soldiers shot 13 unarmed people. The trial concluded after decades of campaigning by victims' families, a landmark 2010 inquiry that found the killings unjustified, and a formal apology from the UK government. The prosecution's case was hampered by the inadmissibility of key evidence from the inquiry, leading to the not-guilty verdict.</p>

          <p>As savers seek returns that can outpace inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) have become an attractive option due to their competitive rates and safety, with balances typically insured up to $250,000. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 1.97%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some six-month and one-year CDs exceeding 4.25% APY. The current economic environment has created an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often provide better returns than long-term ones. Experts suggest strategies like CD laddering to take advantage of high short-term rates while maintaining long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House has paused billions in funding for infrastructure like a New York subway line and clean-energy initiatives in blue states, actions the article describes as a partisan effort to reshape the country's economic geography. While this strategy may cause significant disruption, the article argues it could ultimately harm Republican-leaning regions more due to broader economic impacts from policies like Medicaid cuts and trade wars, which disproportionately affect their constituencies.</p>

These rates are considerably lower than many alternatives and are expected to decrease if the Federal Reserve implements further rate cuts.

          <p>Following a fourth consecutive defeat, Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk called a players-only meeting to openly discuss the team's recent struggles. The summit took place after a 2-1 home loss to Manchester United, which left the club joint third in the Premier League. Van Dijk emphasized that it was not a "crisis meeting" but an opportunity for the squad to come together and address their low morale and poor form. The team responded positively, ending their losing streak with a decisive 5-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League shortly after the internal discussion.</p>

          <p>China is responding to the Trump administration's tough trade policies with increasingly assertive measures of its own, signaling a shift in its diplomatic and economic strategy. Beijing has recently tightened export controls on rare-earth metals, which are vital for U.S. national security and tech industries, and has sanctioned subsidiaries of a key U.S. partner in shipbuilding. These actions, combined with earlier moves like halting U.S. soybean purchases, demonstrate China's willingness to leverage its economic power to counter American pressure. This escalating tension sets a contentious stage for an anticipated meeting between the two nations' leaders.</p>

          <p>A jury has convicted six men of rioting in the Ely area of Cardiff in May 2023, with a seventh man acquitted of the charge. The violent disorder erupted after two teenagers, Kyrees Sullivan and Harvey Evans, died in an e-bike crash, which sparked false rumors on social media that they were being pursued by police. The unrest involved a crowd of 100 to 150 people and continued for several hours. CCTV footage later confirmed that a police vehicle had been following the boys shortly before the fatal crash. The six convicted men have been granted bail but were warned to expect significant prison sentences.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police officer, PC Philip Neilson, has been dismissed for gross misconduct after a BBC Panorama investigation recorded him making highly racist and discriminatory comments. The undercover footage captured Neilson referring to an "invasion" of "scum" from the Middle East and making offensive remarks about other ethnic groups. He was also recorded glorifying inappropriate use of force and suggesting unlawful violence against migrants. Despite arguing his comments only amounted to misconduct, a disciplinary panel ruled his actions caused significant harm to public confidence in the police and dismissed him immediately.</p>

          <p>The rate of rent growth for single-family homes in the United States has slowed dramatically, hitting its lowest level in 15 years. According to data firm Cotality, rents rose just 1.4% year-over-year in August, a significant drop from the 2.3% gain seen in July and well below the previous year's average. This cooling trend is observed across all price tiers, though regional variations exist, with cities like Chicago still seeing robust growth while Dallas experienced a slight decline. The slowdown mirrors a similar trend in the multifamily apartment sector, where a construction boom has increased supply and pushed the national vacancy rate to a record high.

          <p>The seven U.S. states that rely on the Colorado River are engaged in high-stakes negotiations over how to share its dwindling water supply as current agreements expire in 2026. Prolonged drought and a warming climate have left the river basin at a breaking point, with its largest reservoirs, Lakes Mead and Powell, at critically low levels. The conflict pits the Upper Basin states against the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona, and Nevada over complex water rights. A major point of contention is the large amount of water used for agriculture, particularly for water-intensive cattle-feed crops like alfalfa.</p>

The demolition, which has already begun, marks a significant expansion of a project previously described as an addition that would not interfere with the current building. The move has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and conservationists, who raise concerns about transparency and the lack of public review for a project impacting a national historic landmark.

This strategic consolidation is seen as a pivotal step for Europe to enhance its technological sovereignty and build a more resilient and competitive presence in the global space market.

While the record 8.7% COLA in 2023 provided significant relief during peak inflation, recent adjustments have been more modest as inflation has cooled. However, many retirees report that costs for essentials like healthcare, food, and housing continue to outpace the annual increases, leading some to wish for a larger adjustment to better reflect their actual cost of living.

During a visit to Israel, Vance reiterated that the Trump administration's policy is that the West Bank will not be annexed, underscoring U.S. opposition to the measure. The public rebuke is part of an intense diplomatic effort by Washington to maintain momentum for a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza and prevent actions that could destabilize the region further.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, France is reportedly retreating from a recent commitment to more aggressively intercept small migrant boats crossing the English Channel. A promised new "maritime doctrine," which would involve turning boats back to shore, is now being described as a "political stunt" that may never be implemented. The delay is attributed partly to France's current political turmoil and to safety concerns within the French navy about the dangers of such interventions. This development is a setback for the UK government's efforts to stop the crossings, as dangerously overcrowded boats continue to depart from the French coast.</p>
