        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill, granting parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks, but the proposed change will extend this critical support. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that the new law will give people essential time away from work to grieve. This move has been widely praised by campaigners and politicians as a significant step forward in recognizing all pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement deserving of formal support.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called on BRICS member states to take collective action in response to potential tariff threats from the United States under former President Trump. Speaking at the bloc's meeting, Li urged members to uphold independence, build consensus, and preserve global peace and stability through cooperation. The premier's comments position the BRICS group, which is perceived as a challenge to the Western-led world order, as a united front for championing the peaceful settlement of disputes. This call for solidarity comes as a temporary tariff truce with the U.S. is set to expire.</p>

          <p>A highly advanced British F-35B fighter jet has been grounded at an airport in Kerala, India, for over three weeks after a technical snag forced it to divert during a sortie. A specialized 14-member engineering team from the UK has now arrived with specialist equipment to assess and repair the $110 million aircraft. The plane, which was operating from the HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier, has been unable to fly, prompting questions and even jokes in India. If the new team cannot fix the jet, it will need to be dismantled and transported out via a large cargo plane.</p>

          <p>The United States has lifted a ban on selling American jet engine components to China, a move expected to significantly aid the production of China's homegrown C919 aircraft. This allows the state-owned manufacturer Comac to continue importing critical parts from a GE-invested joint venture, enabling the fulfillment of hundreds of existing orders. While this decision supports Comac's ambitions to expand into European markets, analysts suggest that previous US restrictions have strengthened China's resolve to develop its own engine technology. The deal is seen as crucial for maintaining the current production pace of the narrowbody C919 jet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the European housing crisis, fueled by the financial sector, has become a major source of political disenfranchisement and inequality. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have increasingly treated housing as a lucrative asset class, driving up prices and rents from Dublin to Berlin. This "financialization" of housing has shifted power from residents to investors, who profit from housing shortages and often push for deregulation. The author contends that this system, which prioritizes profit over social need, is failing to provide affordable homes and is fueling support for far-right political movements across the continent.</p>

          <p>Chloe Childress, a recent high school graduate and counselor at Camp Mystic, has been identified as one of the victims of the devastating floods in Hunt, Texas. She was set to attend the University of Texas at Austin in the fall. The head of her high school remembered her as a compassionate and empathetic leader who had a remarkable ability to make others feel valued and safe. Childress was praised for her selfless commitment to others, a quality she reportedly demonstrated in her final moments. Her death is part of a larger tragedy that claimed at least 80 lives in the region.</p>

          <h2>Breakthrough Gene Therapy Injection Shows Promise in Reversing Congenital Hearing Loss</h2>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with some participants regaining significant hearing within weeks. The research, detailed in Nature Medicine, focused on individuals with hearing loss caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. The therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver a functional copy of the gene into the inner ear. All 10 participants showed improvement, with children responding best, offering hope that this approach could be adapted for other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has created confusion over the timeline for new tariffs, with the president stating letters would be sent to trade partners by July 9, while his commerce secretary clarified the new rates would take effect on August 1. This new date offers a three-week reprieve for countries but extends the period of uncertainty for importers and has caused jitters in Asian stock markets. Trump also announced plans to send letters dictating new tariff rates and deals, further roiling global trade relations. The lack of clarity complicates negotiations for countries racing to finalize trade agreements with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Campaigners are urging the UK government not to abolish education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). In a public letter, they warn that removing these legally binding documents could deny thousands of children vital support or even access to education. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has not ruled out scrapping EHCPs, calling it a "complex and sensitive area" while promising to strengthen support. The debate comes as the number of children with EHCPs has risen, placing financial strain on local authorities and prompting a government review of the system.</p>

          <p>A top police official in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province has accused the country's police minister and other senior figures of interfering in investigations into political assassinations. Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi alleged that officials were shielding politically connected individuals and obstructing police work. The allegations have been described by President Cyril Ramaphosa as a matter of "grave national security concern" and have prompted calls from opposition parties for an urgent parliamentary debate and an independent inquiry. The police minister has denied the claims, which surface amid a documented rise in targeted political killings in the country.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched air strikes on three ports and a power plant in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, targeting infrastructure it claims is used to support the rebel group's attacks. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repeated Houthi missile attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. One target was the Galaxy Leader, a commercial ship hijacked by the Houthis in 2023 and allegedly used for surveillance. Following the Israeli attacks, the Houthis launched two missiles toward Israel, escalating the regional conflict that has been simmering since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <p>A research team from Fuzhou University in China has developed a novel vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots" that can adapt to extreme changes in light more rapidly than the human eye. The system is also designed to overcome the limitations of current sensors by providing faster computation while using less energy. This innovative technology mimics the human visual system's ability to adjust to different lighting conditions and memorize those settings for quicker future adaptation. The breakthrough represents a significant advancement in machine vision, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and advanced imaging.</p>

          <h2>Scrutiny Mounts Over Adequacy of Official Warnings Ahead of Deadly Texas Floods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of the devastating Texas floods that killed nearly 80 people, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate warnings to the public. While the National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings with several hours of lead time, some local officials stated the sheer scale and speed of the deluge were unexpected. The Kerr County judge noted that the area lacks a county-wide warning siren system due to cost. The tragedy has also drawn attention to budget cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, though the NWS defended its performance, stating its forecasts were timely and precise.</p>
