        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's recent Victory Day parade served as a significant geopolitical message, primarily targeting middle powers across the Global South rather than Western nations like the United States. The event, featuring North Korean leader Kim Jong Un alongside Russia's Vladimir Putin, projected an image of a powerful alternative to Western-dominated global frameworks. This alignment signaled that Beijing offers diplomatic legitimacy and pathways for development without demanding internal reforms, appealing to nations grappling with military capabilities and seeking to avoid Cold War entanglements. Domestically, the parade aimed to reassure Chinese citizens of the nation's strength despite international pressure, while internationally, it underscored the perceived limitations of Western sanctions.</p>

          <p>East Los Angeles held its 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade with a renewed spirit of defiance, despite ongoing immigration raids by the Trump administration and a recent Supreme Court ruling expanding federal agents' powers. Participants, including many Mexican Americans, expressed pride and a commitment to fighting for their rights, though attendance appeared lower than previous years due to fear. Local leaders and Mayor Karen Bass denounced the raids as abhorrent, emphasizing Los Angeles's identity as a city of immigrants. The event highlighted a blend of cultural celebration and proud resistance against discriminatory policies, even as some families faced personal fears.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian advocates for China to establish its own knowledge system, particularly in artificial intelligence, to avoid "intellectual colonialism" stemming from Western social sciences. He argues that Western theories, based on their own practices and experiences, fail to adequately explain diverse civilizations like Confucian, Islamic, and Indian societies. Zheng emphasizes that the meaning of society and technology is deeply intertwined with humanities and social sciences. Therefore, China should fully embrace its secular civilization to play a proper role in the international order and build an AI that reflects its unique societal values.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Utah have arrested two men following the discovery of an incendiary device placed under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City. The device, found on Friday, was lit but failed to detonate as intended, prompting a bomb squad response. Investigators subsequently identified and apprehended the two suspects, aged 58 and 31, during a search warrant execution in Magna. The search uncovered explosives, firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction, with the men potentially facing charges related to weapons possession and terrorism threats. A motive for the attempted attack and the relationship between the suspects remain unknown.</p>

          <p>Chloé Zhao's film "Hamnet," exploring Shakespeare's family life and the influence of his son's death on "Hamlet," has won the prestigious People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. This award is often a strong indicator of future Oscar success, as seen with Zhao's previous film "Nomadland." The festival also honored other films, including Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” as runners-up. Additionally, "The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue" won the Documentary award, and "No Other Choice" received the International People’s Choice Award.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as UK ambassador to the United States, citing deep corruption within the system. Business Secretary Peter Kyle admitted Mandelson's appointment was "highly unlikely" if the full extent of his relationship with Epstein had been known. Mandelson was recently sacked after emails revealed supportive messages to Epstein during his 2008 sexual offense charges. Giuffre's family, speaking after her death by suicide, called for greater accountability for individuals connected to Epstein, emphasizing the need for justice and transparency.</p>

          <p>A growing number of car owners are "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicle's worth, with 26.6% of new car trade-ins in Q2 2025 having negative equity—a four-year high. This trend forces drivers to either pay the balance in cash or roll it into a new loan, increasing their overall debt. Factors contributing to this include depreciation, longer loan terms (like 84-month loans now comprising 21.6% of new auto loans), and smaller down payments. Experts advise consumers to research credit scores, seek pre-approvals, and consider guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance to mitigate risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals a surge in maternal and infant deaths in Afghanistan following the Trump administration's abrupt cuts to US aid, which led to the closure of over 400 medical facilities. Families like Abdul's, whose wife and newborn died after finding their local clinic shut, exemplify the devastating human cost. While the US justified the cuts over concerns of funds reaching the Taliban, the Taliban denies this, and the UN's role in aid distribution is noted. The closures have overwhelmed remaining hospitals and exacerbated Afghanistan's already high maternal mortality rates, with a ban on women's higher education further limiting healthcare access.</p>
