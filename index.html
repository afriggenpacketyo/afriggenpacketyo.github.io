Kennedy asserts that the administration has the authority to ensure fair pricing and is prepared to take decisive action to protect American patients and encourage innovation.

          <p>Maureen Dowd pens a somber reflection on the decline of Joe Biden, highlighting his transformation from a gregarious and empathetic leader to an isolated and embittered figure. The article suggests that Biden's hubris and clinging to power, fueled by a protective inner circle, ultimately harmed his party and legacy. Dowd points to the debate as a turning point, exposing a steep mental decline that his advisors attempted to conceal. The article also criticizes the Democratic establishment for failing to address the issue, drawing parallels to the Republican's handling of Donald Trump's behavior.

          <p>The Israeli military announced preparations to expand its ground campaign in Gaza, aiming to seize more territory and displace additional civilians, accompanied by intensified airstrikes. Hospitals in Gaza reported over 140 deaths on Friday alone, as mediators seek a new truce to halt the ongoing conflict. Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed to drastically expand military operations to force Hamas's surrender and the release of hostages, though previous efforts have been unsuccessful. The UN has warned of a growing risk of famine in Gaza due to an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid, exacerbating the already dire situation for the territory's two million residents.</p>

The author suggests that the media should have prioritized defending democracy and the rule of law, rather than focusing solely on Biden's age.

          <p>CNBC reports on the high costs associated with long-term care, highlighting that many households are unprepared for the expense. The article notes that over half of Americans turning 65 today will require long-term care, with average future costs exceeding $122,000. It explains that health insurance and Medicare often don't cover these expenses, leaving individuals to rely on Medicaid or out-of-pocket payments. The piece also discusses long-term care insurance options, emphasizing the importance of proactive planning and discussing needs with family members. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Guardian reports that US House Republicans are proposing new fees on immigrants seeking to remain in the United States, a move that advocates warn will create insurmountable financial barriers. Legislation moving through the GOP-controlled House of Representatives could require immigrants to pay potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars to seek asylum, care for a minor in the government’s custody, or apply for humanitarian parole. The fees were proposed as the Trump administration looks for novel ways to push immigrants out, including by offering them cash to leave. The bill gives a preview of what more will come, should the president receive the tens of billions of dollars he has requested from Congress.</p>

          <p>The Guardian reports on the Trump administration's efforts to deport international students over their pro-Palestinian speech, noting recent setbacks in court. While the government seems to be getting clobbered in court, the fundamental question at the heart of the cases – whether the government has the authority to detain and deport noncitizens over their political speech – is far from settled. The arrests have prompted widespread anxiety among international students and scholars and significantly contributed to a climate of fear and repression on US campuses. Despite occasional efforts to revive it, last year’s mass campus protest movement has been significantly dampened, even as Israel’s war in Gaza – the focus of the protests – is only escalating.</p>

It also notes the book's claim that there was a conspiracy to conceal Biden's symptoms from the press, public, and top Democrats. The article also mentions that there was a lack of compassion for Biden's last campaign and that there was a need to be honest.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reports that some German tourists are avoiding travel to the U.S. due to fears of harassment or detention by immigration authorities. The article highlights the case of a Berlin tattoo artist who was detained for six weeks and the resulting negative perception of the U.S. in Germany. The number of German visitors to the United States was down 28% in March from the year before, according to data from the International Trade Administration, a German government agency. The article also quotes German citizens expressing their concerns about potential mistreatment and the impact on their travel plans.</p>

          <p>A key committee of the Los Angeles City Council voted to reduce the number of city employees targeted for layoff by Mayor Karen Bass, bringing the total down to an estimated 650. The council’s budget committee took steps to save more than 1,000 jobs by pursuing an array of cost-cutting measures, such as hiring fewer police officers and scaling back funding for Bass’ Inside Safe program. The budget committee also agreed to eliminate 42 emergency incident technicians at the fire department, a move opposed by interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva, while also canceling Bass’ plan for a new homelessness unit within that agency. The article suggests that city officials will keep finding ways to reduce the number of layoffs.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist argues that the Lakers should prioritize drafting older, more experienced players in the NBA draft, particularly those who have navigated the challenges of college life and NIL deals. The piece contends that the league's economic shifts have led to an overemphasis on "high ceiling" players, neglecting the value of maturity and resilience. The columnist suggests that the Lakers should seek a 24-year-old college graduate with a strong work ethic and financial responsibility, rather than focusing solely on raw talent. The article also suggests that the increase in technology and nutrition has extended the youth for professional athletes.</p>

          <p>The South China Morning Post reports that China cut its stockpile of US Treasuries in March, before its trade war with US President Donald Trump escalated, stepping aside from its position as the No 2 overseas holder. As foreign holdings rose for a third straight month to an all-time peak of US$9.05 trillion in March, China’s stockpile slid to US$765.4 billion, down US$18.9 billion from the previous month and ending an upswing in holdings in the January-February period.

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reports that the Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan detainees accused of being members of a violent gang under the Alien Enemies Act. The justices sent the case back to a federal appeals court to examine claims by the migrants that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act. President Trump reacted with fury to the ruling. Lawyers for the migrants responded with relief. The decision “means that more individuals will not secretly be sent to a brutal prison in El Salvador,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has given his strongest signal yet that a youth mobility scheme could form part of a new deal with the EU. The UK already has reciprocal agreements with countries, including Australia, that allow young people to work in another country. She understands that the EU has been pushing for stays as long as four years, while the UK is not contemplating more than one or two. An agreement is expected to be announced at Monday's summit, which is being held at London's Lancaster House.</p>
