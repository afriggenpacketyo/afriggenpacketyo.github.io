          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's gut, particularly Bifidobacterium longum, may protect against dangerous infections. The study found that infants with this bacteria were half as likely to be hospitalized with lung infections in their first two years. Researchers believe early microbial encounters are crucial for immune system development, and this finding could lead to new therapies to boost beneficial bacteria in babies. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked the deportation of the wife and children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack. The judge cited potential irreparable harm and the need to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case. Soliman, an Egyptian national, is accused of a hate crime for attacking demonstrators supporting Israeli hostages. The family's lawyers argued that punishing them for the crimes of a relative violates democratic justice principles.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The FDA confirmed the plans in a statement to CBS News Tuesday, but did not respond to questions about when the review is scheduled to start and what exactly it will be reviewing about the medication. Experts say concerns about its safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions and is funded by multiple right-wing organizations.</p>
