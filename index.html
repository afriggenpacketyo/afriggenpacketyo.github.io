          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, allowing his immigration proceedings to continue outside of custody. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil is neither a flight risk nor a threat to the community, criticizing the "highly unusual" nature of his detention. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March, and the Department of Homeland Security cited omissions in his green card application as justification for continued detention. The judge found a lack of evidence supporting the allegations and suggested the immigration charge was being used to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel speech, which led to the judge ordering that he not be electronically monitored.</p>

Tensions have escalated following attacks between Iran and Israel, which began after the Hamas attack in October 2023. President Trump has set a two-week deadline to decide on potential U.S. military intervention, while European officials seek a diplomatic resolution. Markets have been unsettled by the potential for wider conflict in the Middle East, leading to a flight to safe-haven assets and increased interest in defense companies, and the Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed concern about the possibility of the world heading toward World War III.</p>

          <p>A new CDC report indicates a significant increase in hypertension deaths linked to excessive alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers found a 51.6% rise in the estimated average number of hypertension deaths from excessive alcohol consumption between 2020-2021 compared to 2016-2017. This increase translates to approximately 21,137 deaths annually, up from 13,941. The report also highlights that over 60% of these deaths occurred among females, and excessive alcohol use accounted for 1 in 5 hypertension deaths among females and 1 in 8 among males during the 2020-2021 period, with these findings coming as alcohol-related deaths in the U.S. have been on the rise.</p>

While she has not set any absolute red lines, Murkowski has emphasized her reservations about the Medicaid proposals, citing Alaska's high healthcare costs and the significant percentage of Alaskan children relying on Medicaid. She acknowledged the need to address entitlement spending but stressed that it should not disproportionately burden the most vulnerable populations.

The delays have reduced the survival chances for some children, who often arrive with advanced diseases and malnutrition due to the ongoing conflict and restrictions on aid entering Gaza.

Fat Joe's lawyer stated that law enforcement is aware of the extortionate demand and that the allegations are complete fabrications intended to damage his reputation and force a settlement.

These incentives benefit tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, but critics argue that data centers don't create many jobs while consuming immense amounts of electricity. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, with 16 states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. While some states like Virginia see some economic benefit from these exemptions, others are experiencing significant revenue losses, raising questions about the overall value for taxpayers.

          <p>Tesla is preparing to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless trip expected on June 28. The initial rollout will include a limited number of Model Y vehicles operating in a geofenced area of the city, with remote drivers monitoring as a backup. Access to the vehicles and rides will be by invitation only, with some social media influencers receiving early access invites. Analysts believe robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, but the company is seen as lagging behind competitors like Waymo in the self-driving technology space.</p>

          <p>Tesla has signed its first agreement to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, amid ongoing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The project, which Tesla announced on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, is expected to be the largest of its kind in China upon completion. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems are essential for balancing electricity grids, particularly with the increasing use of intermittent energy sources like solar and wind. The deal, valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million), involves Tesla, the local government of Shanghai, and financing firm China Kangfu International Leasing.</p>

          <p>The film *Materialists* explores modern dating through Lucy, a matchmaker who sees dating as a marketplace where a suitor’s net worth is the most important factor. Lucy finds herself in a love triangle between a wealthy partner in a private equity firm and an aspiring actor, forcing her to confront the conflict between her past idealism and her current pragmatism. The film critiques the commodification of love, but its ideas are scattershot and its characters thinly written, particularly Lucy, whose transformation from skeptic to believer feels unearned. While the film has enjoyable moments, it ultimately fails to cohere into an emotionally potent tale, lacking the depth and specificity of director Celine Song's previous work, *Past Lives*.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing practice of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks during enforcement actions is criticized for undermining their authority and endangering public safety. Masking contradicts Homeland Security regulations requiring officers to identify themselves and can confuse bystanders, risking interference with enforcement actions. It also raises concerns about potential civil rights violations and due process issues, as it gives agents impunity to make unlawful arrests without accountability. The author argues that the need for public accountability outweighs any rationale for agents' anonymity, and suggests that Congress should ban the use of masks by immigration agents.</p>

          <p>Haim’s fourth LP, “I Quit,” explores the space between breakup and moving on, reflecting on a relationship that didn’t work and assessing the lessons learned. The album musicalizes this state of transition with songs that go in multiple directions at once, blending familiar comforts with new sonic explorations. The lyrics touch on nostalgia, sharply drawn memories, and emotional vulnerability, particularly regarding the complexities of family support and personal growth. The album captures the emotional complexities of choosing who to leave behind and who to embrace, ultimately finding solace in the enduring bonds of family.</p>

          <p>River Island is planning to close 33 shops in the UK, putting hundreds of jobs at risk, due to more people shopping online and rising costs. The clothing retailer also wants its landlords to cut rents at a further 71 stores that are at risk. The family-owned retailer, which currently has 230 shops and employs about 5,500 people, made a £33.2m loss in 2023 after sales fell 19%. The chain intends to consult employees over the possible job losses and will redeploy staff where possible.</p>
