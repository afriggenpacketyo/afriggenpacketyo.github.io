          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, seeking amendments to achieve a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. A senior Hamas official indicated the response includes notes and amendments, particularly regarding U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli force withdrawal. A draft deal suggests Israel would release prisoners and deceased Palestinians, with humanitarian aid contingent on Hamas's agreement. The U.N. reports dire food shortages in Gaza, with aid trucks being stopped and offloaded by desperate civilians amid ongoing Israeli military operations that have resulted in numerous casualties on both sides, underscoring the urgency of the situation.

          <p>Researchers have developed a face "e-tattoo" to track brainwaves and mental workload in high-stress professions such as pilots, doctors, and emergency dispatchers. The device, temporarily attached to the forehead, uses EEG and EOG to measure brain waves and eye movements, offering a more cost-effective and compact solution than traditional machines. The study involved participants performing tasks of varying difficulty, with the e-tattoo detecting shifts in brainwave activity corresponding to higher mental workload. While currently a lab prototype costing $200, further development is needed for commercialization, including real-time decoding and validation in realistic environments, as this innovation has the potential to improve training and performance in mentally demanding careers.</p>

Norrie acknowledged the difficulty in managing the noise, while Fearnley downplayed its impact on his performance, as he double faulted on match point.

          <p>Eric Spofford, former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers in New Hampshire, was arrested for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to stalk journalists from New Hampshire Public Radio in retaliation for an article detailing sexual misconduct allegations against him.

          <p>Hamas responded to a US ceasefire proposal by expressing willingness to release 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, while requesting amendments to the plan. The group reiterated demands for a permanent truce, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and guarantees for continuous humanitarian aid, which are not part of the current deal. US envoy Steve Witkoff labeled the response "totally unacceptable." Hamas faces pressure from both the dire conditions in Gaza and the threat of an escalated Israeli ground offensive.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), aimed at reforestation, is facing scrutiny due to satellite data and field reports suggesting limited forest restoration. An analysis of satellite images indicates deforestation events on NGP land, with native trees cleared for cash crops. Local communities often have short-term access to the land and are required to grow single cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods. The program was intended to regrow native rainforests, but many designated protection areas have little to no tree cover, with independent audits suggesting issues remain unaddressed.</p>

This article argues that the apparent increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and better screening, rather than a novel toxin.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis that has forced school closures and triggered citywide inspections. The crisis began after a child tested positive for high lead levels, leading to the discovery of lead paint and dust in schools. Federal support from the CDC has been denied due to restructuring under the Trump administration, leaving Milwaukee to navigate the crisis independently. This situation highlights the challenges faced by cities when federal assistance is unavailable during public health emergencies.</p>
