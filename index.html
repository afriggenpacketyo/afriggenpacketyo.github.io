        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are struggling to gather enough support for President Trump's significant domestic policy legislation ahead of a self-imposed deadline. A crucial procedural vote to begin debate on the bill remains in jeopardy due to opposition from both moderate and conservative members of the party who are dissatisfied with changes made by the Senate. Despite a strong pressure campaign from the White House, including direct meetings with holdouts, party leadership has been forced to keep the vote open indefinitely while they attempt to persuade skeptical lawmakers. The bill extends tax cuts and increases spending on border security and defense, but its passage remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's signature tax-and-spending package is facing a major setback in the House, as Republican leaders have failed to secure enough votes to advance the bill. At least five GOP members, spanning the party's ideological spectrum, voted against the procedural rule required to begin floor debate, effectively stalling the legislation. The defections from both moderates concerned about Medicaid cuts and hardline conservatives highlight deep divisions within the party. This development puts Speaker Mike Johnson in a difficult position, as any new changes to appease House members would require sending the bill back to the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has lifted its export restrictions on crucial chip-design software to China, as announced by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence.

Both firms, along with Siemens EDA, dominate the global electronic design automation (EDA) market, which is essential for designing modern semiconductors.

Rescue operations are underway, and thus far, 29 survivors have been pulled from the water. The vessel was traveling from Java to Bali, a common route for local residents, when it reportedly experienced engine trouble before sinking. Marine accidents are a persistent issue in the Indonesian archipelago, where safety regulations are often inconsistently enforced, leading to frequent tragedies on the water.

          <p>A federal jury acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, charges related to the Mann Act. The verdict came after a high-profile trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends who described a culture of coercion and abuse. Combs, who appeared startled by the guilty verdicts but triumphant overall, will remain in detention while awaiting sentencing, which is proposed for October.

          <p>With a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become a significant factor in legislative battles. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, a tie in the House of Representatives means the motion or bill in question automatically fails. According to House rules, if the votes are equal, the question is lost. This procedural reality was highlighted during a 2024 vote on impeaching a cabinet secretary, which initially tied before a member switched their vote to allow for reconsideration, demonstrating how fragile legislative majorities can be.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska defended his support for President Trump's sweeping spending bill, arguing that a 'no' vote would effectively raise taxes on middle-class families by about 20%. While acknowledging that the House's original version of the bill was better, Bacon stated the core of the legislation remains beneficial. He addressed concerns over Medicaid changes by emphasizing that they primarily focus on implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults. His comments come as House GOP leadership struggles to secure enough votes from a divided caucus, with both moderates and conservatives raising objections to the Senate-passed version.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating after a piece of a wing flap from a Delta Air Lines jet was found in the driveway of a Raleigh, North Carolina home. The part belonged to a Boeing 737 that had just landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport after a flight from Atlanta. An inspection after landing revealed that a portion of the left wing's trailing edge flap was missing. The flight was carrying 109 passengers and six crew members, and no injuries were reported. Delta is cooperating fully with the investigation to determine the cause of the incident.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that severely restricts the ability of migrants who cross the southern border to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws passed by Congress. The judge's 128-page order grants a nationwide injunction against the policy, which was implemented via an executive order on President Trump's first day in office. The decision has been praised by civil liberties and immigrant rights groups as a critical affirmation of existing U.S. asylum law.</p>

Thick smoke has engulfed the region, and authorities have closed roads and urged residents to avoid non-essential travel.

          <p>In a significant escalation of his attacks on the U.S. central bank, President Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign immediately. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump shared a news article and added the comment, "'Too Late' should resign immediately!!!" Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, whom he appointed, for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to boost the economy. The article provides context that a president's authority to remove a Fed chair is legally limited to removal "for cause," making such a move highly contentious and legally questionable.

          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has found that historical investigations into child grooming cases were significantly delayed due to Manchester City Council providing heavily redacted evidence. The watchdog noted that some pages of material had only a few words visible, making it impossible for police to assess their value. The delays particularly affected two major operations investigating historical child sexual exploitation. The council cited complex data-sharing rules, but a new, more efficient protocol for sharing unredacted documents has since been agreed upon by the police, council, and prosecutors to address the issue.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that women under 55 using a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms may face a higher risk of breast cancer. The research found that a combination of estrogen and progestin increases the risk for women who still have a uterus. Conversely, the study found that using estrogen alone, a treatment suitable for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk of breast cancer. This research adds important nuance to the understanding of hormone therapy, showing how the type and timing of treatment are crucial factors in its safety and effectiveness.</p>

Political analysts suggest this trend is not necessarily an ideological move to the right but rather a populist shift. Experts interviewed in the article theorize that many Latino voters, particularly working-class and naturalized citizens, are driven by economic concerns and feel that the Democratic party has failed to address their priorities, leading to disillusionment and a search for alternatives.</p>
