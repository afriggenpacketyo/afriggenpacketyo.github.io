            <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney has requested a pause in the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing, pending a review of a recently completed parole board risk assessment ordered by California Governor Gavin Newsom as part of their clemency appeal. The DA argues that the court should have access to the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions. Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 1989 killings of their parents, but former DA George Gascón had filed a motion to reduce their sentences, which the current DA is attempting to withdraw. The judge denied the request to withdraw the previous motion, allowing resentencing to continue. Optimism score is 40.</p>
