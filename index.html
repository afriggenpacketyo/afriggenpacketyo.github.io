          <p>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the chance to challenge their removal. This decision lifts a previous injunction and remains in effect while the Trump administration's appeal is processed. Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the decision as an abuse of the Court's discretion. The ruling has sparked strong reactions, with a Trump official praising it as a victory for national security, while immigrant rights advocates warn of potential harm to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Florida is constructing a detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," to house ICE detainees. Attorney General James Uthmeier stated the location's natural surroundings of alligators and pythons provide perimeter security.

          <p>Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized President Trump's missile strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, citing concerns about foreign wars and the national debt. However, voters in her district generally supported the president's decision, expressing satisfaction with the use of military force. Many conservative voters in the district hold Christian Zionist views, seeing the state of Israel as part of a biblical prophecy. While Greene's comments raised eyebrows, she later affirmed her support for Trump's pursuit of peace.</p>

          <p>The first evacuation flight from Israel, carrying 63 British nationals and their families, landed in the UK after airspace was closed due to conflict. Passengers criticized the evacuation plan as "shambolic," citing delays compared to other nations' efforts. One passenger noted the Foreign Office's choice of Birmingham as the landing destination was likely for cost reasons. Despite the criticism, passengers sang both the Israeli national anthem and God Save The King during the flight, showcasing unity.</p>
