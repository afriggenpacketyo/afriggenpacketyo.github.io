          <p>Thirteen security guards kidnapped from a major Peruvian gold mine were found dead, according to the mining company La Poderosa. The company blamed the abduction on informal miners allegedly linked to criminal gangs who ambushed the mine on April 26. La Poderosa stated that 39 of its workers have been killed since 1980 due to violence from groups fighting for control of the mine. The Interior Ministry said special police forces have been deployed to locate and capture those responsible for the crimes, as extortion reports have surged in the northern mining area.</p>

Bolsonaro is expected to stand trial in the coming months for allegedly attempting to stage a coup in January 2023.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Texas Democrats argue the legislation will hurt public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private schools. President Trump supported the bill, stating it was a victory for students and parents in Texas.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is on its way to becoming an official city named Starbase. A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters, mostly SpaceX employees. The creation of an official company town has drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. The city's incorporation is accompanied by efforts to shift beach closure authority from the county to the new town's mayor and city council.</p>

          <p>A de minimis tariff exemption expired on Friday, leading to potentially higher prices for cheaper goods from China. Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu relied on this loophole, which allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free. Consumers will likely see hefty tariff surcharges on their orders, and importers face the challenge of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. Experts anticipate potential delays in shipments and a diminished market for Chinese goods as prices rise, potentially benefiting companies selling goods made in the U.S.</p>
