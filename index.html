          <p>Senate Democrats are forcing a vote under the War Powers Act to block President Trump's unauthorized military strikes against boats suspected of drug trafficking near Venezuela. The resolution, led by Senators Adam Schiff and Tim Kaine, argues these actions are unconstitutional without congressional approval and risk escalating into a broader conflict. The Trump administration defends the strikes as necessary actions against cartels designated as terrorist organizations, claiming they constitute an armed attack on the U.S. Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about the legality and lack of intelligence shared by the White House.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, a 53% increase this year, reflecting growing investor anxiety about the U.S. economy and political stability. Analysts attribute the rally to several factors, including the ongoing government shutdown, which fuels economic uncertainty and diminishes data visibility. Expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts also make gold a more attractive asset compared to lower-yielding government bonds. Additionally, strong demand from global central banks seeking to reduce exposure to the U.S. dollar amid geopolitical tensions has contributed significantly to the price increase.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is warning that an existing shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown, could lead to increased flight delays across the United States. Controllers are deemed essential workers and are required to work without pay, with many on 10-hour shifts six days a week, leading to a slight increase in sick calls. Staffing shortfalls have already prompted the FAA to slow or halt arrivals at airports in Burbank and Nashville. This situation echoes a previous shutdown in 2018-2019, which ended after controller shortages caused significant disruptions to air travel in New York.</p>

          <p>Roundhill Investments has resurrected its Meme Stock ETF under the ticker MEME, aiming to provide investors with a vehicle to trade volatile, socially-driven stocks. The fund's original iteration launched in late 2021 near a market peak and was subsequently closed two years later after significant losses in popular meme stocks like GameStop and AMC. Some market analysts are viewing the ETF's relaunch as a potential indicator of market froth reaching a "fever pitch," suggesting it could signal that the current rally is losing steam. The new version of the fund includes holdings like Opendoor Technologies, reflecting the latest generation of trending meme stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The man responsible for the deadly attack outside a Manchester synagogue, Jihad Al-Shamie, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a 999 call made after the incident. Al-Shamie was shot dead by police after killing two men, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, in a car and knife attack. An investigation by the police watchdog confirmed Mr. Daulby died from a police gunshot wound, and another man was non-fatally injured by police gunfire.

          <p>In an opinion article, U.S. Senator and Illinois Army National Guard veteran Tammy Duckworth condemns President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to American cities like Chicago. She argues the move is an unconstitutional abuse of power, using the military to intimidate citizens and serve the president's political agenda rather than for its intended purpose of national defense. Duckworth asserts that these deployments are based on fabricated claims of chaos and do not make the nation safer, as Guard members are not trained for urban policing. She states that the troops swore an oath to the Constitution, not to one individual.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Prison in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a months-long manhunt. His arrest was the result of a coordinated multi-agency operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. The May 16 jailbreak, which occurred through a hole behind a toilet, was attributed by the sheriff to prison staffing shortages and significant design flaws in the facility. At least 16 other individuals, including a former jail employee, are facing charges for allegedly aiding the fugitives after their escape from the New Orleans jail.</p>

A slight majority of 10-9 favored two additional quarter-point cuts by the end of 2025, while others advocated for a more cautious approach. The discussion reflected a shift in focus toward growing downside risks to employment, even as inflation was still expected to ease.

Huang, who immigrated from Taiwan as a child, emphasized that immigration is a cornerstone of the American dream. While confirming Nvidia will cover the new fees for its employees, he expressed hope for policy enhancements that still allow for serendipitous opportunities for aspiring immigrants.</p>

Alison Morton, CEO of the Institute of Health Visiting, stated that the move left vulnerable children without necessary protection, contributing to tragic outcomes like the deaths of Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. The redeployment left remaining health visitors with unmanageable caseloads and led to a reliance on virtual visits, which were identified as factors in some child deaths.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, with more expected this year, rates on savings vehicles like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are declining from their recent highs. While the 6-7% rates of the past are gone, savers can still find competitive returns, particularly with short-term CDs offering rates above 4%. These rates remain significantly higher than traditional savings accounts, and locking one in now can protect earnings against future rate reductions. Experts suggest that savers should act quickly as rates have likely peaked and should compare offerings from online banks, which typically provide higher yields than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

          <p>Suman Mokhtarian, a 33-year-old former UFC featherweight, was shot and killed in what police believe was a targeted attack in New South Wales, Australia. He was shot in the upper torso by an unidentified gunman and died at the scene despite paramedics' efforts. This was not the first attempt on his life; he survived an alleged murder attempt in February 2024, and a planned MMA event in April was canceled by police over fears of another gang-related plot against him. Mokhtarian competed on "The Ultimate Fighter 27" and had two official bouts in the UFC before his release in 2019.</p>

          <p>The number of international students arriving in the U.S. dropped by 19% in August compared to the previous year, according to federal data. This decline signals a significant blow to American universities, which rely on the revenue from full-tuition-paying foreign students. The dip is attributed to the Trump administration's increased scrutiny of student visas, including a temporary pause on visa interviews and a travel ban affecting 19 countries. Regions most affected saw the largest declines, including a 45% decrease from India, which traditionally sends the most students to the U.S., prompting some to seek education in other countries.</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, some financial advisors caution that stocks remain a superior long-term investment. Pat Beaird of Beaird Harris Wealth Management notes that while gold can perform well during periods of turmoil, its returns are unreliable over extended periods. Historical data shows the S&P 500 has provided a higher annualized total return over the last 30 years compared to gold. Experts argue that equities offer the benefits of earnings growth and dividends, which physical gold does not, making them a more effective hedge against inflation over time.

          <p>Authorities have arrested 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht in connection with the devastating Pacific Palisades fire that killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of homes in January. Prosecutors allege he maliciously started an initial fire on New Year's Day that smoldered underground before erupting a week later. A key piece of evidence cited by the Department of Justice was a disturbing image Rinderknecht generated using ChatGPT, depicting a burning city and fleeing crowds, which officials say indicated his mindset. Geolocation data from his phone also allegedly placed him at the fire's origin, contradicting his statements to investigators.</p>

          <p>A lesser-known financial product, the single-purpose reverse mortgage, offers a targeted way for homeowners aged 62 and older to access home equity for a specific, pre-approved need, such as paying property taxes or making essential home repairs. Unlike more common reverse mortgages, these loans are typically offered by state or local agencies and nonprofits, often to lower-income seniors. They generally have lower costs and fees because their use is restricted. While borrowers make no monthly payments, the loan becomes due when the homeowner sells, moves out, or passes away, making it a viable option for some retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

The clash occurred between members of a unified protection force, comprising troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and his rival, Riek Machar. According to an army spokesman, the argument began between two officers romantically involved with the same woman, which escalated into a gunfight between their respective bodyguards.

The piece contends that with current global emissions pledges falling far short of the 1.5C target, the presence of world leaders is crucial for securing a more ambitious deal. The article dismisses fears of a political backlash from Reform UK as cowardly, urging Starmer to reaffirm his commitment to climate action. It emphasizes that the UK, as a historic polluter with comparatively ambitious recent policies, has a responsibility to champion evidence-based solutions on the world stage.</p>

Dunlap explains that while renting offered flexibility for travel and business growth, she grew tired of the instability of landlords selling her rental properties. With her business and personal life now more settled, she prioritized the emotional desire for a stable home over purely financial metrics. She strategically used a mortgage, putting 60% down to maintain cash reserves for unexpected repairs, demonstrating how debt can be used as leverage even for those with high net worth.</p>
