          <p>The New York City medical examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people in Midtown Manhattan in July, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes indicating he believed he had the degenerative brain disease and was targeting the NFL headquarters. While experts caution against drawing a direct causal link between CTE and his actions, the finding has intensified the conversation around brain trauma in young athletes and its potential long-term consequences.</p>

          <p>Amid rising national credit card debt, consumers are increasingly exploring options like debt relief programs and credit counseling. Debt relief, such as settlement or consolidation, aims to reduce the total amount owed but can significantly damage credit scores. In contrast, credit counseling focuses on creating manageable repayment plans over several years, which has a milder impact on credit but requires disciplined budgeting. The article suggests the best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, debt level, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced that an influx of federal agents from 13 U.S. agencies, including the FBI and DEA, will be deployed in Memphis starting next week to combat crime. The operation, supported by 300 state troopers and the National Guard in non-arrest roles, is part of a broader initiative championed by President Trump. While the governor described it as a "generational opportunity" to reduce crime, the move has drawn scrutiny as part of a pattern of sending federal forces to Democratic-led cities.</p>

The arrest has raised questions about his hiring, as ICE reported he had a final order of removal and a prior weapons charge pending, alarming parents in the state's largest school district.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are pressing the Department of Homeland Security for information regarding White House border czar Tom Homan and his potential involvement in federal contracts. The inquiry follows allegations that Homan accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen in a sting operation that was later closed by Trump appointees. Lawmakers expressed concern that homeland security should not be for sale and highlighted Homan's previous work for a major private prison contractor as a potential conflict of interest.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice argued in a Supreme Court filing that President Trump's firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud would not cause a "financial market disaster." The administration is seeking to remove Cook while her lawsuit proceeds, claiming her alleged pre-confirmation misconduct constitutes the necessary "for cause" removal. Cook's attorneys contend that her removal would eviscerate the Federal Reserve's independence and risk economic chaos, arguing the charges are manufactured to undermine the institution's stability.</p>

          <p>A rare, brightly colored orange lobster was rescued from a supermarket in upstate New York and released back into the wild. A shopper named Kyle Brancato noticed the one-in-30-million creature, purchased it to save it, and temporarily housed it in a tank at home. With assistance from the wildlife group Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium, the lobster, nicknamed Jean-Clawed Van Damme, was safely returned to the Long Island Sound, just ahead of National Lobster Day.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the UK's Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who defied the party line by voting to scrap the government's two-child benefit cap shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. Their return comes as the Labour government faces increasing pressure to abolish the cap, with senior ministers recently suggesting that scrapping the controversial policy is now "on the table."</p>

          <p>Financier and former bond trader Howard Rubin has been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts over a ten-year period. The indictment alleges that Rubin, with the help of his former assistant Jennifer Powers, operated a trafficking network and brutalized women in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse. Prosecutors claim Rubin used his wealth to recruit women and non-disclosure agreements to threaten them, with the alleged crimes going beyond the scope of consent.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have won their 12th division title in 13 years, but players acknowledged that the season was a difficult journey. The team faced numerous challenges, including injuries, slumps, and bullpen collapses, which some attributed to a "World Series hangover" after their championship last year. Despite the adversity, the team believes these struggles have made them more battle-tested and better prepared for the pressures of the upcoming postseason as they aim to become the first repeat champions in over two decades.</p>

          <p>While global oil markets focus on OPEC, a significant disruption is occurring within Russia due to effective Ukrainian drone strikes on refineries and fuel depots. These attacks have reportedly taken over a million barrels per day of refining capacity offline, causing severe domestic fuel shortages and forcing Moscow to increase crude oil exports. This strategic campaign is degrading Russia's war economy by reducing its ability to produce and export valuable petroleum products, potentially leading to a tightening of global product markets.
