          <p>Southeast Asian countries are increasingly looking to Germany and other European nations to diversify their defense partnerships, moving beyond traditional allies like the US and Russia. This shift involves new defense deals, increased joint activities, and the purchase of European weaponry. The Philippines, for example, recently signed a defense cooperation agreement with Germany and is pursuing similar deals with other countries. This diversification is driven by concerns over Chinese actions in the South China Sea and doubts about US security guarantees.</p>

          <p>The Republican Party's recent passage of a major tax and spending bill was complicated by a divisive tax provision known as SALT, the state and local tax deduction. SALT allows Americans to deduct some of what they pay in state and local taxes from their federal taxes, currently capped at $10,000. The cap has been unpopular with constituents in high-tax states, leading to pressure on lawmakers to make changes. The GOP leadership ultimately agreed to raise the cap, highlighting the fragile political process in Congress and the complex Republican coalition.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans passed a massive spending bill centered on extending tax cuts enacted during Trump's first term while creating new deductions, but these deductions are set to expire in 2028, coinciding with the end of Trump's term. The bill also includes cuts to social safety net programs, potentially affecting millions of poor and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the wealthy will benefit most from the bill, while the poorest taxpayers will see their resources decline due to the reduced benefit programs.</p>
