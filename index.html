        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed five new bills aimed at protecting residents from federal immigration enforcement operations. The most prominent new law, the "No Secret Police Act," prohibits on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings and requires them to be identifiable by name and badge. These measures, which also protect schools and hospitals from warrantless entries, are a direct response to the Trump administration's immigration policies and are framed by supporters as a defense of civil liberties, while federal officials have condemned them as dangerous to officers.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Tampa International Airport discovered a human skull and other bones inside a passenger's luggage during a routine check. The traveler, who was initially flagged for undeclared cigars and prohibited plants, informed officers that the remains were intended for ritualistic use. The bones, which were deemed a potential health risk by officials, were subsequently destroyed. This incident highlights the strict Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regulations governing the importation of human remains into the United States, which require specific documentation and handling procedures.</p>

The mission, dubbed "Eastern Sentry," aims to bolster the alliance's eastern flank and sends a clear signal that NATO airspace will be defended against what UK Defence Secretary John Healey described as "reckless Russian aggression." This action follows a series of airspace violations by Russia against NATO members, including Poland, Romania, and Estonia, significantly escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>An overnight operation in Hong Kong saw the evacuation of approximately 6,000 residents after a 1,000-pound, unexploded U.S.-made bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site. Bomb disposal experts worked for nearly ten hours under typhoon conditions to safely defuse the device, which contained 500 pounds of TNT. The discovery in the Quarry Bay district is not an isolated incident, as several similar wartime munitions have been found in the city in recent years. Hong Kong was occupied by Japanese forces during the war and was a target of Allied air raids.</p>

          <p>Russia executed a large-scale aerial assault on Ukraine, deploying over 600 drones and missiles against various regions, including Dnipro, Kyiv, and Odesa. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the strikes successfully targeted Ukraine's military-industrial complex, while Ukrainian officials reported that their air defenses intercepted most projectiles. However, the attacks resulted in at least three civilian deaths and numerous injuries, with President Zelenskyy condemning the strikes as a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians. The exchange of fire comes amid ongoing diplomatic tensions and heightened NATO vigilance following recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace.</p>

          <p>A recent online discussion highlighted a critique of popular financial advisor Dave Ramsey's methods from the perspective of a self-proclaimed multi-millionaire. The critic argued that while Ramsey's debt-averse "Baby Steps" program is effective for risk-averse individuals aiming for a standard retirement, its strict avoidance of leverage is "terrible mathematically" for those seeking to build substantial wealth. The article explores this contrast, suggesting that Ramsey's strategies prioritize financial peace and stability over the higher-risk, leveraged approaches often necessary for significant financial growth.

          <p>At their party conference, the UK's Liberal Democrats have made a conspicuous effort to reclaim patriotism from far-right groups, employing national flags and patriotic anthems. Former leader Tim Farron delivered a theatrical speech, draping himself in an England flag and urging members to wave the nation's flags with pride to counter the "poison of nationalism." This strategic shift aims to position the party as the true voice of British values, contrasting with figures like Reform UK's Nigel Farage, whom they have labeled a "plastic patriot." The move represents a notable departure from the party's traditionally reserved stance on overt displays of national pride.</p>

The defense contends the decision to pursue capital punishment was politically motivated by the Trump administration's push to revive federal executions.

After the House passed a short-term Republican bill that subsequently failed in the Senate, both parties are blaming each other for the potential shutdown, with Democrats insisting that Republicans will bear the responsibility for its consequences.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois that their refusal to honor ICE detainers could lead to lawsuits and the loss of federal funding. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding the states comply with requests to hold undocumented immigrants for federal custody, accusing them of obstructing enforcement and releasing criminals into communities. The states argue that detainers are non-binding requests and that compliance could lead to liability for unlawful detention, citing state laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities without a judicial warrant.</p>

          <p>Joanna Page, star of the popular British sitcom "Gavin and Stacey," has alleged that she was groped by a television host during a filming session. In her new book, Page recounts that a female producer had warned her beforehand that the unnamed host could be "very handsy." She states that when the host began touching her, she confronted him directly by hitting his hands and questioning his actions, after which he stopped. Page described the incident as bizarre, noting that such warnings from colleagues were something performers of that era became accustomed to.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to prevent U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, exercising new oversight powers for the first time. These powers, known as "golden share" rights, were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of the company by Japan's Nippon Steel and give the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After U.S. Steel announced plans to close the plant, affecting nearly 800 workers, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company the administration would not permit it, prompting a reversal of the decision.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving what a venue described as a "credible threat" on his life. The threat was reportedly made online by a 26-year-old man in Ottawa, Canada, prior to a festival performance there; the man has since been charged by local police. Out of caution for the safety of the artist and his band, Morrissey's scheduled performances at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut and the MGM Music Hall in Boston were called off.

          <p>A study from China's Helicopter Research and Development Institute claims the creation of an advanced AI system capable of detecting even the stealthiest submarines with 95% accuracy in simulations. The system reportedly integrates data from various sources like sonar buoys and water temperature to create a real-time underwater map and can adapt to countermeasures. While the announcement could be seen as psychological warfare, if effective, such technology could challenge global naval strategies and undermine the effectiveness of submarine-based nuclear deterrents. Western military experts acknowledge the potential of AI but remain skeptical about its immediate implementation in the complex underwater environment.</p>

          <p>West Ham head coach Graham Potter is facing significant pressure, with the club reportedly considering managerial alternatives following a poor start to the season. A recent home defeat to Crystal Palace has intensified scrutiny on Potter, whose team has won just six of the 25 matches since his appointment in January. Sources indicate that even before the latest loss, the club had begun identifying potential replacements. Among the names being discussed are Nuno Espirito Santo and former manager Slaven Bilic, signaling that Potter's future at the London Stadium is increasingly uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions requiring journalists to sign a pledge not to report on any information, including unclassified material, that has not been officially authorized for public release. Under the new rules from the recently rebranded Department of War, failure to comply could result in the revocation of press credentials and escorted-only access within the building. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the policy as a security measure, but it has drawn sharp criticism from press freedom advocates who call it a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint on publication.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural critique argues that the trend towards minimalism, exemplified by the new, thinner iPhone Air, reflects a broader, more sterile and controlled aesthetic in modern life. The article contrasts today's spartan designs with the colorful, maximalist look of past technology like the 1998 iMac, suggesting that the current preference for beige, unobtrusive objects and spaces suppresses personality and risk. This minimalist grip is seen not as a sign of honesty, but as a facade of control in a chaotic world, ultimately leaving a feeling of hollowness and isolation.</p>

Smith is documenting her experience on social media to showcase a more authentic, everyday perspective of life in Japan outside of major hubs like Tokyo.
