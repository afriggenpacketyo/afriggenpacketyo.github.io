          <p>President Trump has issued an ultimatum, threatening to impose 100% tariffs on any country conducting business with Russia if a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. The announcement, made alongside the NATO Secretary General, marks a significant escalation of economic pressure and reflects Trump's growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's actions despite diplomatic conversations. The move also includes a deal to sell weapons to NATO allies, who will in turn supply Ukraine, aiming to bolster the nation's defense without direct U.S. payment.</p>

          <p>A friend of Constance Marten, recently convicted in her baby's death, has revealed that Marten spent four months as a teenager at the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Nigeria. The church, led by the late preacher TB Joshua, has since been the subject of a BBC investigation alleging widespread abuse, which a fellow disciple described as a place of torture. While there is no evidence Marten was abused, her friend believes the experience may have broken her trust in institutions. The article notes Marten later tried to make a documentary about what she felt was a cult.</p>

          <p>The Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is underway in Morocco, showcasing top talent but plagued by familiar off-field issues that hinder its potential. Despite Morocco's growing investment in women's football, the tournament suffers from last-minute scheduling, the use of smaller stadiums, and significant financial disparities. Players and coaches highlight the lack of professional recognition and compensation, with the prize money for WAFCON winners being substantially lower than that of the men's tournament and other women's international competitions. These challenges reflect broader systemic issues holding back the growth of professional women's football in Africa.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, President Trump stated he is "disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him" when asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin. This comment followed his announcement of a new weapons deal for Ukraine and a 50-day tariff ultimatum for Russia to agree to a ceasefire. Trump conveyed his frustration, explaining that despite seemingly positive conversations with Putin, they are often followed by Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities. The president also affirmed his support for NATO, a shift from his previous criticisms, attributing the change to members increasing their financial contributions.</p>

          <p>The Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Belgium has become a massive parking lot for thousands of vehicles, as new U.S. tariffs have caused a significant slowdown in exports. Shipments of passenger cars, vans, and heavy equipment to the United States have dropped sharply since President Trump announced the tariffs, with truck and tractor exports down by nearly a third. European carmakers are now facing an additional 25% tariff, adding substantial costs to their vehicles. The situation has created an "instant shock" for the port, which is also grappling with stockpiles of Chinese cars and logistical pressures from global shipping disruptions.</p>

          <p>Despite initial criticism, the FIFA Club World Cup has proven to be a financial success, prompting discussions about its future expansion. FIFA President Gianni Infantino's vision was vindicated by a $1 billion prize fund that attracted top clubs, with suggestions the tournament could expand to 48 teams in 2029 or even be held biennially. The event generated significant revenue and high viewership, particularly in Brazil, validating the investment from broadcaster Dazn.

          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that President Trump is actively delivering on his campaign promises by reversing policies from the previous administration, yet mainstream media portrays these actions as destructive. The author contends there is a media double standard, where actions taken by a Democratic president are framed as progressive reforms, while similar executive actions by Trump are labeled as damaging to democracy. The piece highlights Trump's aggressive moves on tariffs, border security, and deregulation as examples of fulfilling his mandate from voters. It suggests the media's resistance narrative overlooks that these policies are precisely what his supporters elected him to do.</p>

The landmarks, celebrated for their role in the early encounters between Eastern and Western cultures, joined prestigious sites like China's Great Wall.

It highlights that many Jewish NHS employees and patients feel unsafe or unsupported, recommending a dedicated summit to address the issue.

          <p>The European Union is facing a strategic dilemma as it navigates the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. Recent U.S. tariffs on EU imports, announced by President Trump, place Europe in a difficult position, forcing it to balance its historic alliance with Washington against its economic ties with Beijing. Analysts note that the EU perceives the China threat differently than the U.S., aiming for a balanced relationship rather than engaging in a hegemonic struggle. This has led the EU to pursue "de-risking" strategies to reduce critical dependencies on China while trying to protect its own economic interests from American protectionism.</p>

The report from India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau indicates that two fuel cut-off switches were moved moments after takeoff, causing the engines to lose power. However, aviation experts criticize the report for being selective, notably for omitting a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder that could provide crucial context.

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding forecasts but slowing from the previous quarter's 5.4% growth. While the data keeps China on track for its annual 5% target, underlying weaknesses are fueling calls for more stimulus. Retail sales growth slowed, and the real estate slump deepened, while a broad measure of prices indicated persistent deflationary pressures. Officials acknowledged the need for stronger support to stabilize the property market and boost consumer spending, but some economists believe Beijing may hold off on major stimulus measures until later in the year.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has temporarily intervened to maintain protections for nearly 12,000 Afghans, preventing their potential deportation. The Trump administration had moved to end their Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to live and work in the U.S. legally. An immigrant advocacy group sued the administration over the decision, and while a lower court judge allowed the lawsuit to proceed, they did not halt the revocation. The appeals court has now issued a one-week stay, keeping the protections in place while it considers the case, providing a brief reprieve for the affected individuals.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025. This success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong government incentives, including VAT exemptions, reduced taxes, and access to bus lanes, combined with high taxes on polluting vehicles. The country has also invested heavily in a robust public charging infrastructure, with over 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide. This comprehensive approach has made EVs a common sight, improving air quality and reducing noise in cities like Oslo.</p>

The trip comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China relations, and analysts believe the visit's approval may depend on the state of diplomatic ties between Washington and Beijing.

          <p>Yields on Japan's benchmark 10-year government bonds have surged to their highest point since 2008, with longer-term bonds also hitting multi-decade highs. This spike is driven by growing investor concern over Japan's fiscal stability, particularly as political parties discuss potential consumption tax cuts ahead of an upcoming election. With Japan already managing one of the world's highest public debt-to-GDP ratios, markets are wary that increased government spending or tax reductions could lead to more debt issuance. Analysts suggest this uncertainty is creating doubt about the government's commitment to fiscal discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities are reportedly issuing administrative subpoenas to landlords, demanding access to tenant files, including leases, rental applications, and identification. This tactic appears to be a new front in the Trump administration's efforts to locate individuals for deportation. Legal experts and property managers have raised concerns, questioning the legality of these judge-less subpoenas and warning that compliance could risk violating fair housing laws. Critics argue that landlords may feel intimidated into providing private information, potentially without the tenant's knowledge, blurring the lines of law enforcement and housing management.</p>

Tesla contends that the driver was distracted by a dropped cell phone and is solely responsible for the incident.
