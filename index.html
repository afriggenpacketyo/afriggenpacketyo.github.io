Cotler is urging the Canadian government to establish a dedicated agency to counter foreign interference and threats from countries like Iran.

          <p>The wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has created a sharp divide in the city, mixing celebrity glamour with local discontent. While A-list guests attended the lavish events, hundreds of Venetians marched in protest against over-tourism, capitalism, and the environmental impact of the wealthy elite. Activists hung banners from the Rialto bridge, though their planned disruption of water taxis was dropped.

Now serving as Red Bull's head of global soccer, Klopp expressed serious fears about player welfare due to increased fixture congestion and lack of adequate recovery time. He argued that the relentless schedule, which includes major international tournaments year after year, puts players at risk of unprecedented injuries.

          <p>South Africa's coalition government is experiencing significant strain after President Cyril Ramaphosa dismissed a deputy minister from the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party. In response, the DA has withdrawn from the president's "National Dialogue" initiative and threatened to block budgets for departments led by ministers accused of corruption. DA leader John Steenhuisen accused Ramaphosa of applying "double standards" by targeting a DA member while failing to act against alleged corruption within his own ANC party. This public clash threatens the stability of the year-old government.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their Australian tour with a decisive victory over the Western Force, but the win was overshadowed by an injury to a key player. Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who scored two tries, left the field with a hamstring injury, creating concern for the team's depth in that position. Coach Andy Farrell noted the team's high penalty count in the first half but was pleased with their ambitious, attacking style of play. The performance of lock Joe McCarthy was a standout, positioning him as a contender for a starting role in the upcoming Test series.</p>

The violence continues as President Trump indicated that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached within the next week.

          <p>The Trump administration has signaled a major shift in U.S. foreign policy by withdrawing funding from Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, based on anti-vaccine rhetoric. In a speech to a Gavi summit, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused the organization of ignoring vaccine safety and stifling dissent, confirming the U.S. would halt its financial pledges. This move, rooted in the administration's opposition to both foreign aid and vaccination, could jeopardize immunization programs that have saved millions of children's lives. Public health experts have condemned the decision as dangerous and unscientific.</p>

The man kicked the 25-pound dog with enough force to lift it off the ground, causing contusions. Agents discovered over 100 pounds of undeclared and prohibited agricultural products in his luggage.

This low-cost, high-impact strategy demonstrates a new vulnerability for major military powers, proving that even well-defended rear areas are no longer safe from asymmetric attacks.

The event is framed as a turning point that shattered illusions and initiated a period of internal turmoil, which continues to manifest in events like the divisive New York City mayoral primary. The party is described as rudderless, struggling with factional disputes and relitigating the past instead of uniting around a new generation of leaders. The author suggests that a forward-looking 2028 presidential primary might be the only way for Democrats to escape their current malaise.</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed he will attend the August peace ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki. This marks a return for Israel, which was not invited to the 2024 ceremony by the city's government due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. That decision prompted other G7 ambassadors to withdraw from last year's event in solidarity. For this year's commemoration, Nagasaki's government has adopted a more inclusive approach, extending invitations to all diplomatic missions in Japan, including Russia.</p>
