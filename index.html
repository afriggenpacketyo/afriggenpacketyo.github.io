          <p>Conservative commentator and Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk was shot during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Authorities confirmed that Kirk was hit at least once and was transported from the scene by his security team, with a suspect now in custody. The event was part of Kirk's "American Comeback Tour," which features a debate-style format where he engages with individuals who challenge his views. The incident has drawn widespread attention, including a social media post from former President Trump expressing his concern and prayers.</p>

          <p>A shooting occurred at Evergreen High School in the Denver metropolitan area, resulting in at least two students being wounded and subsequently hospitalized. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office responded to reports of an active assailant, placing the school on lockdown as the situation remained active and dangerous. Authorities have established a unification center for families at a nearby elementary school and have asked parents not to go directly to the high school campus. The investigation is ongoing, with more details expected to be released as they become available to the public.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by the China-Brazil Business Council found that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report highlights the deep economic integration between the two nations, with bilateral commerce growing nearly fivefold in two decades. While this trade relationship generated a significant surplus of $276 billion for Brazil over the past decade, it also reveals a heavy reliance on a few key commodities like soybeans, iron ore, and oil. This concentration raises concerns about the economic risks of depending on a single trade partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>John Cowen, a former champion of the quiz show "Countdown," stabbed a rival player, Thomas Carey, during a fan club tournament in Blackpool. A court heard that Cowen, a Cambridge maths graduate, felt other competitors had an unfair advantage by using an app to practice. CCTV footage showed Cowen running across the social club with a knife and lunging at Carey, who sustained a stab wound to his bicep. Cowen was found unfit to stand trial due to being "seriously mentally unwell," but a jury determined he committed the assault and possessed a knife in public.</p>

          <p>The mortality rate in the United States saw a 3.8% decline in 2024, reaching its lowest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a provisional CDC report. For the first time since 2020, COVID-19 is no longer one of the ten leading causes of death in the country. The top causes of death remained heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries, with deaths from the first two actually increasing despite the overall rate drop.

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's decision that temporarily blocks him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had ruled that Cook's potential reinstatement was in the public interest to maintain the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump's administration sought to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Her lawyers argue the firing is a pretext in a broader campaign by the president to pressure the Fed into cutting interest rates.</p>

Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference, Lachlan stated the resolution provides clarity and consistency for the companies' strategies moving forward.

The BBC was granted rare, controlled access to Gaza to view new aid distribution sites being built by Israel for evacuees in the south.

According to the lawsuit, Patel admitted the firings were likely illegal but stated he was powerless to stop them due to pressure from the White House.

The rally significantly boosted the company's market capitalization towards the $1 trillion mark and made founder Larry Ellison the world's richest person, according to some trackers.

The contest was initiated following the recent resignation of Angela Rayner. As the only cabinet member in the race, Phillipson is seen as a candidate who will be supportive of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, a factor that may appeal to MPs but could be a disadvantage among the broader party membership.</p>

Ocean freight bookings data indicates that the usual late-September rush is unlikely to happen this year, with Chinese imports seeing a 27% year-over-year drop for three consecutive weeks. This trend is attributed to the ongoing trade war, which prompted an early front-loading of inventory in May and June, followed by a sharp decline as U.S. retailers report increased inventory levels. Consequently, ocean carriers are announcing blank sailings to manage reduced capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite September 10 being the statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, activity has been unusually quiet this year. Meteorologists attribute the lack of storm formation primarily to persistent Saharan dust moving across the Atlantic, which inhibits the development of the thunderstorms necessary for tropical cyclones. Additionally, the climate is in an "ENSO Neutral" phase, meaning neither El Niño nor La Niña patterns are present to strongly influence storm activity. However, NOAA forecasters still predict an above-average season overall and caution that significant storm development can still occur through the end of November.</p>

The White House has requested a stopgap measure through January, but some Democrats fear this would allow the Trump administration to withhold congressionally approved funds. Key sticking points also include a Democratic push to extend health care subsidies, which Republicans prefer to handle separately from the funding bill.</p>

          <p>The leader of the RMT union, representing thousands of striking London Underground workers, has called for a summit with London Mayor Sadiq Khan to resolve the ongoing dispute over pay and working hours. The industrial action, which began on Sunday, has severely disrupted Tube services across the capital. The union's central demand is a reduction of the working week to 32 hours, a proposal Transport for London (TfL) has deemed "impractical and unaffordable." The mayor's office stated that TfL is prepared to restart talks, but the union insists on the mayor's direct involvement to break the impasse.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris criticizes the decision-making process around President Joe Biden's 2024 reelection campaign. She describes the choice to let Biden decide alone as "recklessness," suggesting the stakes were too high for it to be a purely personal decision based on ego. Harris also expresses frustration with her time in the administration, claiming the president's staff fueled negative narratives about her and failed to defend her against attacks. The revelations signal a significant turn in her public stance toward her former running mate.</p>

          <p>A large-scale survey of nearly 70,000 U.S. college students reveals that a majority now oppose allowing speakers with controversial viewpoints, from either the left or the right, on their campuses. The report, from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), indicates a growing trend where students of all political affiliations prefer to avoid encountering challenging ideas rather than engaging with them. The survey also found a record-high level of acceptance for disruptive tactics to silence speakers, including shouting them down or, in some cases, using violence, raising concerns about the state of free speech in higher education.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the tactical principles of England's national football team under the new management of Thomas Tuchel. After just six games, including an impressive 5-0 win against Serbia, a distinct style is emerging, characterized by a flexible 2-3-5 formation in possession and an emphasis on aggressive, off-the-ball runs to stretch defenses. Tuchel has shown a willingness to take more risks with direct passes compared to his predecessor and has focused on selecting players who fit his system, such as wingers adept at one-on-one situations. While the team's defense against strong opposition remains a question, the foundation appears solid.</p>

He also addresses the Justice Department's effort to build a national voter roll and the potential for partisan gerrymandering.
