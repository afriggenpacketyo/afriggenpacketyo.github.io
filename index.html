          <p>Nintendo has released the Switch 2, its first new gaming console in over eight years, meeting strong preorder demand and boosting the company's financial prospects. The Kyoto-based gaming giant anticipates selling 15 million units globally in the current business year, fueled by significant preorder interest with 2.2 million Japanese applicants vying for a unit via lottery. The console features include screen sharing, voice chat, a larger screen with twice the pixel count, and 4K output, with a new Mario Kart installment released alongside it. The company expects a substantial sales increase for fiscal 2025 due to the Switch 2's popularity.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein have seen a significant decrease in U.S. demand following President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the "de minimis" trade loophole. Temu's U.S. daily active users dropped by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's declined by 25%, also reflected in lower Apple App Store rankings. This decline is attributed to both the new tariffs and a reduction in U.S. advertising spending by both companies. The "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed tariff-free shipments of low-cost goods under $800, was ended on May 2nd.</p>

          <p>Russia is attempting to revive a strategic alliance with China and India to counter the Western-led international order, but faces challenges due to existing distrust between the two Asian nations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized NATO's efforts to involve India in "anti-China" initiatives and expressed hope for restoring the Russia-India-China framework. Despite previous attempts to push for a resumption of the trilateral mechanism after the 2020 China-India border dispute, tensions remain. Some analysts believe that aggressive and unpredictable policies from the United States President Donald Trump could potentially catalyze the three nations to unite.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban is creating new hardships for people in war-torn nations such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, diminishing their hopes for seeking refuge in the United States. The ban, which restricts travel from 12 countries, is expected to face legal challenges and has drawn criticism from human rights groups. The order cites national security risks as the reason for the ban, but opponents argue it is discriminatory and cruel.

          <p>Automotive industry groups are expressing increasing concern over potential rare earth shortages due to China's recent export restrictions, with some European auto supplier plants already experiencing shutdowns. China imposed these restrictions on several rare earth elements and magnets, crucial for automotive, defense, and energy sectors, in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increases. Only about 25% of export license applications submitted to Chinese authorities have been approved since early April, leading to production disruptions in Europe. The German Association of the Automotive Industry has called on lawmakers to address this issue with China to avoid further output halts.</p>

Approximately 100 Stryker vehicles and over 8,000 soldiers are being used along the border, along with spy planes, drones, and Navy ships. The military's expanded presence is facilitated by the creation of National Defense Areas, allowing soldiers to detain migrants as trespassers until Border Patrol agents arrive.

          <p>Thin Blue Paw, a charity supporting serving and retired police dogs, is advocating for pensions to assist with the often complicated and costly medical needs of these animals. Each year, 50 to 70 police dogs retire and are often adopted by members of the public or their former handlers, but their care can involve significant expenses. The charity estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of Â£3,000 more annually compared to a regular dog, due to specialized diets, joint support, and hydrotherapy. Some police forces, like Nottinghamshire Police, already provide pensions for retiring dogs, but the Home Office currently has no plans to change the national retirement process.</p>

Trump's inquiry focuses on the use of an autopen to sign executive actions and questions Biden's mental acuity. Biden, now 82 and battling advanced prostate cancer, has dismissed Trump's claims as "ridiculous and false," asserting that he made the decisions during his presidency. The investigation comes amid scrutiny over Biden's mental and physical capacity, fueled by a new book alleging a cover-up of his "physical deterioration" during his reelection campaign.</p>

The report suggests China should support a unified clean energy vision in Pakistan, fostering a co-creation of a home-grown clean-energy innovation ecosystem.

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether individuals working for former President Joe Biden conspired to deceive the public about his mental state by using an autopen. Trump alleges that Biden's aides abused the power of presidential signatures to conceal his cognitive decline. He also claims that the American public was shielded from discovering who wielded executive power while Biden's signature was used to effect radical policy shifts. The investigation will focus on any activity that purposefully concealed information about Biden's mental and physical health.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an immediate ban on Harvard University enrolling new international students, citing national security concerns, particularly regarding links with China. The administration accuses Harvard of maintaining connections that pose a threat to U.S. security. The order also directs the State Department to review whether current foreign enrollments should have their visas revoked. This action is expected to deepen tensions between the U.S. and China, with the administration expressing concerns about foreign adversaries exploiting American higher education to steal technical information and spread false information.</p>
