          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies arrested over 80 illegal migrants, some with criminal records, at a Louisiana racetrack. The operation followed the lifting of a brief pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, prompted by intelligence indicating unauthorized workers at Delta Downs Racetrack. ICE is reviewing each case to identify additional criminal activities, such as labor exploitation and immigration violations, and the arrests occurred amidst anti-ICE protests in major U.S. cities. Worksite enforcement investigations aim to reduce illegal employment and hold employers accountable, with the joint operation involving multiple law enforcement agencies. </p>

          <p>Boeing's senior vice-president, Turbo Sjogren, emphasized the need for Europe to decrease its dependence on China for critical minerals, similar to the U.S. The aerospace supply chain is global, necessitating collaboration, and programs in both the U.S. and Europe will feature significant content from each other. Sjogren highlighted that U.S. legislation since 1973 requires the aerospace industry and defense sector to avoid reliance on countries like China for critical materials. This call comes amid growing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities and the need for greater sovereignty in the face of global challenges.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed U.S. President Donald Trump that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct military talks, without U.S. mediation. Modi emphasized India's consistent policy of rejecting third-party mediation, particularly concerning Kashmir. He clarified that discussions on a trade deal or U.S. mediation did not occur between the Pahalgam attack and the ceasefire, with the ceasefire talks initiated by Pakistan. Modi also conveyed that India now considers cross-border terrorism as an act of war, with ongoing operations against terrorists, and the two leaders agreed to meet in person soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manufacturers are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty payments amid rising tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. This practice involves altering an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Companies like Winnebago Industries are working with experts to develop strategies including tariff engineering and deferrals. While not illegal, this act is described as a "clever art of outsmarting customs," with companies making slight adjustments to qualify for lower duties; however, heavily regulated sectors face challenges due to extensive validation requirements.

The review also highlighted failures in evidence gathering, erroneous statements by the former chief constable, and delays in informing the family that Sacoolas had left the country under diplomatic cover, and the FCDO did not cooperate with the inquiry.</p>

Boelter is accused of fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding another Democrat, Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette.

The company stated it is utilizing Honda technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems for this challenge. While there are no commercialization decisions yet, Honda sees potential for launching satellites with its own rockets to enhance various services, aligning with growing expectations for a "data system in outer space." This move positions Honda alongside companies like SpaceX and Japan's JAXA in the burgeoning space race.</p>

The grocery chain said it had not yet completely recovered from the attack, which occurred last month. The offer is available to existing and new Co-op members but not staff, and the retailer says it is "very near to making a full and complete recovery" from the attack. The cyber-attack is estimated to have cost Co-op millions of pounds in lost sales, and the offer is seen as a call to customers to return to the store.</p>
