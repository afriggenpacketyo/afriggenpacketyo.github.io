        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the challenges faced by a Kentucky community deeply rooted in tradition as it navigates economic decline and shifting political allegiances. The narrative focuses on Roger Ford, a local energy startup president, who laments the loss of young talent and the grip of the opioid epidemic on the region. The article highlights the community's strong support for Donald Trump, driven by a sense of abandonment by modern Democrats after the decline of the coal industry. Despite Trump's unfulfilled promises, the community's cultural identity remains intertwined with conservative values, raising questions about its future. The story illustrates the complex interplay of economic hardship, cultural identity, and political disillusionment in a specific region of the United States. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its national stockpiles in an effort to combat rising prices of the country's staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the plan, which involves direct contracts with retailers, including smaller supermarket operators, to ensure broader access to affordable rice. This move follows previous auctions in March and April and aims to address rice prices that have doubled compared to the previous year. The government hopes this intervention will lower overall prices for consumers. </p>

          <p>Barbara Kruger's mural, "Questions," at the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen Contemporary has become a striking backdrop for protests against ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles. The mural, featuring thought-provoking questions about power and control, faces the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building, adding a layer of resonance to the demonstrations. Kruger herself commented on the situation, suggesting the protests could be playing into Trump's hands. Despite some misinformation circulating online, the museum reported only minor graffiti damage and continued its durational performance, "Police State," by Pussy Riot frontwoman Nadya Tolokonnikova, who broadcast the sounds of the protests to the empty museum. </p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery, the media conglomerate owning HBO and CNN, plans to divide its operations into two separate entities by mid-2026. The company will split its studio and streaming business, which includes HBO Max and its film division, from its traditional cable television networks like CNN and Discovery. This strategic move aims to allow each division to compete more effectively in a rapidly evolving media landscape, where streaming services are gaining popularity while cable TV audiences decline. David Zaslav, Warner Bros. Discovery president and chief executive, believes this restructuring will provide sharper focus and strategic flexibility for the company's iconic brands. </p>

          <p>U.S. officials have clarified the rules of force for the National Guard and Marines deployed to Los Angeles amid ongoing protests. The troops are tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel, and they will not be engaging crowds unless necessary. While carrying weapons, their guns will not have ammunition loaded, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. The officials emphasized that the rules would change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which has not occurred. </p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has released a report criticizing the UK's statutory paternity leave system as one of the worst in the developed world. The report highlights that the current rules entrench outdated gender stereotypes and require significant investment to improve. It suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach. The report also addresses concerns about the complexity and underutilization of shared parental leave. </p>

The Department for Education emphasizes that AI should only be used for low-stakes marking and that teachers must check the results. While the Association of School and College Leaders acknowledges the potential benefits, it also highlights the need to resolve issues related to data breaches and marking errors. </p>
