          <p>A federal trial has concluded regarding President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a move contested by California's Governor. The state argues the deployment for immigration enforcement support violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic military use. The presiding judge expressed significant concern over the federal government's claims of unchecked presidential power and the lack of clear limits on deploying a "national police force." The case now awaits a ruling that could set a major precedent on the boundaries of executive authority over state-controlled military forces.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe against an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," has concluded its hearing. The core issue is whether the facility is under state or federal control, which determines if federal environmental laws apply. Plaintiffs argue the facility, built without environmental assessment, harms endangered species like the Florida panther and contaminates the fragile ecosystem. The judge repeatedly questioned who is "running the show," highlighting the ambiguity used by the state and federal governments in their defense.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old New York man has been federally charged with cyberstalking a relative of the late UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson. Prosecutors allege Shane Daley left threatening voicemails hours after Thompson's fatal shooting, expressing approval of the killing and wishing similar harm upon the family. The calls were made to the work phone of Thompson's family member. If convicted, Daley faces up to five years in prison for the harassment, which authorities condemned as an effort to amplify the family's suffering.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and MSF, has accused Israel of "weaponizing aid" and causing starvation to deepen in Gaza. The groups state that new Israeli regulations, introduced in March, are blocking the delivery of essential supplies by requiring compliance with rules that could compromise their independence. Organizations report that dozens of requests to import lifesaving goods have been denied, leaving hospitals without supplies and exacerbating a dire humanitarian crisis. Israel maintains the rules are necessary for national security and to prevent aid from being diverted by Hamas.</p>

The feedback noted the candidate "lacked enthusiasm and energy" and had a "more subdued" communication style. Despite this, the applicant was invited for a second, in-person interview, creating a dilemma about whether to acknowledge the email or adjust their personality.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at streamlining the regulatory process for commercial rocket launches in the United States. The order directs the Department of Transportation to expedite or eliminate certain environmental reviews required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for launch licenses. The White House stated that "inefficient permitting" discourages investment and limits the competitiveness of U.S. space companies like SpaceX. Environmental groups have criticized the move, warning that it puts wildlife and local communities at risk from rocket launches that can have significant environmental impacts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, a record low not seen since 1958. This decline coincides with increasing public awareness, especially among young adults, that even moderate drinking poses health risks like cancer and depression. Experts suggest that evolving scientific consensus, social trends like "Dry January," and the rise of non-alcoholic alternatives are contributing factors. The poll also highlighted a significant drop in drinking among women compared to men, reflecting complex social and behavioral norms.</p>

This contradicts an earlier assessment from Seoul, which had detected some speakers being dismantled and had expressed hope for renewed communication. The sharp denial serves as a cold dismissal of the South's recent diplomatic overtures and reaffirms Pyongyang's hardline stance.</p>

The attack, part of a broader incendiary campaign, killed over 260 people and destroyed nearly 75% of the city. Survivors and historians reflect on the raid's tragic timing, with one survivor calling it "utterly foolish." The article explores the moral complexities of the firebombing strategy and notes that many in Kumagaya today blame the war's momentum and Japan's own imperial aggression, rather than holding animosity toward America.</p>

          <p>A man in Big Bear, California, has been arrested for allegedly operating an illegal psilocybin mushroom business out of a local establishment called the Jah Healing Cannabis Church. Following citizen complaints, San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant and found psychedelic mushrooms on the owner, Christopher Tindall. This is not the first time the church has faced legal trouble; it was previously shut down by the county for functioning as an illegal cannabis dispensary. Tindall was arrested on a felony charge for the illegal sale of psilocybin.</p>

          <p>Photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like facial growths have gone viral, sparking alarm online. However, Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have clarified that the animals are not "zombies" but are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus. The disease, spread by ticks and fleas, causes keratinous tumors that are usually harmless unless they impede eating or vision. The virus is not transmissible to humans or other pets and is believed to have inspired the myth of the "jackalope." The growths typically disappear once the rabbit's immune system fights off the infection.</p>

          <p>New Mexico's governor has declared a state of emergency for the city of Española and surrounding areas in Rio Arriba County, citing a "significant surge" in violent crime and drug trafficking. The order authorizes $750,000 in emergency funding to provide additional law enforcement and community resources. The governor noted that police calls in the region have more than doubled in two years, and the county has the highest overdose death rate in the state, largely driven by fentanyl. This is the second such emergency declaration for crime in New Mexico this year.</p>

          <p>For many low-income Americans, rising energy costs are making it increasingly difficult to afford air conditioning during hot summers. The article highlights the reliance on programs like the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which serves over six million households but faces elimination in a new budget proposal. Research indicates that climate change is driving up electricity costs, with wholesale prices increasing significantly during heatwaves. This puts vulnerable populations at greater risk, as they are forced to choose between paying costly utility bills and enduring dangerous heat. (not investment advice)</p>

Ellison emphasized that the company will be Hollywood-based and aims to be an "entertainment company first," moving away from political divisions to appeal to a broader audience.

          <p>Researchers at Imperial College London are warning that UK cities face a growing threat from "firewaves," a term describing multiple urban wildfires occurring during extended periods of hot, dry weather. The risk is driven by climate change, which makes urban green spaces dangerously flammable. Recent fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this vulnerability. Scientists have developed a model to help predict when conditions are ripe for such events, urging for greater preparedness as a risk once considered rural now poses a significant threat to densely populated areas.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, experienced record flooding after a glacial basin near the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive "outburst flood."

However, newly installed temporary barriers, known as Hesco barriers, largely held, preventing a catastrophic event and minimizing damage. The annual flooding, a consequence of a retreating glacier due to climate change, has now receded, and officials have reopened evacuated areas as they begin to assess the impact.</p>

          <p>Brazil's President Lula da Silva has announced a $5.5 billion plan to support Brazilian exporters affected by high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The U.S. tariffs, reaching up to 50% on some products, were justified by President Trump as a reaction to the legal situation of his ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro. President Lula called these reasons non-existent and a pretext, but emphasized a desire to negotiate rather than retaliate. The Brazilian support package includes credit lines and tax postponements for businesses impacted by the U.S. trade measures. (not investment advice)</p>

For travelers, it's a way to save money on personal travel and reclaim family time that would otherwise be lost. While many companies quietly accept the practice as long as work is completed and expenses are kept separate, some employees remain hesitant to broadcast their plans for fear of appearing unprofessional.</p>
