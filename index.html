          <p>A 20-year-old man has been convicted of assaulting two female police officers during a large, violent disturbance at Manchester Airport in July of last year. A video of the incident was widely circulated on social media at the time. Following a three-week trial, the jury found him guilty of causing actual bodily harm to one officer and assaulting an emergency worker. He was also convicted of an earlier assault on a member of the public in the airport's arrivals area.</p>

          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an on-duty police officer, inside a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas, reportedly left a note blaming a traumatic head injury on the National Football League, which has offices in the tower. Investigators are piecing together his cross-country journey and motives, while officials and the public mourn the victims, who included employees at Blackstone and Rudin Management. The incident has prompted renewed calls from New York officials for national gun control legislation.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action has won the right to a High Court judicial review of the UK government's decision to ban it under terrorism legislation. The ruling judge stated that the proscription might conflict with rights to free speech and that there is a strong public interest in determining the ban's legality. The group, known for causing millions in damage to firms linked to Israel, remains banned pending a full hearing in November. This decision sets the stage for a significant legal battle over the limits of protest and counter-terrorism laws.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, significantly exceeding forecasts and reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. This surprising surge was primarily driven by a sharp decrease in imports, a trend linked to the Trump administration's tariff policies, along with an increase in consumer spending. However, some underlying metrics, such as final sales to private domestic purchasers, suggest that demand from consumers and businesses is beginning to soften. The report provides a complex picture of an economy influenced by volatile trade flows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula generated tsunami waves that reached Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. The powerful quake prompted evacuation orders and tsunami warnings in Japan and several U.S. states, with officials urging coastal residents to move to higher ground. Initial waves measured up to 4.9 feet in Hawaii, though authorities later stated that a major, destructive tsunami was not expected. The event caused widespread alerts and disruptions, including flight cancellations and harbor evacuations, as nations across the Pacific monitored the situation.</p>

          <p>This article, based on a podcast discussion with trade historian Douglas Irwin, deconstructs the economic rationale behind President Trump's tariff policies. It argues that tariffs, rather than boosting domestic manufacturing, actually harm it by increasing the cost of inputs and inviting foreign retaliation that closes export markets. The analysis further posits that tariffs function as a regressive tax, disproportionately burdening lower-income households who spend more on goods. The discussion concludes that such protectionist measures lead to slower growth, corruption, and alienation of key allies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Hold Interest Rates Steady Despite Presidential Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 10:02:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists widely predict the Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rate at its upcoming meeting, despite persistent calls from President Trump for a rate cut. The central bank is expected to hold steady due to a solid labor market and the potential for new tariffs to increase inflation. While at least two FOMC members have signaled a desire to cut rates, the consensus remains cautious. The decision highlights the Fed's focus on its dual mandate of low inflation and full employment, independent of political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece for The Guardian, the executive director of the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, Yuli Novak, argues that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. She contends that the state's actions—including mass killings, engineered starvation, and inflammatory rhetoric from leaders—fit the legal definition of the term. Novak reflects on how decades of occupation and dehumanization created the conditions for the current crisis, which was catalyzed by the Hamas attack on October 7, where civilians were slaughtered, sexually assaulted, and taken hostage. The article calls for an urgent acknowledgment of this reality to stop the violence.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca's CEO has revealed that the company has proposed price cuts for certain drugs in the United States. This move appears to be a direct response to pressure from the Trump administration, which has been pushing pharmaceutical companies to lower U.S. drug costs. The CEO stated that a rebalancing of global prices is necessary, suggesting the U.S. can no longer bear the primary cost of worldwide R&D. The company is also boosting its U.S. manufacturing capabilities to produce its medicines locally.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is advocating for the release of grand jury transcripts from the sex-trafficking cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In a court filing, officials revealed that only two law enforcement witnesses—an FBI agent and an NYPD detective—testified across both proceedings. This push for transparency comes as the Trump administration faces intense pressure to release more information related to the scandal. The move aims to quell public furor and conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's high-profile connections and crimes.</p>

Instead, she highlights green flags in employees who are reliable, open to new opportunities, and proactively help their colleagues. The advice emphasizes the importance of a positive, solution-oriented mindset in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad, the top vaccine official at the FDA, has departed from his position less than four months after his controversial appointment. Prasad, a vocal critic of previous FDA policies and COVID-19 mandates, had faced sharp criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. During his brief tenure, the agency made several unusual regulatory decisions, including limiting COVID vaccine use and declining to approve certain therapies. His departure is seen by some investors as a positive development for biotech and gene therapy companies. </p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported a 26% rise in infections from Shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) in England last year, with young children being the most affected group.

The agency is urging the public, especially parents of young children, to practice thorough handwashing with soap and hot water to prevent the spread of the bacteria.</p>

          <p>Medical experts are warning that consuming alcohol in the evening, a common habit for relaxation, can be detrimental to heart health. While alcohol may initially act as a vasodilator and temporarily lower blood pressure, it causes a rebound increase hours later as the body's sympathetic nervous system responds. Cardiologists and dietitians explain that regular alcohol consumption, even in moderate amounts, is a significant risk factor for developing long-term high blood pressure. They recommend healthier stress-relief alternatives like exercise, creative hobbies, or spending time with loved ones.</p>
