This stability could provide some reassurance to businesses and consumers in Japan amidst broader economic concerns. The report suggests a steady employment situation within the country.</p>

          <p>Cambridge Associates suggests global investors are shifting from US-heavy portfolios to undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China due to geopolitical tensions. Despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities, particularly in China and Hong Kong, have outperformed US stocks.

This shift is supported by monetary easing and signs of policy coordination between Beijing and Washington, signaling a potentially stronger case for diversifying away from US equities.

          <p>Multiple senior officials from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are departing the Trump administration, following Elon Musk's official departure. James Burnham, DOGE's top attorney, and Steve Davis, a longtime Musk associate, are among those offboarding. Musk, who launched DOGE to slash federal spending, is stepping down as his time as a Special Government Employee ends. Despite his departure, Musk will continue to serve as an unofficial advisor to the president, as the @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time.</p>
