          <p>A shooting in Boyle Heights left three teenagers wounded, prompting an LAPD investigation to find the suspect. The incident occurred on North Soto Street, where a 15-year-old, a 16-year-old, and an 18-year-old sustained non-life-threatening gunshot wounds and were transported to local hospitals. Police are searching for a heavyset man wearing a tie-dyed sweatshirt and blue pants who was last seen traveling northbound in a gray BMW sedan. The shooting led to a significant law enforcement presence and the closure of North Soto Street in both directions as authorities investigate the crime scene.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has secured victory in Canada's federal election, capitalizing on anti-Trump sentiment and concerns about the country's economic survival. Carney, a political newcomer, successfully framed the election as a referendum on Canadian sovereignty against U.S. President Trump's threats and tariffs. While the Conservatives made significant gains, focusing on domestic issues like affordability and crime, the Liberal's message of protecting Canada from external threats resonated with voters. Carney plans to immediately begin negotiations for a new economic and security relationship with the United States following the election.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce companies, including Alibaba, are strategizing to navigate the impact of U.S. tariffs by helping sellers find markets beyond the United States. Despite the U.S. being China's largest export market for online trade, companies are offering support, including assistance with customs procedures and financial aid for domestic advertising. The Chinese government is also prioritizing the expansion of online international sales, offering tax breaks and encouraging related university majors.

          <p>China's military is rapidly deploying low-cost, AI-powered drones, including a micro drone capable of carrying twice its weight and transmitting real-time battlefield intelligence. The micro drone, designed for infantry units, can carry up to three grenades and utilizes AI-powered targeting, allowing a single operator to manage multiple drones. This development is part of a "phased leap" towards unmanned combat team technology, aiming for deep integration within operations and eventual autonomy. The transition is considered vital for defining future battlefield rules and gaining an edge in intelligent warfare.</p>

Some cemeteries offer amenities like basins for pets to wash their feet during visits.

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured a surprising victory in the federal election, largely influenced by U.S. President Trump's threats to annex Canada and impose tariffs. The Liberal Party's platform focused on safeguarding Canadian sovereignty and economy from external threats, which resonated with voters concerned about Trump's policies. While domestic issues like affordability and immigration remained important, Trump's intervention dominated the campaign, potentially costing the Conservative party votes due to their leader's perceived similarities with the U.S. president.

          <p>President Trump's "border czar," Tom Homan, defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a previous order withholding his removal due to the risk of gang persecution. Homan asserted that the facts surrounding the withholding order had changed, claiming Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist because the gang he feared no longer exists. Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny his involvement with MS-13, which the Trump administration has designated as a terrorist organization. The Salvadoran president has refused to send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., and a federal judge has temporarily paused an order requiring updates on efforts to facilitate his return.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts to give automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, they will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs on materials like steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for a portion of the cost of tariffs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of the value of a new car in the first year, phased out over two years. The changes aim to reward companies manufacturing domestically while providing a transition period for those investing in U.S. production.</p>

          <p>Approximately 55,000 Los Angeles County workers initiated a two-day strike, leading to disruptions in public services such as healthcare, social work, libraries, and parks. SEIU Local 721 leaders cited the county's failure to fairly negotiate a new contract and alleged 44 labor law violations as the reason for the strike. The union also expressed outrage over a low pay offer, while county officials cited wildfire costs, a sex abuse settlement, and the loss of federal grants as reasons for caution. The strike is expected to impact nearly all county departments, with some healthcare clinics and libraries closed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration crackdown to include unaccompanied minors, conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the U.S. alone, typically across the US-Mexican border. These actions have sparked fears of a crackdown and concerns about potential family separation. The president has also signed executive orders targeting "sanctuary cities" that obstruct federal immigration laws. These moves are part of a broader effort to enforce stricter immigration policies, leading to legal and political debate.</p>

          <p>A pro-Palestinian demonstration took place in Brooklyn to condemn the verbal and physical assault on a woman by pro-Israel counterprotesters the previous week. The demonstrators marched towards the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters, the site of the original protest, under heavy police presence. The protest remained peaceful, with police preventing the group from reaching their intended destination, though one man was arrested. The incident stemmed from a protest against a speech by Israeli security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, which led to a confrontation and the assault on the woman.</p>

Projections indicate that in a pessimistic scenario, outdoor sporting activity would need to be avoided for several hours in the afternoon in July and August in most regions except Hokkaido.
