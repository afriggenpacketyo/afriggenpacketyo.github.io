          <p>Current and former Federal Reserve officials are emphasizing the critical importance of preserving the central bank's independence amidst a criminal investigation into Governor Lisa Cook. Cook, a Biden nominee, faces accusations of mortgage fraud from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, prompting calls for her resignation, including from President Trump. Cook has publicly rejected these demands, stating she will not be bullied. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren have both publicly supported Cook's integrity, underscoring the necessity of maintaining the Fed's non-political mandate to ensure sound economic outcomes for the American public.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted court-authorized searches at former National Security Advisor John Bolton's Maryland home and Washington D.C. office, reportedly linked to a classified documents investigation. This event reignites a contentious history with the previous Trump administration, which had sought to prevent the publication of Bolton's critical memoir and initiated a criminal inquiry into alleged classified information leaks, a case later closed by the Biden administration. President Trump, who frequently disparaged Bolton, claimed he learned of the raid through media, while top U.S. law enforcement officials used social media to highlight the operation and the principle that no one is above the law. The article notes that Bolton's Secret Service protection was removed by the Trump administration shortly after his second inauguration.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to expand federal anti-crime operations to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York City, following an ongoing effort in Washington D.C. He indicated a willingness to deploy "regular military" if needed, representing a significant escalation of federal intervention in domestic law enforcement. Trump characterized these cities as "a mess" with "incompetent" mayors, claiming residents are calling for his help. The article highlights that the federal government's authority to intervene in cities outside of D.C., where state National Guard units are under gubernatorial control and local police departments are autonomous, remains legally ambiguous, potentially setting up clashes with Democratic state and city leaders.</p>

Morello described Osbourne's life as "on-the-edge," deeming his longevity a "miracle" given his lifestyle. Despite increasing frailty, Osbourne reportedly rallied to attend an afterparty and served as musical director for a benefit concert just weeks before his death, demonstrating his enduring passion. The article confirms Osbourne's official cause of death as cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and Parkinson’s disease, noting he was with family and surrounded by love.</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate activists in Wisconsin, aged 8 to 17, have filed a lawsuit against the state, challenging its pro-fossil fuel policies. The lead plaintiff, Kaarina, shared her traumatic experience of being displaced by climate-exacerbated flooding, which inspired her involvement. The lawsuit targets two state laws that restrict the public service commission from considering air pollution when permitting new fossil fuel plants and from requiring increased carbon-free electricity. Represented by Our Children’s Trust and Midwest Environmental Advocates, the plaintiffs argue these laws violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and the public trust doctrine, amidst mounting climate impacts in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plunged by almost $100 million in market value after the release of a new, simplified logo that eliminated its long-standing "Uncle Herschel" figure. This rebrand is part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's strategy to modernize the 55-year-old chain, which she described as "not as relevant as we once were." The move sparked criticism from conservative commentators who labeled it "woke," and marketing experts who warned of alienating long-time fans. While the company insists its values haven't changed and "Uncle Herschel" remains central in restaurants, the significant market reaction highlights investor and customer concerns over the strategic direction and potential marketing missteps.</p>

While the government did not disclose the exact sum, the claimants' lawyer stated it was £2.9 million, describing it as the "best possible outcome" despite client dissatisfaction with the amounts. This article highlights the resolution of a lengthy legal battle concerning environmental damage and community impact from military activities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the draw for the 2026 men's FIFA World Cup will take place at Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center on December 5. The tournament, which will feature 48 nations across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, marks an expansion from 32 teams. FIFA President Gianni Infantino joined Trump for the announcement, highlighting the global viewership of one billion for the draw and calling the 104 matches "104 Super Bowls." The selection of the Kennedy Center, where Trump serves as chairman, shifts the event from its expected location in Las Vegas, adding a unique political dimension to the major sports announcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines three often-overlooked factors that can reduce Social Security benefits for millions of American retirees, highlighting the importance of understanding these pitfalls for retirement planning. Firstly, working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, temporarily reducing payments. Secondly, Medicare Part B premiums are automatically deducted, with high-income earners facing additional Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) that can significantly increase costs. Lastly, federal income taxes can apply to up to 85% of benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, surprising many retirees. The article suggests options like reverse mortgages, part-time work, or annuities to supplement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are adapting to President Trump's increased tariffs, implementing creative strategies to avoid widespread price hikes for consumers. While some costs have been passed on, companies are diversifying sourcing, pushing back on vendors, and strategically managing discounts. Consumer spending has largely remained steady, though lower-income shoppers show more sensitivity to price changes. The article notes that while tariff costs are rising for retailers, the impact hasn't been as severe as initially feared, with many executives expressing a measured tone.

          <p>President Trump has publicly demanded Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's resignation, even threatening to fire her, following accusations of mortgage fraud made by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Pulte alleges Cook falsified bank and property records to secure more favorable loan terms for two homes simultaneously designated as primary residences. Cook has strongly rejected these claims, stating her refusal to be intimidated into stepping down from her position. This political pressure on a Fed governor is occurring amidst Trump's persistent calls for interest rate cuts, raising concerns about the independence of the central bank, as Cook is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Justice Department is reportedly escalating efforts to prosecute political enemies, exemplified by the recent FBI search of former National Security Advisor John Bolton's home, ostensibly for leaking classified information. This article highlights the unusual public social media posts by top DOJ and FBI officials during the raid, which are interpreted as an attempt to demonstrate retribution to the MAGA base and the president. This situation marks a departure from Trump's first term, where similar demands for prosecution often stalled due to internal hesitations. With loyalists in key positions, the current administration appears more effective in pursuing investigations perceived as politically motivated, signaling a significant shift in the DOJ's operational approach.</p>

Her journey highlights the interplay between physical travel and internal discovery, connecting her animist-leaning Quaker perspective to Japan's Shinto traditions.
