          <p>America's intelligence agencies identify China as the most active and persistent cyber threat to the U.S., actively infiltrating government, private sector, and critical infrastructure. Beyond cyber operations, Beijing's Ministry of State Security (MSS), now the world's largest spy agency, is expanding its human intelligence network to monitor and influence events globally, and to surveil Chinese dissidents within America. This article details how the MSS recruits spies, often through coercion or financial incentives, and highlights the case of Shujun Wang, a Chinese-American historian convicted for secretly spying for nearly two decades. The aggressive nature of these operations reflects President Xi Jinping's ambition to position China at the center of the world stage.</p>

          <p>Two New Orleans high school seniors, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, achieved a mathematical breakthrough by independently developing a trigonometry-based proof for the Pythagorean Theorem, a feat previously thought impossible for 2,000 years. Their innovative work, which included Calcea's "Waffle Cone" method, was presented at an American Mathematical Society conference and gained international recognition. This article celebrates their remarkable accomplishment, highlighting the supportive environment of their all-girls Catholic school, St. Mary's Academy, which fosters a belief in boundless possibilities for its students. Despite their brilliance, both students plan to pursue careers outside of pure mathematics.</p>

While the U.S. Navy retains advantages in overall tonnage and advanced carriers, China is rapidly narrowing the gap, with satellite imagery showing significant expansion of naval bases.
