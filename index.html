          <p>The IRS has released updated federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year, which will be filed in 2027. Income thresholds for each bracket, including the top 37% rate, have been raised, alongside adjustments to capital gains, estate and gift tax exemptions, and earned income tax credit eligibility. The standard deduction will also increase to $32,200 for married couples and $16,100 for single filers. These announcements come amid a government shutdown, with nearly half of the IRS workforce furloughed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Victims of the UK Post Office Horizon IT scandal, considered one of the nation's worst miscarriages of justice, will now receive free government-funded legal advice for their compensation claims. This change, announced by the Business Secretary, aims to help sub-postmasters secure fair payouts, responding to recommendations from a public inquiry. More than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software, with many forced to use personal savings or accept low offers. The government has accepted most inquiry recommendations, extending the Horizon Shortfall Scheme and committing over £1.2 billion in payouts to date.</p>

          <p>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz hosted a high-stakes auto summit to address the industry's deep crisis, marked by job losses, stagnation, and a challenging transition to electric vehicles (EVs). German carmakers like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are struggling against Chinese rivals in the EV market and facing impacts from US protectionist policies. Merz pledged to seek a delay to the EU's 2035 internal combustion engine ban and announced €3 billion in new EV subsidies for households. Experts warn against undermining EV confidence, emphasizing the need for a coordinated industrial and trade policy response to Chinese competition.</p>

The agreement involves a ceasefire, hostage release for Palestinian prisoners, and IDF withdrawal from parts of Gaza, with increased humanitarian aid. However, significant obstacles remain, including Hamas's demand for full Israeli withdrawal and demilitarization, which Israel opposes. The article highlights Trump's leverage over Israel, the impact of the Doha attack, and the complex path ahead for a comprehensive peace in the region.</p>

          <p>The Indian Super League (ISL) is at a critical juncture, facing a governance crisis after India's Supreme Court ordered an open tender for its commercial rights, ending a decade-long exclusive deal. This decision has halted the 2025–26 season and exposed deep structural issues within Indian football, where political influence often blurs administrative lines. While grassroots participation has surged, pathways for young players to professional ranks remain blocked. Experts believe a reset is inevitable, advocating for greater professionalism, transparency, and the introduction of promotion and relegation to ensure a sustainable future for the league.</p>

          <p>California is set to become the first U.S. state to gradually eliminate certain ultra-processed foods from school meals over the next decade. Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law requiring the state's Department of Public Health to define "ultra-processed foods of concern" by mid-2028, with schools beginning to phase them out by July 2029 and a full ban by 2035. This initiative builds on California's history of leading on school nutrition, including free meals and banning synthetic food dyes. While some critics raise concerns about costs and broad definitions, proponents emphasize the health benefits for children.</p>

          <p>Despite an ongoing government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Education is sending notices to student loan borrowers announcing the impending cancellation of their debt under Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plans. Borrowers are informed their loan discharge will be processed over several months, with an opt-out deadline of October 21. This action follows a temporary pause in IBR forgiveness that caused concern among borrowers, especially as IBR is currently the only plan offering debt erasure after decades of payments. The move also comes amidst a lawsuit against the administration by a teachers' union regarding borrower rights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to robust international growth compensating for declining North American volume. While global food and drink volume fell by 1%, CEO Ramon Laguarta noted a strategic shift to smaller packaging to appeal to price-conscious consumers, which boosts revenue despite lower volume. The company is also investing in "permissible" snack offerings and new packaging for brands like Lay's and Doritos to align with consumer health trends and governmental pressure. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has taken a significant stake, pushing for further changes to unlock value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During an ongoing government shutdown, President Trump has threatened to withhold back pay from furloughed federal workers, adding to the challenges faced by public servants. Despite a law requiring retroactive pay, Trump suggested it "depends on who you're talking about," implying some may not deserve it. This move, along with potential mass layoffs, is widely deemed illegal by legal scholars and policy experts. Democrats are banking on courts rejecting these actions while they negotiate healthcare tax credits. The situation is deeply discouraging for prospective public servants, potentially impacting the federal workforce for years.</p>

The report scrutinizes officials in the White House and eight key agencies, including the EPA and energy departments, responsible for energy and climate policy. These appointments align with the administration's broad attacks on climate policies and renewable energy, such as opening federal lands for drilling and crafting tax breaks for the fossil fuel sector.

          <p>The debate over abolishing stamp duty in the UK is intensifying, with both Conservative and Labour parties considering changes. This article examines five potential consequences, including a likely rise in house prices due to increased demand, which could disproportionately benefit wealthier homeowners in southern England. While it could improve mobility for movers and downsizers, freeing up housing stock, its impact on overall transaction costs might be less significant than often perceived. Abolishing stamp duty would also create a substantial revenue gap for the Treasury, potentially leading to tax increases elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>
