          <h2>PLA Carrier Explores Alternative Routes Near Taiwan Ahead of Drills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 02:00:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier reportedly explored a different path to Taiwan's east before recent drills, a move analysts suggest is training to counter nearby American warships and discover alternate routes for potential conflicts. Instead of the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, the Shandong navigated the narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago. Experts say this new route provides the PLA with southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel and northbound options via the waterway between Japan and Taiwan. The Shandong conducted joint maneuvers with naval and aerial units southeast of Taiwan, signaling a strategic adaptation in the region.</p>

          <p>Experts are calling for increased attention to men's health, noting that men are significantly more likely to die prematurely than women. Factors contributing to this include higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use, as well as biological factors and a lack of engagement with health services. Deprivation also plays a significant role, with men in the poorest areas having a much lower life expectancy. The article emphasizes the need for targeted interventions and a greater focus on addressing the specific health needs of men.</p>

          <p>A family has been awarded damages after cancer screening reporting errors led to the death of a mother from cervical cancer. Louise Gleadell was wrongly told her tests were negative in both 2008 and 2012, despite an internal review finding the samples inadequate. The misreporting meant she missed the opportunity for early treatment, and her family has now received an apology and payout from the NHS trust. The case highlights the importance of accurate screening and timely communication in healthcare.</p>

          <p>Washington is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and blocking new arrivals, secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Saturday, complaining the African nation is not accepting its nationals expelled from the US.

The state department “is taking actions to revoke all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and prevent further issuance to prevent entry”, Rubio said in a statement.

It was the first such measure singling out all passport holders from a particular country since Donald Trump returned to the White House on 20 January, having campaigned on an anti-immigration platform.</p>
