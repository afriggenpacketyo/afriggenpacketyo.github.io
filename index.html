          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers experienced a second consecutive day of decline due to investor concerns about a potential price war and increased regulatory scrutiny. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell significantly after the company announced price cuts on multiple electric and plug-in hybrid models. Additionally, China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers to address the practice of marking cars as sold to meet targets, which involves selling zero-mileage cars on the secondhand market. This situation has raised concerns about vehicle margin pressure for BYD in the short term, though the company anticipates offsetting the impact through larger sales and low battery costs.

          <p>Malaysia’s home minister, Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, has faced public ridicule after his WhatsApp account was hacked, raising concerns about the country's digital security. The Home Ministry, which oversees critical functions like policing, immigration, and border control, confirmed the breach and urged the public to disregard messages from anyone claiming to be the minister. This incident highlights the prevalence of mobile phishing scams in Malaysia, where citizens are frequently targeted by fraudsters posing as authorities to extort money.

          <p>Three more inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier this month have been apprehended in Louisiana and Texas, leaving two still at large. The escape, which occurred on May 16, involved ten inmates who exploited a faulty cell door, squeezed through a hole, and scaled a barbed-wire fence. Authorities have been actively searching for the remaining escapees, who were awaiting sentences or trials for violent crimes. A jail maintenance worker has been arrested for allegedly aiding the escape by turning off the water to a toilet, and four other individuals have been arrested for allegedly assisting the inmates after they escaped.</p>

This initiative aims to show that the soil, which retains low-level radioactivity, is suitable for public works projects across Japan. The soil was collected after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that led to a nuclear accident, and it will be used in flowerbeds and other landscaping purposes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the importance of securing public understanding, though previous attempts to reuse the soil have faced local opposition.</p>

Lee's remarks came in response to concerns about recent tax reviews on members of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, where at least 20 members were asked to prepay about HK$1 million. Lee emphasized that no one has the right to evade taxes, regardless of their profession, and that tax evasion could result in imprisonment.

Residents fear the development will exacerbate sewage pollution in the nearby River Great Ouse, as upgrades to the wastewater treatment system are not imminent. The Environment Agency previously objected to new development in Oxford due to similar sewage capacity concerns, highlighting a growing problem across England and Wales. An environmental charity has been granted permission for a judicial review, challenging the council's decision and emphasizing the need for joined-up thinking between housing plans and sewage infrastructure.</p>

The officer questioned whether the arrest was "the best for Nicola" under the circumstances, acknowledging it was an "uncomfortable area for police to be operating in." The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists released guidance reminding healthcare professionals that it is never in the public interest to report women to the police who might have terminated pregnancies illegally.</p>

Advocates argue that the cuts will not save money but will lead to greater costs due to the resulting damage and widespread suffering.
