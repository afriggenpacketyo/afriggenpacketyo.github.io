          <p>Jay Wynne, a beloved former BBC Weather presenter, passed away in June at the age of 56 following a long-term illness, as confirmed by his brother, Matthew. Known for his "gentle clarity" and distinctive presenting style, Wynne made complex weather forecasts accessible and engaging during his tenure at BBC Weather, which began in October 2000 and included regular appearances on BBC News at Ten. Tributes highlighted his passion for the weather, which stemmed from his studies in Environmental Geography and Applied Meteorology, and his commitment to accuracy, often staying up after night shifts to verify his reports. His passing is a loss to the broadcasting community and his many admirers, who remember his wisdom, generosity, and dry sense of humor.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a suspect is in custody for the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, claiming the individual was turned in by a close associate, possibly their father, who drove them to police headquarters. While law enforcement has not officially confirmed the arrest, a high-powered rifle believed to be the murder weapon was recovered in a wooded area near the scene, with spent cartridges reportedly bearing "transgender and anti-fascist" writing, the meaning of which is under investigation. The shooting occurred during Kirk's "American Comeback" tour, hitting him in the neck. Utah Governor Spencer Cox has labeled the incident a "political assassination" and pledged to seek the death penalty, underscoring the gravity of the event and the intensive, ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Labour MPs are publicly and privately criticizing the appointment and swift dismissal of Peter Mandelson as the UK ambassador to the US, following revelations about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Although Mandelson's links were known, new emails published this week, including supportive messages sent after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, prompted his sacking. The controversy has led to calls for transparency regarding the vetting process and raised questions about the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who is increasingly blamed for the "shambles." This situation has fueled despondency among Labour MPs after a chaotic week of resignations, with some demanding the release of pre-appointment documents.</p>

The decade-old company specializes in using alternative data and machine learning algorithms to assess the creditworthiness of consumers with limited financial history, funding its loans through asset-backed securitization, warehouse loans, and sales to institutional investors. This IPO positions Lendbuzz amidst a wave of fellow fintech companies, including Klarna and Chime, that have recently gone public, reflecting a dynamic market for financial technology.

Former chief justice Sushila Karki is being considered, potentially under the "doctrine of necessity," despite constitutional bars. The unrest, initially sparked by a social media ban, escalated into deadly violence, resulting in 51 deaths and widespread jailbreaks, underscoring deep frustrations over misgovernance and corruption that the new administration must address.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, labeling the city "deeply troubled" and stating his intent to "fix" its issues, similar to actions taken in Washington D.C. He claimed support from both Tennessee's Republican Governor Bill Lee and Memphis's Democratic Mayor Paul Young for this federal intervention. The decision was reportedly influenced by Jim Vena, CEO of Union Pacific railroad, who cited severe crime concerns in Memphis, prompting Trump to prioritize the city over previously mentioned Chicago. This controversial move comes amidst ongoing legal challenges to the president's constitutional authority to deploy federal troops in U.S. cities, with D.C. having sued his administration over a similar deployment.</p>

          <p>Rapid urbanization in India has not translated into safety for women, with 40% reporting feeling unsafe in public spaces, particularly at night and on public transport. A recent National Annual Report and Index on Women's Safety (NARI) 2025 ranked Mumbai as safest, while Delhi, Kolkata, and Jaipur were among the least secure, with young women aged 18 to 24 most vulnerable. Experts argue that merely technical fixes like CCTV are insufficient; true urban safety requires integrating social understanding with technical measures, including creating vibrant, inclusive public spaces. Deep-rooted patriarchal norms and victim-blaming mindsets further shape women's safety, necessitating a coordinated, inter-disciplinary approach that involves grassroots NGOs and addresses societal values to create genuinely safe and free cities for women.</p>

          <p>The Dutch public broadcaster, Avrotros, has announced the Netherlands will boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel participates, echoing a similar stance by Irish broadcaster RTÉ. Both broadcasters cite "the ongoing and severe human suffering in Gaza" and the "serious erosion of press freedom" as reasons for their potential withdrawal. Irish musician Phil Coulter has also urged the UK to join the boycott, highlighting widespread public disgust over events in Gaza. This move follows calls from over 70 former Eurovision contestants for Israel to be banned from the competition, putting significant pressure on the Eurovision organizer, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), to make a decision on Israel's inclusion.</p>

          <p>Popular longtime Providence television meteorologist Kelly Bates announced on Facebook that she and "a number" of colleagues at ABC6 have lost their jobs due to the station's acquisition by a new parent company. Bates, who previously left NBC10 after a contract dispute in 2021 before joining ABC6 in 2022, expressed frustration but also praised her former colleagues as "magic makers" and "finest humans." The layoffs, attributed to redundancies by the new ownership, underscore the precarious nature of local media employment amidst industry consolidation and corporate restructuring. Bates, an Emmy nominee and multiple-time "best female meteorologist" award winner, is now seeking new employment and has received significant public support.</p>

          <p>The US Social Security trust fund faces depletion in about eight years, threatening a 23% benefit cut for retirees unless reforms are enacted, prompting a looming political battle. Economist Tyler Cowen notes France's "longest financed retirements," highlighting the challenge of increasing life expectancies and the political difficulty of raising retirement ages. Raising the retirement age, a common bipartisan proposal, is debated for its regressive impact, disproportionately affecting poorer workers whose life expectancy gains have not kept pace with wealthier individuals. A proposed solution suggests raising the retirement age only for the top 40% of earners, along with other progressive cuts and tax hikes, to ensure solvency without unduly burdening the most vulnerable, creating a more equitable approach.

Key pitfalls include failing to "look under the hood" to understand underlying assets, "chasing performance" based on past returns in "buzzworthy ETFs" like bitcoin or cannabis, and frequent trading, which can negate the benefits of low cost and tax efficiency. Investors are advised to align ETF picks with their risk tolerance and long-term goals, avoiding treating them as short-term trading vehicles, as poorly timed trading has hurt investor returns.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital, Doha, has ignited a diplomatic crisis and raised questions about the value of US President Donald Trump's pledges of protection to the emirate. Despite Qatar's substantial investments in US military bases and a luxury jet donation to Trump, Israel acted with apparent impunity, disrupting crucial ceasefire talks. The Qatari prime minister condemned the attack as "state terrorism," while Israeli officials indicated they would not hesitate to target Hamas leaders in Qatar again, asserting no immunity for terrorists. This incident underscores Israel's growing sense of impunity under Netanyahu and the perceived worthlessness of US protection when it conflicts with Israeli objectives, leading to a collapse of current negotiations.</p>

          <p>American colleges face rampant grade inflation and declining academic rigor, partly driven by the flawed system of teacher evaluations. Professors are incentivized to lighten workloads and give higher grades to boost their scores, which critically impact their pay, hiring, and tenure, leading to an academic "equilibrium" of mutual grade inflation. Extensive research shows students are poor judges of teaching quality, often preferring less challenging instruction and exhibiting biases like gender or attractiveness in their ratings. While some universities are exploring alternative review processes to reduce reliance on these evaluations, they remain entrenched, as colleges fear backlash from tuition-paying "customers" who expect to critique their service, despite the system's documented shortcomings.</p>

While overall holiday retail sales are projected to rise by about 3% this year, it's a slower pace than 2024, with e-commerce expected to provide an extra boost. Retailers placed orders earlier to guard against price shocks, with many absorbing more of the tariff hit for now, though this strategy may not be sustainable long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

While focusing on preventing AI-enabled biological weapons, cyberattacks, or rogue systems, it seeks to adapt as AI evolves and applies to companies generating over $500 million in revenue.
