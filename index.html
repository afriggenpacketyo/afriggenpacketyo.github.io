          <p>Russia's military asserts it has regained full control of the Kursk region, a claim Ukraine disputes, eight months after Kyiv's incursion. Russian commander Valery Gerasimov praised North Korean troops' assistance, marking Russia's first public acknowledgment of their involvement. President Putin hailed Ukraine's efforts in Kursk as a complete failure, while Ukraine maintains its troops are still operating in the border region, dismissing Moscow's claims as propaganda. The US-based ISW think-tank reported recent Russian advances near the Kursk border and ongoing fighting in Belgorod Oblast, indicating a complex and contested situation in the area.</p>

          <p>Joseph Koenig, now 20, was convicted of first-degree murder after a night of throwing rocks at cars resulted in the death of Alexa Bartell. Two other teenagers involved testified against Koenig after reaching deals with prosecutors. The incident occurred in April 2023 when a 9-pound rock crashed through Bartell's windshield, killing her instantly. While Koenig's lawyers argued he didn't know anyone was hurt and had a personality disorder, jurors found him guilty, leading to a mandatory life term. The other two teens face significant prison sentences as well.</p>

The blast caused widespread damage, blowing out windows and roofs of nearby buildings, with residents reporting feeling the impact up to 50km away. Initial reports suggested the fire was due to improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, while later statements from customs officials indicated a fire in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing accusations of attempting to intimidate the judiciary, exemplified by the arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan. Critics argue the administration's actions, including comments from Attorney General Pam Bondi, send a message that judges who displease the administration will be targeted. This follows similar incidents and broader concerns about the administration's disregard for judicial independence. Some legal experts believe the Dugan case is questionable and fits a narrative of vilifying judges who rule against the administration in deportation cases.</p>

          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as the first-ever vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), signaling a likely successor. The move aims to address international doubts over Palestinian leadership. However, it's unlikely to improve Fatah's image among Palestinians, many of whom view the party as corrupt and out of touch. Abbas faces pressure to reform the Palestinian Authority (PA) for a potential role in post-war Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines "woman" and "sex" as biological.

It also states that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use.
