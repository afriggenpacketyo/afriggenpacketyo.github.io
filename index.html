          <p>Researchers from several Chinese institutions have created a "digital embryo," a high-resolution spatiotemporal atlas of early human organogenesis. This model provides an unprecedented tool for understanding the complex processes of cell differentiation and organ formation during the critical early stages of embryonic development. The scientists state that this digital map helps decode how a single fertilized egg develops into hundreds of cell types and can provide insights into the origins of developmental defects and diseases. The research aims to illuminate how abnormalities during this period can lead to serious health conditions later in life.</p>

          <p>Despite conceding the Democratic primary, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will remain on the November ballot for New York City mayor under the independent "Fight and Deliver" line. A source close to the campaign confirmed the decision, stating Cuomo is analyzing data before deciding on the extent of his campaign activity. Cuomo himself noted that the general election presents a "totally different landscape" and that he qualified for the independent line to appeal to voters disillusioned with the Democratic Party. His mayoral run follows his resignation as governor four years ago amid sexual harassment allegations.</p>

Notably, major AI companies from both the US and China were absent from the forum, which was attended primarily by representatives from Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America.

          <p>The ACLU of Idaho has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law set to restrict public benefits for undocumented residents, including access to life-saving HIV/AIDS medication. The complaint, filed on behalf of a doctor and four patients, argues the law is vague, contradicts federal statutes, and poses a severe public health risk by potentially increasing HIV transmission. The law requires verification of legal residency for services like communicable disease testing and prenatal care. Health officials have determined that HIV treatment under the federal Ryan White Program is not considered an emergency, making patients ineligible without proof of legal status.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed significant changes to its welfare reform bill following a major rebellion from over 100 of its own Labour backbenchers. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced that planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and Universal Credit will now only apply to future claimants, protecting those currently receiving benefits. This move is seen as a "massive climbdown" to avoid a potential defeat in the House of Commons. Rebel MPs, who had threatened to block the bill, have largely expressed satisfaction with the concessions, making the bill's passage now likely.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative Conor Lamb, who lost to John Fetterman in the 2022 Democratic primary, is reemerging in Pennsylvania politics, fueling speculation of a future challenge. Lamb has been appearing at town halls, often as a stand-in for Fetterman, and has been critical of the senator's willingness to cooperate with President Trump and his stance on issues like the war in Gaza. This comes as some progressive Democrats express growing frustration with Fetterman, feeling he has strayed from the party's core principles. Lamb states he is not currently running for office but is unafraid to publicly criticize Fetterman's political positions.</p>

Professor Jin Keyu of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology stated that China will not achieve true wealth unless it transitions from its production-focused model. She warned that China's export-heavy economy could create friction with global trading partners and suggested that local governments should measure success based on consumption metrics. The consensus was that fostering internal consumption, particularly in the services sector, is crucial for China's long-term economic harmony and prosperity.</p>

This trend is amplified by the fact that a majority of millennial and Gen Z travelers use platforms like TikTok and Douyin for holiday planning.

          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the largest monthly drop since last October and signaling that stimulus measures are not yet boosting corporate financial health. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the decline to weak domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods. For the first five months of 2025, cumulative profits for major industrial firms were down 1.1% year-over-year. Despite this downturn, some economists believe Beijing may not introduce significant new stimulus, as other economic indicators like retail sales have shown robust performance.

However, twelve other prisons remain under heightened security. The initial lockdown suspended visits and limited inmate movement. During the two-week period, investigators conducted extensive searches, uncovering 169 weapons and 310 cellphones. The measures were a response to a rise in inmate deaths, with 13 homicides and 41 other unexpected deaths, including suspected overdoses, recorded this year.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the United States and China have reached an agreement to facilitate the shipment of rare earth minerals to the U.S. This development is part of a framework to implement the broader Geneva agreement and comes amid ongoing efforts to de-escalate the trade war between the two nations. China had previously suspended exports of many critical minerals as a retaliatory measure against U.S. tariffs, disrupting global supply chains for industries like automotive and aerospace. The new understanding aims to resolve these disruptions, although the path to a final, comprehensive trade deal remains long.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid delivered a cohesive performance to defeat Red Bull Salzburg 3-0 in Philadelphia, ensuring they finished as winners of Group H in the Club World Cup. The victory, orchestrated under new manager Xabi Alonso's 3-5-2 formation, means they will avoid a last-16 clash with Manchester City. Stars Jude Bellingham and VinÃ­cius JÃºnior were instrumental, with VinÃ­cius scoring the first goal from a Bellingham assist and later setting up a second for Fede Valverde. The result sets up a knockout match against Juventus and demonstrates the team's improving form under Alonso's more structured tactical approach.</p>

          <p>An Egyptian national has been deported after pleading guilty to kicking a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The man, Hamed Ramadan Bayoumy Aly Marie, 70, kicked the dog "so hard that he was lifted off of the ground" after it alerted officers to his luggage. A search of his bags revealed over 100 pounds of prohibited food products. The dog, Freddie, sustained contusions. Marie was sentenced to time served, ordered to pay the dog's veterinary bills, and was placed on a flight back to Egypt following his court appearance.</p>

          <p>China's Defence Ministry has issued a stern warning to the Philippines, cautioning against "self-inflicted destruction" for its decision to host U.S. anti-ship missile systems. A ministry spokesman stated that by binding itself to the "U.S. war machine," Manila is undermining regional security and stability. The warning comes after the U.S. deployed its NMESIS missile system in the Philippines during a joint military exercise, which the Philippine military says will remain as a deterrent. Beijing also condemned Manila's plan to encourage its fishermen to operate in disputed areas of the South China Sea.</p>

          <h2>Trump Omits July 4 Deadline in Final Pitch for Major Tax and Spending Bill</h2>

          <p>In a White House address, President Donald Trump made a final pitch for his major tax-and-spending bill but notably omitted his previous demand for a July 4 deadline. The bill, which extends tax cuts from his first term and increases funding for immigration enforcement, is facing a potential logjam in the Senate. Trump argued the legislation would benefit working families, while Democrats have strongly opposed it, citing significant cuts to programs like Medicaid and food assistance. The lack of a deadline in his speech suggests a recognition of the legislative challenges ahead for his marquee proposal.</p>
