          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a criminal investigation into Andrew M. Cuomo, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, following accusations that he lied to Congress regarding his decisions as governor during the COVID-19 pandemic. This inquiry comes after the Justice Department dismissed corruption charges against current Mayor Eric Adams, creating concerns about the department being used for political purposes. Cuomo's spokesman has questioned the investigation's timing and basis, calling it 'lawfare and election interference.'

          <p>The Trump administration has decided against finalizing a rule that would have allowed millions of Medicare and Medicaid recipients to access GLP-1 drugs for weight loss. Despite this, some states like South Carolina are choosing to cover these medications for Medicaid beneficiaries, albeit with stringent prerequisites. The medications, which include Wegovy, are expensive and have faced resistance from insurers due to their high cost. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s in the future as costs decrease, but for now, access remains limited.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is facing a lawsuit filed by Alliance Defending Freedom on behalf of Female Athletes United and anonymous softball players. The lawsuit challenges the state's policy of allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports, citing Title IX violations. The controversy arose after a transgender softball pitcher dominated the season, leading to debates about fairness and safety in sports. Ellison defends the rights of all students to participate, while critics argue it disadvantages female athletes. This article covers a contentious issue with strong opinions on both sides.</p>

International leaders, including those from the UK, France, and Canada, have condemned Israel's blockade and threatened action.

With gonorrhoea cases at their highest since 1918 and increasing antibiotic resistance, this initiative aims to reduce infections and ease pressure on sexual health clinics. Public Health Scotland is also planning a similar program, while health bodies in Wales and Northern Ireland are considering the move.</p>

Despite the divisions, Trump expressed confidence that the bill would pass, emphasizing the need for unity and compromise.

          <p>A new analysis reveals that studies on red meat funded by the red meat industry are nearly four times more likely to report favorable or neutral cardiovascular results compared to independently funded studies. The industry-funded studies often failed to compare red meat to heart-healthy plant-based protein sources. Experts worry that this trend could undermine nutrition science and confuse consumers. As government funding for nutrition research declines, the influence of industry-sponsored research may increase, potentially affecting public health understanding of dietary choices.</p>

The truce signals that neither side is willing â€“ nor prepared â€“ to sever economic ties completely.

The company's fiscal 2025 third-quarter revenue increased 15% year over year to $2.29 billion, exceeding estimates, and adjusted EPS increased 21% to 80 cents. The drop may be attributed to the company not raising its full-year outlook for key metrics like remaining performance obligation (RPO) and next-gen security ARR. Palo Alto Networks has reached an inflection point in customer adoption for the security products that are critical to its future growth in the cloud-computing and artificial intelligence eras, according to CEO Nikesh Arora.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Senator Chris Van Hollen engaged in a heated exchange during a Senate hearing. Van Hollen criticized Rubio's handling of foreign policy issues, including the freezing of humanitarian aid in Sudan and deportations to El Salvador, stating he regretted voting for Rubio's confirmation. Rubio defended the Trump administration's policies and ridiculed Van Hollen for meeting with a gang member who was mistakenly deported. The exchange highlighted deep divisions over the administration's approach to foreign policy and human rights.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued sharp condemnation of Israel's recent actions in Gaza, citing the humanitarian crisis and renewed military offensive. Britain suspended free-trade talks with Israel, while all three countries jointly demanded an end to the military escalation. The leaders expressed concern over the high Palestinian death toll and the Israeli blockade of humanitarian aid. Prime Minister Netanyahu dismissed the criticism, accusing the countries of offering a "huge prize" to Hamas and tacitly encouraging a repeat of the October 7 attacks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to construct a new missile defense shield called the "Golden Dome," estimated to cost $175 billion and be operational within three years. The project, led by Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, aims to protect the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, even those launched from space. Experts cite advancements in technology since the 1980s as reasons for the project's feasibility. Critics question the steep price tag and whether the system can be fully developed within the given timeframe.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers have informed a court that the Trump administration has illegally deported two Asian men to South Sudan, violating a previous court order. The attorneys said a flight carrying a dozen people, including citizens of Myanmar and Vietnam, landed in South Sudan on Tuesday. Judge Brian Murphy issued a ruling on 18 April requiring that illegal migrants have a chance to challenge removal to countries other than their homelands. South Sudan is one of the world's poorest countries, and has been plagued by conflict and political instability in recent years.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer analyzed Tuesday's market action, attributing the retreat of indexes to rising bond yields as Wall Street awaits a federal budget bill. He said that stocks related to "fickle consumers" and banks react to bonds, because when rates go higher there's usually less economic activity. He highlighted GE Vernova as a company that can withstand changes in the bond market, saying the power outfit stands to benefit from the ever-growing need for energy as data centers continue to proliferate. This article provides insight into the interplay between bond yields and stock market performance.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged House Republicans not to pursue additional Medicaid cuts in a bill aimed at advancing his agenda. The push comes as hard-liners are seeking stricter Medicaid cuts before the bill heads to the floor. Trump also urged Republicans to accept the current deal on state and local tax deductions (SALT) and "move on." He emphasized unity and delivering for the American people. Despite the pressure, some hard-liners believe changes to the bill are still possible.</p>

          <p>If Republicans pass their tax and spending bill, the record will arrive even sooner â€” putting Americaâ€™s debt at more than 113 percent of the size of its entire economy. Under the G.O.P. megabill being considered in the House, budget experts now say, the U.S. debt would blow past the record even sooner and climb significantly higher in coming decades. The measure will increase the federal debt by a lot more. It would widen the gap further by extending and expanding tax cuts and increasing military spending, partly offset by spending cuts in other areas. Elevated interest rates over the past few years have made it more costly for the government to borrow money, accelerating the debtâ€™s upward trajectory.</p>

The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a "Make America Healthy Again Commission," which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.</p>
