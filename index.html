        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders with the goal of expediting nuclear power plant construction by streamlining regulations and incentivizing development on federal lands. The orders direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to revise its rules and expedite approval processes, aiming for decisions within 18 months, potentially including relaxed radiation exposure limits. The administration also seeks to quadruple the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050 and rebuild domestic uranium supplies, however, skeptics worry about safety shortcuts and the loss of staff at the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office could hinder financing for new reactors. This New York Times article provides context for the nuclear industry's struggles with costs and regulatory hurdles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to dismiss criminal charges against a top MS-13 leader, Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, to deport him to El Salvador, raising concerns about limiting disclosures regarding Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's past ties to the gang. Arevalo-Chavez has knowledge of a secretive pact between Bukele's government and MS-13, involving concessions in exchange for reduced violence and electoral support. Critics argue that deporting him prevents him from testifying in a U.S. court.
