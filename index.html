          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan, aged 91, was discharged from the University of Tokyo Hospital after undergoing a thorough examination of his heart condition. He had been admitted to the hospital following an earlier health checkup that revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. In 2022, Akihito received treatment for heart failure, marking a period of health concerns for the retired monarch. He abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, becoming the first Japanese monarch to step down in approximately two centuries, signaling a significant shift in imperial tradition.</p>

          <p>Newark, N.J. Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing at the Delaney Hall detention center, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, during a visit with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation. The facility has recently started housing migrants detained by ICE, and Baraka has been a vocal opponent of its opening, citing concerns over permits and safety. Governor Phil Murphy expressed outrage at Baraka's arrest, calling for his immediate release, while members of Congress suggested the arrest was an act of intimidation. The Department of Homeland Security claims members of Congress "stormed the gate" at the facility, escalating tensions further.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for critical trade negotiations aimed at resolving a trade war intensified by increased tariffs.

          <p>President Trump has agreed to remove the 25 percent tariffs on steel imported from Britain, offering a respite to the struggling British steel industry, particularly for companies like Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield. The tariffs, imposed earlier in the year, had significantly increased costs and complexities for British steelmakers already facing weak demand and high energy expenses. While the tariff removal brings cautious optimism, uncertainties remain regarding products processed in the European Union before being shipped to the United States. The Trump administration's unpredictable trade policies continue to create instability, making long-term planning difficult for businesses in the steel sector.</p>

This exodus is driven by tariffs so high that they have effectively halted trade between the two countries, pushing Chinese businesses to seek alternatives.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts and layoffs at numerous federal agencies, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) cost-cutting initiative. Judge Susan Illston ruled that federal employee unions are likely to prove the administration's reorganization and downsizing efforts exceed its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. This decision underscores concerns about the administration's power to reorganize federal agencies without Congressional approval.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have introduced the initial components of a roughly $4 trillion tax cut plan, aiming to extend key provisions of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts while proposing temporary expansions for his second term. The legislation seeks to lock in place the larger standard deduction and lower individual income tax rates, while also adding $1,000 to the standard deduction and increasing the child tax credit temporarily. Democrats have criticized the plan, focusing on the proposed cuts to programs for the poor to finance tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy, creating a challenging path for the legislation to pass.</p>

Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, was informed of her dismissal via email.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the Librarian of Congress to be appointed by a congressional commission rather than by presidents, emphasizing the importance of the role and the need for a non-partisan approach.</p>

          <p>Hawaii has reached a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies over its lawsuit regarding the blood thinner Plavix. The settlement resolves claims about the efficacy and safety of Plavix, with the funds divided equally between Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi. The lawsuit alleged that the companies did not adequately update their labels despite knowing that about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians, might have a "diminished response" to Plavix. Neither company has admitted wrongdoing, but the settlement marks a significant victory for the state.</p>
