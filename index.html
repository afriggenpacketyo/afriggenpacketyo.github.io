          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has contacted Tesla following social media videos showing its robotaxis operating erratically in Austin, Texas. These incidents included a robotaxi traveling the wrong way and another braking abruptly due to stationary police vehicles. The pilot service, using Model Y SUVs with FSD Unsupervised software, is limited to invited users and operates only during daylight in good weather with a safety supervisor present. This scrutiny comes amid ongoing investigations into Tesla's FSD-Supervised technology following previous accidents. The agency's involvement highlights the regulatory challenges and safety concerns surrounding the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles, especially as Tesla faces increasing competition from companies like Waymo.

          <p>Florida's Operation Dragon Eye, led by the U.S. Marshals Office, rescued dozens of children from child sex trafficking operations. The initiative involved 20 agencies and focused on locating 60 critically missing children and apprehending suspects involved in trafficking, drugs, and child endangerment. The rescued children, aged 9 to 17, received immediate medical and psychological support. Florida is among the top three states for reported human trafficking cases, prompting increased funding and legislative efforts to combat the issue, including stricter penalties for traffickers and awareness training for various professionals. The operation sends a message that Florida will not be a safe place for traffickers, and the state remains committed to finding missing children.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of aerial attacks following Israel's initial strike on Iran's nuclear program. This announcement came after Iran reportedly carried out a missile attack on the United States’ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. According to a U.S. official, there were no casualties at the base. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war concludes, but neither Israel nor Iran has confirmed the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, including conflict-ridden regions. This decision pauses a lower court ruling that required immigrants to have a meaningful opportunity to claim they would face torture or death if deported to certain countries. Justice Sotomayor dissented, accusing the court of rewarding lawlessness by allowing the government to violate due process rights. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a victory, while immigrant rights groups expressed concern over the safety of those deported.</p>

He also noted that the market seems to agree, as oil prices decreased. Braziel cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are causing issues for exporters, making global customers wary of relying on the U.S. as a trustworthy energy supplier.

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that increasing veterinary costs are causing more pet owners to euthanize their animals or delay necessary treatment. Many attribute these rising costs to large corporations acquiring veterinary practices, leading to pressure to generate income. Animal welfare charities report a significant increase in applications for financial assistance for emergency vet care. The British Veterinary Association acknowledges the rising costs but asserts that fees reflect the prices needed to maintain viable businesses, and urges pet owners to discuss cost concerns with their vets to find suitable treatment plans. The Competition and Markets Authority is currently investigating whether a lack of competition in the veterinary sector has contributed to soaring prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump's high-risk strategy of striking Iranian nuclear facilities may yield positive results if Iran's retaliation ends with limited damage. Trump stated that Iran's response was weak and expressed hope for peace in the region. The situation echoes the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, where initial escalation de-escalated. Trump's approach involves a high-stakes gamble that could lead to negotiations and a resolution, but success hinges on Iran's willingness to de-escalate and engage in earnest discussions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb nuclear sites in Iran has sparked debate in Congress over war powers, with Democrats claiming they were not properly briefed. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused the president of potentially misleading the public and wants to know what the administration is hiding. Some lawmakers are pushing for a war powers resolution to require congressional approval before further action against Iran, while House Speaker Mike Johnson argues it's not the appropriate time. The Trump administration is expected to brief all House and Senate lawmakers soon.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices. The agreement aims to standardize the prior authorization approval process, deliver decisions faster, and reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization. The officials are hopeful that the agreement will cover 275 million Americans. The insurance industry often argues insurers “target its use” to prevent wasteful testing by doctors, but prior authorization is known to be incredibly widespread: in 2023, a spokesperson for a lobbying group told FierceHealthcare that 93% of beneficiaries were in plans that required prior authorization for nearly a quarter of services.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about the impact on oil supplies and potential increases in energy prices. While oil prices initially surged, they later declined due to speculation that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz. Experts warn that ongoing tensions could disrupt the energy market, with potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities posing a significant risk. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to a spike in oil prices, potentially reaching $130 per barrel, while U.S. gas prices are expected to rise in the short term.</p>

          <p>President Trump raised the idea of toppling Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, using the phrase "Make Iran Great Again," a play on his own campaign slogan. This suggests a shift from discouraging Israeli military strikes to potentially supporting broader regime change. The move has created division within the MAGA right, with some aides unprepared for the change in rhetoric. Trump's stance exemplifies the hubris of the Iraq War project, promising to easily transform Iran, a country of 90 million people, much like past claims about Iraq.</p>

          <p>Sayed Naser, an Afghan national who served as a translator for U.S. troops, was detained at his immigration hearing in San Diego. Naser, who entered the U.S. legally, had been granted humanitarian parole and was in the process of scheduling an asylum hearing when he was arrested by ICE. His attorney expressed dismay at the arrest, noting that Naser has no criminal record and has a brother who was granted asylum weeks before his detention. Naser is being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center.</p>

          <p>Monica Sementelli was sentenced to life without parole for orchestrating the murder of her husband, celebrity hairstylist Fabio Sementelli. A jury convicted her of murder and conspiracy to commit murder for masterminding the slaying on their Woodland Hills deck. The crime was committed by Robert Baker, Sementelli's lover, in what was supposed to appear as a home invasion robbery gone wrong. Blood from the crime scene was soon linked to Robert Baker, a convicted sex offender and former porn star who began an affair with Monica Sementilli after serving as her racquetball coach at a West Hills fitness club.</p>
