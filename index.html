The deal would see Kohberger plead guilty to all counts in exchange for four consecutive life sentences, avoiding the death penalty. While the father of victim Madison Mogen expressed relief at avoiding a prolonged trial, the family of Kaylee Goncalves stated they were "beyond furious" and had not been consulted, demanding a full confession and accountability.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed the Republican party's major tax and spending bill by a slim 51-50 margin, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The passage followed a marathon session lasting over 24 hours, marking a significant legislative victory for President Trump's agenda. Three Republican senators—Thom Tillis, Rand Paul, and Susan Collins—voted against the measure, citing concerns over its impact on the deficit and cuts to social programs. The bill, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on border security and defense, now returns to the House for final approval.</p>

          <p>The UK government narrowly won a key vote on its welfare bill after making significant last-minute concessions to concerned Labour MPs. To avoid a defeat, the government agreed to delay changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) eligibility rules until after a wider review is complete, gutting a key cost-saving measure from the bill. This U-turn followed previous reversals on cuts to Universal Credit, putting pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' spending plans.

The right-wing House Freedom Caucus has already criticized the Senate version for increasing the deficit.

The author notes that this threat is not isolated to Musk, as similar suggestions have been made about progressive politician Zohran Mamdani.

          <p>A company named ZymoChem is tackling the environmental impact of disposable diapers by creating a biodegradable alternative to a key plastic component. Using a fermentation process similar to brewing beer, the startup converts sugar from corn into a bio-based, biodegradable super absorbent polymer (SAP), which constitutes a large portion of a typical diaper. The company claims its product is nearing cost parity with traditional fossil-based polymers. ZymoChem's materials can be used as a drop-in ingredient for other manufacturers and have attracted investment from companies like Lululemon for use in bio-based nylon apparel.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares fell over 5% after President Donald Trump suggested that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) should investigate federal subsidies received by Elon Musk's companies. In a social media post, Trump claimed that without government support, Musk would have to "close up shop," a threat he later reiterated to reporters. The comments mark a sharp escalation in the public feud between the two, which stems from Musk's vocal opposition to the president's tax and spending bill. Musk responded on his platform X, stating he supports cutting all subsidies, including his own.</p>

In a statement, the duo clarified they do not advocate for the death of any group of people but for the dismantling of a "violent military machine."

If the deal is approved by shareholders, Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which could lead to the disappearance of the TSB brand from High Streets. Santander has a history of absorbing the brands of banks it acquires, such as Abbey and Alliance & Leicester. The takeover would create the UK's third-largest bank by personal current accounts, but a spokeswoman did not rule out job cuts and branch closures due to role duplication.</p>

          <p>The Republican spending bill passed by the Senate includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates could cause 11.8 million people to lose health insurance by 2034. The cuts stem from provisions like a strict new national work requirement for beneficiaries and a cap on provider taxes that states use to fund their Medicaid programs. Healthcare advocates warn these changes will disproportionately harm vulnerable Americans and could force the closure of many rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid funding, jeopardizing care in those communities.

Despite the low player ranking, Clark will serve as a team captain, an honor determined solely by fan votes. The discrepancy has fueled the narrative that some WNBA players are jealous of the attention Clark receives. However, the voting process, where players select four guards, means Clark was left off many ballots rather than being explicitly ranked ninth. Clark's weighted score, combining fan, media, and player votes, still secured her a spot as an All-Star starter.</p>

When asked if the concept was that alligators would eat detainees who tried to escape, Trump responded, "I guess that’s the concept," and joked that immigrants would need to learn to run in a zigzag pattern to evade them. The new facility, constructed rapidly in the Everglades, has been met with protests from environmentalists, immigration advocates, and Indigenous groups.
