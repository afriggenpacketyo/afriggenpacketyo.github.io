          <p>President Trump stated that he will not make a deal with China on tariffs until the trade deficit is resolved, emphasizing that the US loses hundreds of billions of dollars annually due to this deficit. He also mentioned that China did not approve the TikTok deal because of the tariffs. Trump expressed willingness to deal with China, but only if they address their surplus. The President's stance reflects a firm approach to trade negotiations, prioritizing the reduction of the trade deficit with China.&#x20;

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant downturn following President Trump's announcement of tariffs on U.S. imports and reciprocal levies on numerous countries. Japan's Nikkei 225 index plummeted nearly 8%, while other Asian markets also saw substantial losses, reflecting investor anxiety over the potential economic repercussions of the tariffs. China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products. The tariffs have raised concerns about increased inflation, reduced consumer spending, and hindered economic growth, leading to fears of a severe global trade war.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other nations have intensified fears of a global trade war, casting a shadow over investors' portfolios and leading to market declines.

Treasury Secretary Bessent dismissed recession fears, while economists warn that the tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices and an increased risk of recession.

Worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, which could lead to a slowdown in economic activity that would ultimately hurt demand for oil.

          <p>President Donald Trump said Sunday evening that he is not intentionally engineering the ongoing stock market sell-off, but said little to try and dissuade it. He said that sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something, citing the trade deficit with China as his rationale for pressing on with his tariffs plan. Trump's comments echo those made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who on Sunday said the administration will remain steadfast in its plans for reciprocal tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, even in the face of the global stock market sell-off.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a landmark Justice Department office created during the civil rights movement. The office's mission is to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders. Former leaders of the Community Relations Service worry that shuttering the office could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments or city leaders and minority communities nationwide. Some of the current Community Relations Service staff would be reassigned to federal prosecutors' offices nationwide.</p>

The Washington Capitals' captain made history when he scored against the New York Islanders by beating fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin on a power play. Ovechkin dived onto the ice to celebrate as so many Capitals fans in attendance chanted "Ovi! Ovi!" from the stands. Wayne Gretzky congratulated Ovechkin and his family for the accomplishment, adding, "They say records are made to be broken, but I'm not sure who's going to get more goals than that."</p>

          <p>Newly-qualified medical students in the UK are facing uncertainty over their job locations, with some being told their placement only weeks before starting. This is due to a new system of allocating foundation jobs, which assigns jobs randomly rather than based on merit. The British Medical Association has accused the government of failing to plan for an increase in resident doctors after increasing the number of medical school places. This uncertainty is causing stress and anxiety for new doctors and could lead to some seeking employment abroad.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 10% universal tariffs on all U.S. imports have taken effect, prompting him to urge Americans to "hang tough" and calling the move an "economic revolution." The tariffs are intended to revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs, and generate federal revenue. However, the announcement has sent global markets plummeting, and China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products. The situation has raised concerns about a potential trade war and its impact on the global economy.</p>
