            <p>White House "Border Czar" Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's decision to return Kilmer Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, alleging he is an MS-13 member and a public safety threat. Homan argued that the administration did not have the ability to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return, claiming Abrego Garcia is under El Salvador's jurisdiction. He criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accusing him of supporting a gang member. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family deny his MS-13 affiliation, which is currently disputed in court.</p>

            <p>The ACLU appealed to the Supreme Court seeking an emergency injunction to prevent the deportation of Venezuelan nationals from Texas under the Alien Enemies Act. This appeal came after the ACLU requested injunctions from two federal judges, including James E. Boasberg, who scheduled a hearing. The ACLU is advocating for a deportation ban on two Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet Detention Center, accusing the administration of labeling them as members of the Tren de Aragua gang.

            <p>Foreign students in the U.S. are experiencing heightened anxiety due to recent detentions and visa revocations, particularly those involved in pro-Palestinian protests. Over 1,000 international students have had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, often without clear explanation. The Trump administration maintains that visas are a "privilege" that can be revoked, leading to fear and uncertainty on college campuses. Students are taking precautions, such as carrying cards listing their constitutional rights, and professors are offering spare rooms to those worried about arrest.</p>

            <p>President Trump and his team are reportedly exploring options for removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. This consideration follows Trump's criticism of Powell's monetary policy, particularly his decision to hold interest rates steady. While the president nominates the Fed chair, the role is designed to be independent. Trump is reportedly considering Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a potential replacement for Powell, though Warsh has advised allowing Powell to complete his term. (not investment advice)</p>

Sea lions have a moderate survival rate when treated promptly, but handling them can be challenging due to their size. Domoic acid blooms are becoming more frequent and severe due to human activity and climate change, resulting in warmer ocean temperatures.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish Tufts University student detained by immigration authorities, be transferred to Vermont for a hearing. Ozturk's lawyers allege that her detention is retaliation for an op-ed she co-wrote in the student newspaper. She was detained in Massachusetts and transported to a detention center in Louisiana. Her lawyers are challenging the legal authority for her detention and argue that it violates her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process.</p>

            <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has been placed on paternity leave in anticipation of the birth of his first child with his wife, Mamiko Tanaka. Ohtani will stay back in Los Angeles, and veteran outfielder Eddie Rosario has been called up from triple A to replace him on the roster. Ohtani can stay on the paternity list for up to three days but could rejoin the team sooner. The Dodgers transferred reliever Edgardo Henriquez to the 60-day injured list to make room for Rosario.</p>

This ultimatum has jeopardized hopes that U.S. impatience with Russia would translate into further sanctions, potentially benefiting the Kremlin more than Kyiv.</p>

The U.S. is seeking to block such cooperation, forcing Latin American governments to navigate a difficult balance between the two superpowers. Analysts anticipate that the Trump administration will intensify scrutiny of Sino-Latin American space cooperation and adopt a more assertive approach. However, it is unlikely that Latin American countries will abandon the China partnership if the U.S. cannot provide competitive alternatives.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration faces limited options after wrongfully deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a court order barring his deportation. The Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling requiring the administration to "facilitate" his return. However, the administration has not complied, arguing that the courts cannot compel the President to request El Salvador's assistance. An appeals court has rejected this rationale, leaving the administration with the choice of complying with court orders or continuing to defy them.</p>

The government claims the action was necessary to end the koalas' suffering from burns and starvation. However, animal welfare advocates argue that logging and development have contributed to habitat loss, exacerbating the situation. Experts are skeptical that shooting the animals from helicopters is the best approach, advocating for rescue as the first option when feasible.</p>
