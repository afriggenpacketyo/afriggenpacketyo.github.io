          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced revenue that surpassed analyst expectations in its first earnings report since its IPO, resulting in a stock surge in extended trading. The company's revenue increased by 420% compared to the previous year, reaching $981.6 million, driven by strong customer demand for Nvidia GPUs. Despite the revenue growth, CoreWeave reported a widened net loss due to stock-based compensation costs associated with the IPO.

          <p>The Trump administration is granting expedited refugee status to a subset of white South Africans, known as Afrikaners, citing unsubstantiated claims of genocide and anti-white discrimination. This decision has drawn criticism due to the lack of evidence supporting these claims and the fact that white South Africans remain a privileged class, while other groups facing war and famine are being denied refugee status. Critics argue that this policy reflects a racial bias and undermines efforts to address the real challenges faced by South Africa's poor. A history professor who grew up under apartheid describes the decision as a 'kick in the gut', noting the historical oppression of Black South Africans.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Michigan man, Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, has been arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting at a U.S. military base on behalf of ISIS.

The planned attack was thwarted on the scheduled day when Said was arrested near the base, and he now faces charges of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, potentially leading to a 20-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>Consumer Reports, The Guardian, and FERN conducted an investigation revealing that Kroger stores frequently overcharge customers for items marked as being on sale. Expired discount tags were found on numerous products, leading to an average overcharge of $1.70 per item. While Kroger disputes the findings, the investigation highlights a persistent issue of pricing inaccuracies, with multiple class-action lawsuits alleging similar errors. Analysts suggest that these mistakes, whether intentional or not, damage Kroger's reputation at a time when consumers are focused on maximizing value.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water and reconsidering the allowable levels for others. The compliance deadline for PFOA and PFOS is extended to 2031, while limits for other PFAS chemicals are being rescinded and reconsidered. Environmental advocates express skepticism, suggesting the move is aimed at providing cost relief to water systems rather than strengthening protections.

          <p>House Republicans have voted to include a federal school voucher program, worth $20 billion over four years, in a broader reconciliation bill. The program would use federal tax credits to incentivize private citizens to donate to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs), which would then distribute scholarships for private school expenses. Critics argue that this would weaken public education and redirect funding to private institutions with less accountability, while advocates claim it would expand educational opportunities for students, particularly those from lower-income families.</p>
