          <h2>NATO Summit Focuses on Defense Spending and Russia Deterrence Amidst Ukraine Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to center on increasing defense spending among member nations to deter potential Russian aggression, a key demand of the US administration. Secretary-General Mark Rutte has been instrumental in gaining support for this initiative, particularly from Germany. While the summit aims to give the US a win and rebalance the alliance, some European countries express reservations about shifting priorities from social justice to military strength. Despite Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's invitation, Ukraine's NATO aspirations are unlikely to be a major focus, with the US seemingly downplaying the issue, while discussions about Russia as a threat are expected, but without new aggressive language due to ongoing US efforts to facilitate negotiations. Optimism surrounding the summit hinges on NATO's ability to demonstrate its strength and unity to Russia. </p>

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency has reported over 180 earthquakes near the Tokara island chain in southwestern Japan over the past weekend, urging residents to remain vigilant. Akuseki Island, part of the island chain in Kagoshima Prefecture, experienced two quakes measuring 4 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale on Sunday, and another early Monday. Seismic activity near the island chain has been frequently observed since Saturday, prompting increased monitoring and warnings to the local population.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged China to persuade Iran not to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global shipping route for oil. This request follows reports that the Iranian parliament approved a plan to close the Strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. China, being the largest buyer of Iranian oil, has a significant stake in maintaining the Strait's accessibility, as any disruption could cause global oil prices to surge. Rubio emphasized that closing the Strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran and would negatively impact many countries' economies, while energy analysts believe Iran has too much to lose by closing the Strait, including the risk of alienating its key market, China. </p>

          <p>News outlets worldwide are covering the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with varying perspectives on the implications. The Financial Times highlights the US administration's stance that it is targeting Iran's nuclear program, not the country itself, while the Metro features imagery of the attack and Iran's warning of "everlasting consequences." The Sun uses a provocative headline referencing the Falklands War, and the Guardian calls the attack a major intervention with potential for a drawn-out conflict. While the Daily Telegraph notes President Trump's shift to becoming a "wartime leader," The Times focuses on the strike's impact on the Fordo nuclear facility and Iran's threat to block the Strait of Hormuz, as the Daily Mail and Daily Express emphasize potential terror backlashes in the UK and among US allies. </p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national and wife of a Marine Corps veteran, was detained by ICE while breastfeeding her 3-month-old daughter, causing distress for her husband and children. Clouatre had been seeking a green card to legally live and work in the US, but ICE issued a deportation order based on her mother's failure to appear at an immigration hearing years prior. Despite her attempts to reopen the case, she was detained during a green card application appointment, leaving her husband to care for their children, including a newborn who relies on breastfeeding. Immigration law experts note a shift in discretion afforded to military families, with increased referrals for deportation, and the Marine Corps has been cautioned against promoting enlistment as a guaranteed path to immigration benefits for family members. </p>

          <p>New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate secures a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate receives a majority, ensuring that the winner has broad support, though the complexity of the system may lead to slower results and potential questions about transparency. Preliminary results based on first choices are expected shortly after polls close, but the ranked choice tabulations will not begin until July 1, with official certification on July 15. </p>

          <p>Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who gained international attention in 2015 for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses, is still challenging the Supreme Court's ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.

While the Kentucky Legislature later enacted a law removing county clerks' names from marriage licenses, Davis's lawyers are attempting to bring her case before the Supreme Court again. Davis has been ordered to pay $360,000 in damages and attorney fees to a couple she denied a license to, but her attorney aims to affirm her constitutional rights and overturn Obergefell. </p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, the father of three US Marines, was violently detained by masked federal agents in Orange County, California, sparking outrage after video of the incident went viral. According to his son, Marine veteran Alejandro Barranco, Narciso was working as a landscaper when he was approached by the agents, who pinned him down, pepper sprayed him, and dislocated his shoulder. Despite his injuries, Narciso was reportedly denied medical treatment, food, and water for over 24 hours while in detention, with the incident prompting a GoFundMe campaign for legal representation. Alejandro expressed his disappointment with the use of force against his father, while acknowledging the complex feelings of his fellow Marines who are deployed in Los Angeles amid recent immigration raids. </p>

Patrick Agyemang scored the winning goal in the 75th minute after Malik Tillman's early opener was canceled out by a Haitian goal following a mistake by US goalkeeper Matt Freese. The US, using a largely second-string team, had already secured a spot in the quarter-finals, where they will face either Mexico or Costa Rica. This tournament serves as the last competitive test for the Americans before the World Cup, which they will co-host with Mexico and Canada. </p>

          <p>Following US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the State Department has issued a worldwide security alert, warning of potential demonstrations and cyberattacks against American interests. While Israel praised the US action, the UN called for a halt to fighting and a return to negotiations on the Iran nuclear program. Professor Houman Sadri from the University of Central Florida believes that Iran will likely respond in a calculated manner, and the impact on gas prices will depend on the stock market's reaction. Despite fears of a global conflict, Professor Sadri believes that a full-scale World War III is unlikely, as he believes that any potential conflict will remain a regional one between Israel and Iran. </p>

          <p>Oil prices have surged following US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating tensions in the Middle East and raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. Experts warn of possible triple-digit prices as investors monitor Iran's response, with threats to block the Strait of Hormuz adding to market jitters. The Strait, a critical artery for global oil trade, sees about 20 million barrels of oil pass through it daily, and analysts suggest that Western forces would likely intervene if Iran attempts to close it. The potential for unprecedented supply disruptions could lead to a severe oil price shock, reminiscent of the 2022 crisis following the Ukraine war. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump deemed the operation a "spectacular military success," claiming that Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated."

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Despite the ruling, Abrego Garcia may remain in custody due to a potential transfer to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison, despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, and his defense argues that the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case. The prosecution alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status from Texas across the US between 2016 and 2025, and another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release. </p>
