          <p>China's economy showed significant signs of slowing in July, as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output failed to meet forecasts. Retail sales grew by only 3.7%, missing the expected 4.6%, while industrial production also underperformed. This slowdown reflects persistent weak domestic demand and the fading effects of earlier government stimulus, raising concerns about whether Beijing can meet its annual 5% growth target without new policy support. The data points to ongoing challenges, including high youth unemployment and unresolved trade disputes with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The Queensland Court of Appeal decreased the required time served from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence, making him eligible for release about 17 months earlier. The court cited the attacker's early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and potential for rehabilitation as reasons for the change, though it upheld the overall length of the sentence as appropriate for the "particularly heinous offence."</p>

          <p>A man was struck and killed by a vehicle on a freeway in Monrovia, California, while attempting to flee an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a local Home Depot. The incident occurred during one of several recent enforcement operations targeting day laborers in Southern California, during which authorities reportedly detained ten other individuals. The man's death has intensified criticism from community advocates and local politicians, who argue that such raids create fear and put lives at risk without enhancing public safety.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling flights in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could ground the airline's entire fleet by the weekend.

The airline warns that a full shutdown will affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily and has started canceling long-haul international flights to manage a gradual suspension of operations.</p>

Newsom is calling for a special election to allow California's legislature to create a new map that could favor Democrats, a move he described as meeting "fire with fire" to protect democracy. This action would only proceed if Texas or another state advances a mid-cycle partisan gerrymander, setting up a potential nationwide political "arms race" over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw embracing her single life, an ending that some critics are calling more authentic to the character than the original "Sex and the City" conclusion.

          <p>Four years after famously transitioning to a fully plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm announced that the restaurant will now serve select dishes with fish and meat, citing a desire to be more inclusive and acknowledging a decline in private event bookings and wine sales. The reversal has sparked a debate about the sustainability of high-end vegan dining and highlights the challenge of changing consumer preferences, even at the highest levels of the culinary world.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting with Texas Democratic lawmakers who have left the state, praising their "courage" in blocking a Republican plan to pass gerrymandered congressional maps. Obama emphasized that their actions were a critical part of a larger fight to protect democracy from partisan manipulation and have already inspired counter-efforts in states like California. The meeting, also attended by former Attorney General Eric Holder, served to bolster the Texas Democrats' resolve as they continue their standoff from outside the state.</p>

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, analysis suggests they arrive with distinct objectives for the talks on the Ukraine war. Putin seeks international recognition and a validation of his territorial claims, using the meeting to show that Western efforts to isolate him have failed. Trump, driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker, aims for a breakthrough deal, though his vacillating statements have created uncertainty about his specific strategy. The meeting's outcome will depend on whether these contrasting priorities can find any common ground.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20%, with almost 100 new facilities planned, largely to support the growth of artificial intelligence. While the government views this expansion as critical national infrastructure, concerns are mounting over the immense energy and water these centres will consume. Experts and residents worry about the potential strain on national grids and water supplies, which could lead to higher utility bills for consumers and significant environmental impact, sparking local opposition to some projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AI-driven technology called DeepEditor is changing how foreign language films are dubbed, potentially breaking down barriers for international cinema in markets like the United States. The tool, developed by the company Flawless, digitally alters an actor's lip movements to perfectly match the dubbed audio, creating a more seamless and authentic viewing experience. Independent studio XYZ Films successfully used the technology for a Swedish sci-fi movie's U.S. theatrical release, suggesting that AI could help a wider range of global films reach new audiences.</p>
