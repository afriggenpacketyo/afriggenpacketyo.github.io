          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 16:31:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines surpassed second-quarter earnings estimates, prompting an updated financial forecast for 2025. CEO Scott Kirby noted that a less uncertain global environment is bolstering confidence in a strong end-of-year performance, following a period of weaker domestic travel demand. While revenue of $15.24 billion slightly missed expectations, the airline's premium cabin sales showed robust growth. The new forecast projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share, aligning with analyst predictions and reflecting cautious optimism despite earlier economic concerns.

          <p>Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell is suing a Florida county, alleging the sheriff's department has failed to remove trespassers from his private beach. Littrell stated that people are invading his family's privacy, running onto his property, and specifically targeting him due to his fame. His attorney argues that this is a matter of property rights, with individuals deliberately crossing public beaches to cause issues for Littrell and his neighbors. The lawsuit seeks to compel the sheriff's department to enforce trespassing laws on his land.</p>

          <p>Shares of GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer with Donald Trump Jr. as a shareholder, declined by over 20% during its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The public debut followed a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and Trump Jr. celebrated the event by ringing the opening bell. He framed the public offering as a "vindication" against "woke nonsense." The company, now trading under the ticker PEW, raised $179 million from the merger, marking another instance of Trump family allies backing conservative-aligned businesses.

The discussions have created uncertainty, as removing a Fed chair is a major break with precedent and could undermine the central bank's independence.

For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 were standout performances, but a sloppy fielding effort and a failure to accelerate their scoring earlier proved costly.

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has suspended four Members of Parliament after they rebelled against the party's position on a government welfare bill. The MPs, including Rachael Maskell, voted against proposed cuts, undermining the authority of party leader Keir Starmer. Maskell stated she was elected to represent her constituents' interests and does not see herself as a rebel. The other suspended MPs also defended their votes, emphasizing their commitment to protecting vulnerable people from austerity measures while affirming their loyalty to the Labour movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent uptick in the Consumer Price Index suggests that inflationary pressures are persisting, which could have a significant impact on consumers with credit card debt. Because credit card APRs are closely tied to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, continued inflation may compel the Fed to keep interest rates high to cool the economy. This would likely keep variable credit card rates at their current elevated levels, making it more difficult for borrowers to pay down their balances. The article advises consumers to be proactive by negotiating rates, considering balance transfers, or consolidating debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in several years, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has resumed transferring inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The transfers, which involved 20 individuals in May and June, were conducted using federal judicial warrants, a method not prohibited by local and state sanctuary policies. These policies generally restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities for civil enforcement but allow for transfers in criminal cases. This represents a new tactical approach by the Trump administration to enforce immigration law in a region with strong sanctuary protections.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced legislation to regulate donations to presidential libraries. The move follows several large contributions to President Trump's future library, including multi-million dollar payments from Paramount Global and Disney as part of legal settlements. The proposed Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act would cap contributions, ban donations from lobbyists and foreign governments, and require greater transparency. Lawmakers argue the bill is necessary to close loopholes that could allow special interests to use library donations to curry favor with a sitting president.</p>

According to the indictment, the officers created false reports of armed robberies in exchange for payment, generating hundreds of fraudulent applications.

          <p>A long-standing debate over Germany's summer vacation schedule has flared up, with several states demanding a fairer rotation system. Currently, most of Germany's 16 states rotate their six-week holiday start times to manage travel and tourism, but the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg always get the desirable late-summer slots. Critics argue this forces families in other states to travel during peak prices. However, leaders in the south insist their traditional late break is part of their identity and necessary for their school calendar, showing no signs of budging.</p>
