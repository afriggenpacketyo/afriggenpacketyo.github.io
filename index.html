Barclay, who had been on the run for two years after breaching parole for a previous violent attack, assaulted the 57-year-old mother of six while she was walking her dog. The court heard that the attack was unprovoked and savage, with the judge describing Barclay as an "unpredictable, dangerous" man.

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has publicly condemned Fairfax County's Commonwealth Attorney after a man was arrested for allegedly attempting to abduct a toddler, just three days after being released from jail.

Executives noted that the feared negative impact from U.S. trade tariffs had not materialized, and gross merchandise volume on the platform grew significantly. The strong performance suggests robust consumer spending and effective navigation of macroeconomic uncertainties by the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two women from Cwmbran, Wales, were denied an Airbnb booking in Manchester explicitly because they are Welsh, leaving them "gobsmacked." After the host canceled their request with the explanation "Because you're from Wales," the incident sparked a discussion about discrimination. Airbnb has since suspended the host's account while it conducts an investigation, stating that discrimination has no place on its platform. The women, who were booking the trip to attend a concert, expressed their shock and pride in their Welsh identity.</p>

          <p>McDonald's announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by a rebound in its U.S. sales. The fast-food giant's performance was boosted by popular promotions and new menu items, leading to a 2.5% increase in U.S. same-store sales. Despite the positive results, executives expressed caution about the economic health of low-income consumers, who are visiting less frequently. The company plans to focus on affordability to re-engage this crucial customer base while anticipating stronger results in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ten months after Israel remotely detonated thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah, survivors are struggling with life-altering injuries and psychological trauma. The coordinated attack in September 2024 killed 12 people and wounded over 3,000, including fighters, their family members, and other civilians. Interviews with survivors reveal the devastating human toll of the operation, with many left blinded, missing fingers, and facing dozens of surgeries. While Israel views the attack as a major intelligence success, human rights groups have questioned its indiscriminate nature, as the devices exploded in populated areas.</p>

          <p>Disney reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings, largely due to continued growth in its streaming business and robust performance at its theme parks. While overall revenue slightly missed projections, the direct-to-consumer streaming segment showed significant improvement, and the experiences division saw an 8% revenue increase. The company announced it now expects to combine Disney+ and Hulu into a single app in 2026. Despite these gains, Disney's traditional television business continues to face headwinds from declining viewership and advertising revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation by the Guardian has uncovered a high number of deaths and a significant drug smuggling problem at the Cibola County Correctional Center, a private prison in New Mexico. The article focuses on the case of Jasmine Williams, a 29-year-old mother who died of a drug overdose just two days after being booked into the facility. Since 2018, at least 15 detainees have died at the prison, which is also the subject of an FBI probe into a "drug trafficking epidemic." The findings raise serious questions about safety, oversight, and conditions at the CoreCivic-run facility.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration has recently undermined its own stated goals for U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. The article points to the reversal of an export ban on advanced Nvidia chips to China and deals to build AI data centers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia as major strategic errors. These moves, influenced by tech executives, are seen as ceding critical leverage and technology to geopolitical rivals and placing vital infrastructure in volatile regions. Critics, including former administration officials, warn these decisions could endanger America's long-term economic and military edge.</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is confronting a challenging economic landscape ahead of the autumn Budget, with new forecasts suggesting a significant budget gap. A report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) points to a potential £40-50 billion shortfall, indicating that substantial tax rises or spending cuts may be necessary. The analysis suggests the Chancellor may need to create a larger buffer to meet borrowing rules and restore economic certainty. With limited options, potential measures could include changes to VAT, pension allowances, and prolonging the freeze on income tax thresholds. (not investment advice)</p>
