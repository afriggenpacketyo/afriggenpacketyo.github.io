        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent trade agreement between the European Union and the United States carries significant geopolitical weight beyond its economic terms, according to EU officials. The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on most EU imports, also includes commitments for the EU to purchase strategic US commodities like energy and AI chips. Critics in Europe argue the EU negotiated from a weak position, highlighting a continued reliance on the US for security, particularly regarding support for Ukraine. The agreement is also seen as a coordinated effort to counter China's growing economic influence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Far East triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific, impacting Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While initial warnings prompted evacuations and disruptions, the waves were smaller than feared, leading authorities to downgrade warnings to advisories. Officials reported minor flooding and urged continued caution near coastlines due to strong currents. The event drew comparisons to the 2011 Japan tsunami but fortunately resulted in no major damage or widespread casualties.</p>

          <p>A gunman who killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building was attempting to reach the NFL headquarters, according to Mayor Eric Adams. The shooter, identified as Shane Tamura, left a note indicating he believed he suffered from the brain disease CTE and blamed the league for his condition. Tamura, who had a history of mental health incidents, took the wrong elevator and opened fire in the offices of Rudin Management. The incident has renewed debates about gun control and mental health, as it was revealed he legally purchased the firearms despite previous police encounters.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgages in the U.S. has dropped to its lowest level since May, with application volume falling by 3.8% in the last week. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, this decline affects both home purchase and refinancing applications, which fell 6% and 1% respectively. Experts suggest that lingering uncertainty about the economy and the job market, rather than slight fluctuations in interest rates, is the primary factor deterring potential homebuyers from making major financial commitments. The market now awaits signals from the Federal Reserve's upcoming announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents across Hawaii evacuated coastal areas and faced significant traffic jams after a powerful earthquake near Russia triggered tsunami waves in the Pacific. Officials issued urgent warnings, prompting many, including those on wildfire-scarred Maui, to move to higher ground. Although waves several feet high were recorded, the initial tsunami warning was later downgraded to an advisory, with Governor Josh Green noting the state had avoided a "wave of consequence." The event highlighted community preparedness and lingering anxieties from past disasters, as residents took the threat seriously despite the limited damage.</p>

The author, Rebecca Solnit, highlights that solar and wind power have become significantly cheaper and more efficient than fossil fuels, challenging the old narrative that climate action requires austerity. The transition to renewables is not just about cleaner energy but also about creating a more efficient and politically stable system, reducing reliance on the volatile geopolitics of fossil fuels.

These programs, created during the civil rights era, have historically expanded healthcare access for millions of seniors, low-income families, and disabled individuals. The cuts are projected to cause nearly 12 million people to lose Medicaid coverage, representing a sharp departure from decades of policy and enacting long-held conservative goals to reduce the scope of these public health insurance systems.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet has approved a draft budget for 2026 that signals a significant shift from its long-held fiscal conservatism. The budget outlines €520.5 billion in spending, including major investments in infrastructure and defense, funded in part by €174 billion in new borrowing. This move aims to modernize the country and stimulate its economy, which recently contracted by 0.1%. In other news, Berlin has canceled its iconic New Year's Eve party at the Brandenburg Gate due to budget cuts, and the government is reviewing the use of controversial Palantir security software.</p>

          <p>Shares in Adidas dropped by as much as 9% after the sportswear giant announced that U.S. tariffs would force it to raise prices on its products in the American market. The company warned that the added costs from import levies could amount to €200 million in the second half of the year. CEO Bjørn Gulden confirmed that price increases would be limited to the U.S. and that the company would move cautiously. The news came as Adidas reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales, though it maintained its full-year guidance despite the elevated uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Global momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state is building, with the United Kingdom announcing it will do so in September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the war in Gaza. This follows a similar announcement from France. In a joint statement, 15 countries, including several that have not yet recognized Palestine, affirmed their commitment to a two-state solution. The diplomatic pressure coincides with ongoing tensions, as Israeli forces reportedly disrupted the funeral of a prominent Palestinian activist who was killed by a settler in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>Gary Neville, a former Manchester United footballer and prominent business owner, has criticized UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves over the recent national insurance hike. Neville, who supported the Labour party in the last election, argued that the tax increase has hampered employment and placed an unnecessary burden on businesses during a tough economic period. He suggested the measure "could have been held back" to provide more stability. His comments add to a growing chorus of criticism from business leaders and economists regarding the government's recent fiscal policies.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores How a 1930s Black Fascist's Arguments Parallel Modern Anti-Liberal Critiques</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay examines the work of Lawrence Dennis, a Black intellectual who passed for white and advocated for fascism in America during the 1930s. The author argues that Dennis's critiques of liberalism, which he saw as doomed by the Great Depression, contain two "anti-liberal traps" that are echoed by right-wing critics today. These traps include misinterpreting a temporary crisis as a fundamental failure of liberalism and idealizing authoritarian alternatives. By showing how Dennis's predictions were profoundly wrong, the article offers a cautionary lesson against accepting similar arguments from contemporary illiberal thinkers.</p>

          <p>The women's dating safety app Tea has suspended its direct messaging feature following a significant cybersecurity breach that exposed thousands of user images, posts, and private conversations. The app, which allows its 1.6 million users to share information about men they date, confirmed that some direct messages containing sensitive details were accessed. A report from 404 Media claims the exposed data includes conversations about infidelity and abortions. Tea is now working to identify affected users and will offer free identity protection services while it strengthens its security.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's rightward political shift and alliance with Donald Trump have not only soured his image among U.S. liberals but also appear to be dampening their interest in electric vehicles altogether, a new study finds. Research published in Nature shows that as liberals' perception of Tesla plummeted, their intent to purchase any EV also eroded, slipping into negative territory by March. The study suggests Musk became so synonymous with EVs that his actions dragged down the entire vehicle class for this demographic, without a corresponding increase in interest from conservatives.</p>

          <p>Expansion team San Diego FC is making a historic debut in Major League Soccer with an exceptionally risky and possession-heavy style of play. The team, part of the Right to Dream ownership network, emphasizes playing out from the back under pressure, a tactic reflected in their record-low rate of long passes from the goalkeeper. This strategy, which relies on young, lower-paid defenders to draw in opponents before launching quick attacks, has proven successful so far. Despite the risks, San Diego currently sits atop the Western Conference and is on pace to become the best expansion side in league history.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece uses the recent data breach of the women-only dating safety app 'Tea' to illustrate the broader issue of data insecurity in the digital age. The author, Arwa Mahdawi, notes that the hack, which exposed sensitive images and private messages, was reportedly instigated by misogynistic trolls. She argues that while apps like Tea exist because dating platforms fail to protect women, this incident reveals that even supposed safe spaces are vulnerable. The article concludes that data breaches have become a routine part of modern life, reinforcing the harsh reality of digital privacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a long-standing policy limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department is indirectly enabling deportations by sharing fingerprint data with agencies like ICE. An investigation by the LA Times highlights cases where undocumented individuals, arrested for minor offenses and later released without charges, were flagged in federal databases. This routine data sharing allows ICE to identify and target individuals for deportation, raising concerns among civil rights advocates and city officials that the spirit of the LAPD's sanctuary-like policies is being undermined, eroding trust within immigrant communities.</p>
