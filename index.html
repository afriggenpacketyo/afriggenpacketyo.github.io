          <p>Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez, have been charged with accepting bribes to allow illegal immigrants to enter the country through the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Prosecutors allege that the officers let dozens of vehicles pass through without proper checks in exchange for thousands of dollars, with evidence including phone messages with human smugglers and unexplained cash deposits. Acting U.S. Attorney Andrew Haden emphasized the severity of the officers' alleged actions, highlighting the risk to national security, while Rodriguez's lawyer maintains his client's innocence. In the past two years, five CBP officers in the San Diego area have faced similar corruption charges.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's implementation of 25% tariffs on imported cars, automakers are responding with various strategies, including production halts, shipment pauses, and adjusted pricing. Stellantis announced temporary layoffs at Midwest factories due to production adjustments in Mexico and Canada, while Jaguar Land Rover paused shipments to the U.S. to assess long-term plans. Some consumers rushed to dealerships to avoid anticipated price hikes, while companies like Hyundai and Toyota reassured customers of stable prices in the short term. Market analysts predict potential price increases of 10-15% for affected cars and 5% for others, with Ford and Nissan implementing price cuts to attract buyers.</p>

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders, citing the African nation's failure to accept the return of its citizens. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused the transitional government in Juba of "taking advantage of the United States" and said the action was necessary to ensure countries accept their citizens' return. The decision comes amid growing tensions in South Sudan, with concerns about a potential return to civil war and follows the Trump administration's efforts to increase deportations.

          <p>UK newspaper headlines are dominated by two major stories: the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs and the arrest of Labour MP Dan Norris. The Observer reports that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is planning an "economic reset" in response to the tariffs. The Mail leads with the arrest of MP Norris on suspicion of rape and other offenses. The Sunday Times reports on the discovery of Russian sensors suspected of gathering intelligence on nuclear submarines in British waters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a judge's order to facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Government attorneys argue that the judge did not have the authority to compel the executive branch to engage with a foreign power. The Justice Department has placed the attorney who argued the case on leave, stating that he failed to zealously advocate for the government's interests. The man's attorney argues that the government has taken no actual steps to bring his client back, despite admitting its errors.</p>

          <p>Frito-Lay issued a recall of some bags of Tostito's tortilla chips, saying the snack foods may have been contaminated with undeclared products. The recall applies to 13-ounce bags of the company's Tostitos Cantina Traditional Yellow Corn Tortilla Chips. The bags could include nacho cheese tortilla chips and therefore may contain undeclared milk allergens, the company said in a news release distributed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The product is safe to consume for people who do not have a dairy allergy or milk sensitivity, Frito-Lay said in a statement.</p>

          <p>Joe Joyce is facing serious questions about his boxing future following defeat by Filip Hrgovic at Manchester's Co-op Live Arena. Croatian Hrgovic, 32, won by unanimous decision after an absorbing 10-round heavyweight bout against the 39-year-old Joyce. Britain's Joyce, who looked sharp at times but allowed Hrgovic to take charge, has now lost four of his last five fights. Asked if he felt there was still more he could offer boxing, Joyce told DAZN: "Yeah. Are you not entertained?"</p>

          <p>Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has unveiled a novel method to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The new approach, developed in collaboration with Tsinghua University, combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The company is expected to release DeepSeek-R2, the successor to its R1 reasoning model, soon. The company’s next move is highly anticipated after the global attention garnered by the firm’s V3 foundation model and R1 reasoning model.</p>

          <p>Israel's army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes over the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on 23 March. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas - but has so far provided no evidence. It admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. Israel has admitted its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved. The Red Crescent and many other international organisations are calling for an independent investigation.</p>

          <p>Dodgers starting pitcher Roki Sasaki showed glimpses of his future star potential in the Dodgers' 3-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. Sasaki, who had struggled in his first two starts, held the Phillies to just one run over four-plus innings. He worked on his fastball command and attacked over the plate, setting up his splitter to be a putaway weapon. Manager Dave Roberts praised Sasaki's composure and poise, calling the outing a "building block" for the young pitcher.</p>
