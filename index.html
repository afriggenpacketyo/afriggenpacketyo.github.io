          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become Prime Minister appears less far-fetched after Reform UK's recent election gains, challenging the dominance of traditional parties. The article notes that Farage's success stems from tapping into public disillusionment, particularly among those feeling left behind by mainstream politics. While Labour focuses on proving its ability to govern effectively, the Conservatives face a struggle to regain credibility and define their identity. Reform's challenge lies in transitioning from a protest movement to a responsible governing force, with scrutiny intensifying as they assume control in local councils.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that domestication has led to cats and dogs evolving to look more alike, particularly in skull shape, due to human selection. Selective breeding for traits like flat faces, driven by human preferences for infant-like features, has resulted in similar health problems across species. The article highlights concerns about the welfare of animals bred for extreme physical characteristics and the need for stricter regulations. Humans' intervention has overridden millions of years of evolutionary separation, often at the expense of the animals' well-being.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to raise prices and lower the quality of Halloween and Christmas novelties for US consumers. With nearly 90% of festive products imported from China, retailers face increased costs. Solutions include absorbing the additional costs or sourcing products from less affected countries, potentially sacrificing quality. The Halloween & Costume Association warns that prices for costumes and masks could double due to tariffs.</p>
