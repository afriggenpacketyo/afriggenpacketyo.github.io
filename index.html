          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to multiple arrests. President Trump has ordered the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles County after clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators. Protests erupted in Paramount and Compton, with some demonstrators setting a car on fire and throwing objects at law enforcement vehicles. Advocates for immigrants' rights claim that detentions occurred outside Home Depot and Dale's Donuts stores, leading to further unrest and calls for "mass mobilization."</p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were diverted to Rome because the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large to land at Naples Airport.

After landing in Rome, passengers were transported to Naples by bus, a journey of approximately three hours.

          <p>Tens of thousands of people gathered in Madrid to protest against the left-wing government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, accusing it of corruption. The opposition-led rally, dubbed "Mafia or Democracy," drew crowds waving Spanish flags and chanting for Sanchez's resignation. The protest was triggered by a leaked audio recording implicating a member of Sanchez's party in a smear campaign against a police unit investigating graft allegations. Opposition leaders are demanding early elections, while Sanchez dismisses the investigations as a right-wing smear campaign.</p>
