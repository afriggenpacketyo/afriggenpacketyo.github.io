        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, activists organized protests in Los Angeles, leading to the deployment of National Guard troops to protect federal property and personnel. The protests erupted after ICE officers executed search warrants at multiple locations, with demonstrators attempting to block agents and gathering outside a federal building. Clashes between law enforcement and protesters occurred, resulting in arrests and the use of non-lethal munitions. President Trump ordered the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A. County and stated that masks would no longer be allowed at protests, while local officials criticized the federal government's response as inflammatory.</p>

          <p>With three days remaining before the UK's spending review, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has yet to agree to a funding deal with the Treasury, while Housing and Communities Secretary Angela Rayner reached a settlement. Ministers are engaged in talks with Chancellor Rachel Reeves regarding departmental budgets for the next few years. Cooper's reluctance stems from concerns over police funding, particularly in relation to recruiting the 13,000 new police and community support officers promised by the Labour party. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle emphasized the need for police to embrace change and contribute to public service reform.</p>

          <h2>US Treasury Secretary Warns Newsom of Tax Evasion Over Federal Funding Dispute</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of "criminal tax evasion" if he withholds state tax payments to the federal government amid threats of funding cuts by President Trump. Newsom had threatened to cut tax payments after reports that the Trump administration was preparing to cancel federal funding for California, including its university system. Bessent described Newsom's comments as "extremely reckless" and advised him to develop a tax-cutting plan instead. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions between California and the federal government over funding and policy differences.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists recommend walking regularly to improve heart health, with any amount being better than none. The American Heart Association suggests aiming for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity. This breaks down to about 30 minutes a day, five days a week, to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. It is important to adjust the general recommendation depending on individual health conditions and to consult with a healthcare provider before starting a new exercise program.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, even the happiest couples encounter conflict, with common triggers including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone or attitude is a frequent source of conflict, signaling contempt, a predictor of divorce. Arguments about family relations often reflect misalignments and unmet needs, while those about chores often stem from the uneven distribution of labor. Ineffective communication can escalate conflicts, requiring strategies such as the "five-second rule" to pause and regain perspective.</p>

Anaya, who has described Bukele as a "dictator," was arrested at his home in Santa Tecla. Human rights organizations have criticized the move, claiming it is an attempt to silence those who question the government. The arrest follows the detention of another lawyer, Ruth Lopez, who is accused of embezzling state funds.</p>
