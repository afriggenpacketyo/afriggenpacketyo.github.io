          <p>The European Union is preparing retaliatory measures as negotiations for a trade deal with the United States remain uncertain ahead of an August 1st deadline. While a potential base-case scenario involves a 15% U.S. tariff on EU imports, which is lower than previously threatened rates, no agreement has been finalized, with the decision resting with President Trump. In response to the potential tariffs, the EU is readying countermeasures, including a combined list of targeted goods worth €93 billion. Brussels is also considering its "Anti-Coercion Instrument," which could restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market.</p>

          <p>A 2022 sentencing memorandum from the Department of Justice described Ghislaine Maxwell as engaging in a "significant pattern of dishonest conduct" and being a vital participant in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation. This assessment resurfaces as the DOJ plans to interview Maxwell to learn more about Epstein's network. The memo, from her 2021 conviction, highlighted her role in enabling and participating in the abuse of multiple teenage girls, casting doubt on her credibility. Maxwell, who is appealing her 20-year sentence, has vowed to testify truthfully in the upcoming meeting with the Deputy Attorney General.</p>

          <h2>EU Demands Trade Rebalancing at Summit as China's Xi Jinping Pushes for Deeper Ties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 05:18:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a high-stakes summit in Beijing, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to address the significant trade imbalance between the two economies. While Xi emphasized a "mutually beneficial" relationship amid global geopolitical tensions, von der Leyen stated that the relationship had reached an "inflection point" requiring real solutions. The EU has grown concerned over China's export of excess industrial goods, leading to tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and subsequent anti-dumping probes from Beijing. These trade frictions, along with disputes over market access and China's stance on the Ukraine war, underscore the strained diplomatic ties.</p>

          <p>Relatives of the four murdered University of Idaho students delivered emotional and powerful victim impact statements during Bryan Kohberger's sentencing hearing, directly confronting the admitted killer. The families described their profound grief and anger, with Kaylee Goncalves's father calling him a "pathetic loser" who failed to instill fear and her mother stating "hell will be waiting." The two surviving roommates also shared harrowing accounts of the trauma and guilt they have endured since the November 2022 attack. Following the statements, Kohberger received four consecutive life sentences without parole after pleading guilty to the murders.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are set to sign a landmark free trade agreement aimed at boosting the British economy by an estimated £4.8 billion annually. The deal will reduce tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while making Indian textiles and jewelry cheaper in the UK. The agreement also includes a controversial three-year exemption on national insurance contributions for Indian workers temporarily in the UK, a measure the government insists aligns with existing reciprocal agreements. The deal is expected to create over 2,200 British jobs and includes commitments for closer collaboration on defense and tackling illegal migration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning the 2009 "endangerment finding," a crucial determination that classifies greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. This finding has served as the legal foundation for numerous federal climate regulations, including limits on emissions from power plants and vehicles. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the move as a way to lower costs for Americans and boost domestic energy production. If successful, the reversal would dismantle a cornerstone of U.S. climate policy, making it significantly harder for future administrations to regulate the emissions driving global warming.</p>

The FAA prohibits pilots from flying within 24 hours of taking a sleep aid, and similar cautions apply to commercial drivers, heavy equipment operators, and medical professionals.

In the first half of 2025, authorities approved 43 new drugs, a 59% increase year-over-year, with many targeting serious conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. This acceleration is attributed to reforms in the country's drug review and approval processes, which have encouraged more R&D investment from pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, China set a new record for licensing out its own innovative drugs to overseas markets, with deals valued at over $48 billion, further establishing its growing role in the global biomedicine market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's long-standing animosity towards wind energy, which began with a dispute over turbines near his Scottish golf course, has now translated into major U.S. policy with global consequences. As president, Trump has actively worked to curtail clean energy, culminating in a spending bill that dismantles support for the renewable sector, threatening jobs and climate goals. This policy stance is a stark contrast to the rapid growth of wind and solar power, which have become the dominant new sources of energy in the U.S. Critics argue this approach undermines America's economic future and cedes leadership in green technology to countries like China.</p>

          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" introduces a sweeping overhaul of the federal student loan system, impacting nearly all of the 43 million U.S. borrowers. Key changes include the phasing out of the generous Biden-era SAVE repayment plan, which will be officially shut down by July 2028. The law establishes new, stricter borrowing limits for graduate students and parents and consolidates the numerous repayment options into two new plans: a standard, fixed-payment plan and an income-based Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). These changes will significantly alter how borrowers manage and repay their educational debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major new study suggests that what we eat, rather than a lack of physical activity, is the main cause of rising obesity rates in industrialized nations. Researchers compared the daily calorie expenditure of people from diverse lifestyles, including active hunter-gatherers and sedentary office workers, and found surprisingly similar results when adjusted for body size. This finding challenges the common assumption that modern sedentary lifestyles lead to burning fewer calories. The research indicates that our bodies adjust how they use energy to keep total calorie burn within a narrow range, pointing to the shift towards ultra-processed foods in modern diets as the key culprit behind widespread weight gain.</p>

According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car output dropped by 7.3% and van production plummeted by 45% through June. The decline is partly attributed to uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some firms to slow production, though a new deal has since been reached.

A self-taught artist like Van Gogh, Madu draws inspiration from his upbringing in Lagos and global influences like manga. He identifies as an "artist from Africa" rather than an "African artist," reflecting his global citizenship and cosmopolitan perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation has been launched after it was revealed that some asylum seekers in the UK have been misusing their state-issued payment cards for gambling. A Freedom of Information request found over 6,500 attempted payments at gambling establishments using ASPEN cards, which are provided by the Home Office for food and essentials. These cards, which provide a small weekly allowance, were successfully used at physical sites like casinos and lottery retailers, though online attempts were blocked. The Home Office stated it would take urgent action to correct any misuse and ensure the cards cannot be used for gambling in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is facing an unusual oversupply problem in its waste-to-energy incineration sector, where a massive build-out of facilities has outpaced the generation of municipal solid waste. Despite a 10% increase in waste since 2019, incineration capacity has more than doubled, leaving an estimated 40% of the industry's capacity idle. This glut is attributed to a slowdown in waste supply growth, linked to economic downturns and slowing urbanization. The situation highlights a significant miscalculation in planning, creating a scenario where there is not enough trash to burn, leading to serious underutilization of these expensive plants.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its focus on implementing trans-Himalayan infrastructure projects in Nepal as it competes with India for influence in the strategically important South Asian nation. During a recent visit, a senior Chinese official emphasized boosting projects in agriculture, new energy, and health to promote Nepal's economic development. Landlocked between the two Asian giants, Nepal has traditionally been allied with India but has grown closer to Beijing in recent years due to significant Chinese investment in its infrastructure. This diplomatic push underscores the ongoing rivalry between China and India to secure partnerships in the region.</p>

          <p>Scottish mountain biker Sean Green has accomplished the extraordinary feat of cycling down all 282 of Scotland's Munros, mountains over 3,000 feet. The 36-year-old from Angus is believed to be only the second person to complete the challenge, which took him eight and a half years. The quest involved climbing to each summit while carrying his bike on his back before riding down the often-narrow paths. Green said the challenge combined his passions for mountain biking and the outdoors, though he acknowledged the logistical difficulties and the toll it took on his family life.</p>

          <p>German authorities are addressing several key issues, including a plan to build a dedicated deportation terminal at Munich Airport to streamline the repatriation of migrants with rejected asylum claims or criminal convictions. The facility, planned for 2028, is designed to handle group charter flights and has support from conservative politicians, though it faces criticism from the Green Party. Separately, police in Bavaria conducted raids related to a suspected multi-million euro fraud case involving the black market sale of government-procured COVID-19 medication.

          <p>Court documents from a New Orleans lawsuit reveal that the late Pedro Arrupe, a former worldwide leader of the Jesuit order and a candidate for sainthood, was warned about a priest who had sexually molested minors. Despite warnings in the late 1970s that Donald J. Dickerson was a "poor risk for ordination," he was ultimately ordained and went on to abuse other children. The records show Arrupe was directly informed of the accusations but there is no indication he took steps to prevent the ordination. This revelation casts a dark shadow over Arrupe's legacy and the church's handling of abuse.</p>

          <p>Spain's Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has warned that President Trump's threatened 30% tariffs on EU imports could lead to higher prices and limited access for U.S. consumers. With approximately 95% of olive oil consumed in the U.S. being imported, the company argues that such trade policies will inevitably affect end-users. Deoleo, which makes brands like Bertolli, stated that access to a healthy staple like olive oil should be promoted, not penalized. The potential tariffs have rattled European exporters as the August 1st deadline approaches without a trade deal in place.</p>
