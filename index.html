The ship, a 5,000-ton destroyer-class vessel, had previously undergone tests involving the launch of supersonic and anti-air missiles.

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including a rule to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn these waivers, but Democrats and nonpartisan watchdogs disagree, setting the stage for a legal battle. The outcome could impact 16 other states and D.C. that have adopted California's standards. </p>

Trump himself used eminent domain to build the border wall, filing lawsuits against landowners in Texas to secure space, a practice he also advocated for as a casino developer.
