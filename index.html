          <p>A non-partisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of a major Republican-backed bill estimates it could add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt. The assessment also projects that the legislation, which includes significant tax cuts, would lead to around 12 million Americans losing healthcare coverage due to over $1 trillion in funding reductions. This report has complicated the bill's path in the Senate, where Republicans hold a slim majority and face unified Democratic opposition. The White House is pushing for the bill's passage before a July 4th deadline, framing it as a key legislative priority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is currently engaged in a lengthy debate over a significant spending and tax bill central to President Trump's second-term agenda. After narrowly advancing the bill in a procedural vote, lawmakers have entered a period of extended debate, with Democrats expected to use the full allotted time to criticize the legislation. The bill is being advanced through the budget reconciliation process, which allows the majority party to pass it with a simple majority. Following the debate, a "vote-a-rama" is anticipated, where senators can introduce numerous amendments, potentially lasting through the night. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, has apologized after mistakenly informing thousands of Eurojackpot lottery players they had won millions more than their actual prizes. The error occurred when converting winnings from Euros to Norwegian kroner, resulting in a calculation error that multiplied amounts by 100 instead of dividing. While no incorrect payments were made, the company's CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, expressed deep regret for the disappointment caused to customers who had already made plans with their supposed winnings. Following the incident, Sagstuen announced her resignation from the company.</p>

          <p>According to Senator Mark Warner, the Trump administration explicitly threatened the University of Virginia with significant cuts to jobs, research funding, and student aid if its president, Jim Ryan, did not resign. Ryan, who had supported diversity initiatives opposed by the administration, stepped down on Friday, stating he could not risk the welfare of the university community. Warner described the action as an "outrageous" overreach by the federal government into academic governance and a threat to academic freedom. He warned that this sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting other public universities could face similar political pressure from Washington.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has ordered Palestinians in parts of northern Gaza, including Gaza City and Jabalia, to evacuate south as it prepares to intensify its military operations. The announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has reiterated calls for a ceasefire deal to be made to secure the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas. In the 24 hours preceding the order, at least 86 people were killed by Israeli attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. This included three children killed in a strike on the designated "safe zone" of al-Mawasi, where people had been previously told to evacuate.</p>

          <p>A widespread heatwave is affecting large parts of Europe, prompting health warnings as temperatures soar. Southern Spain is experiencing the most extreme conditions, with a new June record of 46°C (115°F) set in the town of El Granado. Red heat warnings are active in Portugal, Italy, and Croatia, while numerous other countries have issued amber alerts. The intense heat has led to an increase in heatstroke cases in Italy and a death in Barcelona, with authorities implementing emergency measures like climate shelters and free pool access for the elderly.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities likely caused severe and long-term damage, despite some preliminary reports suggesting otherwise. The article provides historical context on battle damage assessment, noting that early reports are often incomplete and can be misleading. It points to the advanced precision munitions used, the ideal operational conditions for the strikes, and the cumulative effect of a 12-day campaign as reasons to believe the impact was substantial. This perspective suggests judging the full effect requires more time and comprehensive intelligence than was available for initial assessments.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a Fox News interview that he has identified a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok. He described the prospective buyers as a group of "very wealthy people" and indicated a formal announcement could come in about two weeks. This development comes as the administration has repeatedly delayed enforcement of a law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform due to national security concerns. The current deadline for a sale is September 17, and any deal would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely.</p>

          <p>A gold mine collapse in a government-controlled area of Sudan has resulted in the deaths of at least 11 miners, with seven others injured. The state-owned mining company announced that the collapse occurred in an artisanal shaft at the Kirsh al-Fil mine over the weekend. The company stated it had previously suspended work in that specific mine and issued warnings about the significant risks it posed. Such collapses are common in Sudan's artisanal mining sector due to poor safety standards, in an industry where gold sales are reportedly funding both sides of the country's ongoing civil war.</p>

          <p>The UK's prime minister and Glastonbury Festival organizers have condemned comments made by the punk duo Bob Vylan during their performance. The group's frontman led the crowd in chants calling for the death of the Israel Defense Forces, which the prime minister labeled "appalling hate speech." The festival issued a statement saying the chants "very much crossed a line" and that there is no place for antisemitism or incitement to violence at the event. The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and confirmed the performance will not be available on its iPlayer service.</p>
