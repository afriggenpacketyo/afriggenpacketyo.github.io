        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a week of aerial attacks, Israel and Iran have reportedly agreed to a ceasefire, according to President Trump. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before a complete end to the conflict. This development follows Iran's missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which was in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran. While a full battle damage assessment is pending, Trump stated that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran," marking a potential turning point in the escalating tensions.</p>

McDonnell stated the department would conduct a ‚Äúcomprehensive evaluation of each use-of-force incident‚Äù and would take action against any officer ‚Äúwho has fallen short‚Äù of the department‚Äôs standards. Critics allege that officers used excessive force on non-threatening individuals, leading to potential civil litigation and raising questions about the LAPD's crowd control methods.</p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. These MPs have expressed concerns about plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save ¬£5 billion a year by 2030. The welfare reform bill, called the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment. The reasoned amendment cites concerns about pushing people into poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments.</p>

          <p>Florida is planning to build a migrant detention center in the Everglades, a proposal criticized by lawmakers due to environmental concerns. The facility, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' is intended to temporarily hold migrants, with Secretary Kristi Noem stating it will be funded largely by FEMA's shelter and services program. Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier said the location, a virtually abandoned airport, would act as a natural deterrent for escapees due to the presence of alligators and pythons. The mayor of Miami-Dade County, Daniela Levine Cava, criticized the plan, saying the impacts to the Everglades ecosystem could be devastating.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it will rescind the 2001 ‚ÄúRoadless Rule,‚Äù a policy that protects 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting.

Environmental groups denounced the decision, stating that it threatens wildlife habitats, drinking water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents also dispute the claim that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk, suggesting it is a giveaway to timber companies.</p>

This development comes after Iran retaliated for Saturday's US strike, with missiles directed at a US base in Qatar being intercepted with no casualties or damage.</p>

Myanmar's rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018, reaching a peak in 2023, and are particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents. This reliance has strengthened China's dominant position, giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain. The rare earths extracted by IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of "rare earth oxides" for further processing and refining.</p>

          <p>The winning design for the national memorial for Queen Elizabeth II will also feature her husband Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. Lord Norman Foster's design team won the competition, with their concept including a statue of the late Queen to be built in St James's Park in central London. The design features a translucent bridge inspired by the shape of the late Queen's wedding tiara. The memorial will also include gardens and a Prince Philip Gate, with a main monument to the late Queen to be built beside the Mall.</p>

          <p>Many Los Angeles workers, particularly street vendors, are living in fear due to ongoing immigration raids, with some facing deportation. These raids are causing economic hardship, forcing vendors who are undocumented to choose between safety and providing for their families. Organizations are stepping in to assist vendors, but many are still afraid to leave their homes. Some families are sending their U.S.-born children to pay the utility bills, which comes with its own risks, as nearly all of the 500 vendors that one advocacy group works with are undocumented or are in the process of seeking citizenship.</p>

          <p>The body of the last person missing after a boat capsized in Lake Tahoe over the weekend was recovered, raising the death toll to eight. The Coast Guard said the boat capsized due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park. Officials initially reported six adults dead, two rescued, and two missing, with the search covering over 390 square miles. Sudden changes in weather conditions, including high winds and snow, are believed to have contributed to the incident.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the federal government will fund Florida's effort to set up immigration detention centers, including a proposed site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz."

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said the federal government had "approved" the state's plan to build "Alligator Alcatraz" and other facilities that could collectively house as many as 5,000 detainees. The announcement illustrates a broader effort by Republican-led states to help the Trump administration carry out its mass deportation campaign.</p>

The state's Attorney General James Uthmeier asked the justices to put on hold a federal judge's decision preventing law enforcement officers from enforcing the law. The judge ruled that the measure is likely unconstitutional.

It is also alleged 3M knew the ear plugs were defective, referring to evidence which came out of litigation in the US in which an internal memo acknowledged the ear plugs had problems. A partner at KP Law said hundreds of veterans had joined the UK claim and thousands more had damaged hearing because of ear plugs that "don't work".</p>
