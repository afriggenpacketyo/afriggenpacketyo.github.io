          <p>Swiss food conglomerate Nestle has terminated its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, after an investigation revealed he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The dismissal, effective immediately, followed a report made through the company's internal whistleblowing channel, which prompted an inquiry led by Nestle's chair. The company emphasized that the decision was necessary to uphold its strong values and governance, assuring that its corporate strategy remains unchanged. This action mirrors similar executive departures at other major corporations like BP and McDonald's over conduct-related issues.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has completed a significant deadline-day signing, bringing in French striker Randal Kolo Muani from Paris St-Germain on a season-long loan. The 26-year-old forward, who has been a target for several Premier League clubs, adds a new dimension to Spurs' attack as they prepare for a return to the Champions League. Kolo Muani is known for his versatility, technical skill, and goal-scoring record at previous clubs like Eintracht Frankfurt and Juventus. His arrival provides valuable depth and a different stylistic option to complement Tottenham's existing forwards.</p>

The Pershing County Sheriff's Office has appealed to the public for help in identifying the victim, described as a white male between 35 and 40 years old. The incident occurred as the festival's main effigy was being burned, and a section of the event site was cordoned off for the investigation. Organizers are cooperating with law enforcement and have urged attendees to remain vigilant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's attempt to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi on the final day of the transfer window has collapsed despite the clubs agreeing on a fee of at least £35 million. The deal fell through because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement for the 25-year-old captain before the deadline. Guehi had been a key defensive target for Liverpool, which was looking to strengthen its backline after some early-season vulnerabilities. The failure to complete the signing marks a significant setback for Liverpool's transfer plans on a busy deadline day.</p>

          <p>The Sultanate of Oman has launched a new "Golden Residency" program, becoming the latest Gulf state to offer long-term visas in exchange for significant foreign investment. To qualify, individuals must invest at least $520,000 in Omani property, bonds, or businesses that create local employment. This initiative is part of a broader trend where countries compete to attract wealthy individuals seeking financial security and greater mobility. Proponents suggest such programs offer an "insurance policy against uncertainty" and signal the region's growing integration into the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new film 'The Smashing Machine,' directed by Benny Safdie, stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. Based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, the movie explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. Johnson's performance is noted as a physical fit for the role, supported by Emily Blunt as his girlfriend, Dawn. While the film effectively portrays Kerr's moments of vulnerability, the review suggests it doesn't fully explore the emotional depth of his relationships.</p>

The criticism follows the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other high-level departures, which the former directors describe as part of a dangerous agenda to dismantle the U.S. vaccine system. They are calling on Congress to exercise its oversight authority to address what they see as a system in "major jeopardy."</p>

          <p>Following recent leadership turmoil at the CDC, President Donald Trump has called on pharmaceutical companies to release data to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. In a social media post, Trump referenced the ongoing debate surrounding vaccine efficacy and the recent upheaval at the CDC under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging drugmakers to be more transparent to "clear up this MESS." His comments come after the FDA limited the approval of new COVID vaccines to high-risk individuals and several top CDC officials were fired or resigned, amplifying the political conflict over U.S. public health policy.</p>

The victim's mother, Linda Westcarr, criticized the sentence for lacking a punitive element and called for an urgent review.

          <p>An analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data reveals a significant decline in the number of immigrant workers in the United States, with a drop of 1.2 million between January and July. This reduction, which includes both legal and undocumented workers, is attributed to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, increased deportations, and a slowdown in border crossings. Economists note that this trend could impact sectors heavily reliant on foreign labor, such as agriculture, construction, and services. The decline may also complicate the Federal Reserve's understanding of the labor market by potentially masking underlying weaknesses.</p>

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the move aims to align the rules for refugees with those for other migrants, who must meet income and accommodation requirements. The government argues the old rules are outdated and have led to increased pressure on local councils to prevent homelessness among newly arrived families.

The article also refutes the related claim that the Trumps met at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell, citing multiple sources that state they were introduced by former modeling agent Paolo Zampolli.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets started the month on a positive note, with the defense sector showing significant gains. The rally was largely driven by the announcement of a £10 billion warship export deal between the United Kingdom and Norway, the UK's largest ever by value. Shares of BAE Systems, the builder of the warships, rose alongside other defense firms. The health-care sector also contributed to the upward trend, with Novo Nordisk shares climbing after releasing favorable trial data for its weight-loss drug Wegovy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly defended his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over the purchase of a flat in Hove. The controversy centers on allegations that she may have improperly minimized her tax liability by misrepresenting her primary residence to different authorities, though there is no suggestion she broke any laws. Starmer described Rayner as a "great story of British success" and stated he was proud of her, dismissing the criticism as attempts to "talk her down." The Conservative party has called for an investigation into whether Rayner breached the ministerial code.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human activity caused the body sizes of wild and domestic species to evolve in opposite directions starting in the Middle Ages. Researchers from the University of Montpellier discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like deer and foxes became smaller. In contrast, domesticated species such as cattle, sheep, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding for agricultural purposes. The findings illustrate the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

          <p>The passionate fan base for the hit romance series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated its online debates to a level of toxicity, prompting the show's actors and streaming service to intervene. Fans, divided into "teams" supporting one of the two main male love interests, have begun directing hostility and threats towards the actors themselves. In response, Prime Video launched a social media campaign urging viewers to "keep the conversation kind" and remember the distinction between fiction and reality. A psychiatrist weighs in, suggesting this behavior reflects a blurring of lines and a psychological phenomenon known as parasocial relationships.</p>

          <p>In its UK financial filings, iconic American apparel company Levi's has identified "rising anti-Americanism" as a potential risk to its business. The company stated that political blowback from Trump administration policies, such as trade tariffs, could lead British and European consumers to favor local brands over American ones. This is one of the first instances of a major U.S. brand openly citing the political climate as a direct threat to its international sales. The warning was included in its annual accounts, which otherwise reported a healthy increase in UK sales and profits for the previous year.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has launched a trial program eliminating peak-time fares, meaning passengers no longer have to pay higher prices for traveling during traditional rush hours. The move is a response to post-pandemic shifts in travel patterns, with officials noting that there is now sufficient capacity on the network to accommodate more passengers during these times. This initiative has sparked a debate about whether the rest of the UK could adopt a similar model. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided on whether it would lead to overcrowding on busy routes.</p>
