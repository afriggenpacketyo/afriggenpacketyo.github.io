          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has certified a class-action lawsuit and issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a presidential executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The judge stated the decision was "not a close call," finding that denying U.S. citizenship to children born in the country to non-citizen parents would cause irreparable harm. This legal challenge is one of several across the nation against the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has historically guaranteed citizenship to all persons born in the United States.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares surged after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook, signaling a stronger-than-expected summer travel season. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while booking patterns have shifted, demand has stabilized, leading the airline to project third-quarter revenue and earnings above Wall Street forecasts. The positive outlook is supported by strong sales of premium seats and its partnership with American Express, even as the carrier plans to trim some flights after the peak season.

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for more than 850,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles because of a faulty low-pressure fuel pump that could fail during operation, potentially causing the engine to stall. The issue, which is more likely in warm weather or with low fuel, increases the risk of a crash, though no related injuries have been reported. The recall affects various models from 2021 to 2023, and owners will be notified, with a remedy to be announced later.</p>

However, a federal judge has temporarily frozen the provision, creating a chaotic and rapidly changing situation for both patients and providers. The law, which critics call a "backdoor abortion ban," would primarily impact non-abortion services like birth control and STI screenings, for which the organization is reimbursed by the government program.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would impose a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, one of the highest rates for any U.S. trading partner, citing what he called a "Witch Hunt" against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter, Trump criticized the prosecution of his political ally and also alleged unfair trade practices, despite the U.S. running a trade surplus with Brazil. Brazilian President Lula da Silva responded that his country is a sovereign nation and would react to any tariff hikes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has confirmed 1,288 measles cases so far in 2025, the highest number recorded in 33 years, surpassing the significant outbreak of 2019. The majority of this year's cases are linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, where two children have died, and infections have now been reported in 38 states. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the highly contagious virus, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, to declining vaccination rates in some communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named his transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, as the interim administrator of NASA, who will hold both cabinet-level positions simultaneously.

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the nation faces a "rising, persistent and unpredictable" threat from Iran, urging the government to adopt a more strategic, long-term response. The report highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings on UK soil targeting opponents of the Iranian regime since early 2022. The committee criticized the government for focusing on crisis management rather than comprehensively countering Iran's espionage, cyber attacks, and other hostile activities.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has stated that it is too easy to claim benefits and has proposed a "crackdown on people exploiting the system." Her proposals include barring most foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits and preventing people with less severe mental health conditions, like mild depression, from being signed off work. The plan aims to reform a welfare system that she argues is being exploited, while Labour criticized the Conservatives for failing to fix the system during their 14 years in government.</p>
