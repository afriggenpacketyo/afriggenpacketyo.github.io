          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted precision strikes on three key Iranian nuclear sites: Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, stating the objective was to eliminate Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The strikes involved B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles, and the U.S. communicated to Iran that regime change was not the goal. Iran has pledged retaliation, and Homeland Security is monitoring for potential physical and cyber reprisals domestically, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. U.S. lawmakers have shown mixed reactions, with some Republicans supporting the strikes and Democrats criticizing the president for not seeking congressional authorization. The situation remains tense, with potential for further escalation. </p>

          <p>President Trump, who previously pledged to be a peacemaker and keep the U.S. out of wars, authorized strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, marking a significant departure from his earlier promises. The strikes on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan signal a direct military confrontation with Iran, breaking his campaign vows to avoid Middle East conflicts. This decision contrasts with Trump's suggestion just 48 hours prior that the U.S. would wait two weeks to see if diplomatic resolutions could be reached between Israel and Iran. The shift raises questions about the future of diplomacy and whether this action represents the beginning of a larger conflict, despite Trump's previous focus on preventing Iran from achieving nuclear capabilities. </p>

Experts suggest involving third parties, including users, journalists, and ethical hackers, in AI model evaluations to identify potential harm. Recommendations include adopting standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives to disseminate information, mirroring practices in software security to better understand the risks posed by AI tools. </p>

          <p>In 1989, 17-year-old Jeff Pelley allegedly murdered his father, stepmother, and two stepsisters in Lakeville, Indiana, following an argument over prom, according to prosecutors. Jeff was reportedly grounded for stealing CDs and money, which restricted his prom activities, leading to resentment towards his father. Despite the lack of forensic evidence or a murder weapon, prosecutors charged Pelley with four counts of homicide in 2002, leading to his conviction in 2006. The case is still ongoing, as Pelley's request for post-conviction relief was denied in April 2024, and he is currently appealing that decision. </p>

          <p>By ordering airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Donald Trump has broken with the dovish stance of previous U.S. presidents, who refrained from attacking Iranian territory, even in response to attacks on Americans. This shift could be seen as positive for nonproliferation if it deters other countries from pursuing nuclear weapons. However, the demolition of monitored sites means that any future nuclear facilities will be unmonitored, remaining a secret for years. The long-term consequences depend on Iran's response, which could range from direct military retaliation to asymmetric attacks, testing the limits of U.S. patience and potentially destabilizing the region further. </p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion of a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran was reportedly a smokescreen, as he had already decided to bomb Iranian nuclear sites after a meeting with national security advisers on Wednesday. Sources indicate that the Thursday statement was a feint to keep Iran off guard, while the U.S. government prepared for various scenarios, including evacuating citizens from Israel. The strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities mark a culmination of efforts to contain Iran's nuclear program, potentially increasing the risk of retaliation and economic disruption, and raising questions about the accuracy of intelligence assessments regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. </p>

The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer by detecting microRNA in urine. Trials in Hokkaido, Japan, demonstrated the kit's ability to detect changes in pre-malignant cells, leading to early diagnosis and treatment of tumors that were difficult to find by X-ray. This technology could be particularly valuable in areas with limited medical resources. </p>
