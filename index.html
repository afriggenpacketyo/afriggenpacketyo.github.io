          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its policy interest rate steady at 2.5%, prioritizing financial stability amidst concerns over Seoul's rapidly rising housing prices and household debt. This move comes after a rate cut in May, but recent data showed a significant acceleration in housing costs and a surge in household loans, prompting the central bank to pause and evaluate the impact of recent cooling measures. The decision highlights the challenge of balancing economic growth with the risks posed by the country's unique "jeonse" rental deposit system, which contributes to high levels of household debt.

          <p>Recent back-to-back floods in New Mexico and Texas have resulted in vastly different outcomes, underscoring the importance of community preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where three people died, residents and officials were anticipating floods due to recent wildfire "burn scars" and had plans in place, allowing for a quick return to normalcy. Conversely, a more ferocious and surprising flood in Texas led to at least 119 fatalities, catching state officials off guard. The article explores how prior experience with natural disasters can significantly influence a community's response and resilience.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA. This appointment follows the president's withdrawal of his previous nominee, billionaire Jared Isaacman, citing concerns over Isaacman's Democratic political donations and his professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX holds major NASA contracts. Duffy takes the helm at a critical time for the space agency, as it continues its mission to return astronauts to the moon and eventually land humans on Mars. The move adds Duffy to a list of Trump administration officials serving in dual roles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will implement a 50% tariff on all copper imports, effective August 1, following a national security assessment. President Trump stated that copper is a critical material for numerous defense and technology applications, including semiconductors, military hardware, and data centers. The move is intended to bolster domestic production of the vital metal, as the U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile. The announcement caused an immediate surge in U.S. copper prices, extending a significant one-day gain from the previous session. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese manufacturers who have relocated to Southeast Asian nations to circumvent U.S. tariffs are now facing renewed uncertainty as Washington threatens to target these transshipment hubs. The lack of clear implementation details on these potential new tariffs has left many Chinese business owners in a state of limbo, forcing them to adopt a cautious "wait-and-see" approach. This policy ambiguity from the U.S. disrupts supply chains and complicates investment decisions for companies that had viewed Southeast Asia as a strategic safe haven from the ongoing trade disputes between Washington and Beijing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists and industry experts are warning that the newly announced 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide array of consumer products. Because copper is a crucial component in electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles, the tariff is expected to raise manufacturing costs, which will likely be passed on to consumers. While the administration's stated goal is to reshore the copper industry for national security, analysts note that ramping up domestic production would take years. The move has already caused copper prices to surge to record highs. (not investment advice)</p>

State Senator Scott Wiener has proposed exempting some clean energy projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to meet tight new federal deadlines.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 jobs at NASA, targeting mostly senior-level employees with specialized and management skills. According to internal documents, the move is part of a broader government-wide effort to reduce the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements. The proposed cuts would deprive the agency of decades of institutional knowledge, with over 1,800 of the targeted positions being in core mission areas like science and human space flight. The plan has caused turmoil within the space industry and drawn condemnation from former NASA science chiefs.</p>

          <p>The European Union has indicated it could reach an outline for a trade deal with the United States within days, aiming to de-escalate tensions as the Trump administration continues to announce new tariffs. The EU's trade chief expressed hope for a satisfactory conclusion soon, even as President Trump targeted more countries with proposed levies, including a steep 50% tariff on Brazil. The flurry of U.S. tariff threats has unsettled the global economy, prompting key trading partners like the EU to seek swift negotiations to avoid being hit with damaging duties and to stabilize their economic relationship with Washington.</p>

          <p>As catastrophic floodwaters rose in Kerr County, Texas, the activation of the CodeRED emergency alert system was reportedly delayed as dispatchers waited for supervisory approval. Radio traffic from the event reveals a firefighter requesting an alert be sent, only to be told it needed to be approved. A former county official who helped install the system noted that this delay occurred while the situation was clearly becoming an emergency. While the National Weather Service did issue 22 warnings, many residents say they never received any local alerts, raising critical questions about the effectiveness of the local emergency response.</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest number of infections recorded in 33 years and surpassing the total from the significant 2019 outbreak. The majority of this year's cases are linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, which has seen over 750 infections and resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the nearly-eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates in certain communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend the safe and effective MMR vaccine as the best form of protection.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs across the federal government. The decision allows the administration to resume its efforts, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to significantly reduce the size of the federal workforce. In its unsigned opinion, the court stated the government was likely to succeed in its argument that the president's executive order was lawful. The ruling is a major victory for the administration's agenda but a blow to federal employee unions who argued the plan unconstitutionally bypasses Congress.</p>

The strike, involving 9,000 workers including sanitation staff and 911 dispatchers, had led to piles of trash accumulating across the city during a summer heatwave. The new three-year deal includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. Workers returned to their jobs immediately, and the city expects trash cleanup to be completed by the weekend.</p>

          <p>European allies are feeling a sense of "whiplash" due to the Trump administration's rapidly shifting policies regarding military aid to Ukraine. A surprise halt in weapons shipments last week, followed by an abrupt reversal and a pledge for more aid this week, has left many foreign officials confused and struggling to understand Washington's strategy. The lack of clear communication from the Pentagon has compounded the uncertainty. This unpredictability extends to broader security concerns, as allies worry about a potential reduction of U.S. troops in Europe, leaving them in the dark about long-term American commitments.</p>

          <p>The Greek government has announced it will suspend processing asylum applications for at least three months for migrants who arrive on its shores from Libya. The decision follows a recent surge of over 2,000 migrants arriving on the island of Crete, a top tourist destination, leading to pressure from local authorities. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stated the measure is a "necessary temporary reaction" and a message to smugglers, adding that any migrants entering illegally will be detained.
