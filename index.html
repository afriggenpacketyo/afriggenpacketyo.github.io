          <p>The United States is holding firm on its August 1 deadline to implement higher tariffs on the European Union, despite ongoing last-ditch talks to secure a trade deal. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the deadline is fixed but expressed confidence that an agreement could eventually be reached, even after the new rates take effect. The EU is preparing retaliatory measures if a deal isn't struck, with analysts warning that a proposed 15-20% tariff rate would severely impact European exports and could reignite inflation fears in the U.S. This trade dispute highlights the tense economic relationship between the two major global trading partners.

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is used to house asylum seekers, turned violent, leading to six arrests. Over 1,000 demonstrators gathered, with some throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault. Essex Police described the escalation as "mindless thuggery" and implemented a dispersal order to prevent further anti-social behavior. The incident highlights rising local tensions and the challenges authorities face in managing protests related to asylum policies.</p>

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis has issued a warning of an expected net loss of €2.3 billion ($2.68 billion) for the first half of the year. The company, which owns brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Peugeot, attributes the significant loss to several factors, including the initial effects of U.S. tariffs, increased industrial costs, and pre-tax net charges. This announcement underscores the immense challenges facing the new CEO, Antonio Filosa, as the company grapples with falling sales and operational issues. The company's second-quarter vehicle shipments are also estimated to have fallen by 6% year-over-year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to tackle a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that future pensioners could be worse off than today's. The Department for Work and Pensions revealed that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will explore ways to boost private pension savings and build a national consensus on a future strategy. This initiative aims to address the growing gap in private pension wealth without directly altering the state pension's controversial "triple lock" policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese government officials have intervened in the country's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, calling on major carmakers to halt what they term "irrational competition." During a meeting with the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and leading companies like BYD, a senior official emphasized the "extreme urgency" of curbing the ongoing price war. Regulators stated that healthy industry development should be promoted through cost oversight and price monitoring. This move signals Beijing's growing concern that the fierce price-cutting among electric vehicle manufacturers could destabilize the rapidly growing sector.</p>

          <p>A significant signalling failure at London Waterloo station has caused widespread travel chaos, with South Western Railway (SWR) advising passengers not to travel on its network. The issue, which was reported early in the morning, has left 14 platforms at the major London hub out of use, leading to cancellations across all routes. Disruption is expected to continue for most of the day as engineers work to resolve the problem. SWR, which was recently brought into public ownership by the Labour government, has arranged for tickets to be accepted on some other rail and bus services.</p>

The comments followed a U.S.-announced ceasefire between Syria and Israel, which Barrack clarified is a limited agreement addressing only the Sweida conflict.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Democratic party's only opportunity to regain the trust of key voter demographics, particularly young and Black voters, is the 2028 election. The author criticizes establishment figures like Rahm Emanuel for now calling for a focus on economic issues after years of policies that alienated these groups. The piece suggests that voters are tired of insiders and identity politics, instead demanding real solutions for affordability, housing, and healthcare. For many, 2028 will be the first presidential contest without a pre-selected party favorite, offering a chance for authentic candidates to address these core concerns.</p>

While the league has reported annual losses, players and analysts question these figures, pointing to soaring revenue, broadcast rights, and franchise valuations. Public data shows league revenue has nearly doubled since 2019, and the value of teams like the New York Liberty has skyrocketed. Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure they argue is unjustifiably low given the sport's explosive growth and popularity.</p>

The administration claims it froze the funds due to Harvard's alleged failure to address antisemitism on campus, a violation of civil rights law. In court, Harvard's lawyers argue the government violated procedural laws and that there is no rational link between the antisemitism concerns and the vital medical and scientific research being halted.

Brazil supplies about 30% of U.S. coffee imports, and its beans are a staple in many popular blends. Business owners argue the tariffs function as a tax on Americans, as the U.S. does not produce coffee on a comparable scale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venture capitalists often rely on a principle known as the "power law" to guide their investment decisions, focusing on startups with the potential for massive returns. This law posits that a very small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, outweighing all losses and smaller successes combined. According to Peter Specht of Creandum, VCs actively seek these outliers, or "massive winners," that can define a new market category. For founders, this means they must effectively pitch not just their product, but a compelling vision for why their company has "outsized-outcome potential" and can achieve enormous scale.

          <p>The far-right party Sanseito, running on a nationalist "Japanese First" platform, has emerged as a major winner in Japan's recent upper house election, securing 14 seats. Founded in 2020, the party gained prominence by spreading anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and has more recently focused on an anti-immigration and anti-globalist agenda. Its success reflects growing public frustration with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party over issues like the economy, cost of living, and immigration. While Sanseito's gains signal a potential rightward shift in Japanese politics, it still lacks the seats needed to submit its own legislation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since privatization, including the abolition of the current regulator, Ofwat. The report by Sir Jon Cunliffe contains 88 recommendations aimed at addressing widespread criticism over leaks, sewage spills, and underinvestment. Key proposals include introducing minimum capital levels to prevent excessive debt and blocking ownership changes that are not in a company's long-term interest. The reforms acknowledge that massive investment is needed to upgrade aging infrastructure, which will require higher consumer bills to fund the necessary improvements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners in Rotherham, as well as the aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had "unanswered questions for over 40 years." Campaigners, who have long called for an inquiry into allegations of police misconduct and falsified evidence, cautiously welcomed the news.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has stated he is "100%" confident the club followed correct procedures regarding former midfielder Thomas Partey, who was under investigation while playing for the team.

The charges relate to incidents reported to have occurred in 2021 and 2022. Arteta's comments came during a pre-season press conference, where he emphasized that he could not discuss the complex legal matters further as the case proceeds through the courts.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in these products past $50 billion.

These ETFs offer advantages like lower costs, diversified holdings, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The fastest-growing segment targets corporate notes, as investors seek higher yields than those available from government debt, which is seen as a crowded trade. (not investment advice)</p>

The situation is described by the local MP as a failure of a "broken leasehold system," where historical owners and management have allegedly neglected their responsibilities.
