          <p>The United States will resume sending weapons to Ukraine, reversing a decision made just a week prior to halt certain critical arms shipments. President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine needs to be able to defend itself against intense Russian attacks, specifically mentioning the provision of "defensive weapons." This policy change comes after days of deadly Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukrainian cities and appeals from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Pentagon confirmed it is acting on the president's direction to send additional armaments to help ensure Ukraine can secure a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman believes teenage forward Michelle Agyemang can "bring something different" to the national team during its Euro 2025 campaign. The 19-year-old made an immediate impact on her debut, scoring just 41 seconds after coming on as a substitute. Despite England's recent loss to France, Agyemang has provided a spark of energy and strength, impressing teammates and fans with her brief but effective performances. The Arsenal player, who is known for her physical presence on the pitch, is seen as a wildcard who could be crucial as England fights to stay in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent and often controversial cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, has passed away at the age of 94. A key architect of Thatcherism, he was known for his tough stance and for introducing laws to curb the power of trade unions during his time as employment secretary. In 1984, he and his wife were seriously injured in the IRA's bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Conservative Party conference. Colleagues remembered him as a man of great political insight and personal courage who was unafraid to pursue unpopular but principled policies.</p>

          <p>The world's first commercial deep-sea mining operation may soon begin, as The Metals Company (TMC) awaits a US decision on its application to extract precious metals from the ocean floor. The move, fast-tracked by a presidential executive order, bypasses the International Seabed Authority, which has not yet established rules for such activities. Scientists and legal experts warn of potentially severe and irreversible damage to deep-sea ecosystems, which play a critical role in global climate regulation. Critics also point to the controversial history of TMC's CEO and question the company's claims that these minerals are essential for the green energy transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A counterterrorism expert and former FBI special agent has warned that Iranian sleeper cells might be present in the United States, potentially targeting rural areas. This concern follows a Department of Homeland Security bulletin about a heightened risk of terrorism after recent US military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The expert suggests that the administration's border policies could have allowed individuals to enter the country without thorough vetting, creating opportunities for such cells to establish themselves. The article notes that these cells could target less-protected rural venues, drawing parallels to attacks seen in other countries.</p>

          <p>An early analysis of the NBA's free agency period identifies the Atlanta Hawks, Houston Rockets, and Denver Nuggets as initial winners. The Hawks made shrewd moves to build a deeper roster around Trae Young, while the Rockets successfully acquired superstar Kevin Durant to complement their young core. The Nuggets managed to offload a large contract and bring back a key role player, solidifying their contender status. Conversely, the article names the New Orleans Pelicans, Milwaukee Bucks, and the superstar duo of LeBron James and Luka Dončić as losers due to questionable front-office decisions and a lack of urgency in roster-building.</p>

          <p>Recent export controls imposed by Beijing on rare earth elements have triggered a global push to diversify supply chains and reduce dependence on China for these critical minerals. In response, international companies are accelerating exploration and development projects in other countries, such as Brazil and Kazakhstan, to establish alternative sources. Despite these efforts, analysts believe China maintains a strong position due to its long-standing control over the market. The geopolitical maneuvering highlights the strategic importance of rare earths, which are essential for numerous high-tech and defense applications, and the growing competition to secure their supply.</p>

          <p>Several Asian nations, including key U.S. allies, have responded to President Trump's latest tariff threats with a mix of regret and a desire for continued negotiation. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called the announcement "truly regrettable" but stressed that talks would continue, while South Korea vowed to accelerate negotiations to resolve trade uncertainties. Thailand's finance minister expressed shock but remained confident a better deal could be reached. The reactions highlight the widespread economic uncertainty caused by the renewed threats of steep import duties, even as countries hold out hope for diplomatic resolutions before the August deadline.</p>

          <p>Yorkshire Water has declared the first hosepipe ban of the year in the UK, affecting over five million customers starting this Friday. The restriction follows the region's driest and warmest spring on record, which has left reservoir levels at just over 50%, a record low for this time of year. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hosepipe, with potential fines up to £3,000 for violations. The move comes as the Environment Agency declared a drought across the region, highlighting concerns about water supply resilience amid climate change and population growth.</p>

          <p>The first-ever malaria treatment specifically formulated for babies and very young children has been approved for use and is expected to be rolled out in African countries within weeks. Until now, there were no approved malaria drugs for infants weighing less than 4.5kg, forcing doctors to use versions made for older children, which carried a risk of overdose. Developed by Novartis in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the new drug, Coartem Baby, fills a critical treatment gap for the most vulnerable population. Malaria claimed nearly 600,000 lives in 2023, with children under five accounting for about three-quarters of all deaths.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed United Nations investigators that the United States retains legal responsibility for Venezuelan migrants deported from the US to El Salvador's CECOT prison. This admission, revealed in court filings, contradicts public statements from both governments and supports claims by migrant advocates that the men remain under US jurisdiction. The Trump administration had argued it was powerless to act as the migrants were beyond the reach of US courts. This development is a key point in legal challenges against the administration's deal to house migrants in the notorious Salvadoran facility.</p>

However, the booking was non-existent, and the seller became unreachable on the day of the concert.

Senator Ted Cruz described the scene at the camp as heartbreaking, while questions are being raised about the adequacy of warnings ahead of the flood.

          <p>China has issued a stern warning to the Trump administration against reinstating tariffs, stating that dialogue is the only correct path to resolve trade tensions. An official commentary in the People's Daily newspaper reiterated that China would firmly uphold its rights and interests if the U.S. proceeds with additional import curbs after the August 1 deadline. Beijing also threatened to retaliate against any country that strikes a deal with the United States designed to cut China out of its supply chains. The remarks signal a potential re-escalation of the trade war if a lasting agreement is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump indicated the new deadline was firm but suggested he was open to further negotiations if countries proposed alternative arrangements.
