          <p>The Sudan Doctors Network reported that paramilitary forces, identified as the Rapid Support Forces, killed over 100 civilians in Nahud, southern Sudan, including at least 21 children, marking another large-scale atrocity in the country's ongoing civil war. Communication with Nahud has been largely cut off, making independent verification difficult. The Rapid Support Forces claimed they attacked Nahud, a city held by the Sudanese military along a crucial highway to Darfur. The UN human rights chief expressed grave concern, stating that at least 542 civilians have been killed in the region in just three weeks, with the real toll likely higher, highlighting the escalating violence and humanitarian crisis in Sudan.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, an Illinois landlord, was sentenced to 53 years in prison for the murder of Wadee Alfayoumi, a six-year-old Muslim boy, and the attempted murder of his mother, Hanan Shaheen, in a hate-crime attack motivated by their Islamic faith and the Israel-Gaza war. The family rented rooms from Czuba in Plainfield, Illinois, and the attack occurred in October 2023. Evidence included testimony from Shaheen, a 911 call, and crime scene photos.

          <p>Southern California is bracing for thunderstorms and colder weather over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. A low-pressure system is expected to bring a risk of showers and thunderstorms to the mountains, with potential flash flooding and debris flows in burn-scar areas. Coastal areas could see light rain or drizzle, and mountain areas may experience snow around 5,500 feet of elevation. Temperatures are expected to dip to the 60- to 70-degree range, about 10 degrees below normal.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans are expected to resume repaying defaulted student loans after a five-year pause enacted by President Trump in March 2020. The second Trump administration is ending the pandemic-era reprieve and restarting forced collections on federal student loans starting on Monday, May 5. More than 5 million borrowers have loans that are in default, and that number could grow to almost 10 million in the next few months. Borrowers who are behind on payments could face repercussions like having their wages garnished and watching their credit scores plummet.</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal suggests cutting federal rental aid by approximately 40% and shifting funds to states to design their own rental assistance programs. The plan also includes a two-year cap on rental assistance for able-bodied adults. HUD Secretary Scott Turner calls the budget request 'bold' for reimagining aid programs. Advocates warn that such cuts could escalate homelessness, as nearly half of all renters are already considered cost-burdened. The budget also proposes shrinking HUD funding for homelessness by 12% and giving the money directly to states.</p>

The Coast Guard reported more than 30,000 gallons of an 'oily watery mixture' had been collected from the spill site.

You can negotiate a settlement directly with the creditor or debt collector, working with a debt settlement company, checking for legal defenses or procedural errors, or hiring a debt defense attorney. Creditors and debt collectors are often open to settling for less than the full balance, especially if they think you might not have the means to repay in full or if they want to avoid the cost of litigation.</p>
