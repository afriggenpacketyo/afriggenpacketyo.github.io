          <p>Donald Trump's plan to impose massive tariffs on US imports could significantly alter the global economic landscape.  The tariffs, potentially reaching 20% on all imports, aim to reverse what Trump calls unfair trade practices.  This move threatens to disrupt decades of globalization and could trigger substantial economic repercussions worldwide, including potential recession and significant cost increases.  The impact on the UK alone could be a 1% economic shrinkage.</p>
