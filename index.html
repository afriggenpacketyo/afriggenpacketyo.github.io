            <p>Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse was refused entry to Hong Kong while attempting to visit her newborn grandson, leading to diplomatic tensions. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has requested that the Foreign Secretary summon the Chinese Ambassador for an explanation, calling the situation deeply concerning. Hobhouse, a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, was not given a reason for the denial, which she described as cruel and devastating. The incident has raised questions about the UK's engagement with China, especially given previous sanctions against MPs critical of Beijing. The Foreign Secretary has stated that the UK will urgently raise the issue with Hong Kong and Beijing authorities.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration confirmed that Kilmar Abrego García, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, is being held in a notorious prison there. The confirmation came after a federal judge demanded information about García's whereabouts and the steps being taken to return him to the United States. While the administration acknowledged García's location, it did not detail the efforts to facilitate his return, leading to further frustration from the judge. The Supreme Court has upheld the judge's order to facilitate Abrego García's return after he was deported despite having a US work permit since 2019.</p>

            <p>A 50-foot gray whale washed ashore in Huntington Beach, marking another in a series of whale deaths this year. The cause of death is currently unknown, as initial examinations revealed no signs of physical injury. Samples have been sent to a lab for further testing. Scientists have noted an unusually high number of gray whale deaths, particularly in the lagoons of Baja California, Mexico, and San Francisco Bay, with some whales appearing malnourished. This has led researchers to suspect a potential lack of food as a contributing factor.</p>

            <p>A 45-foot statue of a nude woman, titled "R-Evolution," has been erected in San Francisco's Embarcadero Plaza, sparking controversy and criticism.

Critics across the political spectrum have deemed the statue tone-deaf, with some calling it a metaphor for the city's current state.

            <p>The State Department has reported to a judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, is "alive and secure" in a Salvadoran prison. This update follows a Supreme Court order to facilitate Garcia's return to the U.S. However, the report did not provide details on specific steps being taken to bring Garcia back. Attorneys for Garcia have requested additional relief, including ordering the government to show why it should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with previous court orders. Garcia was deported despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation.</p>
