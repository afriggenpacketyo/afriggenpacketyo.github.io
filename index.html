          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory at the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for violating Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority rules. The Kentucky Board of Stewards determined that Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times with his riding crop, exceeding the permitted six times during the race. This marked Alvarado's second violation in 180 days, leading to a doubled fine. Sovereignty, owned by Godolphin, will not run in the Preakness Stakes but is expected to participate in the Belmont Stakes.</p>

The discussions, involving Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland, aim to de-escalate trade tensions. President Trump has suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first. High tariffs have disrupted trade between the two countries, which exceeded $660 billion last year.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million. Cohen-Roth gained the victim's trust while preparing her taxes and offered fake "investment opportunities" with promised high interest rates. The scheme, which ran from 2013 to 2019, involved Cohen-Roth using the victim's savings and a reverse mortgage to fund a lavish lifestyle and pay off earlier investors in a Ponzi scheme. The victim was left financially destitute when the scheme collapsed in 2020.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where explicitly required by law. This directive effectively suspends the use of the "social cost of carbon," a metric reflecting the economic damage from global warming. The White House argues there are too many uncertainties in calculating the figure and doubts the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. Scientists and environmental groups criticize the decision as denying reality and ignoring the science and economics of climate change.</p>

The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, but significant changes are possible before the final vote.

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to resume trade negotiations, aiming to resolve a trade war impacting the global economy. The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng, seek to address tariffs that have disrupted trade between the two countries. While expectations for a breakthrough are low, the fact that talks are occurring has raised hopes for de-escalation. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations, fearing that continued tensions will lead to slower growth and higher prices.</p>
