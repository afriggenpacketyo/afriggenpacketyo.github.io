          <p>A former Department of Justice employee accused of throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal officer in Washington, D.C., has been charged with misdemeanor assault. Prosecutors had sought a more serious felony indictment, but a grand jury declined to issue one. The accused, Sean Charles Dunn, was fired after his arrest during a period when federal authorities had been deployed to the capital to crack down on crime. This marks the second recent case where federal prosecutors in D.C. have failed to secure a requested felony indictment for alleged assaults on federal officers, an outcome described as extremely rare.</p>

In an interview, Zhao emphasized that the city's success hinges on the speed and adaptability of its regulators. He suggested that Hong Kong's government has shown a clear willingness to embrace Web3 technologies but must act quickly to realize its potential. One key recommendation was to expand the limited number of cryptocurrencies currently approved for trading on licensed exchanges to foster a more competitive and dynamic market.</p>

He believes Nvidia is uniquely positioned to dominate this massive market and is "reinventing the very concept of work."

          <p>During the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School, older students are being lauded for their heroic actions in shielding younger children from gunfire. A school tradition pairing older and younger students as "buddies" for church services placed them in a position to act quickly. Witnesses and officials described middle schoolers pushing their younger buddies under pews and even covering them with their own bodies, with one taking a shotgun blast to the back. These selfless acts, along with those of teachers, are credited with saving numerous lives and preventing a much greater tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to auto research firm Edmunds, the upcoming Labor Day weekend presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. This is primarily due to a $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases that is set to expire on September 30. With EV prices already declining amid softer demand, leasing has become the dominant way consumers acquire electric cars, accounting for 70% of transactions in July. Experts suggest leasing is a prudent choice for many, as it allows them to experience the technology without committing to a rapidly evolving product that depreciates quickly.

          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans found that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is a net negative for the brand's appeal. Thirty-five percent of respondents said the feature would make them less likely to buy a Tesla, compared to only 14% who said it would make them more likely. The findings present a challenge for Tesla, which has positioned FSD as a key competitive advantage and a cornerstone of its future value, especially amid a sales slump and increased competition. The survey also revealed that nearly half of consumers believe FSD technology should be illegal, suggesting significant public skepticism and a need for stronger regulation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Kari Lake, a Trump administration official, cannot legally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressional advisory panel, which is currently vacant as President Trump has not appointed new members. The ruling is a significant check on the administration's efforts to reshape the federally funded international broadcaster, which has seen its operations dramatically reduced under Lake's leadership. The judge found the attempt to terminate Abramowitz did not comply with statutory requirements designed to insulate the network from political pressure.</p>

The article highlights Trump's recent statement, "I have the right to do anything I want to do," as strikingly similar to the fictional villain's mindset.

          <p>This opinion article explores the critical role global demand, particularly from China, plays in the future of Indonesia's palm oil industry. As Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto cracks down on illegal plantations to reclaim millions of hectares of deforested land, the author argues that the industry's practices cannot be separated from the markets it serves. The piece posits that each hectare of cleared forest is linked to international consumer appetite. It suggests that China, as a major importer, has the potential to influence a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally responsible practices within this vital but destructive sector.</p>

          <h2>Suspension of 'De Minimis' Tax Rule to End Duty-Free Status for Low-Value Online Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 17:29:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing import tax exception known as "de minimis," which has allowed Americans to buy cheap goods from online retailers like Temu and Shein without paying duties, is being suspended. Effective Friday, an executive order from President Trump will subject all incoming shipments to an import tax, ending the duty-free status for packages valued under $800. The rule's suspension is intended to support American businesses and enhance oversight of imported goods. Consumers should expect price increases on many low-cost items, as sellers will likely pass the new import costs on to their customers.</p>

          <p>Shares of Gap Inc. fell after the retailer reported second-quarter sales that slightly missed Wall Street expectations and issued a warning about the future impact of tariffs. The company increased its estimate for tariff-related costs for the year and projected a lower operating margin as a result. While the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy brands saw positive comparable sales growth, the Athleta brand continued to struggle with a 9% decline. CEO Richard Dickson acknowledged disappointment with Athleta's performance, stating that the brand is in a "year of reset" to refocus on its core customer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced an expansion of special California Highway Patrol teams to combat crime in major cities, while also highlighting that statewide crime numbers are down. The move is seen as a direct counter to President Trump's frequent criticisms of crime in "blue states" and threats of federal or military intervention. Newsom emphasized that his approach involves collaboration with local law enforcement, contrasting it with the Trump administration's strategy of "doing things to people, not with people." He presented data suggesting some Republican-led states have higher crime rates, directly challenging the president's narrative.</p>

          <p>The recent upheaval at the CDC, including the firing of its director and multiple high-level resignations, stems from a fundamental conflict over vaccine policy and the role of science in public health. Under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, the administration has overhauled a key vaccine advisory panel and altered COVID-19 shot recommendations, moves that departing officials claim are not based on scientific reality. Critics fear these actions could erode public trust, weaken the nation's ability to respond to disease outbreaks, and represent a dangerous politicization of the country's premier health agency.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to block his unprecedented attempt to remove her from the central bank's board. The lawsuit challenges the legality of the firing, which Trump justified by citing allegations of mortgage fraud that Cook's attorney calls "nakedly pretextual." The Federal Reserve Act permits a president to remove a governor only "for cause," a standard the suit argues has not been met. This legal battle is seen as a critical test of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference and could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for approximately 500,000 vehicles due to a safety issue that could cause a brake fluid leak. The recall affects 2015-2018 Ford Edge and 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX SUVs. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a rear brake hose in these vehicles can rupture, potentially leading to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances, which elevates the risk of a crash. Ford will notify affected owners in September, but a remedy for the problem is still under development and is not expected to be available until April.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that while President Trump's attempts to influence the Federal Reserve are concerning, the larger threat to its independence comes from unsustainable fiscal policy set by Congress. The author explains that as public debt grows, the pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates low to manage the government's borrowing costs—a concept known as fiscal dominance—becomes immense. This dynamic could force the Fed's hand regardless of who is president, subordinating monetary policy to fiscal needs. The article concludes that without meaningful budgetary reform from Congress, the Fed's ability to control inflation and operate independently is fundamentally compromised.
