          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have established a framework agreement aimed at implementing the Geneva consensus, a trade truce established last month, following high-level talks in London. The agreement awaits approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping before implementation can proceed. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and China's international trade representative Li Chenggang both confirmed the agreement to reporters. Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis, noted that unresolved details require internal discussion, making the agreement's potential for concrete breakthroughs uncertain. The framework signals a commitment to de-escalate and continue dialogue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has declared a curfew for a one-square-mile area of downtown L.A. from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. to address ongoing anti-ICE protests, citing concerns about vandalism and looting. The curfew zone is bordered by the 5, 110, and 10 Freeways, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and individuals experiencing homelessness. The protests, triggered by recent immigration raids, have resulted in numerous arrests and property damage, prompting President Trump to deploy the California National Guard and U.S. Marines, a move contested by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who argues it is an overreach of federal power and an illegal commandeering of the state's National Guard.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team has presented an expert witness who disputes the prosecution's claim that she fatally struck John O'Keefe with her car. Dr. Andrew Rentschler, a biomechanist, testified that a collision between Read's SUV and O'Keefe would not have resulted in the injuries sustained. Rentschler's testimony supports the defense theory that O'Keefe's injuries were caused by a fall and possibly a dog bite. Read has stated that she will not testify in her own defense, and Renstchler is the final witness the defense plans to call.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have prompted President Trump to deploy active-duty Marines to join the National Guard, leading to legal challenges from California Governor Gavin Newsom. Tensions escalated, resulting in arrests, property damage, and a curfew in downtown Los Angeles. The protests were triggered by recent immigration raids, with demonstrators blocking freeways and clashing with law enforcement. The situation has sparked a debate over federal authority, immigration policy, and the use of military forces in domestic law enforcement.</p>

This decision reverses a renaming process ordered by Congress and implemented under President Biden. Fort Bragg and Fort Benning had already been changed back to honor non-Confederate soldiers with the same last names.</p>
