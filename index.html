            <p>Women protesters in Guinea-Bissau reportedly attacked a Chinese-run zircon mining site, setting fire to equipment due to concerns that the mining activities were damaging their farms and the local environment. The protesters claim that authorities failed to address their complaints, leading to the direct action. Several women and a village leader were arrested following the incident at Nhiquin, near the border with Senegal, where Chinese companies have been operating since 2022. The interior minister expressed irritation, emphasizing the state's efforts to find partners and condemning the destruction of property.</p>

The decision to forgo the death penalty was influenced by the majority of victims' relatives who desired closure. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges, and has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.</p>

            <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange 252 Venezuelan deportees from the United States, who are imprisoned in El Salvador, for what he terms "political prisoners" held in Venezuela. Bukele addressed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on social media, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists detained during Venezuela's electoral crackdown. Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded critically, calling Bukele's statements "cynical" and demanding information on the detained Venezuelans in El Salvador, where they are being held in a "mega-prison" following deportation by the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>China has issued a warning to countries against appeasing the United States in trade negotiations related to President Donald Trump's tariffs. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that "appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot earn one respect," in response to reports that the U.S. plans to pressure governments into restricting trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from U.S. import taxes. China firmly opposes any deals made at the expense of its interests and will take countermeasures if necessary. This comes as the Trump administration has begun tariff talks with various trading partners.</p>

Both sides had previously accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov indicated that President Putin did not order an extension of the truce.

            <p>Approximately 60,000 Americans are at risk of losing their rental assistance and facing eviction due to a funding shortfall in the Emergency Housing Vouchers program. Launched in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, the program is expected to run out of money by the end of next year due to rising rent costs. The program's future depends on Congress, which could decide to allocate additional funds. If the program ends, it would represent one of the largest one-time losses of rental assistance in the U.S., potentially pushing many back into homelessness or abusive relationships.</p>

            <p>An industry expert suggests that increased tariffs will likely drive consumers toward the secondhand clothing market. With new clothing becoming more expensive due to tariffs, consumers may seek more affordable options in the resale market. This shift could lead to growth in the secondhand clothing industry as consumers look for cost-effective alternatives to traditional retail. This represents a potential opportunity for businesses involved in the resale of clothing.</p>

            <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to host US Vice President JD Vance for trade talks, amidst concerns about potential US tariffs on Indian imports. Vance's visit is seen as crucial for advancing the bilateral agenda set during Modi's visit to the US in February, focusing on fair trade and expanding the defense partnership. The US is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024. India hopes to secure a trade deal within a 90-day pause on tariffs declared by President Trump.</p>

Bukele made the offer directly to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro via social media. The US has been deporting Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they are held in a high-security prison. Maduro has condemned the US deportations as a human rights abuse, while Venezuela's chief prosecutor has criticized Bukele's proposal.</p>

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that it firmly opposes any deals made at the expense of China's interests and will take reciprocal countermeasures. The ministry cautioned about the risk to all countries once international trade returns to the "law of the jungle."</p>
