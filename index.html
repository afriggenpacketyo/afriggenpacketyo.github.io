          <p>Over 200 people were arrested in London's Parliament Square for demonstrating support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw participants display signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to mass arrests by the Metropolitan Police. The government banned the group following an incident where activists caused millions in damages to military aircraft. This event occurs amid a legal challenge by Palestine Action against its proscription, arguing it infringes on free speech.</p>

          <p>A notable shift is occurring within the Democratic party, moving from Michelle Obama's "when they go low, we go high" ethos to a more confrontational approach. Spurred by Republican-led gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas, Democratic leaders such as governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker are advocating for retaliatory redistricting. This new "fight fire with fire" strategy reflects a belief that passive, rule-based politics are insufficient against what they see as authoritarian maneuvers. The change signals a generational shift towards a more pugnacious political style to protect democratic processes.</p>

          <p>A development team has invested over $104 million to convert the abandoned St. John's College campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The historic site, which had been deteriorating for decades, now features 205 units, including 62 designated for affordable housing, blending original architectural elements with modern amenities. The project involved securing a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church and navigating complex financing. The renovated building is now leasing, aiming to preserve a local landmark while providing new housing options.</p>

          <p>Several German cities have offered to accept and provide medical care for seriously ill and traumatized children from Gaza, but the federal government is showing reluctance. Officials cite security concerns and a preference for providing aid locally, though critics suggest the hesitation stems from fears of a new wave of immigration. The debate has caused political friction within Germany's ruling coalition, with some lawmakers calling the offer a humane gesture while others dismiss it as political posturing. This contrasts with other European nations like Italy and Spain, which have already begun evacuating injured children.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that any peace deal negotiated without Ukraine's involvement, such as a potential summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, would be a "dead solution." He emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that his country will not cede land to Russia. Zelenskyy's comments address anxieties that a direct U.S.-Russia meeting could marginalize Ukrainian interests, especially following Trump's suggestions of a potential "swapping of territories." The statement reaffirms Ukraine's stance on achieving a lasting peace only through direct participation in negotiations.</p>

He argues that the high volume of ship and plane traffic in the area means the number of disappearances is statistically normal on a percentage basis. This explanation is supported by institutions like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and Lloyd's of London. Factors such as the Gulf Stream's volatile weather, complex navigation around islands, and potential magnetic compass anomalies are cited as logical reasons for the incidents.</p>

          <h2>American Malls Are Finding New Life by Replacing Traditional Anchors with Unconventional Tenants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Enclosed shopping malls across the U.S. are experiencing a resurgence by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with non-traditional tenants such as churches, entertainment venues, and community hubs. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which now draws thousands of people weekly, boosting traffic for remaining retailers. Mall owners are subdividing large, old anchor spaces for a mix of tenants including restaurants, hotels, and large-format bookstores like Barnes & Noble. This strategy is credited with increasing foot traffic and creating new "cross-shopping" opportunities, revitalizing once-struggling properties.</p>

          <p>Roland Mehrez Beainy, the owner of the "Trump Burger" restaurant chain in Texas, has been arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is facing deportation. Beainy, a Lebanese national, allegedly overstayed his visitor status after entering the U.S. in 2019. ICE stated that his application for legal status through marriage was suspect, as there was no proof he lived with his purported spouse. The case highlights the administration's stringent immigration enforcement, which applies even to vocal supporters of the president, as Beainy's restaurants are filled with pro-Trump memorabilia.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on a growing trend of toxic fan culture that has begun targeting national symbols like giant pandas and table tennis athletes. A recent government statement condemned individuals for manipulating public opinion to smear panda caretakers and research institutes with false claims of animal abuse. This follows a case where two people were convicted for inciting online harassment against panda researchers. The phenomenon reflects a darker side of intense national pride and fan devotion, prompting official warnings against "emotional outbursts" and "fan frenzy."</p>

          <p>A LendingTree survey found that nearly a quarter of Americans, particularly younger generations, use "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans to afford increasingly expensive concert tickets. In response to this trend, financial analysts suggest a more proactive approach. Instead of relying on short-term loans, consumers are advised to create dedicated savings funds, like a "Beyoncé fund," by incorporating these entertainment expenses into their regular budget. While BNPL offers interest-free installments, it may lack the consumer protections of credit cards and can lead to debt if not managed carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a high school football player, Logan Coleridge, experienced debilitating symptoms for months following a concussion, doctors discovered he had a rare brain condition. His persistent headaches, dizziness, and memory issues were ultimately diagnosed as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain. The concussion likely exacerbated symptoms from the pre-existing AVM, leading to its discovery. Following a successful surgery at NYU Langone to remove the malformation, the teen has recovered and is preparing to return to his normal life, raising awareness about early diagnostic imaging.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern-day alchemy: creating gold to make nuclear fusion economically viable. The speculative idea involves using neutrons produced during the fusion process to transmute other metals, like mercury, into gold. The revenue from selling the precious metal could then offset the immense cost of generating fusion power. While scientists have created minuscule amounts of gold in labs before at exorbitant costs, Marathon's co-founder believes this method could be a clever way to help fund the development of this near-limitless clean energy source.</p>
