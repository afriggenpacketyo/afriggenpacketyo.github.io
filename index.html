          <p>David Jolly, a former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump, has announced his candidacy for governor of Florida as a Democrat. Jolly, who represented the Tampa Bay area in Congress, left the Republican Party in 2018 and believes issues like affordability, public school funding, and campaign finance reform will resonate with voters. His shift to the Democratic Party is described as a formality, aligning with his long-held values of government assistance, economic fairness, and celebrating immigrants. Jolly's run draws comparisons to Charlie Crist, another former Republican congressman who unsuccessfully ran for governor as a Democrat, and he will face competition from Trump-backed Byron Donalds, among others, in the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>Habibur Masum has admitted to the manslaughter of his wife, Kulsuma Akter, in Bradford, but denies the charge of murder. The incident occurred on April 6 of last year when Masum stabbed Akter as she pushed their baby in a pram; the baby was unharmed. Masum, 26, of Leamington Avenue, Burnley, entered his plea at Bradford Crown Court. He also faces two counts of assault by beating and one charge of stalking, with a trial scheduled to begin on Monday to address the murder charge and other accusations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, about potential risks to unborn babies and reduced effectiveness of the contraceptive pill. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking these medicines and for a period after stopping, ranging from one to two months depending on the specific drug. The agency also highlights concerns about the growing popularity of these 'skinny jabs' and the potential for unsafe usage without proper medical advice. The MHRA has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancies, including unintended pregnancies, in women using these medications and advises women to discuss the risks and benefits with their prescribers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries, citing national security risks, while imposing partial restrictions on seven additional countries. The White House stated that these restrictions are necessary to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, and the list could be revised based on improvements or emerging threats. Exemptions will be made for athletes, holders of immigrant visas for persecuted minorities, Afghan nationals with Special Immigrant Visas, lawful permanent residents, and dual nationals from non-banned countries. Democrats and human rights groups have condemned the move as discriminatory and cruel, while Somalia has pledged to work with the US to address security issues.</p>

          <p>Political activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of harassing two Daily Mail reporters. The 42-year-old from Luton is accused of harassment causing fear of violence towards the journalists between August 5 and 7. He was released on bail and is scheduled to appear at Southwark Crown Court for a plea and trial preparation hearing on July 3.

          <p>China has granted approval for the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100, marking a significant milestone for the country's aviation ambitions. The move comes shortly after the US announced new export restrictions targeting China, including curbs on jet engine-related technologies. While the AES100 turboshaft engine differs from the jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts said its development represents a major step forward for the country's aviation sector. Li Gaiqi, chief designer of the AES100, stated that the license reflects China's ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines.</p>

          <p>With an above-normal hurricane season forecasted, experts are advising homeowners to review their insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts an active season with 13 to 19 named storms. Experts recommend checking policy limits to cover rebuilding costs, assessing deductibles, and determining the need for flood insurance, as standard policies typically do not cover flood damage. Acting now is crucial, as insurers often suspend policy changes when a storm approaches, ensuring homeowners have the right coverage before an urgent need arises.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that leprosy existed in the Americas long before the arrival of European explorers, challenging the previously held belief that the disease was solely introduced by settlers. Researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Paris discovered that a second species of bacteria, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, was responsible for leprosy in the Americas, existing and infecting humans for 1,000 years prior to European contact. The study, which involved analyzing over 800 DNA samples from ancient human remains and recent medical cases, found that Mycobacterium lepromatosis had spread rapidly throughout North and South America. This discovery transforms our understanding of the history of leprosy in the Americas.</p>

UK retailer Currys reported its "biggest gaming pre-order ever," selling 30,000 units.

          <p>Emergency experts are warning that recent fixes to long-standing problems at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are in jeopardy due to program cuts and staff reductions under the Trump administration. Under the Biden administration, FEMA had taken steps to address issues of inequitable aid distribution, simplifying forms and loosening residency requirements. However, some of those efforts have been canceled, and President Trump has expressed skepticism about FEMA's current form. Experts fear that these changes will disproportionately affect poor people, racial minorities, and those in rural and tribal areas, who have historically been underserved by the agency.</p>

          <p>A BBC Arabic team, including British citizen Feras Kilani, was detained by Israeli forces in southern Syria while filming near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The team was filming near a UN observation post when they were approached by Israeli soldiers who pointed rifles at their heads and confiscated their equipment. The soldiers escorted the team to a crossing point, where they reviewed the footage and interrogated Kilani about their activities. The BBC has complained to the Israeli military about the incident but has not yet received a response.</p>

          <p>The government has announced that any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, and the government has set aside Â£1 billion to fund the initiative up to 2029. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the changes would save parents Â£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. The Institute for Fiscal Studies noted that while the rule change would reduce child poverty to some degree, other measures like lifting the two-child limit would be more effective.</p>

          <p>Divorce lawyers report a seasonal pattern in divorce filings, with peaks in late summer and early spring. This trend is attributed to couples delaying legal proceedings during holidays and family vacations. A 2016 study supports this, finding that divorce filings consistently peak in March and August. While some believe sentimental reasons influence timing, others point to practical factors like tax filings and summer vacations. Overall divorce rates are declining, but "gray divorces" among those over 50 are increasing, often initiated by women with financial independence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed visa restrictions are causing international students to consider the U.K. instead of the U.S. for higher education. Experts anticipate a potential influx of international applicants to elite U.K. institutions, redirected from the U.S. This shift could financially benefit U.K. universities but raises concerns about access for domestic students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

          <p>The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has announced that the April inflation rate was overstated by 0.1 percentage points due to a car tax data calculation error. The ONS initially reported the annual rate at 3.5%, but revised data shows the Consumer Price Index rose by 3.4% in the 12 months to April. The error stemmed from incorrect Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport, which overstated the number of vehicles subject to VED rates in the first year of registration.
