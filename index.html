          <p>Personal finance expert Ric Edelman is calling for improved financial literacy in America, particularly among young investors who are drawn to risky, get-rich-quick schemes. Edelman argues that the lack of personal finance education in high schools leaves young adults unprepared for financial decisions like buying a car or getting a mortgage. He cautions against overly complex financial products and getting financial advice from unreliable sources like TikTok. The article emphasizes the need for credible financial education to help younger generations achieve long-term financial security.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that prices for common household items, including Barbie dolls, leggings, power drills, and washing machines, have increased following President Donald Trump's initial tariff announcement.

While the analysis doesn't definitively prove tariff impact, retailers and brands suggest that higher costs will be passed on to consumers.</p>
