          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicated that he is leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year due to concerns about potential upward pressure on inflation. Bostic highlighted that the central bank is trying to balance inflation worries with recession risks, noting that tariffs have been larger than initially expected. He expressed concern about rising inflation expectations, which could complicate the Fed's job of maintaining stable prices and maximum employment. Bostic, while not a current voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, emphasized the economic significance of even reduced tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of May 16, 2025, the price of gold is $3,175.87 per ounce, a figure subject to constant fluctuations due to supply and demand dynamics, economic conditions, and inflation. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, and its price is inversely proportional to interest rates. Geopolitical instability, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies also significantly impact gold prices.

          <p>Annual energy bills in the UK are predicted to decrease by Â£129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This nearly 7% decrease means a typical household will pay Â£1,720 annually for dual-fuel, down from the current Â£1,849. While this provides some relief, prices remain significantly higher than at the start of the decade, and many households continue to struggle with affordability. Experts emphasize the need for government action to reduce energy bills through home upgrades and support for those facing energy debt.</p>

While some critics within the Maga movement have raised concerns about Qatar's support for Islamist groups, Trump's administration appears to value Qatar's ability to resolve regional conflicts and its strategic alliance with the U.S., including hosting a major U.S. military installation.</p>

          <p>This article examines how views on friendship have changed over time, highlighting the contrast between passionate bonds between men celebrated in the Renaissance and modern depictions of male friendship. It discusses Aristotle's concept of 'perfect' friendship between men 'alike in virtue' and how women were historically considered incapable of such bonds. The article explores the shift in the 18th and 19th centuries, where women's friendships were idealized, while male bonds were often portrayed as superficial.

          <p>The UK and EU are working towards increased cooperation, marked by new agreements on fisheries, trade, and security, as British PM Starmer hosts EU leaders in London. The agreements aim to reduce red tape and stimulate the British economy. A key element is an agreement on fisheries allowing EU fishermen access to British waters for 12 years in exchange for easing red tape on food and drink imports/exports. Additionally, a defense and security pact will pave the way for the UK defense industry to participate in a â‚¬150 billion defense fund.</p>
