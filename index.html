          <h2>Trump Considers Tariff Revenue Rebate Checks for Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:30:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced he is considering issuing rebate checks to Americans, funded by the substantial tariff revenue collected by his administration. He noted the potential for rebates for "people of a certain income level," without specifying a threshold, while also emphasizing his administration's priority to pay down the national debt. The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue this year, projected to increase to $300 billion annually, yet economists forecast a significant rise in the national deficit due to recent tax cuts and spending. This proposal, reminiscent of pandemic-era checks, would require new tax legislation from Congress, as tariffs are typically paid by U.S. importers and could be impacting consumer prices.</p>

          <h2>Home Equity Lines of Credit: Expediting the Closing Process</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are increasingly considering Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) due to record tappable equity and relatively low interest rates compared to other borrowing options. While HELOCs typically take two to six weeks to close, the article explores whether a quicker turnaround, under two weeks, is feasible. Achieving a faster closing depends on the lender's streamlined processes, the borrower's preparedness with documents, and the possibility of appraisal waivers. However, federal regulations, like the mandatory three-day rescission period, make same-week closings nearly impossible, emphasizing the importance of proactive planning for borrowers.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:18:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel's stock fell 9% following the chipmaker's announcement of significant cost-cutting measures in its struggling foundry business, despite an otherwise better-than-expected earnings report. CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated that future chip manufacturing processes would require confirmed customer commitments, indicating an end to "blank checks" for projects. The company's SEC filing revealed uncertainty in securing external foundry customers, leading to the cancellation of facility projects in Germany and Poland and slowed production in Ohio. This slump reflects ongoing challenges in the AI market and skepticism regarding its manufacturing strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to questions about pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, stating he "haven't thought about it" but acknowledged his authority to do so. His remarks came as Maxwell met with a top Department of Justice official in Florida for a second consecutive day. Trump deflected focus to others who socialized with Epstein, including former President Bill Clinton, and expressed faith in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche regarding Maxwell's cooperation. Maxwell's lawyer maintained she answered all questions truthfully and seeks fairness after being treated "unfairly for over five years."</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has suspended its participation in all think tank events, a departure from its historical engagement with Washington's national security community. This move aims to prevent the Department of Defense from endorsing organizations that contradict the current administration's "America Last" values, which are described as promoting globalism and criticism of President Trump. Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson stated that future invitations will be thoroughly vetted to ensure alignment with Trump's agenda. This policy shift follows the Pentagon's withdrawal from the Aspen Security Forum, an event Wilson characterized as promoting "globalism" and "hatred for the President."</p>

          <p>Despite years of promises, reliable in-flight Wi-Fi remains an elusive goal for many air travelers, often functioning inconsistently or failing entirely. The article explains that the primary issue isn't the Wi-Fi technology itself within the plane, but rather the "pipe" connecting it to the internet, historically relying on unreliable air-to-ground communication. While satellite technology has improved speed and reliability, its widespread implementation is slow due to significant investment, regulatory hurdles, and aircraft-specific configurations. Airlines like Delta and American are still in transition, prioritizing larger jets, meaning consistent service remains a future promise, perpetually "a year away."</p>

Science's editor-in-chief stated retractions are appropriate when experiments don't support conclusions, even without misconduct. However, the study's co-author argued that scientific debate should not lead to retraction, while NASA, a funder of the original work, also urged Science to reconsider its decision.</p>

A famine (Phase 5) requires three conditions: at least 20% of households facing catastrophe, 30% of children under five suffering acute malnutrition, and two of every 10,000 adults dying daily from non-trauma causes. While Gaza is currently in Phase 4 (emergency), with many experiencing "catastrophe," the formal declaration is complex due to data collection challenges in conflict zones. Experts emphasize that starvation can occur long before a famine is officially declared, highlighting the urgency of aid access.</p>

          <p>Bridget Everett, star, writer, and producer of HBO's "Somebody Somewhere," reflects on her semi-autobiographical journey from waitressing and karaoke in New York to becoming a local legend in her Kansas hometown, where the show is set. The series follows Sam Miller, a character grappling with grief and self-discovery after her sister's death. Everett's unique cabaret performances, which blend risqué humor with meditations on life and loss, including the death of her beloved dog, inspired the show's focus on strength and vulnerability. Despite the show not being renewed for a fourth season, it earned a Peabody Award and an Emmy nomination, marking a surreal and fulfilling chapter in Everett's life.</p>

          <p>Over 220 Members of Parliament from nine political parties, including a majority of Labour MPs, have signed a letter urging Sir Keir Starmer to recognize Palestinian statehood. This move intensifies pressure on the UK Prime Minister, especially after France committed to recognizing a Palestinian state within months. While Starmer stated that recognition must be part of a "wider plan" for a two-state solution and lasting security, the letter argues that British recognition would send a "powerful symbolic message" and is a vital step toward peace. The call comes amidst strong criticism of aid restrictions in Gaza and demands for an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress, aiming to incentivize public companies to distribute stock to their rank-and-file employees. The proposed legislation would offer a 3 percentage point corporate tax rate discount to large companies that grant at least 5% of their stock to the lowest-paid 80% of employees. Sponsors argue this initiative could transfer nearly $4 trillion in stock value to almost 40 million middle-class Americans, fostering employee loyalty and expanding ownership. The bill also includes tax deductions for companies and tax-free benefits for employees, highlighting a bipartisan effort to address wealth disparity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has issued new "Failure to Travel" guidance, stating that single adult male asylum seekers who refuse to move from hotels to alternative accommodation risk becoming homeless. This policy aims to establish "clear consequences" for those deemed to be "gaming the system" and reduce the government's reliance on costly hotel accommodations for asylum seekers. Hundreds of migrants are reportedly refusing transfers weekly, prompting this stricter approach. Under the new rules, individuals will receive five days' notice, and persistent refusal could lead to eviction and withdrawal of financial support, intensifying the debate over asylum policy and migrant welfare.</p>

However, the article warns of significant financial consequences if the transferred balance is not paid in full before this promotional period expires. Immediately, the card's standard APR, often high, kicks in, applying interest to the remaining balance. Some cards may even charge deferred interest retroactively from the original transfer date. Failure to pay off the balance can also negatively impact credit scores due to high utilization.

These statements come amidst Trump's efforts to deflect scrutiny from his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.
