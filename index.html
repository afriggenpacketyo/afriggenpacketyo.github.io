        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index increased by 2.7% annually in July, slightly below expectations, providing some relief to markets. The core index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3.1%, driven by costs for shelter and services, reflecting the initial impacts of new international tariffs. This moderate inflation reading has increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may consider an interest rate cut in September to support the economy amid trade policy uncertainty.

          <p>A new U.K. law, the Online Safety Act, is facing significant criticism from users, tech companies, and U.S. politicians. The legislation mandates age verification on platforms with adult content to protect children but has raised major privacy concerns due to requirements for sharing personal ID or credit card details. The backlash has intensified as major platforms like X and Reddit implement these systems, and U.S. officials worry it could set a precedent that chills free expression.</p>

          <p>A high school teacher in Fairfax County, Virginia, claims she repeatedly tried to report a school social worker for allegedly arranging and funding a 17-year-old student's abortion in 2021 without parental consent. The teacher, Zenaida Perez, states her warnings over several years were ignored and met with retaliation by school officials. The school district has now launched an external investigation, though it claims it only recently learned of the allegations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive trade policies, including steep tariffs and sanctions threats, are reportedly damaging relations with key U.S. allies India and Japan. This friction threatens to unravel the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, a strategic alliance between the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia that was strengthened to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. The article suggests these moves are driven more by domestic politics than a coherent foreign policy strategy.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour government came to power last year. The milestone, which follows the death of a female migrant during a crossing attempt, has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties who accuse the government of failing to control the border. In response, the government is highlighting a new "one in, one out" returns agreement with France as part of its strategy to deter the crossings.</p>

          <p>According to a new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, 2.4 million fewer Americans will receive food stamp benefits due to expanded work requirements in a recently passed law. The legislation broadens the mandate to work or participate in job training to include parents of older children, adults up to age 64, and other groups. Critics argue the changes will disproportionately harm households at the bottom of the income distribution and worsen food insecurity.</p>

          <p>Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% jump in revenue to $658.1 million in its first quarter as a public company, causing its stock to rise. This strong performance was driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of USDC, reflecting growing mainstream and institutional interest in stablecoins. The growth is also supported by a more favorable regulatory environment in the U.S., including the recent passage of supportive crypto legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

He discusses the process of procuring brains for research, including from the recent NFL headquarters shooter, and warns that the risk of CTE is not diminishing at lower levels of football. Nowinski argues that despite rule changes, the underlying problem is still being created.</p>

          <p>Even with a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, the global shipping landscape is undergoing a significant transformation as companies diversify their supply chains. Analysts predict a year-long decline in traffic on the direct transpacific route from China to the U.S. as businesses preemptively shift to other countries to avoid potential future tariffs. This trend is putting sustained downward pressure on freight rates for cargo leaving from major Chinese ports like Shanghai. (not investment advice)</p>
