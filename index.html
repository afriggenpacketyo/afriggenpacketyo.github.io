          <p>Tommy Robinson, the far-right anti-Islam activist, will be released from prison four months early after his 18-month sentence for contempt of court was reduced. Robinson was jailed for ignoring an order not to repeat false allegations about a Syrian refugee. The High Court granted the sentence reduction after Robinson's lawyers argued that he had demonstrated a 'change in attitude' and a 'commitment' to comply with the court order. This decision comes after a hearing where Robinson's lawyers presented evidence of his altered behavior and willingness to adhere to legal directives.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, McPhail, stated that the retailer will not raise prices due to tariffs, thanks to its scale and strong supplier partnerships. This decision contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices in response to tariffs. Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, expecting a 2.8% increase in total sales and a 1% rise in comparable sales. The company's strategy includes diversifying import sources to reduce reliance on any single country outside the U.S. to less than 10% by next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff reduction between Beijing and Washington, a survey by Allianz Trade reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters are planning to increase exports to markets outside the U.S. This move reflects lasting concerns from the trade war and expectations of continued U.S.-China decoupling. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is a popular choice for relocating production. The report estimates that global exports could see a loss of $305 billion due to widespread trade conflicts, highlighting the long-term impact of trade tensions on business strategies.</p>

Experts and diplomats express concern that dismantling agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation could undermine U.S. influence and economic growth in Africa, even as countries like China invest heavily in infrastructure projects across the continent.</p>

          <p>Emergency rooms in the United States are facing a crisis due to a dramatic rise in patients 'boarding' in ER beds while waiting for a traditional hospital ward space. This overcrowding leads to worse patient outcomes, fragmented care, and increased costs, as well as negatively impacting the training of young doctors. A recent study found that nearly three-quarters of emergency medicine residents reported that boarding had highly negative effects on their training, causing anxiety and emotional toll. The authors of the article call for collective action from hospital administrators, insurance executives, and elected officials to address the systemic issues causing this crisis.</p>

          <p>Jake Tapper, in his new book 'Original Sin,' claims that the White House repeatedly lied about President Biden's cognitive state, leading to a 'horrible cover-up'. Tapper argues that the media failed to aggressively pursue the story due to a lack of sources and loyalty to Biden. The book details instances of Biden's memory lapses and physical challenges, suggesting that these issues were known but concealed. Tapper believes that this concealment deprived the Democratic Party of the chance to determine if its chances were better with another candidate.</p>

          <p>Scientists warn that even if global warming is limited to 1.5C, the world could still see damaging sea-level rise of several meters in the coming centuries. The researchers reviewed recent studies and past climate data, concluding that 1.5C should not be considered a 'safe' limit for coastal populations. They emphasize that continued melting of Greenland and Antarctica is likely, and every fraction of a degree of warming avoided would still greatly limit the risks.</p>

          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, reflects on Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis and its potential impact on his legacy. Drawing parallels to her father's Alzheimer's announcement, Davis suggests that Biden can use this opportunity to show leadership on a human level by openly sharing his experiences and feelings about his illness. She argues that such candor could restore trust with voters and transcend partisan politics.</p>
