          <p>This year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., centered on the theme of youth and the future of cultural traditions. The event showcased a diverse group of artisans, including a Guatemalan painter preserving her Maya identity and Bolivian rappers who integrate indigenous languages like Quechua and Aymara into their hip-hop. Other featured artists were refugee weavers revitalizing an ancient craft and a family of Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for renowned musicians like Dolly Parton. These ensembles, all rooted in the Global South, demonstrated their commitment to passing down their unique cultural heritage to the next generation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions have escalated between China and Japan after their military aircraft had a series of close encounters over the East China Sea. Japan's defense ministry accused a Chinese fighter jet of making "unusual approaches" toward one of its intelligence aircraft, warning that such actions could lead to accidental collisions. In response, China's defence ministry claimed its forces acted lawfully and professionally while monitoring Japanese planes that had "repeatedly" entered China's air defence identification zone. Beijing asserted that Japan's close-in reconnaissance and alleged harassment are the primary cause of security risks in the region.</p>

          <h2>Child's Death in Liverpool Highlights Surge in UK Measles Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 06:34:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, marking what is believed to be only the second such death in the UK in a decade. The hospital reported a significant increase in "seriously unwell" children with the highly contagious virus, having treated 17 cases since June. Health officials attribute the surge to falling uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with rates in the North West of England at 85%, below the 95% target set by the World Health Organisation. Experts are urging parents to vaccinate their children, emphasizing the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The UK government is actively considering additional regulations to enhance online safety for children, according to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. This comes as new age-verification rules, enforced by the media regulator Ofcom, are set to take effect this month under the Online Safety Act. Alexander stated that these initial measures are a foundation but not the "end of the conversation," with the Technology Secretary exploring further actions to address issues like addictive online habits. Ofcom's chief executive affirmed the regulator's commitment to enforcing the new requirements but acknowledged that future legislation may be needed to address emerging challenges from artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza has killed ten people, among them six children, according to emergency service officials. Eyewitnesses reported that a drone fired a missile at a crowd of people who were queuing with jerry cans to fill them with water from a tanker. The attack also resulted in 16 injuries, including seven children, who were treated at a local hospital. This incident is part of a broader escalation of Israeli aerial attacks across the Gaza Strip, which has led to numerous casualties and prompted international organizations to voice alarm over the horrific conditions civilians are facing.</p>

          <p>A year after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, which resulted in the death of fire chief Corey Comperatore, attention is focused on the significant security breakdown. Multiple investigations by the Secret Service, FBI, and Congress have highlighted systemic failures, including lapses in intelligence sharing and event coordination. The Secret Service has since outlined 37 reform measures, but critics point to long-standing issues dating back to its post-9/11 integration into the Department of Homeland Security, which expanded its mission without a proportional increase in resources. The incident remains a stark warning about the consequences of under-resourcing the agency.</p>

          <p>Recently declassified documents have revealed that an F-16 Viper jet was struck by an unknown flying object during a training exercise in Arizona in January 2023, intensifying discussions about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). While officials ultimately determined the object was a drone, its operator and origin remain unknown. The incident is one of hundreds of UAP encounters reported by the Department of Defense, many occurring near sensitive military sites. Experts like filmmaker James Fox suggest these events, some involving craft with no visible propulsion, point to technology far beyond current capabilities, fueling speculation about non-human intelligence that has persisted for decades.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the event is being analyzed for its profound impact on the 2024 election and Donald Trump's presidency. Trump's survival and defiant reaction, raising a bloodied fist, created a powerful image that galvanized his supporters and was framed by many as divine intervention. This moment contrasted sharply with then-President Joe Biden's perceived weakness, culminating in his withdrawal from the race just eight days later. The shooting and its aftermath are now seen as having solidified Trump's political narrative and contributed to a sense of invincibility, while leaving the Democratic party grappling with the consequences.</p>

This, along with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to the exiled spiritual leader, drew sharp criticism from Beijing. China, which views the Dalai Lama as a separatist, has lodged a formal protest, insisting that the succession must follow Chinese law and tradition and has urged India to cease interfering in its internal affairs.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech's Dabiri Lab are transforming ordinary jellyfish into cyborgs by embedding them with microelectric controllers. These biohybrid robots can be remotely guided to swim and collect environmental data, such as temperature and pressure, from the ocean's depths. The project aims to provide a low-cost, scalable alternative to expensive underwater robots, making ocean research more accessible. Jellyfish are ideal candidates as they lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, and they can heal quickly after the device is removed. Current research focuses on improving the device's durability for deep-sea pressures and adding steering capabilities for more precise navigation.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing and homelessness crisis, California is creating its first-ever Cabinet-level agency dedicated exclusively to these issues. The new agency will be formed by splitting the existing Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency, a move supporters say is long overdue to elevate the topic to the highest level of state government. The primary goal is to streamline the state's complex and fragmented network of affordable housing funding programs, which are currently spread across multiple departments. While the reorganization is seen as a crucial first step, experts caution that simply restructuring bureaucracy will not solve the state's deep-seated housing affordability problems.</p>

          <p>The class of 2025 is encountering significant difficulties in securing employment, with economists describing the current labor market as one of the toughest in recent years, outside of the pandemic. Factors contributing to the struggle include job cuts in the federal government and tech sector, as well as general employer hesitancy to hire amid economic uncertainty. Many graduates who do find jobs are forced to accept lower salaries than anticipated. While the overall unemployment rate remains low, fewer people are quitting their jobs, resulting in limited openings for new entrants.

The fight transcended spectacle because it was about winning, not just performing. However, the sport remains filled with contradictions, from disparities in pay to the objectification of ring girls. Ultimately, the bout affirmed a woman's right to risk her body for glory and self-belief, reclaiming it for something more defiant than traditional roles.</p>

On Saturday, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales all recorded their warmest day of 2025 so far. Amber heat health alerts remain active for several regions in England, warning of potential health risks, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The heatwave has prompted hosepipe bans and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. The Met Office forecasts that the heat will begin to break down on Monday, bringing cooler, rainier conditions to many parts of the country.</p>

          <p>After more than four decades of armed struggle, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its conflict with the Turkish government and initiated a disarmament process. In a symbolic act, 30 PKK fighters destroyed their weapons in Iraqi Kurdistan, following a call from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan to end the insurgency. The PKK has demanded concessions from Turkey, including Ocalan's release and legal reforms, for full disarmament. While Turkey's government remains cautious, it has called the move an opportunity for peace. A legislative commission is expected to be formed to address the complex path toward reconciliation and stability.</p>

          <p>This article focuses on Warren Buffett's long-standing investment advice for the average person: buy a low-cost S&P 500 index fund, specifically citing the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). It notes that consistently outperforming the S&P 500 is extremely difficult, with nearly 90% of professional large-cap fund managers failing to do so over the last 15 years. The article illustrates the potential for long-term growth, calculating that a consistent monthly investment of $500 could grow to over $1 million in three decades based on the index's historical annual return of 10.4%. The fund's broad diversification and very low expense ratio are presented as key advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Forty years after its historic broadcast, Live Aid is remembered as a monumental moment of global unity and fundraising for famine relief in Ethiopia, but it is also viewed with a more critical lens today. Conceived by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the 1985 concert featured an unprecedented lineup of rock stars and raised millions. However, in retrospect, the event has been criticized for its lack of diversity, featuring no African performers on the main stages and very few women. While Geldof defends the choices as necessary to maximize donations, critics argue it reinforced a patronizing "white savior" image of Africa, a debate that continues to surround its legacy.</p>

          <p>A campaign is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English instead of Latin to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Currently, companies use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a system based on Latin and scientific names, which can make it difficult for consumers to identify allergens like peanut oil or almond oil. MP Becky Gittins, who has a severe nut allergy, is leading the campaign, arguing the current system puts people at risk. While the industry's trade association defends the Latin-based system for providing a universal global standard, allergy sufferers and advocates argue for clearer, more accessible labeling similar to food packaging.</p>
