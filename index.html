          <p>After a disappointing first round at the U.S. Open, Rory McIlroy continued his pattern of avoiding the media, bypassing reporters after finishing at 4-over par. McIlroy, who won the Masters in April, has not spoken to the assembled media since then, continuing his silence from the PGA Championship last month. Golfers are not contractually obligated to speak with the media, unlike players in other major American sports leagues such as the NFL and NBA. Despite a strong start, McIlroy's fortunes declined, leaving him eight strokes behind the leader, J.J. Spaun, as he prepares for the Ryder Cup after the U.S. Open.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration raid protests, deeming the move "illegal." Judge Charles Breyer ordered the administration to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, citing a failure to follow congressionally mandated procedures and a violation of the Tenth Amendment. Newsom criticized the militarization of city streets, emphasizing the military's place on the battlefield, not in civilian affairs. The judge noted that the protests did not meet the legal requirements of a "rebellion" to justify federal deployment, highlighting the threat to First Amendment rights and the constitutional balance of power.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations reportedly linked to Iran's nuclear program, prompting Defense Minister Israel Katz to declare a state of emergency. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation would continue until the threat is removed, while Iranian state media reported fatalities in Tehran. Oil prices surged by more than 7%, and U.S. stock futures fell amid fears of a broader regional conflict. The United States asserted non-involvement in the military operation, emphasizing the protection of American forces in the region, as President Trump had previously warned of potential action if talks with Iran failed to curb its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's policy of defending Israel against Iran, aligning with both isolationist and progressive viewpoints. Greene questioned the rationale behind potentially bombing Iran based on Israel's assessment of Iran's nuclear capabilities, stating that she doesn't know anyone in her district who even thinks about Iran. Her comments followed reports of the State Department's decision to move nonessential embassy staff out of Baghdad due to escalating regional violence, with Trump indicating that an Israeli strike on Iran could happen. Greene's stance reflects a broader debate within the Republican party regarding U.S. involvement in international conflicts.</p>

          <p>Israel has conducted a series of airstrikes in Iran targeting the country's nuclear sites, according to an Israeli military official, who accused Tehran of operating a secret nuclear weapons program.

Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a "special state of emergency" and warned of potential missile and drone retaliation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. was not involved in the attack, but that Israel had advised them that the action was necessary for self-defense.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, potentially alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. The study, published in PNAS, analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The findings indicate that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste, challenging the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. This domestication process of Sus scrofa occurred in ancient society, marking a significant development in the region's history.</p>

          <p>Approximately 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike to protest what they claim are unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals announced that members voted overwhelmingly in favor of granting their leaders the authority to call a strike. The vote comes after several months of contract negotiations between the union and the grocery chain companies, with the workers' contracts expiring in March. Negotiations are set to resume on June 25, with staffing levels being one of the main sticking points.</p>

          <h2>Trump Orders Consolidation of Wildland Firefighting Forces Despite Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 20:20:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings of potential disruptions and increased risks during peak wildfire season. The order aims to centralize efforts currently divided among multiple agencies, proposing a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department. Critics, including former Forest Service officials, argue that the restructuring could increase the likelihood of catastrophic fires and endanger communities and firefighters. The order does not address climate change, despite its role in exacerbating wildfires, and comes as another destructive fire season is anticipated.</p>

          <p>A Taiwanese court sentenced a Chinese captain to three years in prison for damaging an undersea cable connecting Taiwan's main island to the Penghu island group in February. The court found that the captain of the Hong Tai 58, sailing under a Togolese flag with a crew of eight mainland Chinese, instructed crew members to release the ship's anchor near the undersea cable. The vessel was also found to have sailed in a zigzag pattern, leading to the cable damage.</p>

          <p>A novel "Trojan horse" therapy, which delivers toxic drugs directly into cancer cells, will be available on the NHS in England, marking a world-first. This treatment, known as belantamab mafodotin, has demonstrated the ability to halt the progression of the blood cancer myeloma for nearly three times longer than current therapies. The drug works by binding to cancerous plasma cells and releasing a lethal chemotherapy drug inside. Clinical trials have shown that the therapy can halt the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current treatments.</p>

One couple recounted being assured of a good rental income for their lodge, only to experience minimal bookings and face threats when seeking legal advice.
