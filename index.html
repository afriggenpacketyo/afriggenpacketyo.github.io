          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report revealed a 69% sales increase, driven by strong data center performance due to demand for AI GPUs. However, U.S. export controls restricting the sale of its H20 chip have cost the company billions in potential revenue from China, a market Nvidia estimates to be worth $50 billion. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's cloud provider partnerships with companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon remain strong, accounting for roughly half of its data center revenue. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasizes the growing demand for AI inference, the process of using AI models to serve millions of customers, with the latest Blackwell chips designed to meet this need (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have determined that a 1,500-year-old bucket discovered at Sutton Hoo, a site of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries in England, was used as a cremation vessel. Analysis of the Byzantine Bromeswell bucket revealed cremated human and animal bones, indicating it held the remains of an important person and their grave goods. The bucket, dating back to the 6th century, is decorated with hunting scenes and is believed to have originated from Antioch in the Byzantine Empire, now modern Turkey. Researchers also found an unburned double-sided comb made from antler, suggesting the Anglo-Saxons valued grooming.</p>

          <p>Israeli attacks on Gaza have reportedly resulted in over 60 deaths in a single day, according to local health officials, while aid distribution efforts face significant obstacles. The United Nations criticizes the new Israeli-backed aid system, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, deeming it insufficient to address the population's basic needs, and a World Food Program warehouse was looted by desperate individuals, resulting in casualties. Israel and Hamas are reportedly considering a revised cease-fire proposal, which includes the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, potentially leading to a 60-day cease-fire and increased aid flow. The conflict, which began in October 2023, has resulted in a staggering loss of life, with over 54,000 Palestinians and approximately 1,200 Israelis reportedly killed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's threat to impose tariffs on key trading partners faces uncertainty after a U.S. court blocked across-the-board charges, leading to cautious reactions from global partners.

Despite the court's decision, sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place, potentially leading to continued negotiations in these sectors.

          <p>Retirees in Carlsbad, California, lead the U.S. in annual income from Social Security and savings, averaging $85,442, according to a SmartAsset analysis. Social Security and retirement account withdrawals form the bulk of retirees' income, with Social Security benefits partially tied to earnings. Higher earners tend to receive larger Social Security checks and save more for retirement, explaining the concentration of high-earning retirees in specific cities. Social Security payments vary less than retirement account withdrawals, with average Social Security benefits ranging from $15,421 to $31,752 annually.</p>

          <p>Savings accounts offer a safe place to store emergency funds and earn interest, with high-yield savings accounts providing significantly higher rates than traditional accounts. Online banks often offer the best high-yield savings account rates due to lower overhead costs, passing the savings on to consumers through higher interest rates and low or no fees. Comparing different accounts and considering factors beyond interest rates, such as fees, is essential to maximize savings potential. Choosing a high-yield savings account with an online bank and researching options allows savers to prepare for the future.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced another setback with its third consecutive test flight ending in failure, despite achieving its greatest progress to date. The unmanned spacecraft spun out of control minutes after separating from its Super Heavy booster, resulting in a "rapid unscheduled disassembly." While the company successfully used a previously flown booster, the repeated failures raise questions about the long-term reliability and safety of the Starship program. Experts suggest that SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" approach may not be as effective for Starship due to its higher costs and the lack of an established market for its primary goal of sending humans to Mars.</p>
