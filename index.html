          <p>With South Korea set to elect a new president, women who played a crucial role in ousting the previous leader, Yoon Suk Yeol, feel their concerns are being ignored. Despite enduring discrimination, sexual harassment, and a significant gender pay gap, equality for women has been largely unaddressed by the main candidates. The candidates' silence is particularly disheartening after women actively protested against Yoon's perceived anti-feminist stance. The lack of focus on women's issues leaves many feeling abandoned and unheard in the current political landscape, prompting concerns about the future of gender equality in the country. The situation has made many young women feel abandoned and unheard. Optimism is low among women who led protests against Yoon and celebrated his impeachment.</p>

Hedges' resurgence came at a crucial time, as he had been in a hitting slump recently, but his performance helped USC advance to the Corvallis Regional final. Mason Edwards pitched effectively, while Caden Hunter secured his first Division I save. USC now stands one win away from their first super regionals appearance since 2005, showcasing the team's resilience under coach Andy Stankiewicz. The Trojans advance to the Sunday night regional final at 7 p.m. and hope to continue their winning ways.</p>

          <p>AVZ Minerals has suspended its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo, encouraged by the U.S. government, to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. This pause comes as the U.S. supports KoBold Metals, backed by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZ's stake in Manono, challenging China's Zijin Mining, which currently controls the northern section after Congo revoked AVZ's rights in 2023. Washington's intervention underscores its growing efforts to secure critical minerals in Congo, countering China's dominance in the global green energy transition. If successful, KoBold will pledge US$1 billion to develop the project, marking a significant move in the competition for resources.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a commercial truck hauling pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities urged the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, while beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to find their queen and return to their hives. Officials initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees but later corrected the tally with assistance from a beekeeper. The hives from the overturned truck were recovered, restored and returned to use.</p>
