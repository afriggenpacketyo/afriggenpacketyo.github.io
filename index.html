          <p>Donald Trump's new tariffs, ranging from 10% to 50% on imports, mark a significant shift away from globalization, causing alarm among governments and investors. Trump has advocated for tariffs for decades, believing they will revitalize the US economy. However, economists and businesses fear the tariffs will increase costs for American consumers and disrupt global trade, potentially leading to a recession. Despite skepticism, Trump remains steadfast in his belief that tariffs will bring economic prosperity to the US.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a novel vaccine booster, a molecular 'elevator', that enhances the immune response against cancer and viruses by up to 150-fold. This innovative system, named SABER, efficiently delivers vaccine antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum, bypassing cellular barriers and improving treatment effectiveness. The research promises improved treatments for malignancies and enhanced vaccine efficacy against rapidly mutating coronaviruses, potentially revolutionizing cancer and infectious disease therapies. The advancement marks a significant step forward in immunotherapy.&#x20;</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have come into effect, imposing a 10% duty on all imports and higher rates on specific countries, marking a seismic shift in global trade. The tariffs have already shaken global stock markets and are expected to evolve as countries negotiate lower rates. Exemptions exist for certain goods like energy and pharmaceuticals, but the move signals a rejection of mutually agreed tariff rates, prompting concerns about economic disruption and potential trade wars. The impact on various sectors is being closely monitored.&#x20;</p>

He also criticized global NGOs and emphasized that other rich countries, like China and India, should contribute.

          <p>Despite market turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs, many residents in Ohio's industrial towns support the president's plans. They believe the tariffs will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry, and raise revenue. While some economists warn of potential price increases for American consumers, supporters in Ohio see it as a necessary step to bring companies and business back to the US. The automotive industry faces potential challenges, but local steel businesses may benefit from increased protectionism.&#x20;</p>

          <p>The L.A. Dodgers are scheduled to visit the White House to celebrate their World Series championship, a decision that has sparked controversy. Shortstop Mookie Betts expressed the difficulty of the decision, given his experience as a Black man in America. While some fans and players support the visit, others oppose it due to the Trump administration's policies. The team's manager, Dave Roberts, declined to comment on the political aspects of the visit.&#x20;</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted TikTok a second extension to comply with a law requiring the video app to sell its US operations or face a ban. Trump expressed his desire to work with TikTok and China to close the deal, which has been under negotiation. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, stated that an agreement has not been executed and that key matters need resolution. The extension comes as the Trump administration seeks American ownership of the platform.&#x20;</p>

Alibaba is viewed as a facilitator of entrepreneurship through its AI capabilities, rather than merely an online marketplace operator.

The judge emphasized that the case was not about abortion rights but about breaching the protection order.

          <p>The Peace Corps is the latest federal agency targeted by Elon Musk's 'department of government efficiency' (Doge), with potential budget cuts looming. A Doge representative visited the Peace Corps headquarters, requesting access to financial records and indicating possible program cancellations. This move follows similar actions by Doge at other agencies focused on global issues and foreign aid. The Peace Corps, which sends US volunteers worldwide, has long enjoyed bipartisan support.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are requesting a prison sentence of over seven years for former Congressman George Santos after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges. They argue that Santos's crimes made a mockery of the election system, as he lied to campaign staff, supporters, and the public. Prosecutors maintain that Santos has been unrepentant and has not repaid his victims. Santos's lawyers have not yet responded, and a sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 25.&#x20;</p>

          <p>A deal to transfer TikTok's US operations to a new company with majority American ownership has reportedly fallen through due to the US-China trade war. After months of negotiations, the deal was finalized, but the Chinese government has withheld approval following President Trump's announcement of tariffs.
