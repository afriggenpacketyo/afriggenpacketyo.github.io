            <p>Tyler Herro's 30 points, including crucial overtime three-pointers, propelled the Miami Heat to a 123-114 victory over the Atlanta Hawks in the NBA play-in tournament. This win marked the Heat as the first No. 10 seed to reach the playoffs since the play-in format's inception, showcasing their resilience with two road wins. Trae Young's late layup forced overtime, but Miami ultimately prevailed, setting up a first-round playoff series against Cleveland. The Heat's strong start and clutch overtime performance secured their playoff spot, while the Hawks' three-point shooting proved insufficient to overcome Miami's balanced attack.</p>

            <p>US Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, reporting that he was "traumatized" after being held in the notorious Cecot prison. Van Hollen facilitated the meeting, as Abrego Garcia had no contact with anyone outside of prison since his deportation. Abrego Garcia has since been moved to a new prison with better conditions, though he remains isolated from the outside world. This case highlights a conflict between the Trump administration and the US courts over immigration policy.</p>

            <p>An American citizen, Bachir Atallah, claims he and his wife were detained for hours by US border agents upon returning from a trip to Canada without explanation. Atallah alleges mistreatment, including being handcuffed and placed in a cell, while his wife was held separately. He says agents demanded his phone passcode and never informed him of the reason for their detention. CBP officials deny the accusations, stating that they acted according to established protocols.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen visited Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, and reported that he was "traumatized" at CECOT, a supermax prison. Van Hollen recounted Abrego Garcia's experiences, including being handcuffed and shackled during transport and being placed in a cell with 25 other prisoners. The senator criticized the Trump administration's actions and emphasized the importance of due process. He stated the administration is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without a semblance of due process.</p>
