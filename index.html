          <p>Shares for apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant surge after President Donald Trump praised its new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The "great jeans" campaign had previously faced some criticism for its slogan, but the president's social media post appeared to reverse a recent stock slump and generate a new wave of interest. This event highlights the unpredictable influence of political figures on market dynamics and brand perception in a polarized cultural landscape. The company's stock value increased by over 15% following the public comment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has sparked a significant cultural and political debate, amplified by President Trump's praise and the revelation of her Republican voter registration. This article analyzes the potential career risks for a rising celebrity who becomes entangled in the nation's polarized political discourse. Experts suggest that while politicians benefit from such endorsements, celebrities, particularly those not yet firmly established, risk alienating large segments of their audience. The situation underscores the challenges public figures face when navigating their personal affiliations in a highly charged environment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Nancy Mace has officially announced her candidacy for the Republican gubernatorial primary in South Carolina, cementing her political transformation from a moderate to a staunch Trump loyalist. Her campaign announcement heavily featured her pro-Trump credentials and focused on conservative platform points like cutting taxes and opposing "woke ideology" in schools. Mace, who once criticized Trump's role in the January 6th Capitol attack, now enters a crowded primary field where she will compete with other conservatives for the former president's endorsement and the support of his base.</p>

The project has proven highly useful, assisting stranded drivers and allowing children to call home from a local library. With a state-wide ban on cell phones in schools approaching, demand for these public phones is expected to grow.</p>

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK. This move gives Reform UK its first-ever PCC and signals a continuing shift of energy on the right of British politics. Speaking alongside Reform leader Nigel Farage, Matthews stated a need to remove "wokeness" from the justice system. The defection has been criticized by his former Conservative colleagues, who argue he should call a by-election as he was elected on a Tory platform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 10,000 hotels across Europe have joined a class-action initiative to seek damages from the online travel platform Booking.com. The complaint, supported by the industry association HOTREC, alleges that hotels incurred significant financial losses between 2004 and 2024 due to the platform's "best-price" clauses. These clauses, which were recently deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice, prevented hotels from offering lower prices on their own websites. Booking.com has stated it has not yet received a formal lawsuit and rejects the claims.</p>

          <p>Eurostar services are facing significant disruptions, including numerous delays and cancellations, due to a power supply failure on a high-speed rail line in northern France. The issue has forced trains between London and Paris to be diverted onto slower routes, with delays of up to five hours expected to continue throughout the day. Eurostar has advised passengers to postpone their travel if possible during what is a peak travel period due to school holidays. This incident follows other major disruptions on the same line in recent months.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a party in downtown Los Angeles early Monday morning has resulted in two deaths and six injuries.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has endorsed a controversial migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a model for future state-run centers. She stated that similar facilities are being considered near airports in other states to increase the efficiency of detaining and deporting unauthorized migrants. The Florida site, a makeshift camp surrounded by swampland, has faced legal challenges and criticism from attorneys over its legality and alleged inhumane conditions, which officials have denied. The strategy aims to expand detention capacity and serve as a deterrent.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled fighter jets over the weekend after seven civilian aircraft violated the temporary restricted airspace over President Trump's property in Bedminster, New Jersey. In one instance, a fighter jet fired flares to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane safely out of the area. NORAD has urged pilots to be vigilant about checking for flight restrictions, known as NOTAMs, which are routinely issued when the president is at his New Jersey or Florida residences. The command noted that ignorance of the restrictions is not a valid defense.</p>

          <p>Top military medical experts are raising alarms that the improper and overuse of tourniquets on the battlefield in Ukraine is leading to tens of thousands of unnecessary amputations and other severe complications. A retired senior U.S. Navy medical officer estimates as many as 75,000 amputations resulted from tourniquets being left on for too long, often for injuries that did not require them. Due to prolonged evacuation times in Ukraine, the standard Western military protocol for tourniquet use is proving tragic. Experts are now urging a shift in training to emphasize other bleeding control methods first.</p>

The mockery attempts to frame the defection as unserious and link his interest in the "fantastical" to what they characterize as Reform's unrealistic policy plans. Matthews himself focused his announcement on fighting crime and "wokeness."</p>

          <p>Financial experts predict that interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) will likely remain stable through August, as the Federal Reserve has held the federal funds rate steady amid fluctuating inflation data. While some banks have already begun to slightly lower their rates in anticipation of future cuts, the general outlook is for continued high yields for savers. Experts advise that short-term CDs currently offer the most competitive rates, as banks are hesitant to lock in high rates for long terms.

While avoiding politics has long been an unwritten rule for service staff, the current climate has created palpable tension, forcing workers to act as diplomats to manage the vibe. Some progressive-leaning establishments have faced backlash, while those perceived as conservative-friendly have dealt with protests and hiring difficulties. Many legacy bars actively shut down political talk to maintain a neutral space for all patrons.</p>
