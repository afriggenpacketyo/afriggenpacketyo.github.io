          <p>The U.S. private sector experienced an unexpected contraction, losing 33,000 jobs in June, a stark contrast to the 100,000 increase economists had forecasted. This report from payroll firm ADP marks the first monthly decrease since March 2023, raising concerns about the economy's underlying strength despite recent stock market highs. The data showed significant losses in service sectors like business services and healthcare, while goods-producing roles saw some growth. This has prompted some economists to revise their expectations for the upcoming federal labor statistics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Oregon federal judge has mandated the immediate release of a 24-year-old Mexican migrant who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for nearly a month after an asylum hearing. The judge ruled the detention was unlawful, as the man's temporary legal status, or parole, remains valid until July 2025. The migrant, who sought asylum claiming threats from a violent cartel, was arrested after his asylum case was dismissed, a decision he is appealing. The court found ICE violated due process by failing to justify the arrest, reinforcing that executive agencies must follow established law.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since April has spurred a surge in refinancing activity among homeowners. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance a home loan increased by 7% last week and were 40% higher than the same period last year. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, encouraging homeowners, particularly those with larger loans, to seek savings. However, the decline in rates did not significantly impact home purchase applications, which remained nearly flat, suggesting ongoing uncertainty in the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has officially closed after the Trump administration gradually dismantled it, citing wasteful spending. The agency's remaining programs have been absorbed by the State Department. The closure drew strong condemnation from former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, who highlighted the agency's critical role in global health, including a successful AIDS program. A recent study published in the Lancet medical journal warned that the aid cuts could lead to over 14 million additional deaths by 2030, a figure a State Department official disputed.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech company Honor has launched its new foldable smartphone, the Magic V5, positioning it as a direct competitor to Samsung's market-leading devices. Honor is emphasizing the phone's slim design, which is between 8.8mm and 9mm when folded, and a large battery capacity exceeding 6000 milliampere-hours on a special edition. The device will initially be sold in China before a likely international release later this year. While analysts praise the phone's features, they note Honor faces challenges in brand recognition and distribution compared to Samsung, which is expected to announce its own new foldable next week.</p>

The mission, launched in January, aims to verify technologies for on-orbit refueling and life extension of satellites, which could reduce costs and mitigate space debris.

          <p>The US Northeast is experiencing a significant increase in its tick population this year, leading to a higher risk of tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease. Data indicates a rise in blacklegged ticks, the percentage carrying the disease, and emergency room visits for tick bites. Scientists attribute the expansion of tick habitats to the warming climate, as ticks become active in temperatures above 40Â°F. Experts advise the public to take precautions such as wearing protective clothing and using insect repellent, but not to avoid the outdoors entirely. The trend highlights the public health consequences of a changing climate.</p>

          <p>Heathrow Airport is contemplating legal action against National Grid following a report that a fire causing a major shutdown was due to a known, unfixed fault. An investigation found that National Grid was aware of a moisture issue at its North Hyde electrical substation since 2018 but repeatedly deferred maintenance. The power failure in March led to thousands of canceled flights and significant financial losses for the airport and airlines. Energy regulator Ofgem has launched its own investigation into National Grid, which stated it has since taken action and that such events are rare.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed a freeze on the shipment of some air defense systems and precision-guided weapons to Ukraine, a decision made after a Department of Defense review of U.S. military stockpiles. Officials stated the move was to put "America's interests first," but did not specify which systems were affected or the duration of the pause. A top Ukrainian official denied that the U.S. will end its supply of air defenses, stating negotiations are ongoing. The halt in aid has raised concerns in Kyiv that it could embolden Russia, which continues its intense aerial attacks across Ukraine.</p>

          <p>British prosecutors are considering bringing additional charges against former neonatal nurse Lucy Letby, who is already serving 15 life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others. Cheshire Police have submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service following an investigation into other deaths and collapses at hospitals where Letby worked, including Liverpool Women's Hospital. Letby has always maintained her innocence and recently submitted an application to have her convictions reviewed. The CPS will now independently assess the evidence to determine if new criminal charges should be brought.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major legislative package, which narrowly passed the Senate, is now facing a crucial vote in the House, where it could significantly alter U.S. health and gun policy. The bill aims to cut federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act by about $930 billion over a decade, which the CBO estimates would cause millions to lose health insurance. This is primarily achieved by adding stricter work and paperwork requirements. The administration is also pursuing regulatory changes to relax gun laws, such as extending the validity of background checks and allowing gun dealers to destroy records sooner.

          <p>A new analysis of fossils has provided an explanation for the 5-million-year period of lethal heat that followed the 'Great Dying' mass extinction 252 million years ago. Researchers found that the extinction event, caused by massive volcanic eruptions, led to the collapse of tropical forests worldwide. This widespread loss of vegetation crippled the planet's ability to absorb and store carbon, causing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to remain extremely high long after the initial volcanism ceased. The study warns this could be a historical parallel for a potential climate tipping point if modern rainforests were to collapse.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major budget bill, having narrowly passed the Senate, now faces a challenging path in the House of Representatives, where Republican factions are divided. Conservative fiscal hawks in the House Freedom Caucus have threatened to vote against the bill, citing CBO estimates that it could add $3.3 trillion to the national deficit. Other moderate Republicans are concerned about deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid, which could impact their constituents. These sticking points create uncertainty as House leadership pushes for a vote to meet the president's July 4th deadline for the bill's passage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump's Budget Bill Proposes Deep Medicaid Cuts, Threatening Coverage and Rural Hospitals</h2>

          <p>President Trump's legislative bill, recently passed by the Senate, includes sweeping changes to U.S. health care that could leave millions uninsured and endanger rural hospitals. The bill proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade, primarily by instituting strict work requirements and capping state provider taxes that help fund the program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates these changes would cause 11.8 million people to lose health insurance by 2034. While the administration claims the cuts target waste, critics argue they break promises and will devastate vulnerable communities. (not investment advice)</p>
