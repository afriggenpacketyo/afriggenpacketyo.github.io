        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The leader of Unite, one of the UK's largest unions, has stated that Labour is failing to defend working people, leading to a potential disaffiliation. This conflict intensified after the union suspended Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner’s membership over her handling of bin strikes in Birmingham, a move Labour called a "silly stunt." Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, is under pressure to reconsider the union's £1.2 million annual funding to the party, citing a disconnect between Labour's decisions and the interests of its working-class members.</p>

          <p>The England Lionesses are embracing a new team mantra, "proper English," to drive their performance in the Euro 2025 tournament. The phrase, signifying fight, desire, and resilience, was reinforced after a disappointing opening loss to France. Players and manager Sarina Wiegman have highlighted the mantra's role in their subsequent convincing victory over the Netherlands. This identity combines traditional English tenacity with Wiegman's more dynamic, possession-based tactical approach, aiming to blend grit with modern football flair.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, during a visit to North Korea, has warned the United States, South Korea, and Japan against establishing a security partnership aimed at Pyongyang. The warning comes as the three allies expand trilateral military exercises in response to North Korea's advancing nuclear program. Lavrov affirmed Russia's support for North Korea's nuclear development, while his counterpart, Choe Son Hui, described the Russia-North Korea relationship as an "invincible alliance" and reiterated unconditional support for Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A woman gained significant attention on Reddit after sharing her frustration with her sister, who had moved in with her two young children following a breakup. The sister consistently slept late, leaving the responsibility of feeding the children to the Reddit poster. After several days of catering to the children's specific breakfast demands, the woman refused to cook separate meals, telling them to ask their mother instead. This led to a confrontation where she told her sister to "wake up and take care of your... kids," sparking a family cold shoulder and widespread support online.</p>

          <p>A new immigrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is criticized in this article as a prime example of the Trump administration's performative cruelty. The camp, reportedly erected for its dramatic effect, has been plagued by inhumane conditions, including a lack of sanitation, maggot-infested food, and inadequate shelter, leading to at least one hospitalization. The author argues that the facility's stylized, cinematic branding is designed to mask the real-world horror of a concentration camp where human lives are at severe risk from disease, neglect, and the elements.</p>

While the film's director, James Gunn, has noted this theme, the movie itself focuses on universal values of kindness and personal choice.

          <p>The Western Xia Mausoleums, an ancient tomb site located near Yinchuan in northwest China, have been officially inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The site, dating back to the Western Xia dynasty (1038–1227), covers 40 square kilometers and includes nine imperial mausoleums and over 270 subordinate tombs. UNESCO's World Heritage Committee recognized the site as a significant testament to the cultural fusion and interaction among diverse traditions along the ancient Silk Road. The dynasty was ruled by the Tangut people, an ancient branch of the Qiang ethnic group.</p>

Taylor described the performance as smart and controlled, a contrast to their previous two brawls. After the conclusive win, the 39-year-old champion said she was proud of the history she and Serrano made together but remained noncommittal about her future in the ring.</p>

          <p>This article provides a list and explanation of the tariff rates President Trump has threatened to impose on various countries starting August 1. The policy, communicated through letters to foreign leaders, represents a radical and unpredictable approach to trade, with significant rates proposed for major trading partners. The letters leave room for negotiation, suggesting rates could be lowered if countries remove their own trade barriers. This follows a 90-day "pause" on global tariffs, during which the administration has so far only finalized one new deal, with the United Kingdom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly floods in Texas, this article provides a guide for residents across the U.S. on how to assess their home's flood risk, a growing concern due to climate change. It advises asking about a property's flood history, as disclosure laws vary widely by state and are often minimal for renters. The guide directs readers to resources like FEMA's official maps and real estate sites that incorporate flood data. It also explains the importance of flood insurance, noting that many FEMA maps are outdated and do not account for future climate-driven risks.</p>

          <p>While visiting flood-ravaged Texas, President Trump praised the work of state and local officials, emphasizing a model where the federal government plays a supporting role. The visit occurred against a backdrop of questions regarding his administration's plans to overhaul the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and place more responsibility on states. Trump dismissed questions about the adequacy of flood warning systems as being from an "evil person," instead focusing on the heroism of the response. The administration has not clarified if it will proceed with plans to potentially eliminate FEMA in its current form.</p>

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the deadly Air India crash in Ahmedabad has found that the plane's engines were starved of fuel moments after takeoff. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau reveals that both fuel control switches moved to the "cut-off" position, leading to a total loss of power. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why they cut the fuel, with the other denying doing so. The Boeing 787 crashed less than a minute after departure on June 12, killing 260 people on board and on the ground.</p>

          <p>A farm worker was critically injured after falling approximately 30 feet from a greenhouse roof during a federal immigration raid at a cannabis farm in California. The United Farm Workers union initially reported the worker had died from the injuries. The raid, which led to the arrest of about 200 undocumented migrants, sparked protests and clashes with federal agents. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson stated the man was not being pursued by law enforcement when he fell.

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is maintaining a careful distance from the Trump administration, balancing ideological alignment with potential political risks at home. While sharing nationalistic and anti-immigration views, the party is wary of President Trump's unpopularity among many French voters and the negative impact of US tariffs on its blue-collar base. Party leaders like Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella are pursuing a strategy of "vote maximalization" for the 2027 elections, which requires appearing moderate enough to attract mainstream voters, making an overly close association with Trump's MAGA movement a liability.</p>

          <p>A German education minister's suggestion to implement a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a fierce debate across the country. The proposal, which would cap such students at 30-40% per class, was floated as a way to improve educational outcomes. However, it has drawn sharp criticism from school principals, who cite practical impossibility, and from student bodies, who argue it is discriminatory and stigmatizing. Critics contend the real issue is a lack of German language skills, not immigrant background, and that resources should be targeted at underfunded schools instead.</p>

While PSG is heavily favored after a dominant win over Real Madrid, Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, is expected to stick to his positional, possession-based style rather than "park the bus." The article notes that both clubs have embraced a model of building aggressive, fresh, young teams, though PSG is further in its development. A victory for Chelsea would provide immense validation for their long-term strategy.</p>
