          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery has successfully raised £3.8 million to acquire Dame Barbara Hepworth's sculpture, "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red." The 1943 wooden carving, which was at risk of being exported, will now remain in the UK for public display in the artist's home city. The campaign received widespread support, including over 2,800 public donations and significant grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund, ensuring the rare piece remains accessible to the nation.</p>

This meeting with his Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, is a significant step towards normalizing relations, which deteriorated after deadly border clashes in 2020. Both nations are reportedly making progress on resolving the boundary dispute and are taking steps to restore stability, including resuming pilgrimages and discussing the re-establishment of direct flights, signaling a cautious thaw in relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.</p>

          <p>China's urban unemployment rate for individuals aged 16-24 reached an 11-month high of 17.8% in July, as a record number of college graduates entered a challenging job market. This increase halts a four-month period of decline and underscores the economic pressures facing the country's youth. In response, Beijing has initiated several support campaigns, including career guidance and training opportunities, to assist graduates and other young job-seekers in navigating the difficult employment landscape and securing stable positions.

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a prison sentence for sexual assault set a new precedent for pay-per-view spectacles. The fight against Peter McNeeley, which lasted only 89 seconds, shattered revenue records and demonstrated that a massive, celebrity-fueled event could be more profitable than a competitive contest. This article analyzes how the heavily promoted mismatch established a lucrative blueprint for modern combat sports, paving the way for events like Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor and the rise of influencer boxing, cementing Tyson's enduring, albeit complex, public appeal.</p>

          <p>The algorithms driving platforms like TikTok and Instagram are accelerating language evolution, creating a new lexicon known as "algospeak." In an interview, author Adam Aleksic explains how the need for engagement and the virality of memes are fundamentally rewiring how people, especially younger generations, communicate. This phenomenon has led to the rapid creation and adoption of new words and phrases, changing the structure and speed of linguistic trends in ways that are distinct from previous eras of language development.</p>

          <p>The United Nations reports that a record 383 aid workers were killed in global conflict zones in 2024, a significant increase from the previous year. Nearly half of these deaths, over 180, occurred in Gaza during the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, with Sudan following as the second-deadliest location. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher condemned the attacks and the lack of accountability, calling the trend a "shameful indictment of international inaction" and demanding better protection for civilians and humanitarian personnel in crisis areas.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues EU's Inaction on Gaza Stems from Systemic Racism</h2>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Shada Islam argues that the European Union's failure to take meaningful action against Israel's conduct in Gaza is rooted in structural racism and a lingering colonial mentality. The article contrasts the EU's strong response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its paralysis over Gaza, suggesting that Palestinian lives are devalued. The author calls for a reckoning within the EU to confront these biases, which she contends undermine the bloc's democratic values at home and its credibility as a defender of international law on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Nicole Collier reports being locked inside the Texas Capitol after she refused to accept a mandatory escort from the Department of Public Safety. The escorts were mandated for all House Democrats who had previously left the state to break quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting bill. Collier states she is exercising her right to resist what she views as an unjust measure and continues to oppose the proposed congressional maps, vowing to challenge them in court.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a preliminary injunction for USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson, effectively ending their hopes of playing this season. The players had sued the NCAA, arguing that its five-year eligibility rule violated antitrust laws by limiting their NIL earning potential. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility rule was not commercial in nature and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny, dealing a blow to the players and their teams, who were counting on their contributions.</p>

          <p>A 67-year-old man convicted of the 1982 abduction and murder of an insurance office worker in Bay County is scheduled to be executed in Florida. The execution would be the state's 10th in 2025, setting a new annual record since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The inmate's attorneys have filed last-minute appeals with state and federal courts, arguing issues such as organic brain damage were not adequately considered, but previous appeals have been denied, and the execution is expected to proceed as planned.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 4-3 walk-off loss to the last-place Colorado Rockies, largely due to two critical defensive miscues by right fielder Teoscar Hernández. The disappointing performance prompted a post-game meeting between shortstop Mookie Betts, manager Dave Roberts, and president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. The conversation has fueled speculation about potential defensive adjustments, including possibly moving the six-time Gold Glove-winning Betts back to the outfield to shore up the team's defense as they head toward the postseason.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has handed a partial victory to the Trump administration in a lawsuit concerning a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The judge dismissed a claim regarding which immigration court had jurisdiction, ruling it moot after the government clarified the matter. However, claims alleging that the facility violates detainees' First Amendment rights by restricting confidential access to lawyers will proceed, with the case being transferred to a different federal court.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted to achieve this goal. He repeated unsubstantiated claims that the practice is inherently corrupt and susceptible to widespread fraud. However, legal experts and the U.S. Constitution indicate that the authority to regulate federal elections rests with the states and Congress, not the president, making it highly unlikely that such an executive order would be legally enforceable.</p>
