          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 13:43:19 EDT</div>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase the average monthly benefit by approximately $56. This adjustment, based on the Consumer Price Index, is intended to help the program's 71 million beneficiaries keep pace with inflation. However, advocacy groups for older Americans express concern that the increase is insufficient, particularly as it may be largely offset by projected hikes in Medicare Part B premiums. Critics argue the inflation metric used doesn't accurately reflect the higher healthcare and housing costs faced by seniors, a demographic experiencing a rising poverty rate.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier strike group to the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility to enhance counter-narcotics efforts in Latin America. This deployment significantly increases the U.S. military presence in the region, joining eight other vessels already on station. The move follows a series of recent U.S. strikes against vessels allegedly operated by drug traffickers, including one operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. This escalation is part of a broader administration campaign to disrupt illicit drug smuggling routes in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell in October, marking the third straight month of decline as Americans grow more pessimistic about the economy. Persistent inflation and a weakening labor market are cited as the primary drivers for the dip in confidence, with affordability becoming a key issue for many households. The survey indicated that inflation expectations are rising again, remaining a top concern for consumers. The ongoing government shutdown was noted to have had a minimal direct impact on sentiment so far, unlike previous shutdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

Jeffries praised Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to representing all New Yorkers. The endorsement from the high-ranking Democrat follows similar backing from Governor Kathy Hochul, consolidating establishment support around the progressive candidate. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, continues to lead in polls against rivals including former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p>

          <p>Construction for President Trump's planned $300 million ballroom at the White House has resulted in the removal of at least six trees, including two historic magnolias commemorating Presidents Harding and Roosevelt. Satellite imagery also reveals that the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, adjacent to the East Wing, has been leveled to accommodate the project. The work has reportedly proceeded without consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission, a body established to preserve the integrity of government buildings. The White House has stated it intends to submit plans but has not yet done so, despite demolition being underway.</p>

          <p>A police manhunt has been launched in the United Kingdom for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been sentenced to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex. He was supposed to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation upon completion of his sentence. The Prison Service has initiated an urgent investigation into the error, and an officer has been removed from discharge duties pending the outcome of the inquiry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose at a 3.0% annual rate in September, coming in slightly below economists' expectations and keeping the door open for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. A 4.1% monthly jump in gasoline prices was a primary driver of the increase, though core inflation, which excludes food and energy, also registered a 3.0% annual gain. The data, which is the only official economic report being released during the government shutdown, provides the Federal Reserve with a final key data point before its upcoming meeting.

Under IRS regulations finalized in 2024, most heirs, such as adult children, who are subject to the 10-year account depletion rule must now also begin taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs). Previously, it was unclear if yearly withdrawals were necessary during the 10-year period. Failure to take these RMDs starting next year could result in an IRS penalty of up to 25% of the amount that should have been withdrawn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI company Anthropic and Google have officially announced a multi-billion dollar cloud partnership that will give Anthropic access to as many as one million of Google's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This major commitment is designed to provide the massive computing power Anthropic needs to train and run its advanced AI models, like Claude. The deal highlights Anthropic's multi-cloud strategy, as it also utilizes chips from Amazon and Nvidia to optimize for cost and performance. The expansion is driven by Anthropic's rapid growth, with its annual revenue run rate now approaching $7 billion.</p>

          <p>Research is shedding light on how some dangerous viruses, including Ebola, Marburg, and Zika, can hide within the human body long after a patient has recovered. These viruses can linger in 'sanctuary sites' such as the eyes, testes, and brain, which are protected from the immune system, allowing viral RNA to persist undetected in blood tests. This phenomenon explains how new Ebola outbreaks have been traced back to survivors of previous ones, who can unwittingly transmit the virus through sexual contact. Scientists are now focused on developing treatments, like small-molecule drugs, that can penetrate these sites and completely eradicate the hidden virus.</p>

          <p>Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is renewing calls for the European Union to permanently end the practice of seasonal clock changes, arguing that daylight savings time no longer makes sense. Sanchez claims the biannual time shift offers negligible energy savings while negatively impacting public health and daily life. The European Commission has favored abolishing the practice since a 2018 survey showed 85% of Europeans were against it, but member states have been deadlocked over whether to permanently adopt summer or winter time. An EU transport commissioner confirmed the Commission is conducting a new detailed study to support a final decision.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of gambling scandals, including a new FBI bust involving an NBA player allegedly fixing his performance, is fueling calls to ban or restrict proposition bets. Prop bets, which are wagers on specific player statistics rather than the game's final outcome, are particularly vulnerable to manipulation by a single athlete. Since the legalization of sports betting in 2018, numerous scandals in the NBA, MLB, and NCAA have been linked to these types of wagers. While leagues have monitoring systems, the ease with which a player can influence a prop bet has led some lawmakers and officials to argue for their elimination to protect the integrity of sports.</p>

Proctor had claimed Glenn was reaching for his partner's gun, but video footage and a Police Commission report contradicted this account.

          <p>Recent volatility in the price of gold, which saw it drop from a record high before partially rebounding, is causing uncertainty for investors. While historically seen as an inflation hedge, the relationship is complex, with gold prices also influenced by Federal Reserve interest rate policies, the strength of the dollar, and overall market sentiment. With U.S. inflation hitting 3% in September, the article advises that gold can serve as a portfolio diversifier but should not be the sole protection against rising prices. Experts suggest that real yields—interest rates adjusted for inflation—are a key indicator for gold's appeal. (not investment advice)</p>
