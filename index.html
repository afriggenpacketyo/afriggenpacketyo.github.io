          <p>The UN Security Council has authorized a significantly larger multinational force for Haiti, transforming the current Kenya-led mission into a "Gang Suppression Force" with up to 5,500 personnel. This move aims to curb escalating gang violence that has paralyzed the economy and threatened the nation's future. The resolution, co-sponsored by the U.S. and Panama, was welcomed by Haiti's transitional presidential council as a decisive turning point. This international effort seeks to restore stability and protect the terrorized Haitian population.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit accusing Zillow of an unlawful agreement with Redfin, alleging Zillow paid $100 million to eliminate Redfin as a competitor in the home rental advertising market. The FTC claims Redfin agreed to cease competing in multifamily property ads for nine years and transition customers to Zillow, harming renters and property managers. Zillow and Redfin spokespersons deny the allegations, stating their partnership benefits consumers by expanding access to listings.

This article outlines severe consequences, including up to 4 million federal employees, including military personnel, working without pay, and potential closures of national parks and Smithsonian museums. Essential services like Social Security and Medicare payments would continue, but new grants and some FDA safety reviews could halt. The economic impact could be significant, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating $3 billion in lost activity from the 2018-2019 shutdown.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced a $500 million settlement deal with Harvard University to resolve disputes over alleged federal civil rights law violations concerning Jewish and Israeli students. This agreement, though not yet confirmed by Harvard, follows Trump's previous actions of cutting federal funding and attempting to ban international student enrollment. A federal judge recently ruled against the administration's unlawful termination of $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard. This article highlights the administration's broader strategy of withholding funds from universities over various political issues.</p>
