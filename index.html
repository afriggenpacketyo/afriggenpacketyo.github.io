        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50% at a U.S. Steel factory outside Pittsburgh, aiming to boost the local steel industry and national supply while decreasing reliance on China. Trump also mentioned a $14 billion investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, although he stated that he had yet to see or approve the final deal. The tariff increase is intended to ensure the survival of US Steel, with Trump stating that at 50%, foreign steel producers "can no longer get over the fence." The announcement comes amid ongoing court battles over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, but the tariffs on steel and aluminum were untouched by the lawsuit. (not investment advice)</p>

The probe, launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, targets asteroid 2016 HO3, also known as 469219 KamoÊ»oalewa, to bring back samples within two years. This mission is part of a larger 10-year plan to expand China's presence in space, including the Tianwen-3 Mars sampling return mission in 2028 and the Tianwen-4 mission to Jupiter. The asteroids are chosen for their stable orbits and potential to offer clues about Earth's formation, but NASA is restricted from cooperating with CNSA due to the Wolf Amendment.</p>

Authorities have warned people to avoid the area due to the potential for bee swarming, and roads in the region have been closed. Bee experts and the local community of beekeepers are working to rescue as many bees as possible, with the goal of allowing them to return to their hives and find their queen bee. Honeybees play a crucial role in pollination and food production, and experts have noted the decline of bees due to insecticides, parasites, disease, climate change, and lack of food supply.</p>

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Executive Order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. The administration had sought to overturn an injunction issued by a U.S. judge in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities, questioning the legality of the administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce.

          <p>Law enforcement officials are warning that social media sites are increasingly used for illicit drug sales, with emojis serving as code names for drugs. An investigation in Lompoc, California, revealed that a 15-year-old student provided edible cannabis products to other students, leading to the discovery of an Instagram account used to sell various drugs to underage children. Emojis were used in payment transactions and messages to identify the drugs being sold. Officials are urging parents to monitor their children's social media accounts for suspicious activity and educate them about the dangers of illegal drug activity.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed reinstating an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, requiring them to prove their assets total less than $2,000. The proposal aims to address rising costs in the Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services programs. The "asset test" would include evaluating a person's primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund. Health and disability advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing it would result in people losing coverage and force vulnerable populations into poverty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing challenges in its tourism sector due to rising prices and heavy traffic. Higher prices have led to a decrease in casual trips, although convention traffic remains steady. The average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip has increased, while hotel occupancy has slightly decreased. The city is also seeing fewer international visitors, who tend to stay longer and spend more, and months of construction and road closures are causing traffic congestion. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of events, and officials remain optimistic about the city's resilience.</p>
