        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>English forward Marcus Rashford hopes to make his loan spell at Barcelona permanent when his agreement from Manchester United concludes this summer. Barcelona possesses an option to sign him for £28 million, a fee significantly lower than the £40 million United would seek from other clubs. The 27-year-old, whose United contract extends to 2028, appears to have no future at Old Trafford under current head coach Ruben Amorim, prompting his desire for a change. Rashford, who has scored five goals in 12 games for Barcelona, believes he is greatly benefiting from the change of scenery and the club's rich history, finding new enjoyment in his football career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is currently debating whether to use frozen Russian assets to pay war reparations to Ukraine, a move that significantly impacts millions of Russian private investors. These individuals, many of whom are not on Western sanctions lists, find their securities held in European depositories like Euroclear and Clearstream, effectively trapped. Reclaiming these assets is nearly impossible without expensive legal assistance, with costs often far exceeding the average frozen amount. Zhanna Nemzova advocates for the release of these private assets, proposing a simplified procedure and a thorough inventory to address the issue and prevent disproportionate hardship on ordinary citizens.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the termination of all U.S. trade negotiations with Canada, accusing the Ontario provincial government of fraudulently using a "FAKE" Ronald Reagan TV advertisement. This ad, which featured edited remarks by Reagan criticizing tariffs, was deemed by Trump as an egregious attempt to interfere with a pending U.S. Supreme Court decision on the legality of his tariff policies. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute also confirmed the ad misrepresented Reagan's 1987 address and was used without permission. This abrupt termination significantly escalates existing trade tensions between the two neighboring countries, threatening economic stability.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes reached their highest level since 2022 in September, with new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing a 0.5% monthly rise. Between July and September, sales were 0.9% higher than the previous three months, indicating a robust quarter. Favorable weather conditions significantly boosted clothing sales, while non-store retailers, primarily online shops, experienced a 3.8% increase, driven by strong tech sales coinciding with the iPhone 17 launch and demand for gold. These ONS figures are vital for government policy and Bank of England decisions, despite recent criticisms regarding data quality and budget constraints. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese scholar has urged China and the United States to halt the escalating weaponization of their trade relationship, emphasizing the critical need for self-restraint from both sides. This appeal comes as the world's two largest economies prepare for a new round of negotiations designed to de-escalate recent tensions. Beijing's expanded export controls on rare earth elements, vital for hi-tech goods, are widely viewed as mirroring Washington's restrictions on chips. The scholar stressed that stopping the search for new economic weapons against each other is paramount, with rare earths expected to be a central topic in upcoming US-China trade talks.</p>

          <p>The Caerphilly by-election yielded an extraordinary result, profoundly humbling Westminster's major parties as Labour attracted just 11% and the Conservatives a mere 2% of the vote. This left the two dominant forces with only 13% combined. Instead, the contest was a race between Plaid Cymru, whose candidate Lindsay Whittle secured a historic victory after decades of attempts, and Reform UK, which took a solid second place with 36%. This outcome signals a potential turning point for Labour in Wales, with Plaid Cymru now aiming to become the main governing party after next May's Senedd elections.</p>

          <p>China's top leaders concluded the Fourth Plenum by pledging to vigorously boost domestic consumption and strengthen self-reliance in advanced technologies, including quantum computing and hydrogen power, over the next five years. The strategy aims to balance consumption with "effective investment," indicating a focus on consumption-related sectors like urban planning, public services, and elderly care, rather than direct cash handouts. While reaffirming a 5% growth target, some experts are cautious about achieving significant consumption growth without direct income increases or fiscal commitment.

          <p>England's pharmacy network has dwindled to its smallest size in 20 years, with the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) reporting closures in about 90% of council areas over the last three years.

This crisis is severely impacting the most deprived communities, making it difficult for vulnerable patients to access crucial pharmacy advice and timely medicines, with Liverpool and York being among the worst-affected areas. The NPA emphasizes the urgent need for a funding uplift to avert further closures and ensure the NHS's Ten Year Plan does not falter.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal agent deployment to San Francisco, following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and appeals from prominent tech company bosses. Mayor Lurie assured the president of substantial progress in public safety, citing a nearly 30% citywide crime reduction and historic lows in violent crime and homicides. The mayor also spoke with Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, receiving assurances on tackling the fentanyl crisis. This reversal de-escalates tensions between federal and local authorities, with city leaders united behind local-driven public safety initiatives.</p>

          <p>The Senate has failed to advance a Republican-backed bill aimed at ensuring essential federal workers receive pay during the ongoing government shutdown. This legislative deadlock highlights the persistent political gridlock in Washington, with significant implications for hundreds of thousands of federal employees and their families. The inability to pass such a bill means that these critical workers, who continue to perform their duties without immediate compensation, will face continued financial uncertainty and hardship. This article underscores the broader challenges in resolving the shutdown and its cascading negative effects on the economy and public services, exacerbating national instability.</p>

          <p>"No Kings" rallies in Washington D.C. and Portland featured protesters in inflatable animal costumes, including frogs, lobsters, and unicorns, as a tactic to counter negative Republican narratives portraying them as "Hate America" radicals. Inspired by a viral incident in Portland, activists Jordy Lybeck and Brooks Brown organized "Operation Inflation" to undermine claims of a "war zone." A Princeton professor noted that such absurdist humor can be an effective tactic against perceived autocrats by making government responses seem farcical. This article highlights the creative use of non-threatening imagery to publicize political messages and change protest optics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown threatens to halt food assistance for nearly 42 million Americans, including children, seniors, and veterans, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by November 1. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins warned of funding depletion, blaming Democrats, while food aid advocates argue the agency has legal obligations and contingency reserves to continue payments. Additionally, a separate nutrition program for 7 million pregnant women and new parents (WIC) is also at risk of running out of money. States are preparing for increased demand at food banks, but expanded charity cannot fully offset the billions in federal funding loss.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by the end of the weekend, posing a severe threat to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The storm is expected to bring days of heavy rain, with forecasts ranging from 8 to 14 inches, and potentially trigger life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides across these nations. Melissa's slow movement over very warm Caribbean waters is contributing to its anticipated significant strengthening. Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are in effect for affected areas, while the mainland United States is not expected to experience major impacts from this developing weather system.</p>

The friendly game coincided with a star-studded farewell ceremony for two-time World Cup winner Alex Morgan, who retired last year. Despite Rose Lavelle scoring early for the US, Portugal rallied with goals from Diana Gomes and Fatima Pinto. US coach Emma Hayes attributed the team's disconnected play to a nearly four-month layoff, highlighting the need for more practice ahead of upcoming World Cup qualifications.

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the contentious mayoral race, just two days before early voting begins. This endorsement marks a significant mending of fences between the two, who previously exchanged harsh words during the campaign for Gracie Mansion. Adams, who dropped out of the race, expressed anger at not running but prioritized the city's future, criticizing Democratic Socialist nominee Zohran Mamdani's rent freeze promise as a "lie." Cuomo, running as an independent, also blasted Mamdani as divisive and inexperienced, framing the election as a crucial fight against socialist policies.</p>

The methods included X-ray tables, hidden cameras, pre-marked cards, and special contact lenses, as detailed by prosecutors. Victims, referred to as "fish," were lured by the presence of "face cards" like former NBA players, only to be fleeced out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game.
