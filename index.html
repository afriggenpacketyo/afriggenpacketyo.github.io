          <h2>SpaceX Starship Experiences Uncontrolled Reentry After Reaching Space</h2>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, achieved a significant milestone by reaching space during its ninth test flight, but it ultimately experienced an uncontrolled reentry. The spacecraft successfully lifted off from Starbase, Texas, and surpassed previous flights that ended in explosions. However, a propellant leak during its journey caused it to spin out of control, preventing the collection of crucial heat shield data. Despite the setback, SpaceX considers the flight a valuable learning experience, with Elon Musk planning to accelerate the pace of future tests. The mission also flew a booster that had been used for an earlier test flight, but it was lost as three engines lit up to simulate a landing over the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

Ohtani's two-run shot extended the Dodgers' lead, marking his fastest time to reach 20 home runs in his major league career. The Guardians briefly closed the gap with a three-run homer, but the Dodgers extended their lead with runs in the sixth and eighth innings, capped by Max Muncy's three-run homer in the ninth. Ohtani finished the game with one hit, two RBIs, two walks, and two strikeouts, contributing to the Dodgers' series lead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a major challenge facing hyperloop technology: turbulence and vibrations at high speeds. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) found that minor imperfections in the track could cause violent vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. Through supercomputer simulations and prototype tests, they developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, transforming "extremely severe bumps" to levels deemed "pronounced, but not unpleasant." This advancement could potentially salvage vacuum-tube maglev technology and addresses concerns about ride comfort in high-speed transportation systems.</p>

          <p>SpaceX conducted the ninth test flight of its Starship rocket, which launched successfully from Starbase, Texas, but encountered issues after reaching its suborbital trajectory. An apparent propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin and re-enter Earth's atmosphere in an uncontrolled manner. SpaceX confirmed that the Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" and is expected to have mostly burned up over the Indian Ocean. Despite the failure to complete the mission's objectives, the flight provided valuable data for future improvements, with the company planning to continue its iterative engineering approach.</p>

The affected properties have been left vacant and are deteriorating, causing heartache and financial strain for former residents. More than £68 million had already been spent on the project, and the figure continues to rise due to insurance and council tax payments on the unneeded properties. The Crichel Down rules stipulate that the properties should be offered back to the owners, but the families do not wish to return to the dilapidated homes.</p>

          <p>President Trump will issue a full pardon to reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of evading taxes and defrauding banks of over $30 million. Trump called their treatment "pretty harsh" and stated that they will be "free and clean." The Chrisleys were found guilty of financial fraud and tax evasion, with Todd receiving a 12-year prison sentence and Julie a seven-year sentence. The pardon is another instance of Trump using his clemency power to address what he perceives as the political weaponization of the justice system.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced his disappointment with the price tag of the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House, which was heavily backed by President Trump. Musk stated that the bill increases the budget deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The legislation, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boost border security spending, but is projected to increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034. Musk's comments put him at odds with Trump, who has championed the spending package.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed US embassies to stop scheduling appointments for student visas as it prepares to expand social media vetting of applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the pause would last "until further guidance is issued," citing the need for increased social media screening for student and foreign exchange visas. This decision follows the Trump administration's actions against several universities, accusing them of enabling antisemitism and upholding discriminatory admissions policies.

          <p>The California Interscholastic Federation is altering its competition rules at this weekend's state track and field championships, allowing more girls to participate amid controversy over a trans student-athlete's involvement. The federation said it was extending access for more “biological female” athletes to participate in the championship meet. The change, announced after Donald Trump posted on social media about the athlete's participation, comes amid a nationwide debate over transgender youth rights. The rule change may be the first attempt nationally by a high school sports governing body to expand competition when trans athletes are participating.</p>
