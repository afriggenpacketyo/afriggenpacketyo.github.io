        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Victims of the January 6th Capitol riot and Democratic lawmakers are accusing the Trump administration of hypocrisy in its response to recent protests in Los Angeles, contrasting it with the administration's stance on the Capitol attack. Critics point to the aggressive rhetoric used against those accused of assaulting police in Los Angeles, compared to the defense of individuals who attacked officers on January 6th. Some are noting the disparity in Trump's decision to quickly deploy the National Guard to California while delaying their deployment during the Capitol siege. This perceived double standard risks further inflaming tensions and undermining faith in the justice system.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's suggestion that he would support arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom, White House official Tom Homan clarified that there is currently "no intention to arrest" Newsom. The comments came amid escalating tensions between the Trump administration and Newsom over the handling of protests in Los Angeles, which were triggered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions. Newsom has criticized the administration's response and filed a lawsuit challenging the deployment of National Guard troops. Homan stated that arrests would only be considered if officials were found to have impeded ICE operations.</p>

          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei stated that while the company's Ascend chips lag behind U.S. counterparts by a generation, state-of-the-art performance is still attainable through tactics like stacking and clustering. In an interview with People's Daily, Ren emphasized China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, ample electricity, and a developed information network. The comments come as the U.S. ramps up restrictions on China and Huawei, with new guidance suggesting that the use of Ascend chips anywhere could violate American export controls.

These rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not yet done.

          <p>China's next generation stealth fighter jets, the Chengdu J-36 and the Shenyang J-50, have garnered significant attention since their initial sightings. The J-36, nicknamed the ‚ÄúGingko leaf,‚Äù features a distinctive diamond shape derived from its delta wing platform design, which reduces air drag. The aircraft is tailless, which is essential for radar evasion, and includes trailing edge control surfaces and split flaps for enhanced maneuverability. These features underscore China's advancements in military aviation technology and its efforts to develop cutting-edge stealth capabilities.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" and says it entrenches outdated gender stereotypes. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach. Introduced in 2003, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The report highlights how paternity leave has not changed noticeably since its introduction more than two decades ago.</p>
