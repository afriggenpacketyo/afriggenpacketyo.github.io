          <p>Seventeen statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions are suing the Trump administration over grant application requirements that prohibit promoting "gender ideology" or running diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or prioritizing people in the country illegally. The groups argue that these requirements, initiated through executive orders, create an "impossible position" that could jeopardize their ability to provide critical services such as rape crisis centers and battered women's shelters. The coalitions contend that complying with the grant terms would force them to make statements antithetical to their core values and expose them to legal risks. The lawsuit highlights the tension between federal funding and the autonomy of organizations dedicated to combating violence against women and sexual assault.</p>

This move aims to strengthen Eaton's aerospace business amid growing global defense spending, with Ultra PCS projected to generate $240 million in sales in 2025. Meanwhile, Abbott Laboratories received a hold-equivalent rating from Leerink Partners, citing a full valuation, while also gaining Canadian government approval for a rapid blood test to assess suspected concussions. The Abbott test will be used at MotoAmerica races this year, and the company is also facing scrutiny over baby formula claims. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey on group-based sexual exploitation in England and Wales reveals failures at all levels to address these crimes, with authorities often blaming the children being abused rather than providing help. The report highlights a lack of action over the years, describing it as "denial" or collective "blindness," particularly regarding the ethnicity of perpetrators. The government has accepted the report's recommendations, including better data collection on ethnicity and a national inquiry, but the key question remains whether these recommendations will be put into practice to bring about meaningful change for survivors. The report underscores the need for a shift in perspective and a commitment to protecting vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) experienced a significant increase after Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target, citing optimism about the chipmaker's latest product announcements. The analysts anticipate a "snapback" for AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter, following the bulk of charges related to new U.S. license requirements for semiconductor exports to China. AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including a full-server rack called Helios. The company's CEO Lisa Su introduced the products alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who expressed enthusiasm about the advancements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 could yield substantial monthly payments, but these payouts depend on factors like gender, life expectancy, and the interest rate environment. A 65-year-old male might receive approximately $2,590 per month, while a female of the same age could receive around $2,482. Joint-life annuities offer lower monthly payments, around $2,246, as they continue payments to the surviving spouse.

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that authorities have "shied away from" addressing the ethnicity of individuals involved in grooming gangs. The report found that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of grooming gang perpetrators, hindering accurate assessments at a national level. However, local data from three police forces indicate a disproportionate number of suspects from Asian ethnic backgrounds. The report concludes that ignorance and fear of being seen as racist have led organizations to turn a blind eye to abuse, prompting calls for mandatory data collection and research into the drivers of group-based child sexual exploitation.</p>
