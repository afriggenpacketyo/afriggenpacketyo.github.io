          <p>Habibur Masum has been convicted of murdering his wife, Kulsuma Akter, in a knife attack in Bradford, UK. He stabbed her over 25 times in the street while she was pushing their infant son in a pram. The court heard that Ms. Akter had been living in a women's refuge after Masum previously threatened her with a knife. Despite his guilty plea to manslaughter, the jury found him guilty of murder, stalking, and other charges after a trial revealed his premeditated actions.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Tianjin, Chinese Premier Li Qiang projected confidence in the nation's economic growth, citing a 5.5% increase in the first quarter. However, this optimism contrasts with on-the-ground realities of weak domestic consumer spending, evidenced by empty shopping malls and struggling businesses. Experts suggest China's export-led growth model is no longer viable, and the economy faces significant challenges from over-investment and fierce competition in sectors like the auto industry.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced that planned cuts to disability and sickness benefits will now only apply to future claimants, protecting current recipients. This U-turn, which may cost up to Â£3 billion, was made to ensure the bill's passage and follows intense internal party pressure and criticism.</p>

The ultra-wealthy, with a net worth over $30 million, are increasingly making all-cash purchases and remain active, viewing real estate as a stable asset. In contrast, the less affluent but still wealthy are acting more cautiously due to borrowing costs, leading to an increase in price reductions on listings.

          <p>Leicester City has confirmed the departure of manager Ruud van Nistelrooy by mutual agreement, more than two months after the club's relegation from the Premier League. The Dutchman's tenure saw the team win just five of 27 matches, finishing the season in the relegation zone. The prolonged nature of his exit has drawn criticism, and the club now faces the challenge of finding a new manager while also dealing with a potential points deduction for financial rule breaches.</p>

The surge in activity suggests an immediate positive impact from the de-escalation of the tariff war, easing supply chain pressures for the region.</p>

          <p>Following significant pressure from health organizations and Democratic lawmakers, the Trump administration has restored federal funding for HIV prevention and surveillance programs. The move came after advocates warned that proposed cuts would reverse years of progress and lead to a spike in new infections.
