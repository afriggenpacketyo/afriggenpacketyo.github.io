          <p>Chloe Childress, a counselor at Camp Mystic and recent high school graduate, is being mourned after she was killed in the catastrophic Texas floods. Remembered by her school as a compassionate leader who made others feel valued, she was set to attend the University of Texas at Austin. Childress was one of at least 11 campers and counselors from the girls' camp who died when the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. The devastating flooding across central Texas has resulted in at least 78 fatalities, with a significant number occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>The Christian girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, became a scene of tragedy when the Guadalupe River flooded, killing the camp's director and several young campers. Survivors describe terrifying moments as they were evacuated by military trucks, witnessing destruction and first responders pulling girls from the water. The article details the heroism of counselors and raises questions about the placement of camps so close to the river. With more rain forecasted, the search for 10 missing girls and a counselor is shifting from a rescue to a recovery mission.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration is preparing to notify trading partners that they must finalize new trade agreements or face the reinstatement of higher tariffs starting August 1. Officials stated that dozens of letters will be sent to countries, particularly those with which the U.S. has a significant trade deficit, to apply maximum pressure. While some deals have been reached with nations like the U.K. and Vietnam, many remain unresolved. Experts suggest the deadline might be extended for countries negotiating in good faith, but the move signals a more aggressive U.S. trade posture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A paintball facility owner in Jonestown, Texas, has vowed to keep his business running despite suffering significant damage from what he calls the worst flood in 20 years. The business owner, David Abboud, described the unprecedented speed and height of the floodwaters that ravaged the area. Meanwhile, Texas officials have warned of another potential "wall of water" and urged residents to evacuate low-lying areas as more rain is expected. The death toll in Kerr County alone has reached 68, including 28 children, with search efforts for missing campers ongoing.</p>

          <p>The recent round of indirect ceasefire talks in Doha between Israel and Hamas has concluded without a significant breakthrough, according to a Palestinian official. Mediated by Qatar and Egypt, the discussions failed to bridge the gaps between the two sides' demands. Hamas continues to insist on a permanent end to hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal, conditions previously rejected by Israel. As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to meet the U.S. president, he maintains his commitment to releasing hostages and eliminating Hamas, creating uncertainty about a potential compromise.</p>

          <p>In Wyoming, a group of ranchers continues the Green River Drift, the longest-running cattle drive in the U.S., a 70-mile journey pioneered by their ancestors 125 years ago. The annual drive allows ranchers to move thousands of cattle to high-country summer pastures, a tradition born out of the necessity to grow winter hay in the valley. Today, the ranchers face modern challenges, including protected predators like wolves and grizzly bears, government regulations, and the pressures of development. Despite the hardships, they are determined to preserve their land and this iconic symbol of the American West.</p>

          <p>The Savannah Bananas, a popular exhibition baseball team known for their entertaining "Banana Ball," are also using their platform to support a cause close to the owners' hearts: foster care.

At each game, the organization honors a local foster family on the field, often to a standing ovation from the crowd. The Coles believe they have a responsibility to use their platform to raise awareness about the needs of children in the foster care system.</p>

          <p>A "60 Minutes" team shared their experience reporting on the U.S. Coast Guard's elite surfmen, which involved filming in a treacherous inlet known as the "Graveyard of the Pacific." Before boarding a 47-foot lifeboat, correspondent Bill Whitaker had to test a waterproof dry suit in the frigid Columbia River. The crew was briefed on the possibility of a "rollover," where a wave could flip the boat 360 degrees, and had to be clipped in for safety.

While the state now has a sophisticated suite of powers, including better intelligence sharing and new laws, challenges remain.
