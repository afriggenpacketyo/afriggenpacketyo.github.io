        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed his dissatisfaction with Vladimir Putin following Russia's recent large-scale drone attack on Ukraine, calling Putin "absolutely crazy." This marks a rare instance of Trump criticizing the Russian leader. In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attributed Trump's remarks to emotional overload but affirmed Putin's decisions were crucial for Russia's security. The drone attack, consisting of 355 drones and nine cruise missiles, was the largest since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022 and resulted in injuries and casualties. The article highlights the escalating conflict and the international reactions to Russia's actions. Optimism for a quick resolution remains low due to the continued attacks and political tensions.</p>

          <p>This article explores the often-overlooked role of personal finance in contributing to the climate crisis. It highlights how pensions, investments, and banking decisions can inadvertently support the fossil fuel industry. Shifting to a sustainable pension provider can significantly reduce an individual's carbon footprint, dwarfing the impact of lifestyle changes like reducing air travel or adopting a vegetarian diet. The piece also discusses green finance alternatives and the challenges of "greenlaundering," while emphasizing the power of citizens to demand financial sector regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering temporarily accepting international students from Harvard University should the U.S. government bar them from studying there. The university previously launched a program in 2022 to host researchers and students affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing research facilities and accommodation. This potential acceptance follows the Trump administration's move to end Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, although a U.S. federal court has issued a temporary injunction pending review of the legality of the decision.

          <p>German lawmakers from the Social Democrats (SPD), a party in the ruling coalition, are calling for a halt to supplying weapons to Israel due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Adis Ahmetovic emphasized that German weapons should not contribute to humanitarian disasters or violate international law. The German government historically made an exception for Israel due to Germany's responsibility for Israel's security after the Holocaust, but the lawmakers argue this exception is no longer justified given the current situation in Gaza and the West Bank.

          <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's attacks on Harvard University, viewing them as part of a larger pattern of political weaponization against those who displease the administration. The Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's certification to host international students, prompting a lawsuit from the university. This action is seen as retaliation for Harvard's refusal to comply with demands regarding "viewpoint diversity" among faculty and students. The author argues that these attacks instill fear and signal a broader effort to suppress dissent and target foreigners, ultimately undermining academic freedom and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Age of Diagnosis," argues that modern medicine's eagerness to diagnose and screen patients is creating problems, with doctors often too quick to label conditions. Author Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan advocates for "slow medicine," emphasizing the importance of building relationships with patients, monitoring symptoms, and exercising caution before assigning a diagnosis. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatments and anxiety. O'Sullivan acknowledges the need to balance technological advancements with a more measured approach to clinical practice, ensuring that diagnoses are made with careful consideration and understanding of the patient's story.</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a gubernatorial candidate, is facing criticism for accepting campaign contributions from the oil industry, despite his past record as an environmental champion. Villaraigosa defends his stance by arguing that California drivers could see gas prices soar due to policies that led to refinery closures. He advocates for an "all-of-the-above" approach to energy, including oil and gas, to balance environmental goals with economic concerns. This shift has upset some environmental groups, who view his acceptance of oil industry donations as a violation of a pledge he made in a previous campaign.</p>

          <p>An Austrian court has overturned the perjury conviction of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who had received an eight-month suspended jail sentence for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. The allegations centered on his role in appointing executives for the ÖBAG state holding company. Kurz argued that he was interrupted during his testimony and that the judge was biased. Despite this acquittal, Kurz remains under investigation for corruption in a separate case. He resigned as chancellor in 2021 amid allegations of financial impropriety.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision of a world divided into spheres of influence dominated by the United States, China, and Russia. His praise of leaders like Putin and Xi, combined with his criticism of allies and potential withdrawal of U.S. troops, hint at a desire to reshape global power dynamics. While some analysts view this as a strategic approach, others argue it stems from a lack of a coherent foreign policy vision.
