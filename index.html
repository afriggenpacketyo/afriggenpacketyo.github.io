          <p>Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins voiced support for a recent interest rate cut but expressed a cautious outlook on future reductions, citing persistent inflation risks. While acknowledging a recent shift in the balance of risks, she stated that a "modestly restrictive" policy remains appropriate to ensure price stability without significantly weakening the labor market. Her remarks, made in a highly uncertain economic environment, suggest that further easing of monetary policy this year will be heavily dependent on incoming economic data.</p>

Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, countered that they are ready for a bipartisan solution but will not support a bill that compromises healthcare protections for Americans. The ongoing stalemate highlights the deep partisan divisions preventing the passage of a continuing resolution needed to keep federal agencies operational.</p>

          <p>New research from the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice reveals that over 400 people across 16 states have been charged with pregnancy-related crimes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The majority of these cases, concentrated in states like Alabama and Oklahoma, involved allegations of child endangerment or neglect, often related to substance use during pregnancy. The report suggests these prosecutions are advancing the legal concept of "fetal personhood," which grants legal rights to fetuses and potentially criminalizes pregnant individuals' actions.</p>

          <p>While weakening over the Atlantic, Hurricane Humberto is expected to generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast, the Bahamas, and Bermuda over the next several days. The storm, now a Category 2 hurricane, reached Category 5 strength over the weekend before beginning to lose intensity. The National Hurricane Center is advising beachgoers to remain cautious as the storm's powerful swells impact coastal areas, even as its center remains offshore.</p>

          <p>American colleges and universities are confronting a mounting financial crisis, described as a "perfect storm" of falling enrollment, higher operating costs, and reduced revenue streams. A shrinking population of college-age students, combined with a potential drop in full-tuition-paying international students due to stricter visa policies, is placing many institutions at risk of closure or merger. Experts warn that less competitive and tuition-dependent schools are particularly vulnerable, which could lead to program shutdowns and fewer educational opportunities for students.</p>

          <p>Imelda has strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and is projected to move away from the Bahamas and the U.S. mainland, with a forecast track heading toward Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane watch for Bermuda, as the storm is expected to continue intensifying. While not a direct threat to the U.S. coast, swells generated by Imelda, along with Hurricane Humberto, are contributing to life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>According to sources close to the negotiations, Hamas and other Palestinian factions are leaning toward accepting a 20-point ceasefire plan presented by President Trump. The proposal includes a swift ceasefire, the release of all remaining hostages and numerous Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of an interim administration in Gaza overseen by an international board. The plan has received public support from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Palestinian Authority, and a coalition of key Muslim-majority nations, signaling a potential breakthrough to end the war.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of AI data centers by tech giants like OpenAI, Meta, and Alphabet is colliding with a severe shortage of skilled labor in the construction and electrical trades. With an aging workforce and not enough new workers entering the field, the U.S. faces a projected shortfall of nearly half a million construction workers in 2025 alone. This labor deficit threatens to cause significant budget overruns and project delays for the critical infrastructure needed to power the artificial intelligence industry's growth.</p>

          <p>According to an Iranian foreign ministry official, the United States is deporting 120 Iranian nationals as part of a bilateral agreement, a rare case of cooperation between the two countries which lack formal diplomatic ties. The individuals, most of whom reportedly entered the U.S. illegally, are being returned to Iran via Qatar. This action is part of President Trump's broader immigration crackdown and is expected to be the first phase of a deal that could see up to 400 Iranians deported.</p>

          <p>Former prosecutors and legal scholars are describing President Trump's public and private efforts to secure an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey as a "chilling" slide toward authoritarianism. While Trump succeeded in getting Comey charged, experts suggest his direct interference—including replacing a prosecutor who deemed the case weak—could taint the prosecution. Defense attorneys may argue the charges are a result of selective and biased political motivation, potentially undermining the case in court and highlighting a dangerous break from judicial independence.</p>

The cuts come as food prices continue to rise, placing immense pressure on food banks that are already struggling with increased demand and reduced supply.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the growing reliance on AI for therapy stems from a decline in the effectiveness of modern human therapy, which has shifted toward empty validation rather than building resilience. The author, a psychotherapist, argues that by avoiding challenging truths and discomfort, many therapists have stopped providing real guidance, creating a void that decisive-but-unethical chatbots are filling. The piece warns that this trend has made "bad therapy" scalable, and calls for a return to therapeutic practices that prioritize patient growth and accountability.</p>
