          <p>Widespread flash flooding has severely impacted the northeastern United States, with over 50 million people under flood watches. In New York City, the storm caused significant transportation chaos, including water pouring into subway stations and the closure of major expressways. New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency due to the heavy rainfall, which reached rates of 3 to 4 inches per hour in some areas. The extreme weather also led to thousands of flight cancellations and delays, particularly affecting East Coast airports.</p>

He advanced through the rounds with impressive hitting from both sides of the plate, pitched to by his father. The victory marks the second time a Mariners player has won the derby, following Ken Griffey Jr.</p>

          <p>A large-scale search and rescue operation is ongoing for Ralph Sawyer, a 52-year-old mountain biker who went missing in Oregon's Mount Hood National Forest. Sawyer, an experienced biker familiar with the terrain, failed to return from a trip on Friday. His car was later found with his cell phone inside, prompting a search involving dozens of personnel, ATVs, drones, and a helicopter. As of Monday, specialized units including an Air Force rescue team and K9s have joined the effort to locate him.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations and keeping it on track to meet the government's annual target of 5%. Despite this, the growth rate slowed from the previous quarter, and indicators like retail sales and real estate investment showed signs of weakness. Industrial output, however, expanded more than anticipated. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged an unstable external environment and insufficient domestic demand, while economists remain cautious about future headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

They argue that the 2024 law, which aims to make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, infringes on their property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The claimants contend the changes could result in significant financial losses and impact their ability to invest in communities and charitable giving.

Consequently, stars from major shows like 'Strictly Come Dancing,' 'The Traitors,' and 'The Apprentice' do not appear.

          <p>The Massachusetts assisted-living facility where a fire killed nine people was scheduled for a recertification review this fall and had previously been cited for non-compliance. An onsite visit in October 2023 found that Gabriel House was not in compliance with some state regulations, primarily related to missing documentation for continuity of care and employee records. The facility submitted a correction plan and was certified to operate until November 2025. A preliminary investigation suggests the fire's cause was likely electrical or mechanical, not intentional.</p>

          <p>Former Major League Baseball pitcher Daniel Serafini has been found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2021 killing of his father-in-law, Robert Gary Spohr. Prosecutors argued the attack was financially motivated, stemming from a dispute over a ranch renovation project. Serafini was also convicted of the attempted murder of Spohr's wife, who survived the initial attack but later died by suicide. Security footage showed a hooded figure entering the home hours before the attack, and a second defendant has pleaded guilty to being an accessory. Serafini faces a potential life sentence.</p>
