          <p>Australia's central bank has unexpectedly maintained its policy interest rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' predictions of a rate cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time to assess incoming data to ensure inflation is sustainably returning to its target range. This decision came despite recent figures showing inflation at a four-year low, prompting disappointment from government officials who highlighted the country's progress against the rising cost of living. The Australian dollar strengthened following the announcement, which occurred amid a broader economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Colombian President Gustavo Petro asserts that governments have a duty to oppose Israel's actions in Gaza and its disregard for international law. He criticizes the passivity of many nations and highlights actions taken by Colombia, South Africa, and Malaysia as examples of holding Israel accountable. Petro announces that Colombia and South Africa will co-chair an emergency conference on July 15 to deliberate on concrete legal, diplomatic, and economic measures to halt the conflict. He frames the choice as one between defending legal principles or allowing the international system to collapse under power politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has reported a 15.1% drop in sales for the three months leading to June, attributing the decline partly to the threat of new U.S. tariffs. The company temporarily paused shipments to the U.S. after the Trump administration announced plans for a 25% tariff on car imports, which was later negotiated down for a limited number of vehicles. The sales dip was also impacted by the planned discontinuation of older Jaguar models as the brand shifts towards new electric vehicles. North American wholesale sales fell by 12.2%, highlighting the significant impact of trade policy on the automaker.</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move reportedly designed to pressure U.K. regulators to accelerate its London listing application. The Singapore-based retailer has faced significant regulatory hurdles and scrutiny in both the U.S. and U.K. over allegations concerning its labor practices and supply chain transparency. Having previously shifted its focus from New York to London due to political pushback, this dual-track approach signals the company's determination to go public despite ongoing challenges. The filing seeks to gain approval from both Hong Kong and Chinese regulators.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized its plan to impose new tariffs on a wide range of countries but has postponed the implementation date to August 1.

The move provides a new window for negotiations, which Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed would continue.

A 2016 study, which cost $50,000, recommended a comprehensive system costing nearly $1 million, but the project stalled due to funding concerns.

In response to China's market dominance, new exploration and development projects are underway globally, including an Australian-listed company's project in Brazil and a U.S. partnership to explore deposits in Kazakhstan. While these initiatives signal a global pushback, analysts note that China still holds a strong position in the critical minerals sector.

More than 4,000 people have been evacuated from the area on the island of Flores, and dozens of flights to nearby Bali were canceled.

          <h2>TSA Reportedly Ends Mandatory Shoe Removal at Some US Airports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:43:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has begun phasing out the mandatory requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. Sources confirm the change is being implemented at airports including Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia, with travelers at other major hubs also reporting they were not required to remove footwear. The no-shoes rule was officially implemented nationwide in 2006, following the 2001 attempted bombing by Richard Reid. This policy shift marks a significant change in airport security procedures for travelers who are not enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles City Council Advances Policy to Curb 'Renoviction' Evictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted unanimously to advance a permanent ordinance aimed at preventing landlords from evicting tenants under the guise of a substantial renovation, a practice known as a "renoviction." The new rule would only permit such an eviction if the landlord has a government agency order to vacate the unit to address code violations. The city is also developing rules that would require landlords to pay for relocation expenses or provide comparable temporary housing for tenants during legitimate, necessary remodels. This move aims to close a loophole that tenant advocates say has been used to unjustly displace renters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This unprecedented loosening of travel restrictions has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings. The policy, which has been progressively rolled out to most of Europe, parts of Asia, and Latin America, is designed to make travel to China less cumbersome. While U.S. citizens are not on the 30-day list, they can use a more restrictive 10-day transit option.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: What Caused the Deadly Texas Floods and Why Was There No Warning?</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which killed at least 104 people, were caused by a confluence of factors, including moisture from a tropical system and the region's natural flood-prone geography. The deluge occurred when many were asleep, with the Guadalupe River rising 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the lack of a timely evacuation order or a robust warning system, which survivors say never came. While local officials cite the unprecedented nature of the "100-year flood," questions remain about preparedness and the failure to implement a warning system that had been previously discussed.</p>

          <p>An armed man wearing tactical gear was shot and killed by law enforcement after he opened fire on a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas. The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Lewis Mosqueda, injured two police officers and a border patrol employee before being neutralized. Authorities stated the suspect fired dozens of rounds at the building and agents, who returned fire. The motive for the attack is still under investigation. The suspect's vehicle was found with the phrase "Cordis Die" spray-painted on it, a reference to a revolutionary movement in the video game "Call of Duty: Black Ops II."</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was nominating U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The meeting was the first between the two leaders since recent military strikes involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran. Discussions also touched on the war in Gaza, with Netanyahu suggesting Palestinians who wish to leave the territory should have the "free choice" to do so, a comment that drew criticism. The meeting occurred as indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas resumed in Qatar, though significant obstacles to an agreement remain.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of market expectations. The South Korean tech giant is struggling to keep pace with competitors in the high-demand market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential for artificial intelligence systems led by Nvidia. The disappointing earnings guidance is attributed to losses in its chip foundry business and a muted performance in HBM, where competitor SK Hynix has secured a key supplier role with Nvidia. Samsung's shares fell following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>
