          <p>The counting of ballots has commenced in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to select a successor for the current head of state, Michael D Higgins. Early tallies indicate strong support for independent candidate Catherine Connolly over her main rival, Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. However, officials have also noted a significant number of spoiled ballots in the initial counts. The election has been marked by concerns over potentially low voter turnout, which might not surpass the record low set in the 2018 presidential contest.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations are taking place across Germany in response to controversial comments made by Chancellor Friedrich Merz regarding urban migration and deportations. Critics, including members of his own coalition, have condemned his remarks as divisive, while a recent survey indicates that a majority of the public agrees with his statements. The chancellor later clarified he was referring to migrants without legal residence permits who do not comply with German laws. The incident has ignited a national debate on immigration policy and social cohesion.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected offers for renewed talks with the U.S. regarding the country's nuclear program, stating that any coerced agreement is unacceptable. Following the reinstatement of all UN sanctions, Iran has also suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Analysts suggest that Tehran is attempting to project strength while carefully avoiding actions that could provoke a military strike from Israel or the U.S. The leadership appears to be in a dilemma, balancing defiant rhetoric with pragmatic crisis management.</p>

          <p>A fact-check has determined that widespread claims circulating on social media about Germany canceling its Christmas markets for 2025 are false. While a few isolated local markets have been called off due to specific issues like renovations or rising security costs, the vast majority of Germany's iconic markets are scheduled to proceed as planned. The viral misinformation appears to stem from a single, unreliable source that used sensationalist language and lacked credible evidence. Major cities like Berlin, Cologne, and Dresden are already preparing for their annual festivities.</p>

          <p>Russia is grappling with a severe and long-standing demographic crisis characterized by a shrinking and aging population. Factors such as economic instability, high mortality rates, emigration, and the war in Ukraine have exacerbated the decline, undoing previous gains in birth rates. In response, the Kremlin is pushing a conservative agenda promoting "traditional family values," which includes new laws restricting abortion access and banning the promotion of a "child-free ideology." Critics argue these repressive measures are unlikely to solve the underlying demographic problems.</p>

          <h2>China Imposes Sanctions on South Korean Shipbuilding Group Hanwha</h2>

          <p>Beijing has announced sanctions against several subsidiaries of the South Korean industrial conglomerate Hanwha, effectively banning them from conducting business in China. The Chinese government alleged that Hanwha had supported a U.S. investigation into Chinese shipbuilding competitors, which led to new port fees. This move targets a key player in the U.S.-South Korea initiative to rebuild America's shipbuilding capacity, as Hanwha recently acquired a major shipyard in Philadelphia as part of that strategic partnership.</p>

          <h2>Donors to Trump's White House Ballroom Project Include Corporations with Federal Interests</h2>

          <p>A review of donors for President Trump's $300 million White House ballroom reveals that many are corporations with significant business interests before the federal government. The project, which involves the demolition of the historic East Wing, is being privately funded by tech giants, defense contractors, and cryptocurrency firms. This has prompted conflict-of-interest concerns, as the donations could be perceived as attempts to gain favor or influence policy, regulatory decisions, and the awarding of lucrative government contracts from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>In a significant development in the New York City mayoral race, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani. The endorsement from one of the most powerful Democrats in the country provides a major boost to Mamdani's campaign just before early voting begins. This move helps unify the Democratic party behind Mamdani, who had previously secured support from the progressive wing and now gains the backing of the party establishment, consolidating his position against opponent Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to visit South Korea for the first time since 2014, a move that diplomatic experts interpret as a significant step toward mending strained relations. While major breakthroughs are not anticipated, the visit itself is seen as a "symbolic restart" after years of tension over issues like the deployment of the U.S. THAAD missile defense system. The trip aims to restore a more cooperative tone, harkening back to a period of stronger economic and diplomatic ties between the two neighboring countries.</p>
