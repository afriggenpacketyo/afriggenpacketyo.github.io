          <p>Terence Crawford delivered a career-defining performance, moving up two weight classes to defeat Canelo Álvarez and become the first male boxer in the four-belt era to be an undisputed champion in three divisions. Crawford expressed that the victory was no surprise to him, stating he knew he would win when the contract was signed, and his confidence was evident throughout the bout. In a show of respect, Álvarez praised Crawford as a great fighter and even suggested he was "way better than Floyd Mayweather," while Crawford maintained that he is simply the greatest of his own era.</p>

          <p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, representing families of Israelis held by Hamas, has publicly identified Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the primary obstacle to securing a hostage release and peace agreement. The group claims that every time a deal appears close, Netanyahu sabotages it, citing the recent Israeli strike in Qatar as the latest example of his government prioritizing military action over negotiations. The families argue that the Prime Minister's excuses are merely a tactic to prolong his hold on power, a delay they say has already cost the lives of dozens of hostages.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Israel for a two-day visit as Israeli military operations intensify in northern Gaza, resulting in further Palestinian casualties and the destruction of residential buildings. The visit aims to seek clarity on Israel's path forward following a controversial strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar, which has strained relations with the U.S. and complicated ceasefire negotiations. Rubio's trip also serves as a show of support for Israel, which faces growing international isolation and a UN debate on Palestinian statehood, an issue Prime Minister Netanyahu strongly opposes.</p>

          <p>Israel's offensive in Gaza and the mobilization of 60,000 additional reservists have reignited a contentious national debate over mandatory military service for the Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) community. A long-standing exemption for full-time religious students, dating back to 1948, is now under intense scrutiny as the military faces a soldier shortage and the burden on secular reservists grows. Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition is facing potential collapse over the issue, with Haredi parties protesting any move toward conscription while others advocate for universal service as a matter of security and equality.

          <p>Researchers in China claim to have developed a new artificial intelligence-driven anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system that could significantly alter naval combat dynamics. The system reportedly reduces a submarine's chance of escaping detection and attack to a mere 5 percent. Unlike traditional search methods, this AI commander synthesizes data from a wide array of sources, including sonar buoys, underwater sensors, radar, and even oceanographic conditions like temperature and salinity. This allows it to create a comprehensive, real-time picture of the undersea environment to more effectively track and neutralize submarine threats.</p>

          <p>Following a push from former President Trump, Republican-led states like Missouri and Texas are redrawing their congressional maps to secure electoral advantages ahead of the midterms. This has initiated a national redistricting race, with Democrats in states like California threatening to counter with their own partisan maps, escalating concerns about gerrymandering. The practice, while often legal for political gain, is being challenged for potentially diluting the voting power of minority groups, an issue the Supreme Court is set to review. These efforts highlight a strategic battle to control the U.S. House, which is crucial for advancing the president's agenda.</p>

The criticism follows Mandelson's recent dismissal after emails revealed he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced jail for sex offenses.

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom brings him to the homeland of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who emigrated from the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in the early 20th century. The article explores the deep irony of Trump's own family history, as his mother was part of the "chain migration" phenomenon that his administration has actively sought to curtail. Her story is a classic "rags to riches" tale of leaving a life of hardscrabble poverty for opportunity in America, a narrative that contrasts sharply with the President's current hardline immigration policies. Despite his roots, Trump's visit will be confined to England amid security concerns.</p>

The center's CEO stated that relying solely on one foreign supplier is no longer viable and that they are currently testing GPUs from four different mainland Chinese manufacturers. While the initial phases of the supercomputing center use Nvidia chips, future procurement will likely include Chinese alternatives based on performance and cost.</p>

          <p>A seemingly ordinary father, Robert Andrews Jr., was exposed as the mastermind of a multi-million pound cocaine and heroin empire after police discovered incriminating WhatsApp messages on another gang leader's phone. The messages, where the two joked about becoming millionaires or cellmates, triggered a covert surveillance operation by Gwent Police. Officers then filmed Andrews Jr. conducting large-scale drug deals and cash handovers in secluded locations. His unassuming lifestyle, with no flashy cars or designer clothes, had kept him off the police radar until the digital trail led investigators directly to his industrial-scale operation.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Cannabis Use May Negatively Impact Female Fertility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 02:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Canadian study indicates that cannabis use can threaten female fertility by disrupting the development and genetic stability of egg cells. Researchers examined women undergoing IVF and found that those with detectable THC in their follicular fluid had a significantly lower rate of genetically healthy embryos, which can reduce the chances of a successful pregnancy. Laboratory tests on human eggs also showed that THC led to more errors in chromosome distribution and defects in the egg cell's structure. Experts not involved in the study called the findings significant but noted that more research is needed on dosage, consumption habits, and other influencing factors like age.</p>

          <p>China has issued four travel advisories for the Philippines in the past five months, citing an "unstable" public security situation and crimes targeting Chinese citizens. Analysts suggest these repeated warnings could negatively impact bilateral trade, investment, and educational exchanges if they deter Chinese nationals from traveling to the archipelago. The advisories come amidst heightened geopolitical tensions between the two countries over disputes in the South China Sea. While the warnings focus on security risks, they are seen as a tool that could also exert economic pressure on the Philippines.</p>

          <p>With President Michael D. Higgins's term ending, the race to become Ireland's next head of state is underway, with the election scheduled for October 24. So far, three candidates have secured the necessary nominations to appear on the ballot: independent Catherine Connolly, former Gaelic football manager Jim Gavin, and former cabinet minister Heather Humphreys. The main opposition party, Sinn Féin, has yet to decide if it will field its own candidate or endorse an existing one. Prospective candidates have until late September to gain the required backing from either parliament members or local authorities to enter the race.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of Nazi rule, the racist ideology of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, which stripped Jewish people and other groups of their rights and German identity, still echoes in modern German society. The article explores how the far-right AfD party's distinction between "real Germans" and "passport Germans" mirrors the Nazi-era division between "Reich citizens" and "state citizens." While Germany's constitution guarantees equality, activists argue that people with immigrant backgrounds still face discrimination and are not equally protected. The piece calls for a broader societal effort to embrace the positive aspects of migration and combat lingering prejudices.</p>

          <p>This archival article revisits the case of Amanda Knox, the American student who was arrested in 2007 for the murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, Italy. The piece details how her dream of studying abroad turned into a nightmare as she and her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, became central figures in a global media frenzy. It explores the controversial police investigation, including a 14-hour interrogation that led to a now-disputed confession, and the sensationalist press coverage that painted her as "Foxy Knoxy." The case raised significant questions about the Italian justice system and the treatment of suspects in high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>A growing number of teenage boys are engaging in intense fitness regimes, including "cutting and bulking," to achieve a ripped and muscular appearance, a trend heavily promoted on social media platforms like TikTok. This cycle involves consuming a massive calorie surplus to build muscle (bulking), followed by a strict calorie deficit to lose fat and increase definition (cutting). While some see it as a disciplined approach to health, sports nutritionists warn it can be harmful for adolescents, potentially affecting hormone health, growth, and leading to eating disorders like muscle dysmorphia. The article interviews several teens about their motivations and methods for getting "jacked."</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the CHP, is facing a critical legal and internal battle that could nullify its recent leadership change and plunge it into chaos. A court is set to rule on the legitimacy of the party congress that elected a new, reform-minded leadership under Ozgur Ozel, who was backed by Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The challenge comes from the party's old guard, loyal to former leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who claim the election was illegal. Observers suggest the legal turmoil could be a strategic maneuver by President Erdogan to weaken his most effective political rivals ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent airstrike against Hamas officials in Qatar has raised concerns in Turkey that it could also be targeted, given its leaders' support for Hamas and the presence of some Hamas officials in the country. A Turkish Defense Ministry official warned that Israel's "reckless attacks" could drag the entire region into a wider conflict. While relations were once strong, ties between the two regional powers have deteriorated significantly over the war in Gaza. Analysts believe an Israeli strike on a NATO member like Turkey is unlikely, but Ankara is bolstering its defenses amid rising tensions, particularly in Syria where both nations are competing for influence.</p>

The author contends that Trump's appeasement and encouragement of these leaders have exacerbated the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, pushing them toward dangerous escalation. The piece criticizes Trump's lack of leadership and integrity, suggesting his inaction in response to Russian drone incursions into Poland and Israel's strike in Qatar confirms his ineffectiveness.

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing a significant display of royal pageantry for President Donald Trump's state visit, aiming to use his well-known admiration for the monarchy as a diplomatic tool. The strategy involves a "royal schmooze-fest" with banquets, guards of honor, and personal attention from King Charles III and the Royal Family to create a positive atmosphere for discussing sensitive topics like trade and Ukraine. While the King and Trump hold contrasting views on many issues, analysts believe the carefully orchestrated visit could be a "diplomatic ace card" for the UK government. The event will be tightly controlled with no public procession due to security and protest concerns.</p>

          <p>The tradition of a simple hen or stag night has evolved into elaborate, multi-day destination events that are placing significant financial and social pressure on attendees. Many young adults report spending upwards of £1,000 on a single party, with costs for flights, accommodation, and activities quickly accumulating. The article explores the social dynamics at play, where guests feel pressured to attend to avoid upsetting friends or appearing cheap, even when they cannot afford it. This trend is leading to resentment and difficult conversations about budgets, as the "cost of friendship" continues to spiral for major life milestones.</p>
