          <h2>China's Rising Bond Yields Amidst Deflationary Pressures</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's government bond yields have recently risen, but economists attribute this to factors like currency stabilization and fund rotations, rather than reflation.  Persisting deflationary pressures, weak consumer sentiment, and low credit demand are expected to keep borrowing costs low.  This suggests that the recent yield increase might be temporary. <i>(not investment advice)</i><br></p>
