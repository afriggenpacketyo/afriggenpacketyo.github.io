          <p>Honda Motor's operating profit dropped by 50% in the first quarter, significantly missing analyst estimates due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a strengthening yen. Despite this, the company's revenue exceeded expectations, and it raised its full-year profit forecast, anticipating a weaker yen and a smaller-than-expected hit from tariffs. The report highlights the broader challenges facing Japanese automakers, including Nissan and Toyota, from ongoing trade headwinds with the United States, which remains a crucial market for their exports.

          <p>A BBC analysis reveals that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since President Trump's inauguration in January, despite his calls for a ceasefire. The escalation occurred even as the Trump administration twice paused military aid to Kyiv, a move critics suggest may have emboldened Moscow. Russia has significantly ramped up its domestic production of munitions, leading to the highest rate of aerial assaults in the war and placing immense strain on Ukrainian air defenses and civilian morale.</p>

          <p>Global plastic production is increasing at a rate that far outpaces recycling capabilities and is projected to triple by 2050, significantly worsening climate change. Derived almost entirely from fossil fuels, the manufacturing process is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, undermining the transition to clean energy. International negotiations to cap production have been consistently blocked by a small group of petro-states, including China and Russia, despite growing calls from over 100 nations and some businesses for reduction targets.</p>

Despite the surge, the company's stock has been declining due to softer U.S. sales, increased competition, and pressure from the White House to lower prescription drug prices. In response, Novo Nordisk has pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and sharpen its commercial focus under a new CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new series of MasterChef, even though its co-hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were recently sacked following a report that upheld misconduct allegations against them. The decision to broadcast the pre-filmed series has drawn criticism from broadcast unions and women's rights groups, who argue it sends the wrong message. The BBC defended the move, stating it was fair to the contestants who participated, though one chef was edited out at her own request.</p>

          <p>A leading economic think tank, NIESR, has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must raise taxes to cover a projected £41.2 billion shortfall in public finances to meet her own borrowing rules. The report suggests that without "a moderate but sustained increase in taxes," the government will be unable to fulfill its spending commitments and fiscal targets. This puts the Labour government in a difficult position, as it must choose between breaking its manifesto promises on taxes, cutting spending, or abandoning its fiscal rules.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the untapped tactical potential of throw-ins in football, arguing they are an overlooked resource largely unchanged since the 19th century. Citing Rory Delap's famous long throws for Stoke City as a rare example of innovation, it suggests teams could train specialists and develop complex set-plays similar to corners. A key advantage is that the offside rule does not apply to throw-ins, opening up creative attacking possibilities that most teams currently fail to exploit, often resorting to predictable and ineffective plays.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire NFL Network, NFL Fantasy, and distribution rights for the RedZone channel. In exchange, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, a move that strengthens the sports media giant's content offerings ahead of its planned direct-to-consumer service launch. The deal, which is still subject to final negotiations and regulatory approval, marks a significant partnership that would see ESPN owning and operating NFL Network while merging fantasy football platforms.</p>

          <p>A shortage of available rockets in China is creating a divide between national space projects and commercial ambitions, potentially forcing Beijing to prioritize one candidate to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. The state-backed Guo Wang network has recently seen a sharp increase in launches using Long March rockets, indicating it is receiving preferential access to launch capacity. This has left other aspiring satellite internet companies, like Shanghai's Qianfan, to seek launches from private rocket firms to deploy their own constellations, highlighting the resource constraints in China's space industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to place Washington, D.C., under federal control, citing "out of control" crime after a former government staffer was allegedly assaulted during an attempted carjacking. The incident involved 19-year-old Edward Coristine, with two 15-year-olds being arrested and charged. Trump's call to "FEDERALIZE this City" revives a contentious idea, as the U.S. Constitution grants Congress power over the district, but local self-rule has been in place since 1973, which Congress could potentially repeal.</p>
