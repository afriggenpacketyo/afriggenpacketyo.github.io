          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by immigration authorities, arguing his detention was based on his First Amendment-protected speech in support of Palestine. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri was unjustly punished due to his wife's past work with the Gaza foreign ministry and his father-in-law's connection with a deceased Hamas leader. The judge admonished the government for failing to provide evidence that Suri was not being retaliated against for his speech, emphasizing the chilling effect his detention has on free speech. The judge prohibited the government from redetaining him without a 48-hour notice to the court and his counsel.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has transformed into a prominent figure in Washington, joining multiple corporate boards and launching an exclusive private club called "Executive Branch." This club, with a $500,000 membership fee, has drawn criticism for potentially blurring the lines between private business interests and government policy, raising concerns about a pay-to-play culture. Trump Jr. defends his actions, stating he is a private citizen and businessman who has been earning a living for over 25 years. His involvement with companies has often led to a "Trump bump" in their stock prices, reflecting his influence and connections in the tech and finance sectors.</p>

          <p>The term "Nakba," meaning catastrophe, refers to the loss of the Palestinian homeland between 1947 and 1949, resulting in the displacement of around 700,000 Palestinians. Nakba Day, commemorated on May 15, marks the beginning of the Arab-Israeli war and serves as a day of protest against displacement. The UN recognizes the "right of return" for Palestinian refugees, but Israel rejects this, fearing it would compromise its identity as a Jewish state.

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted on federal charges for allegedly helping a Mexican man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, evade immigration officials. The indictment accuses her of concealing an individual from arrest and obstructing proceedings after she directed Flores-Ruiz out of her courtroom through a side door while federal agents waited to arrest him on battery charges. Dugan's lawyers have moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing her actions were protected by judicial immunity, but the Trump administration views the prosecution as a warning that no one is above the law. The case has sparked debate about immigration enforcement in courthouses and the separation of powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's announcement of another $450 million in grant cuts to Harvard University, President Alan Garber is taking a voluntary 25% pay cut. This move comes after dozens of tenured professors pledged to donate 10% of their salaries to support the university's financial resources as it contests the funding cuts. Harvard filed a lawsuit in April after the administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding, citing concerns over alleged anti-Semitism on campus and rejecting proposed conditions for resuming funding.</p>

          <p>Following a series of appearances as L.A. Phil conductor laureate, speculation is growing about Esa-Pekka Salonen potentially returning to the orchestra as music director. This comes after Salonen announced he would not renew his contract as music director of the San Francisco Symphony, citing a difference in vision with the board. Salonen's history-making tenure with the L.A. Phil and his rapport with the musicians make him a strong candidate, but it remains to be seen if he would accept such an offer given his desire for a break from institutional demands.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is grappling with a healthcare crisis as costs for providing coverage to immigrants without legal status have soared. Newsom must decide whether to scale back coverage, reneging on his promise of universal healthcare, or find budget cuts elsewhere. The expansion of Medi-Cal to immigrants has been more expensive than expected, with costs reaching $9.5 billion per year. The decision is complicated by polling showing tepid support for providing healthcare to immigrants without legal status, and the possibility of federal funding cuts under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers in Australia examines the correlation between Barbie's foot posture and her social standing, revealing that the doll's feet have evolved from arched to flat over time. This shift correlates with Barbie's designated career or hobby, with employed dolls more likely to have flat feet and fashion-focused dolls more likely to have arched feet. The study suggests that Barbie's empowerment is linked to her footwear choices, mirroring broader societal trends in women's roles. Mattel confirmed that the foot design was a deliberate part of Barbie's evolution.</p>

          <p>Three Yale professors, experts in authoritarianism, are leaving the United States to take positions at the University of Toronto, citing concerns about democratic backsliding and attacks on civil liberties. Marci Shore, Timothy Snyder, and Jason Stanley express their worries about the erosion of democratic norms and the rise of authoritarian tendencies in America. They emphasize the importance of defending the rule of law, independent courts, and universities to safeguard democracy. Their decision serves as both a warning and a call to action.</p>

          <p>Jay Bratt, the former special counsel prosecutor who led the federal criminal case against Donald Trump over alleged mishandling of classified documents, asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions during a deposition before a Republican-led House committee. The committee is seeking evidence of politicization in the prosecutions of Trump. Bratt's spokesman cited the administration's willingness to weaponize government against political enemies as the reason for invoking the Fifth Amendment. This appearance is the first known instance of a special counsel prosecutor being hauled before the judiciary committee since Trump took office.</p>
