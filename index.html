          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in at least two deaths and 22 injuries. The ship, carrying 277 people, was departing the South Street Seaport for Iceland when it reportedly lost power and drifted backward into the bridge. The tops of the ship's masts snapped off, leaving sailors dangling. The authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, and the National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a team to investigate, while the Brooklyn Bridge underwent inspection for structural damage, with initial reports suggesting no major damage to the bridge itself.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on Ukraine, targeting regions including Kyiv, just before a scheduled call between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian officials reported that the barrage killed one woman and injured several others, while the Ukrainian Air Force claimed to have intercepted 88 drones. Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he and leaders of the UK, France, and Poland would have a virtual meeting with Trump before his conversation with Putin on Monday morning, to discuss a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, a 25-year-old male, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic blast and believes he is the only fatality.

          <p>New Jersey is experiencing significant transportation disruptions due to a locomotive engineers' strike, sinkholes on Interstate 80, and ongoing issues at Newark Liberty International Airport. The rail strike has shut down NJ Transit's rail service, impacting commuters and travelers across the state. Sinkholes have closed lanes on I-80, causing traffic delays, while the airport faces runway closures, technology outages, and a shortage of air traffic controllers. These issues have left residents frustrated and questioning the state's ability to maintain its reputation for constant movement.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it has begun "extensive ground operations" throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip. This new phase of the war is aimed at pressuring Hamas into releasing hostages and ultimately destroying the group or forcing it to surrender. The military said the idea was to dissect Gaza into separate areas and that the population would be told to evacuate areas where the military was operating. The expansion of military operations comes even as Israel and Hamas are engaged in indirect talks for a cease-fire in Doha, the capital of Qatar.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers released Chris Taylor, the team's longest-tenured position player, to make room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list. Taylor, who was in the final season of a four-year contract, had seen his production decline, leading to the decision. The move signifies a shift towards younger, more productive players like Hyeseong Kim. The Dodgers have now parted ways with two familiar faces, with this being the second longtime team veteran, along with former backup catcher Austin Barnes, to be cut loose by the team in the last week.</p>

Public health leaders fear that these efforts will lead to lower vaccination rates, pointing to the current measles outbreak as proof.
