          <p>Robinhood shares experienced a drop of over 6% after the online brokerage was not included in the latest S&P 500 rebalance, despite speculation and a strong performance this year, where shares are up nearly 90%. Bank of America had previously identified Robinhood as a top candidate for inclusion, which usually results in significant trading volume as passive funds purchase shares. Crypto exchange Coinbase saw a 24% increase in stock value after its inclusion last month. Robinhood's stock had recently hit a record high amid a rebound in both stocks and crypto, recovering from a period of disfavor following the GameStop trading mania and the collapse of FTX. The company's future performance may be affected by this decision, although its year-to-date gains indicate a solid underlying business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval, driven by Republican support, but views vary based on the perceived targets. A slight majority believes the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, leading to strong support and the perception of increased safety. However, support decreases significantly if the focus shifts away from dangerous criminals, and most disapprove if they believe Trump is deporting more people than expected. Concerns about due process and potential economic impacts also influence opinions, with more Americans believing the program will weaken the economy. The poll also indicates that views on the national economy have stabilized, while support for new tariffs remains net negative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to sue the Trump administration after the deployment of the state's National Guard to Los Angeles to confront protesters. Newsom criticized Trump's action as illegal and inflammatory, stating that the deployment occurred without consulting the governor. National Guard troops were deployed to downtown Los Angeles amid protests following immigration enforcement operations, with reports of tear gas and non-lethal ammunition being used. Newsom requested the federal government to rescind the deployment, while Trump criticized Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, calling the protesters "troublemakers and insurrectionists." The ICE spokesperson stated that recent immigration enforcement operations have resulted in the arrest of a "domestic abuser" and a "child rapist."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its cable networks (including CNN and TNT Sports) from its streaming and studios business (including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television). CEO David Zaslav will lead the Streaming & Studios division, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head Global Networks; the split is expected to be completed by mid-2026. This decision effectively reverses much of the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery, as cable networks face declining viewership due to the shift to streaming services. The company aims to scale up HBO Max, targeting 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026, while addressing struggles in its studio business, which saw an 18% revenue decrease in the first quarter. The company's overall first-quarter revenue tumbled 9% to $9 billion.</p>

          <p>A hospital trust and a ward manager were found guilty of health and safety failings in connection with the death of Alice Figueiredo, a 22-year-old woman who took her own life while being treated at Goodmayes Hospital in 2015. The North East London Foundation NHS Trust (NELFT) and ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa were convicted under the Health and Safety at Work Act after a seven-month trial at the Old Bailey. Alice had attempted suicide multiple times using bin bags on the ward, which were not removed from a communal toilet despite warnings from her family. The court heard concerns about Aninakwa's communication and leadership skills, as well as a high turnover of agency staff on the ward, highlighting systemic failures in Alice's care.</p>

          <p>In Riverton, Wyoming, residents formed the Riverton Medical District to build their own hospital after witnessing the decline of their local hospital under private equity ownership by LifePoint Health and Apollo Global Management. The community felt that the hospital was being treated as a mere tool for profit, leading to the loss of essential services like the maternity ward. The group secured a USDA loan of over $37 million to fund a new hospital offering comprehensive services, challenging the conventional wisdom that rural hospitals are destined to fail and that private equity is the only solution. Their success highlights the importance of local knowledge and investment in making decisions for the community, contrasting with the private-equity ethos of consolidation at all costs.</p>

Homan explained that he was speaking broadly about anyone who "crosses the line" and commits a crime being subject to prosecution. President Donald Trump echoed similar sentiments, stating that California officials would face charges if they obstruct law and order. These comments come amid ongoing protests in downtown Los Angeles following immigration raids in the city and surrounding communities.</p>

          <p>Some student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan are reporting unexpected interest accrual despite promises of an interest-free forbearance. One borrower experienced an unexpected $3,000 in interest added to her loan balance. The Education Department has not directly addressed the issue, but Mohela has posted a notice stating that interest is currently set at 0% for borrowers on the SAVE administrative forbearance. Experts advise borrowers to check their loan history and contact Mohela if their debt has grown since July 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are accused of using misleading tropes to justify cuts to safety net programs in order to fund Donald Trump's tax bill, which critics argue will disproportionately harm low-income families. Contrary to claims of widespread waste and laziness, the majority of aid recipients who can work are already employed, while those who aren't are often ill, disabled, or caring for family members. The article highlights the story of a family who benefited from expanded government support during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling them to achieve financial stability. Critics argue that shaping policy around false stereotypes prevents policymakers from addressing the real issues that keep families from economic independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Labour Party is trying to resolve a year-long controversy surrounding the winter fuel payment policy. Initially, Rachel Reeves limited the payment to pensioners receiving pension credit or means-tested benefits, saving up to £1.5 billion annually. However, this decision faced significant backlash, with Labour MPs receiving numerous complaints. The government has since reversed the policy in three stages, with the prime minister announcing a threshold change and the chancellor confirming new recipients would receive the payment this winter, aiming to alleviate concerns and put the issue to rest.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest strategic approaches for investors to maximize their gold investments in June, considering recent price fluctuations influenced by inflation expectations and safe-haven demand. Monitoring the Federal Reserve's June 18 meeting and upcoming CPI/PPI releases is crucial, as rate cuts or increased inflation could impact gold prices. A long-term investment approach is advised over chasing short-term gains, with analysts expecting gold to potentially reach $3,700 this year. Additionally, exploring peer-to-peer sellers for undervalued gold jewelry and considering dollar-cost averaging and portfolio rebalancing are recommended strategies. (not investment advice)</p>
