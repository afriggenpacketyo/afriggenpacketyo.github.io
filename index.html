        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses how President Trump's administration and family have been accused of engaging in pay-to-play schemes with foreign entities, reminiscent of past administrations. The article notes that while Trump's actions may seem unprecedented, previous administrations, including the Clinton Foundation, have faced similar scrutiny for accepting funds from foreign regimes. The author argues that American politicians have long been susceptible to foreign influence and that comprehensive legislation is needed to prevent such corruption, including barring family members of politicians from foreign lobbying and investments. Ultimately, the article suggests that dismantling corruption requires a multi-faceted approach that holds all parties accountable. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article contrasts the diverging paths of night train travel in Europe and the United States. While Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train networks, driven by environmental concerns and increased investment, the United States continues to prioritize cars and air travel, neglecting its rail infrastructure. The article argues that America's car dependence has negatively impacted happiness and mental health, and that investing in rail networks could offer a more sustainable and community-oriented alternative. The author urges the United States to rediscover the American dream through revitalized railways, promoting connection and shared purpose. </p>

          <p>Poland held a presidential election amidst heightened security concerns stemming from the war in neighboring Ukraine and worries about the U.S. commitment to European security. The top candidates are Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, a liberal, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian. The election is also a test of the strength of other political forces, including the far-right. Polish authorities have reported attempts at foreign interference during the campaign. The presidency in Poland carries substantial power, including serving as commander of the armed forces and playing a role in foreign and security policy. </p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to the arrest and conviction of Jerry Westrom for the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs.

The forensic analysis of the footprints confirmed that Westrom was present during the murder.

This marked the first time the Weather Service had issued a dust storm warning for Chicago, with the last significant dust storm affecting the city during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. </p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts by Republicans, aimed at funding President Trump's agenda, are causing concern among low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program for healthcare coverage. An analysis estimates that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance. While some Republicans claim the cuts will only eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, many Medicaid recipients fear losing access to essential services. Some recipients worry about the impact of potential work requirements on their ability to receive treatment and maintain their health. </p>
