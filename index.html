            <p>ICE, along with other federal agencies, apprehended over 200 undocumented immigrants in New York City neighborhoods known for high crime rates during a one-week operation. Many of those arrested had extensive criminal histories, including convictions or pending charges for serious offenses like manslaughter, rape, and drug trafficking. ICE officials stated that the operation was necessary because local authorities often refused to honor immigration detainers, releasing these individuals back into the community. New York City's Mayor Eric Adams supported ICE's actions, emphasizing the need to remove dangerous criminals from the streets.</p>

            <p>Apple experienced a decline in smartphone shipments in China during the first quarter, making it the only top-five vendor to record a decrease as the overall market grew. This downturn occurred amidst rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with President Trump's new tariff regime creating uncertainty for the manufacturing supply chain. A subsidy program was implemented to encourage consumers to buy smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches, but it did not prevent Apple's decline. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods.</p>

            <p>The IRS is considering revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status after the university refused to comply with demands from the Trump administration regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The White House has already frozen billions in grants and contracts, and the Department of Homeland Security is threatening to revoke Harvard's student visa program. Harvard argues that revoking its tax-exempt status would be unlawful and would endanger its educational mission. President Trump has publicly criticized Harvard, accusing it of antisemitism and abusing its tax-exempt privilege.</p>

Krebs, who was appointed by Trump, maintained that the 2020 election was secure, which clashed with Trump's false claims of election fraud. Krebs stated that his resignation was necessary to fully dedicate himself to fighting for democracy, freedom of speech, and the rule of law.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction limiting the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) access to sensitive personal information at the Social Security Administration (SSA). The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit raising concerns about the potential misuse of accessed data. The judge questioned why DOGE needed unfettered access to SSA's entire data system to detect fraud and abuse. This decision prevents DOGE staffers from accessing Social Security databases containing personally identifiable information and requires them to delete any non-anonymized data in their possession.</p>

Surprisingly, it also suggested cannabis could fight cancer cells by inducing cell death and preventing their spread.

            <p>Mondelēz International has discontinued the 360g dark chocolate Toblerone bar in the UK after nearly six decades. The company cited "changing tastes" and a desire to grow its business as reasons for the decision. The original Toblerone was created in 1908, with the dark chocolate version introduced in 1969. The company has not indicated whether the dark chocolate Toblerone is being discontinued in other countries or if other sizes will also be affected.</p>

            <p>A common dolphin calf was killed by four bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay, Wales, an event witnessed by passengers on a dolphin spotting trip. A cetacean expert suggests such attacks may become more common as climate change increases the number of common dolphins in the area. Bottlenose dolphins may hunt common dolphins as a form of "play."

            <p>Grover Norquist, a longtime anti-tax activist, is alarmed by the possibility that Republicans may consider raising taxes on the wealthy. He argues that such a move would be economically destructive and politically foolish. The idea of raising taxes on the wealthy was once unthinkable in the GOP, but some Republicans are now signaling a willingness to break with this long-held principle. The potential shift reflects a change in the Republican Party's base and a greater focus on the concerns of working families.</p>

Hecker's prosecution showed how the clergy molestation crisis roiling the US church for decades was not yet over. Duhon's case spurred a broader investigation into Hecker's former employer, and Duhon hopes it continues.</p>

            <p>Republicans in nearly half of state legislatures have proposed bills requiring documentary proof of citizenship to vote, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud. These bills could make it more difficult for certain groups of people to vote and undermine confidence in elections. The state-level moves come as the US House has approved a bill requiring voters to submit proof of citizenship when registering to vote, based on the false narrative that noncitizens are voting en masse. Several states have already approved laws requiring documentary proof of citizenship, and others are considering similar measures.</p>
