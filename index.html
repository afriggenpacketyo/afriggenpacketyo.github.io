          <p>Xpeng's Hong Kong shares experienced a significant rally, gaining nearly 80% this year, fueled by positive earnings reports and promising revenue forecasts for the second quarter. The Chinese electric-vehicle maker's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, which helped narrow its net loss and improve its gross margin. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of 2025, attributing this turnaround to strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. This optimistic outlook has led brokerages to maintain a buy rating on the stock, projecting substantial upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Archdiocese of New Orleans has reached a settlement agreement to pay nearly $180 million to over 500 victims of clergy sexual assault to resolve a lawsuit filed in 2020. The settlement, which requires approval from the survivors and the bankruptcy court, includes provisions for safeguarding against future abuse and providing services to survivors. However, some survivors and their attorneys have expressed dissatisfaction with the deal, calling it a "secret backroom deal" and "an insult and a slap to the face." The case has brought to light years of abuse claims and the transfer of clergy without reporting alleged crimes to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Russia's war economy is showing signs of strain due to international sanctions, high inflation, and rising production costs, potentially pushing Moscow to the negotiating table with Ukraine. While Russia is believed to be planning a new summer offensive, its stockpiles of military equipment are dwindling, and further offensives into 2026 would require politically and economically challenging forced mobilization. A marked slowdown in Russia's GDP growth has surprised economists, with some predicting a possible technical recession. Tighter sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet" and a decline in oil prices are also impacting Russia's revenues, leading to a lowered oil price forecast and an increased budget deficit estimate.</p>

The Knicks, who had previously completed comebacks of 20, 20, and 14 points against the Boston Celtics, fell victim to a similar rally.

          <p>A landmark review in the UK proposes releasing violent offenders, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence to address severe prison overcrowding. The Independent Sentencing Review recommends managing more offenders in the community and using short custodial sentences only in exceptional cases. While the government plans to build new prisons, the review warns that this alone won't solve the crisis, calling for major reforms and an "earned progression model" inspired by Texas. Concerns are rising among probation officers about the increased pressure on an already stretched system.</p>

          <p>A South African lobbyist for white rights, Ernst Roets, has promoted the false narrative of white genocide in South Africa on platforms like Tucker Carlson's show, influencing figures like Donald Trump. Trump signed an executive order offering refugee status to "ethnic minority Afrikaners," despite evidence contradicting claims of systematic civil rights violations or disproportionate violence against white landowners. The situation reflects a complex interplay of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy, economic inequality, and the exploitation of racial grievances for political gain. While South Africa faces significant challenges, including violence and corruption, the narrative of white genocide is a dangerous distortion of reality used to undermine the country's progress.</p>

Labour sources claim the Conservatives failed to secure a deal on the Chagos Islands and left the prison system near capacity due to insufficient construction. The government is also exploring mandatory chemical castration for sexual offenders and addressing net migration figures. This strategy raises questions about the diminishing returns of blaming predecessors as Labour approaches its first anniversary in office amidst a challenging economic and political landscape.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board has vowed to sue the federal government if the waivers are revoked, as the decision is expected to impact numerous states that have adopted California's standards.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has strongly criticized officials following a "serious accident" during the launch ceremony for a new destroyer. The 5,000-ton destroyer lost balance and was damaged, preventing it from leaving the shipway, which Kim described as an intolerable "criminal act." Kim warned of consequences at an upcoming Workers' Party meeting and ordered the ship's restoration and an investigation. The South Korean military reported that the destroyer remains partially capsized.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall "mega tsunami" could devastate parts of America's West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii if a major earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially causing coastal land to sink by up to 6.5 feet. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake-induced tsunami would happen within minutes, leaving little time for adaptation or mitigation. The most severe effects are projected for southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled House is set to vote on President Trump's tax and spending bill, following weeks of intra-party divisions over spending cuts. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, creates new breaks, ends green-energy subsidies, and boosts military spending, paid for by tightening eligibility for food and health programs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt. Republicans have been deeply divided over the bill, with hardliners seeking deeper spending cuts and moderates concerned about hurting voters.</p>
