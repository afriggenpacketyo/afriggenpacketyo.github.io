            <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin confidently stated that the Trump administration's deregulatory efforts would not negatively impact public health or the environment. Zeldin emphasized the need to balance environmental protection with economic growth, highlighting the administration's focus on applying common sense to regulations. He encouraged public input during the deregulatory process, arguing that the previous administration's regulations were too broad and targeted entire industries, impacting the American economy.

            <p>Justice Samuel Alito criticized the Supreme Court's decision to temporarily halt President Trump's deportation of Venezuelan criminals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, calling the move "unprecedented" and "legally questionable." Alito expressed disapproval of the decision's timing and the lack of explanation provided by the court. The ACLU had filed an emergency appeal, arguing that deportations under the Act had resumed, while the Trump administration argued that detainees had been given advance notice to file habeas claims. The Alien Enemies Act has been rarely invoked in U.S. history.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing bipartisan criticism for the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen, due to an "administrative error." Senator Chris Van Hollen, who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, called the case a "constitutional crisis" and urged pressure on El Salvador to return him. President Trump criticized Van Hollen's meeting, posting about Abrego Garcia on social media, while the administration has refused to bring him back despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return. Senator Kennedy called the deportation a "screw up" but criticized Van Hollen's rhetoric.</p>

He implored the justices to limit the order to a pause on Alien Enemies Act removals only, not any removals of Venezuelan gang members.

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could cause a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start due to preemptive purchasing by businesses and consumers. Businesses are stocking up on inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of the tariffs. Goolsbee expressed optimism about the longer-term economic outlook but noted uncertainty regarding the future of the tariffs. Sectors affected by Trump's tariffs, particularly the auto industry, are most likely to heavily stock up on inventory now before import levies on goods from other countries potentially rise further.

            <p>Trump administration border czar Tom Homan criticized Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s trip to El Salvador to visit deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, accusing the Democrat of meeting with an MS-13 gang member. Homan defended the administration's actions, arguing that under the Alien Enemies Act, due process rights are more limited. He denied that any migrant is being labeled a gang member solely because of tattoos. Homan stated that the administration has followed the law and removed a public safety threat from the United States.</p>

            <p>Israel said "professional failures" were made after the Israeli military killed 15 Palestinian paramedics in the Gaza Strip last month. The Israeli military said an "operational misunderstanding by the troops" occurred during the killings and added that there was also a "breach of orders during a combat setting." The probe found no evidence to "support claims of execution," according to the Israeli military. Israel said a commanding officer would be remanded and a deputy commander dismissed because of the incident.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, who travelled to El Salvador last week to meet Kilmar Ábrego García, the man at the center of a wrongful deportation dispute, said on Sunday that his trip was to support Ábrego García’s right to due process because if that was denied then everyone’s constitutional rights were threatened in the US. Van Hollen has accused administration officials of lying about Ábrego García’s case in attempt to distract from questions about whether his rights were violated when he was deported to El Salvador last month. He stated that if the constitutional rights of this one man are threatened, it threatens the constitutional rights of everyone in America.</p>

While most people dislike the idea of treating national belonging as a commodity, many countries offer residency in exchange for an investment or donation.

The military investigation found that the deputy battalion commander, "due to poor night visibility," assessed that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants. Video footage obtained from the incident shows the ambulances had lights flashing and logos visible as they pulled up to help another ambulance that came under fire earlier. The head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society has said the men were "targeted at close range."</p>

The Democratic senator was speaking after returning from El Salvador where he met Kilmar Ábrego García, who was sent to the notorious mega-jail Cecot (Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism) last month. The Supreme Court has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return, however Trump administration officials have continued to push back against the order. The White House accuses him of being a member of the transnational Salvadoran gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, and has said he will not return to the US.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in a massive natural gas project in Alaska to reach trade deals that would satisfy President Trump's demands and avoid high U.S. tariffs on their exports. The Alaska LNG project, with a price tag topping $40 billion, has been stuck on the drawing board for years. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the project could play an important role in trade negotiations with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. The permits for Alaska LNG are already in place, and Glenfarne expects to reach a final investment decision in the next six to 12 months on the first phase of the project.</p>
