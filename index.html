          <p>Ian Watkins, the former Lostprophets singer, died following an attack in HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. West Yorkshire Police have launched a murder investigation, arresting two men. This incident occurred less than two weeks after a report indicated a marked increase in violence at the prison, noting that many prisoners, especially older men convicted of sexual offenses, felt unsafe. Watkins had previously faced an appeal rejection to reduce his sentence, with the judge describing his crimes as plunging into "new depths of depravity."</p>

Diagnosed in May with a high-grade Gleason score of 9, the cancer is reportedly hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Sources indicate the radiation treatment began weeks ago and is expected to last five weeks. Biden, who has advocated for cancer research and lost his son to brain cancer, has largely retreated from public life since leaving office.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo, will close their doors starting Sunday as the government shutdown continues and their prior-year funds are depleted. The Smithsonian, which receives 62% of its funding from the federal government, assured the public that all animals at the zoo and conservation institute would continue to receive care. However, beloved animal cams are deemed nonessential and will be turned off. This closure follows similar impacts on national parks, highlighting the broad consequences of the ongoing dispute over government funding.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London for a march and rally, a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect in Gaza. Organized by the Palestine Coalition, demonstrators carried Palestinian flags and chanted slogans like "stop arming Israel." The Metropolitan Police made 14 arrests, including for breaching public order conditions and supporting a proscribed group, following a scuffle with counter-protesters. Speakers at the rally described the US-brokered ceasefire as positive but "precarious," vowing to continue protesting until Palestinians achieve full freedom.</p>

          <p>Charter airline Verijet has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, leading to the cancellation of all its flights and leaving customers stranded. The Vero Beach, Florida-based company amassed over $38.7 million in liabilities, including significant debts to jet card customers, and faced numerous lawsuits before its founder Richard Kane's sudden death. Verijet, which experienced rapid growth since 2020, operated short-haul flights across the U.S. and expanded internationally. The bankruptcy signifies liquidation rather than restructuring, impacting customers who had purchased jet cards for flight services that were not provided. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SNP members have backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to pursue a second Scottish independence referendum if the party secures a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic, based on the precedent set for the 2014 referendum. While a proposed amendment for a de-facto independence vote based on overall pro-independence party votes was rejected, Swinney emphasized his leadership's commitment to delivering independence. Despite the UK government's stance against another vote, this endorsement strengthens Swinney's authority within the party.</p>

          <p>Gen Z consumers are increasingly rejecting "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced items designed for disposability—in favor of secondhand and sustainable options.

The article highlights how fast furniture, often made with non-recyclable materials and driven by seasonal trends, contributes to massive waste.

          <p>A US government shutdown occurs when Congress and the President fail to agree on budget funds, leading to the temporary cessation of work for large parts of the state administration. The current shutdown, the 21st since 1976, has furloughed an estimated 750,000 federal employees, affecting public institutions like national parks and museums, though essential services like police remain operational. The main point of contention is healthcare policy, with Democrats seeking to maintain Affordable Care Act support and reverse Medicaid cuts. President Trump has announced layoffs, using the shutdown as an opportunity to reduce the state apparatus.</p>
