        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Primark's chief executive, Paul Marchant, resigned following an investigation into a complaint about his behavior towards a woman in a social setting.  Associated British Foods (ABF), Primark's parent company, stated that Marchant acknowledged his error and apologized.  ABF's share price dropped following the announcement, suggesting investor concern about the timing and potential impact on the company's performance.  The summary presents the situation fairly, though the focus on the stock market decline might subtly imply that the financial consequences are more significant than the ethical concerns. </p>
