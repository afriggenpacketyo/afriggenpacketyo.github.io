Authorities believe it was a professional theft, suggesting it happens frequently in the area, and the Secret Service is investigating the incident.

          <p>Imports at the Port of Los Angeles are expected to drop significantly in the coming weeks due to President Trump's tariffs, with arrivals potentially decreasing by 35%. The high tariff rates on Chinese goods and across-the-board tariffs on other nations are suppressing demand from U.S. retailers and manufacturers. The slowdown is expected to have a ripple effect at the port, impacting truckers and dock workers, and follows a report highlighting the threat tariffs pose to Southern California's trade and logistics industry.</p>

          <p>Eilish McColgan is preparing for her marathon debut in London, aiming to complete the race smoothly and potentially set a new Scottish record, which would also surpass her mother's personal best. Despite initial plans to run the marathon in 2024 being derailed by injury, she hopes this race will be a springboard for the next phase of her career. Her mother, Liz McColgan, who won the London Marathon in 1996, is coaching her, emphasizing the importance of pacing in the first half of the race.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China are set to impact Chinese grocery stores and their customers, potentially raising prices on essential cultural foods. The tariffs, which include a 145 percent tax on goods, could force stores to make difficult choices between raising prices and risking customer loss. This development raises concerns about the affordability and availability of cultural foods, particularly for communities that rely on these stores for continuity and identity.</p>

          <p>A 32-year-old Venezuelan man in Detroit was deported to El Salvador after mistakenly crossing into Canada while delivering food. Ricardo Prada Vásquez was detained while attempting to re-enter the U.S. and subsequently deported, raising concerns among immigration rights experts about due process. DHS claims he was a member of a criminal organization, while rights advocates argue a wrong turn should not lead to deportation without proper proceedings.</p>
