          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the airwaves on Tuesday, less than a week after its suspension. The company stated the initial decision to halt production was to avoid inflaming national tensions following Kimmel's comments on the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After discussions with Kimmel, the show will resume. The suspension had drawn widespread criticism, prompting hundreds of entertainers and the ACLU to sign an open letter condemning the move as a threat to free speech and constitutional values.</p>

          <p>Gabrielle has strengthened into a major Category 4 hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season. With maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, the storm's center is expected to pass east of Bermuda, though no direct warnings have been issued for the island. The National Hurricane Center has advised those in the Azores to monitor its progress. Swells generated by Gabrielle are forecast to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Atlantic Canada.</p>

However, immigration attorneys express uncertainty about gray areas, such as whether current visa holders who travel abroad while applying for an extension might be subject to the fee.

Currently, a $50,000 HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis than a fixed-rate home equity loan for both 10- and 15-year terms. However, the variable interest rate of a HELOC means its cost could rise in the future, whereas a home equity loan provides the stability of a fixed payment.

Mamdani characterized the network's decision, which followed pressure from the FCC, as corporate cowardice in the face of authoritarianism from the White House. He stated his withdrawal was not an indictment of local journalists but a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over freedom of the press. The move highlights the ongoing political and cultural fallout from the suspension and its implications for free speech.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, has declared that his party has a moral obligation to prevent Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party from gaining power. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey positioned the Liberal Democrats as a viable alternative to both the Conservative and Labour parties, offering change that aligns with British values. He contrasted this with Farage's political vision, which he claimed aims to model the UK after "Trump's America," a direction he described as harsh and contrary to the nation's character.</p>

The 24-hour strike, called by grassroots unions, disrupted transportation, schools, and ports, with over 20,000 people protesting in Rome alone. In Milan, clashes between protesters and police led to arrests and injuries, drawing condemnation from Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who stated the violence had nothing to do with solidarity.

Medical professionals, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, echoed this, citing large-scale studies that found no increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of 25 different studies has found that interventions designed to reduce partisan animosity have only a small and temporary impact. Researchers discovered that while approaches like correcting misperceptions of political opponents can slightly increase warmth towards the other side, these effects largely disappear within two weeks. The study also found that combining multiple interventions or repeating them over time did not produce a more significant or lasting reduction in hostility. The findings suggest that tackling deep political divides may require systemic changes to political and media incentives rather than individual-level interventions.</p>
