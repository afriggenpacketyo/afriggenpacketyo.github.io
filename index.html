          <p>President Vladimir Putin oversaw a grand Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany, with leaders from China, Brazil, and other nations in attendance. The parade, featuring thousands of soldiers and military hardware, was used to highlight Russia's past glories and justify the war in Ukraine. This year's parade was particularly significant, showcasing Russia's efforts to present a counterweight to the West with the participation of numerous foreign dignitaries. Amidst the celebrations, Ukraine increased its attacks on Moscow and surrounding areas, while Zelensky rejected Putin's proposed ceasefire, calling it a 'theatrical show'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two months after Israel blocked all aid to Gaza, U.S. and Israeli officials are collaborating on a new food distribution plan, though the U.N. expresses concerns about its practicality. The proposed mechanism involves establishing distribution zones managed by aid workers, with the Israeli military stationed at the perimeters. This plan aims to prevent Hamas from controlling aid and undermining their influence, but the U.N. argues it would reduce the reach of aid, forcing civilians to travel farther and increasing risks of displacement and looting. The U.N. also fears civilians interacting with Israeli soldiers could lead to detentions and interrogations, further complicating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey stated that the U.K. faces ongoing economic uncertainty, even with its new trade agreement with the U.S. under President Donald Trump's tariff regime. Bailey emphasized that tariffs and trade situations have introduced more uncertainty into the economic landscape. While a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement is welcomed, the U.K.'s open economy is still impacted by global tariff relationships, meaning that the impact from tariffs on the U.K. economy comes not just from its own trade relationship with Washington, but also from those of the U.S. and the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>A restored version of the original pilot episode of Thomas & Friends, narrated by Ringo Starr, will be released for the first time since 1983 to mark the franchise's 80th anniversary. The episode, titled "Down The Mine," was rediscovered in storage and digitally treated. Ian McCue, a former series producer, noted the pilot's charm and innocence despite some teething problems during production. The show's enduring popularity is attributed to its themes of friendship, teamwork, and communication, making it a trusted and wholesome program for children.</p>

          <p>The recent trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K., while reducing tariffs on specific sectors like automobiles and steel, suggests that President Trump's 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners. Under the agreement, the U.K. can export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, with higher duties applying to additional exports, while steel and aluminum exports will be tariff-free but subject to quotas. Analysts suggest this deal, though beneficial for certain U.K. industries, indicates that a minimum 10% tariff is the best other countries can expect, potentially impacting U.S. economic growth.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping attended Russia's Victory Day Parade in Moscow, reaffirming China's support against what he termed "hegemonic bullying," a jab at U.S. tariffs and sanctions. As Western sanctions impact Russia's economy due to the Ukraine war, Moscow relies increasingly on Beijing for energy and raw material exports. China has become Russia's top economic partner, with trade soaring and military bonds tightening, but some analysts suggest that without China's economic support, Russia would be in a difficult position, though secondary U.S. sanctions pose obstacles to further trade expansion.</p>

          <p>Chinese government data indicates a shift in trade flows, with exports to Southeast Asian countries surging as shipments to the United States plummet due to increased tariffs. Chinese shipments to the U.S. decreased by 21% in April, while exports to Southeast Asian countries increased by 21%. This redirection suggests a front-loading of the supply chain and a strategic move by Chinese factories to leverage a pause in tariffs on countries across the region to fulfill orders destined for the U.S. Chinese financial regulators are prepared to boost domestic demand to mitigate the trade war's impact.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, with rising global temperatures and extreme weather events posing significant challenges to migratory birds. Coastal stopover sites are being affected by floods, while ocean acidification impacts the crustaceans that birds rely on for food. Warmer temperatures are causing some birds to shorten their routes or abandon traditional habitats, leading to conflicts with resident animals. Conservation efforts, such as expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments, are crucial to mitigating these impacts and preserving the role of migratory birds in maintaining ecosystem health.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir's Pahalgam area in April has brought India and Pakistan once again to the brink of war. The nuclear armed South Asian neighbors have attacked each other this week with missiles and drones in a sudden flare-up of a decades-old feud that's being watched with concern by leaders around the world. After a week of intense clashes, air raid sirens blared in a couple Indian cities near the Pakistani border on Friday and authorities asked people to remain indoors.</p>

          <p>Former Australia cricketer Stuart MacGill has avoided jail after being found guilty of taking part in the supply of cocaine. MacGill pleaded not guilty but had admitted to the use of cocaine and to introducing his brother-in-law to his drug dealer. Prosecutors said that the pair later made a deal for 330,000 Australian dollars (£159,000) worth of cocaine but MacGill maintained that his involvement was limited to the introduction in Sydney in April 2021. A police investigation began after MacGill claimed he had been abducted and beaten in April 2021.</p>

          <p>India is considering zero tariffs on steel, auto parts, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S., a significant shift from its protectionist policies, potentially impacting domestic manufacturing. Experts suggest the deal's effect will vary by sector, with steel and pharmaceuticals less affected due to transportation costs and patented drugs' high prices. A trade deal is expected to benefit logistics companies, while consultancy and consumer staples sectors are projected to outperform regardless of the outcome. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and reducing trade barriers is seen as crucial for India's economic growth.</p>

          <p>Conservative pundit Erick Erickson criticized President Trump’s trade agreement with the United Kingdom as a “shitty deal” for Americans. Erickson argued that the 10% tariff, initially presented as a baseline for negotiations, is now permanent, effectively taxing American consumers. He also highlighted concerns about the deal tripling tariffs on imports from the U.K. and the nationalization of British Steel, questioning the free-market implications. The remarks reflect a divide among conservatives regarding the benefits of the trade agreement.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced a surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariff implementations. Exports jumped 8.1% year-on-year, while imports decreased slightly, indicating a shift in trade dynamics. Shipments to ASEAN countries grew significantly, particularly to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The surge could be due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>
