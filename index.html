          <p>A missile fired from Yemen by Houthi rebels struck near Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel, causing injuries and temporarily halting flights. The Houthis claimed responsibility, stating the attack was in support of Palestinians and vowed further action.

          <p>The Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office (HCAO) in Minneapolis after the office implemented a policy directing prosecutors to consider race when negotiating plea deals.

The investigation will involve a comprehensive review of HCAO policies and practices.

          <p>This article presents the poem "Good Lord, These Muscadines" by Caki Wilkinson. The poem reflects on a moment of intimacy and acceptance, using the image of muscadine grapes as a metaphor for the imperfect and sometimes messy reality of life and relationships. The speaker acknowledges their own shortcomings in expressing emotions directly, preferring subtext, but finds a sense of comfort and connection in the shared experience. The poem contrasts the initial longing with the acceptance of the present, finding beauty in the unglamorous details of everyday life.</p>

          <p>This article discusses two new theatrical productions, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and "Vanya," both featuring a single actor playing multiple roles, and their relevance to modern society's obsession with image and performance. "Dorian Gray" uses technology, including smartphones and video, to critique the superficiality of social media and the dangers of prioritizing appearance over substance. "Vanya," on the other hand, takes a more analog approach, suggesting that exploring multiple facets of oneself can lead to a richer understanding of identity. The article poses the question of when performing a persona becomes a perversion of truth versus a manifestation of self-expression.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen U.S. government health-tracking programs have been eliminated due to layoffs and budget cuts, raising concerns among health experts. The programs, which tracked data on deaths, diseases, and various health issues, have been terminated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These cuts include programs monitoring pregnancies, lead poisoning, sexual violence, and youth smoking. Health experts worry that eliminating these programs will hinder the ability to understand and address health problems effectively, while officials say the cuts are designed to eliminate waste and focus on emerging infectious diseases.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that the Trump administration has canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ health, impacting research on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. The administration justified the cuts by stating that the research no longer aligns with agency priorities and is based on "unscientific" categories. This action has led to job losses at LGBTQ-focused labs and concerns about the health of sexual and gender minority groups. Scientists argue that these cuts create a hierarchy of patients, with some deemed less worthy of research, and undermine efforts to address health disparities.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump is dismantling the Department of Justice (DOJ) through the use of investigations against political opponents, rewarding allies, and eliminating internal opposition. The author asserts that Trump's actions represent an assault on the rule of law, citing examples such as the investigation of former employees Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, and the targeting of states like New Jersey and Maine for disagreeing with Trump's policies. The article concludes that these actions create a climate of fear and undermine the integrity and independence of the DOJ.</p>

          <p>Following heavy losses in the English local elections, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch cautioned against a knee-jerk reaction, stating that a change of leader would not "fix everything." While acknowledging the party's poor performance, she emphasized a "slow and steady" plan to return to government by the end of the decade, focusing on credible policies rather than rushing out false promises to win votes. Badenoch also addressed the rise of Reform UK, stating her job is to ensure Nigel Farage does not become prime minister, as he lacks the answers to the country's problems.</p>

          <p>This article describes the US economy as being on an unstable course due to President Trump's policies and the uncertainty they create. The author notes that businesses and consumers are wary due to the chaos emanating from the White House, with no one able to predict future tariff rates or the impact of budget cuts. While hard data is holding up, forward-looking surveys show anxiety, with concerns about mass deportations potentially leading to worker shortages and increased wage inflation. The author concludes that the unknowability of future policy is the essence of Trump 2.0.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, having gained control of 10 local authorities in recent elections, is considering legal action to prevent migrants from being housed in asylum hotels within those areas. Party chairman Zia Yusuf stated they will "resist" housing asylum seekers and use "every instrument of power available," including judicial reviews. Yusuf acknowledged the limited power at the local level but indicated they would explore options around planning and budget allocation. The party also plans to publish a plan to deport all illegal immigrants in their first term, while cutting spending on diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article argues that the most predictive moment of Donald Trump's second term was the selection of JD Vance as his vice president, signaling a shift from a coalition government to a royal court. Unlike his first term, where he was surrounded by people who occasionally challenged him, Trump is now surrounded by loyalists and enforcers who prioritize his favor above all else. The author contends that this lack of skepticism and the absence of guardrails make Trump's second term more reckless and dangerous.</p>

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was nicknamed "Temu Trump" for echoing some of the U.S. president's ideas, which resonated poorly with Australian voters. While cost-of-living issues were a primary concern, Trump's unpopularity and Dutton's perceived policy missteps contributed to the Labor Party's success, signaling a desire for sensible, centrist politics.</p>
