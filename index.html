          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly boost France's defense budget, citing unprecedented threats to freedom since 1945. The annual defense spending is now set to reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal originally planned for 2030 and double the amount from when he took office. Macron attributed the need for increased military power to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and growing uncertainty from the United States. The plan aims to ensure France is "feared" and therefore "free."</p>

Homan clarified that physical description cannot be the sole factor for detaining someone but also admitted that U.S. citizens have been caught up in raids as "collateral arrests." His appearances underscore his central role in publicly defending the administration's mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old U.S. citizen, Sayfollah Musallet, was reportedly beaten to death and another Palestinian man was shot and killed during an attack by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The incident occurred in the town of al-Mazra'a al-Sharqiya, where residents say the men were attacked after gathering to protest settler violence. The families of the victims claim the men were tortured and that medical aid was blocked for hours. The U.S. State Department is aware of the death, as the event highlights the escalating violence against Palestinians in the region.</p>

          <p>An Iranian news agency close to the Revolutionary Guard has reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli airstrike last month. The report, which has not been independently verified, claims that bombs targeted a secret underground facility in Tehran where Pezeshkian was in a high-level security meeting on June 16. The strikes allegedly blocked all exits, forcing the president and others to escape through an emergency shaft. Israel has not commented on the claim, which follows previous accusations by Pezeshkian that Israel tried to assassinate him.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend its planned retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, which were set to begin on Monday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the delay provides time for negotiations, after President Trump announced new 30% tariffs on EU goods effective August 1. The EU hopes a trade deal can be reached by this new deadline to avoid a significant escalation. The trade relationship between the U.S. and the EU is the world's largest, valued at an average of €4.6 billion per day. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Government Data Contradicts Rhetoric on Deporting 'Worst of the Worst'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of government data reveals a discrepancy between the Trump administration's rhetoric and its actual immigration enforcement actions. While the president pledges to deport dangerous criminals, the latest ICE statistics show that over 71% of detainees have no criminal convictions. Of those with convictions, a small fraction have committed high-level violent crimes. This data contrasts with the administration's narrative used to justify its large-scale deportation program. Immigration policy experts note this disconnect, highlighting that enforcement overwhelmingly targets individuals without any known criminal history.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem clarified that President Trump's goal is to have the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) "remade" rather than eliminated. Speaking amid criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Noem stated the president believes the agency needs to be "redeployed in a new way." Her comments appear to soften previous rhetoric from both herself and the president about phasing out the agency. Critics argue that FEMA has been weakened under the current administration, with staff departures and policy changes that could hinder its ability to respond to major disasters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, a meeting that comes as the administration plans to sell weapons to NATO allies for transfer to Ukraine. This strategy would allow for faster delivery of military aid, as equipment could be moved from European allies rather than directly from U.S. factories. The plan is part of a broader "turning point" in the U.S. approach to the war, which also includes a push for heavy sanctions on Russia and its economic partners. The moves signal a more aggressive stance to pressure Russia into negotiations.</p>

The Israeli military admitted a "technical error" occurred during a strike targeting an Islamic Jihad militant, causing the munition to hit dozens of meters away from its intended target. The IDF stated it regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians and is reviewing the incident. This strike is part of an escalation of attacks across Gaza, with the Red Cross reporting a massive increase in weapon-related casualties at its field hospital.</p>

The statement has angered European leaders, who are now working to find a solution before the deadline.

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's proposed 50% tariff on Brazil, despite the U.S. having a trade surplus with the country. When questioned about the justification, Hassett framed the tariff as part of a broader global strategy to onshore production and reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit, which he described as a national security risk. The proposed tariff on Brazil was also linked in President Trump's letter to the ongoing criminal case against his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, raising questions about the move's motivations.
