          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump asserted in social media posts that the responsibility to end the conflict with Russia lies with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump outlined conditions for peace, including Ukraine abandoning its NATO aspirations and formally ceding Crimea to Russia, which mirrors long-standing Kremlin demands. These statements were made just before a high-stakes meeting in Washington between Trump, Zelenskyy, and several European leaders to discuss the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a significant concession that would allow the U.S. and European nations to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5. This development, described as "game-changing," could provide a pathway to ending the war by addressing Ukraine's security needs without formal NATO membership, a long-standing objection from Moscow. The potential agreement was discussed during a summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents in Alaska.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of unity, several European and NATO leaders are accompanying Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for crucial talks at the White House. This collective diplomatic effort is seen as an attempt to present a united front and provide support for Zelenskyy, ensuring he is not pressured into accepting unfavorable peace terms. The move follows concerns in European capitals after Zelenskyy was excluded from a prior summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents.</p>

          <p>Preliminary results from Bolivia's presidential election suggest the country is set to elect a non-left-wing president for the first time in nearly two decades, with a runoff expected between Rodrigo Paz Pereira and Jorge Quiroga. This political turn reflects widespread voter frustration with the incumbent socialist party amid a severe economic crisis marked by high inflation and shortages. The election also highlighted deep divisions within the left, with former president Evo Morales barred from running and facing accusations of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops in Washington D.C. is expanding, with West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio announcing they will send hundreds of personnel to the capital. This move is part of a federal anti-crime initiative, but it has drawn criticism from crime prevention experts who argue it will not address the systemic causes of violence. The policy has also prompted concern among Democratic mayors in other cities, who are preparing legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Nearly a quarter-century after the September 11th attacks, the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its mission to identify every victim. Using advanced DNA extraction and amplification technologies, scientists are still making new identifications from the thousands of remains recovered from Ground Zero. This painstaking work fulfills a long-standing promise to the families of the more than 1,000 victims who remain unidentified, providing a measure of closure after decades of waiting.</p>

          <p>Jon Rahm has been crowned the LIV Golf individual season champion for the second year in a row, securing the title despite losing a playoff to Sebastian Munoz in the latest tournament. Rahm's finish was sufficient to outperform his closest rival, Joaquin Niemann, for the season-long award and its $18 million prize. The result also had positive implications for Ryder Cup veterans Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who both performed well enough to avoid relegation from the league for the next season.</p>
