          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, a decision that followed public attacks from former President Donald Trump. The conflict arose after Tillis voted against proceeding with Trump's signature "one big beautiful bill," citing concerns over cuts to Medicaid that would harm his state. In response, Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented that bipartisanship and independent thinking have become an "endangered species" in Washington, making his choice not to run again an easy one.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released a new analysis of President Trump's proposed "Big Beautiful Bill." The report estimates the legislation could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose their health insurance coverage and would increase the national debt by almost $3.3 trillion over the next decade. These figures, driven by significant cuts to healthcare programs like Medicaid, are complicating the Republican effort to pass the bill. The findings are fueling criticism from Democrats and some concerned Republicans over the bill's fiscal and social impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is currently debating President Trump's major tax and spending package, known as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," with final votes expected after a marathon session. After narrowly advancing the bill, Democrats initiated a 16-hour full reading to delay the process. The legislation, pursued through budget reconciliation to bypass the need for bipartisan support, includes increased border security and defense spending offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The process now moves to a "vote-a-rama," where senators can propose unlimited amendments, setting the stage for a prolonged political battle.</p>

          <p>Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir-Saeid Iravani, has declared that his country's uranium enrichment program "will never stop," asserting it as an inalienable right for peaceful energy purposes under international treaties. His statement comes in the wake of U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, creating what he called an improper condition for new negotiations. While denying any threats to IAEA inspectors, Iravani confirmed that their access to sites has been suspended by Iran's parliament. He also indicated that while a transfer of enriched uranium could be possible in a deal, renouncing domestic production is not an option.</p>

The pressure campaign was reportedly tied to a Justice Department investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.

          <p>The new racing film "F1 The Movie," starring Brad Pitt, has become Apple's biggest theatrical success to date, earning an estimated $55.6 million in North America and $144 million worldwide during its opening weekend. Distributed in partnership with Warner Bros., the movie was produced by much of the team behind "Top Gun: Maverick." Despite a hefty production budget exceeding $200 million, strong critical reviews and a high "A" CinemaScore from audiences suggest it may have sustained box office success. This opening marks a significant milestone for Apple Original Films' theatrical ventures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The health impact of common seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, has become a subject of intense debate, fueled by claims from public figures like Health Secretary RFK Jr. that they are harmful. These oils are rich in linoleic acid, an omega-6 polyunsaturated fat that the body cannot produce on its own. While some critics argue that high consumption of these oils promotes inflammation, many nutrition researchers and major health organizations maintain that the evidence does not support these claims. They point to studies suggesting that, when substituted for saturated fats, these oils can be beneficial for heart health.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain advanced to the Club World Cup quarter-finals with a dominant 4-0 victory over Inter Miami. The European champions asserted their superiority from the start, scoring all four goals in the first half, including two from JoÃ£o Neves. Inter Miami, featuring superstar Lionel Messi, struggled to gain a foothold in the match against a younger, more dynamic PSG side. The result was largely expected, reflecting the significant gap in resources and current form between the two clubs, with PSG effectively sealing the game before halftime and easing through the second half.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, assessing the actual damage requires a nuanced approach beyond immediate declarations. True battle damage assessment (BDA) considers the precision of munitions, the delivery aircraft, and the specific effects on the target, which can be both physical and functional. This article argues that preliminary reports are often incomplete, as a full analysis integrates imagery, intelligence, and other data over time. Given the advanced U.S. technology used and the cumulative impact of a broader campaign, it is plausible that the damage was severe, setting back Iran's program significantly more than initial, hasty critiques might suggest.</p>

A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes as the president has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell the app, with the current deadline set for September 17.</p>

Such collapses are common in Sudan's artisanal mining sector due to poor safety standards.
