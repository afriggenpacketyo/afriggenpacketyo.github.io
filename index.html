        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The central United States is bracing for another round of severe weather, including thunderstorms, hail, and potential tornadoes, just days after deadly storms and tornadoes killed at least 28 people across the Midwest and South. The National Weather Service has issued flood watches for parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, with forecasters warning of the possibility of strong tornadoes and destructive winds. Residents in Kentucky and Missouri are still recovering from the damage caused by the previous weekend's tornadoes, with emergency workers assessing the damage and providing assistance. The storms have also raised concerns about staffing cuts at the National Weather Service and the impact on disaster warnings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a significant agreement aimed at boosting security cooperation and reducing trade barriers nearly a decade after the Brexit vote. The deal, championed by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, seeks to reset relations with the EU amidst concerns over U.S. commitment to European security. Key provisions include easing border crossings for British travelers, facilitating pet travel, and lifting restrictions on certain British meat product sales in the EU. The agreement also extends European fishing access to UK waters until 2038, a point of contention for some, while business sectors largely welcomed the move for its potential to cut costs and increase sales.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) has criticized the UK government's new deal with the EU, which extends EU boats' access to UK waters for 12 years in exchange for reduced checks on food exports, labeling it a "total capitulation." The SFF fears this agreement undermines the UK's negotiating power in future talks, while Scotland's Deputy First Minister also criticized the lack of consultation. Conversely, Salmon Scotland welcomed the deal, anticipating a reduction in red tape for exporters. The agreement, praised by some as a win-win, includes measures to ease trade barriers and facilitate the sale of shellfish in Europe, but faces strong opposition from those in the fishing industry who feel 'sold down the river'.</p>

          <p>With economic uncertainty looming, many Americans are considering annuities as a means to secure their retirement income. Annuities offer guaranteed lifetime income and protection against market volatility, with tax-deferred growth and no contribution limits. However, they also come with fees, limited access to funds, and potential early withdrawal penalties. Experts advise balancing annuity investments with accessible accounts, researching company strength, and creating a financial plan before committing. Considering current economic conditions and consulting with a financial advisor are essential to determine if an annuity fits one's retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, though it appears hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Prostate cancer is common among men, with a high overall survival rate but a lower rate when the cancer has spread. Dr. Ben Davies, a professor of urology, notes that Biden's Gleason score indicates a severe version of the disease, but hormonal treatments, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are potential options. While Biden's age is a factor, his overall physiology will determine his ability to tolerate therapies, and research has significantly advanced prostate cancer care in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sleep specialists suggest improving sleep quality by rethinking eating habits, emphasizing the importance of nutrients, fats, sugar, and fiber. Consuming foods rich in tryptophan, such as almonds and turkey, can aid in the production of serotonin and melatonin, which regulate sleep. Swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables, like bananas and cherries, provides sleep-supporting nutrients and fiber. Avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, as well as alcohol right before bed, can prevent disruptions to sleep cycles. Lastly, avoiding heavy meals close to bedtime promotes better digestion and more restful sleep.</p>

The bill faces potential hurdles in the House Rules Committee and resistance in the Senate, where some Republicans have warned they will seek changes.

The party's rise reflects broader trends in Western Europe, where hard-right parties are gaining traction.

Moody's cited the failure of successive administrations to address rising deficits and interest costs as the reason for lowering the rating. The proposed tax and spending bill, estimated to add $5 trillion to the national debt, is exacerbating these concerns. The downgrade has led to increased long-term borrowing costs and a weakened dollar, signaling investor unease.

          <p>Researchers are investigating a peculiar trend among young male capuchin monkeys on a Panama island, where they are kidnapping baby howler monkeys. These capuchins carry the infants, often resulting in the howlers' death due to lack of nourishment. The behavior, first observed in 2022, appears to be a novel, culturally transmitted activity among the capuchins, with one monkey named Joker being the innovator. Scientists speculate that the capuchins may be motivated by boredom or a confused parental instinct, highlighting the complex social dynamics and learning capabilities of these primates.</p>

          <h2>Ray Dalio Warns of Greater Risks to U.S. Treasurys Than Credit Ratings Suggest</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio cautions that Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating understates the actual risks to U.S. Treasurys. Dalio argues that credit ratings fail to account for the possibility of the government printing money to pay its debts, which would devalue bondholders' returns. This warning comes after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, citing concerns over the ballooning budget deficit and rising interest payments. The downgrade has already impacted the market, with U.S. stocks falling and Treasury bond yields rising.</p>

The court has ruled that the trio must repay Â£754,525 within three months, or their sentences will be extended. The judge determined that the defendants jointly controlled the stolen property and benefited financially from the robbery, leading to the order for repayment.</p>
