            <p>Malaysia is set to return giant pandas Fu Wa and Feng Yi to China, initiating a quarantine period at Kuala Lumpur's National Zoo to ensure their well-being for the trip. This repatriation occurs as Malaysia finalizes a new 10-year conservation agreement with China, highlighted during Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit on April 16th. The agreement will allow Malaysia to host another pair of giant pandas from 2025 to 2035, continuing a cooperative effort on giant panda conservation. During the quarantine, public viewing will be limited, but visitors may still catch glimpses of the pandas at designated times.</p>

This mission marked Pettit's fourth, bringing his total time in space to 590 days. While Pettit isn't the oldest person to orbit the Earth, a record held by John Glenn, his return marks the end of another successful long-duration mission to the ISS.</p>

Japan is reviewing its automobile regulations to advance negotiations and aims to strike a balance between affordable products and protecting domestic producers amid a declining birthrate. Ishiba also highlighted Japan's commitment to free trade through cooperation with ASEAN and the EU, expressing concern over the U.S.-China tariff escalation.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is grappling with an increasing number of espionage cases, exposing vulnerabilities in its political and military defenses. Revelations of infiltration, including aides to top government officials, have raised alarms about Beijing's efforts to undermine Taiwan from within. At least five individuals closely tied to senior DPP politicians are under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information to mainland Chinese intelligence. These breaches have fueled fears that China's spy networks in Taiwan are becoming more effective, especially as tensions across the Taiwan Strait have worsened since William Lai Ching-te took office.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded that if Russia truly intends to observe a full ceasefire, Ukraine will reciprocate but will strike only in defense. Zelensky suggested extending the ceasefire beyond Easter Day to demonstrate Russia's genuine intentions, while also noting ongoing Russian assaults along the front line. Previous ceasefire attempts have failed, and Ukrainian officials expressed skepticism about Russia's commitment.</p>

            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to open at 750 schools across England next week, offering half an hour of free morning childcare. The trial program, running until July, aims to provide additional hours of childcare and reduce costs for parents. While the expansion is welcomed, teaching unions have voiced concerns that government funding may be insufficient to cover the full costs. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the move would help remove barriers to opportunity.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a non-nuclear hydrogen-based explosive device, triggering devastating chemical chain reactions without using nuclear materials. The 2kg bomb generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds, significantly longer than TNT blasts, using a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, releases hydrogen gas upon activation by conventional explosives, creating a sustained inferno. This technology was initially designed for clean energy applications in off-grid areas.</p>
