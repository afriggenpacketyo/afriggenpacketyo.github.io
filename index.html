          <p>A woman in her 40s and her two children have been killed in a shooting incident at their home in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh. Police have launched a murder investigation into the deaths, which have deeply shocked the rural community. Two of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while a third passed away later in the hospital. A fourth member of the household, an adult male, is being treated for serious injuries. Authorities described the scene as harrowing and noted there was a limited domestic history involving the family, with no arrests currently anticipated.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 12:45:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice has affirmed that countries have a legal obligation to combat climate change and can be sued for failing to do so. The non-binding ruling is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly low-lying island states that initiated the case out of frustration with global inaction. The court stated that existing international laws, including the Paris Agreement, require countries to implement their most ambitious climate plans. This decision could pave the way for future compensation claims against nations with high historical emissions, setting a new precedent in international environmental law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade agreement with Japan, its fifth-largest trading partner, establishing a 15% tariff rate on Japanese imports. This rate is lower than the previously threatened 25% but higher than the standard 10% for most imports. A key concession involves setting a 15% tariff on Japanese cars, a significant reduction from the 25% applied to vehicles from other nations. In return, Japan has agreed to open its markets to certain U.S. agricultural products and has pledged to invest $550 billion in the American economy, according to the White House.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debate if Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales Would Ease Housing Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate experts are analyzing a proposal to eliminate the capital gains tax on home sales, a move floated by President Trump as a way to increase housing inventory. The National Association of Realtors supports the change, arguing that the current tax deters many homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling. However, some analysts are skeptical, suggesting the tax primarily affects higher-end homeowners and that broader economic confidence is more crucial for the market. They argue that policy instability creates uncertainty, which discourages potential buyers from making large financial commitments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German cabinet has approved a new law designed to accelerate the procurement of weapons and equipment for its military, the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the move as a "quantum leap" for national security, aimed at cutting bureaucratic red tape in response to the perceived threat from Russia. The legislation will raise value limits for direct contracts, facilitating faster acquisitions and simplifying cooperation with innovative defense startups. While the government says the changes are vital for strengthening NATO's defense capacity, critics from opposition parties have called the measures inadequate or a gateway to wasteful spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more consumers rely on credit cards amidst rising inflation, understanding minimum payments is crucial for managing debt. For a $2,000 balance with a 22% APR, the minimum payment typically ranges from $40 to $60, depending on the issuer's formula, which is often a percentage of the balance plus interest. While making the minimum payment keeps an account in good standing, it is an expensive long-term strategy due to compounding interest. Experts advise paying more than the minimum whenever possible to reduce the principal balance faster and save significantly on total interest charges over time.</p>

Health officials believe the exposure likely occurred at Lake Murray, marking the state's first known case since 2016. The infection, which has a fatality rate greater than 97%, occurs when contaminated water is forced up the nose, allowing the amoeba to enter the brain.

          <p>With lenders tightening underwriting standards, qualifying for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more challenging. Financial experts advise that if an application is denied, the first step is to ask the lender for the specific reasons, which often relate to high debt-to-income ratios, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score. To improve approval odds, homeowners should focus on reducing debt and boosting their credit score. If a HELOC remains out of reach, alternatives include home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans, though each has distinct requirements and potential drawbacks.</p>
