          <p>Rod Stewart has canceled several US concerts due to the flu, ahead of his scheduled performance at the Glastonbury Festival later this month. Stewart expressed his apologies to fans via Instagram, citing his devastation for any inconvenience caused. The canceled dates include shows in Las Vegas and Stateline, Nevada, with two California shows to be rescheduled. Despite scaling back on large-scale tours starting in 2026, Stewart affirmed his readiness to perform at Glastonbury, where he will be the first artist to headline and play the legends slot, performing with his former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood. The festival's headliners this year include The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo, and Stewart is scheduled for an hour and a quarter on the Pyramid Stage, though he has requested an extra fifteen minutes.</p>

          <p>A report by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) highlights Cameroon as the world's most neglected refugee crisis, characterized by a significant disparity between the gravity of the situation and the political, media, and financial attention it receives. More than 1.1 million people are internally displaced, with an additional 480,000 refugees from neighboring countries seeking refuge in Cameroon due to two major conflicts: a civil war in the western part of the country and destabilization in the Lake Chad region caused by Islamist militants. The NRC criticizes the lack of political will and insufficient aid funding, noting that only 45% of the required assistance is provided. The report underscores the urgent need for renewed political, humanitarian, and media focus to address the dire conditions faced by displaced populations, emphasizing that increased military spending overshadows humanitarian aid, making the crises solvable with sufficient political will.</p>

          <p>A series of ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles triggered protests and strong reactions from elected officials and community members who criticized the actions as cruel and terrorizing to the immigrant community. Federal agents executed search warrants at multiple locations, resulting in the arrest of 44 people for administrative violations and one for obstruction. Protests erupted after the raids, with hundreds gathering to condemn the actions and demand the release of SEIU California President David Huerta, who was injured and detained while documenting a raid. Elected officials denounced the raids, while federal authorities defended their actions, stating that Huerta obstructed federal agents executing a lawful warrant. The LAPD stated they were aware of ICE operations but not involved in civil immigration enforcement, aiming to protect all residents regardless of immigration status.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted final approval to a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year, and allocates $2.7 billion to be paid over the next decade to former players previously barred from revenue sharing. Payouts will vary based on the sport and career length, with football and men's basketball players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each, and the highest payout estimated at nearly $2 million. The agreement resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, and also calls for a clearinghouse to ensure NIL deals are valued at fair market value (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Iran has strongly criticized the US travel ban on Iranians and citizens of 11 other predominantly Middle Eastern and African countries, labeling it as a manifestation of a racist mentality. The travel ban, enacted through an executive order by President Trump, revives restrictions justified on national security grounds. An Iranian foreign ministry official stated that the policy violates international law by denying travel rights based solely on nationality or religion. The US ban affects nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, and the Iranian official asserted that the ban would entail international responsibility for the US government. The US is home to the largest Iranian community outside Iran, estimated at around 1.5 million people in 2020.</p>

          <p>Muhammed Asif Hafeez, a businessman known for his involvement in polo and connections with the British elite, was sentenced to 16 years in a New York prison for conspiring to import drugs into the US. Hafeez, who presented himself as an informant to authorities, was in reality a major drug trafficker known as "the Sultan," overseeing a vast empire supplying heroin, methamphetamine, and hashish from Pakistan and India. He used his legitimate businesses, including a company selling equipment to militaries and a polo services company, to maintain a luxury lifestyle and gain access to exclusive circles. A sting operation by the DEA, involving an undercover buyer from Colombia, led to Hafeez's extradition from the UK in 2023 and subsequent guilty plea, revealing his double life and criminal activities.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. He appeared in federal court in Nashville, with his arraignment set for June 13, and will remain in federal custody until then. Abrego Garcia is accused of smuggling undocumented migrants into the US between 2016 and earlier this year, though his lawyer calls the charges baseless. The US Supreme Court ordered Trump to facilitate Garcia's return after Washington admitted to an administrative error that led to his deportation, and if convicted, Abrego Garcia will be deported to El Salvador after completing his sentence in the US.</p>

While Yoon emphasized stronger military cooperation with the US and Japan, Lee is likely to focus on improving relations with both China and North Korea.

The scheme, which began as a "joke," resulted in profits estimated at over €3 million, and Versailles was among the institutions deceived, acquiring some of the fake pieces for its museum collection.

          <p>Lebanon is making efforts to attract wealthy tourists from Gulf countries in an attempt to revitalize its war-torn economy. With Hezbollah weakened after last year's war with Israel, Lebanon's leaders are aiming to disarm the group and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations. The goal is to lift travel bans and restore tourism, which once contributed significantly to Lebanon's economy. While some Gulf countries have lifted travel bans, Saudi Arabia's decision is still pending, and the country is also in talks with the IMF for a recovery plan to address corruption and improve public services.</p>

          <p>MI5 provided false information to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO), leading the watchdog to rewrite a report on the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent. An early draft contradicted MI5's false evidence given in court, but the final version did not, and the director general of MI5 apologized to IPCO after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements. The false evidence was provided in a case involving an agent known as X, who informed on extremist networks and used his role to terrorize his then-girlfriend. IPCO's role is to inspect MI5's use of investigatory powers, and the incident raises questions about IPCO's ability to hold MI5 accountable.</p>

          <p>While tech billionaires focus on extending lifespan through technology, life expectancy is declining in some high-income countries. The emphasis on personal responsibility for health distracts from the importance of public policy, infrastructure, and community in affecting health chances and longevity. In places where people live longer, healthier lives, such as Japan and South Korea, healthy living is normalized by government and culture. Achieving longevity requires a collective responsibility, including policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water, which should be at the core of what a government provides its citizens.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron have emphasized the need for Europe to shape the emerging international order rather than simply accepting its consequences. The EU seeks to foster economic concessions from China in exchange for improved political relations, as it navigates between the two global superpowers.</p>

          <p>A man in southern England discovered that his father had been swapped at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago, after noticing discrepancies in his family history and DNA matches. The man's father, who had brown eyes and black hair, looked nothing like his blue-eyed, blond-haired parents, leading to a running joke in the family. The discovery was made possible through DNA testing and genealogy databases, revealing that another baby boy had been registered at the same hospital on the same day with a similar surname. The incident highlights the rare but increasingly uncovered cases of babies being accidentally switched in maternity wards before the implementation of modern identification practices.</p>
