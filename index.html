          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, declaring it a "spectacular military success." All U.S. planes have safely exited Iranian airspace after dropping a full payload of bombs on Fordow. Trump warned Iran against retaliation, stating that any such action would be met with even greater force. The U.S. has reportedly informed Iran through diplomatic channels that these strikes are the extent of their planned actions, with no regime change efforts intended, and the strikes utilized the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, also known as a bunker-buster bomb. The strikes follow heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, and the international community is closely monitoring the situation for potential escalations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers across the political spectrum have offered mixed reactions. Congressional Republicans largely backed the president's actions, while many leading Democrats condemned the decision to launch the attack without consulting Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson supported the strikes, while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene argued "this is not our fight." Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer criticized Trump for not seeking congressional authorization, emphasizing the need for congressional oversight on matters of war, while other Congressional Democrats such as John Fetterman supported the strikes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state and mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. The four phasesâ€”1A, 1B, 2A, and 2Bâ€”overlap and transition sequentially, with specific molecular mechanisms triggering the next phase while suppressing others. This study redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast, which is a model organism used in the study of molecular life mechanisms, and it also highlights the interconnectedness of seemingly disparate fields of knowledge.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that U.S. airstrikes have "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's key nuclear facilities, marking Washington's entry into Israel's war against the Islamic Republic. Trump stated the U.S. objective was to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and halt the nuclear threat posed by the country. He warned of potentially "far greater" attacks if Iran refuses to pursue peace. The attacks targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, following a week of mixed signals from Trump and requests from Israel for U.S. military involvement. The U.S. joining Israel's war against Iran is expected to escalate tensions, possibly including strikes on American troops and military bases in the Middle East.</p>

Prince William's 43rd birthday and his environmental work are also highlighted. The newspapers went to print before President Trump confirmed the U.S. had struck nuclear sites in Iran, but the announcement was picked up by news websites.</p>

          <p>The United States has engaged in a war in the Middle East by bombing Iran, a move that President Trump had previously vowed to avoid. The president's statement was contradictory, claiming the destruction of Iranian nuclear sites while also noting that "many targets" remain. The best-case scenario involves a humiliating end to Iran's nuclear ambitions and the fall of the mullahs, while the worst-case scenario involves Iran developing a bomb and retaliating against U.S. targets. A mixed outcome is most likely, where the Iranian program is delayed but continues, the region becomes more unstable, and diplomacy suffers, and this action was undertaken by a White House national-security team with unqualified appointees.</p>

          <p>President Trump ordered a U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities just two days after stating he would decide "within the next two weeks" whether to do so, ostensibly to give diplomacy a chance. Trump dismissed talks between European diplomats and Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, stating, "Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us." He also showcased distrust for his own intelligence community, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and the strikes came as a surprise after the recent statements regarding negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States has attacked Iranian nuclear sites, pushing America into Israel's war with its longtime rival. U.S. Navy submarines launched more than 30 Tomahawk missiles into Iran, and Trump stated the U.S. and Israel worked as a team to erase the threat to the American ally. He warned Iran of potential future attacks if it does not make peace. This action marks a massive escalation in U.S. involvement with Israel's effort to cripple Tehran's nuclear program, and it marks a major shift from just 48 hours ago, when Trump said the United States would take "two weeks" to see if the conflict between Israel and Iran could be resolved diplomatically.</p>

          <p>The United States has launched strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, escalating the conflict between Israel and Iran. President Trump announced the action, describing it as a "very successful" operation, and Democrats and some Republicans have criticized the strike. B-2 stealth bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles were used in the attacks, targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Trump warned that Iran must now "make peace" or face future attacks, and the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the strikes as a violation of international law.</p>

Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Jane continued to advocate for her innocence and sought to reexamine the evidence used to convict her.

Only the US was considered to have a "bunker buster" bomb strong and large enough to destroy Fordo, and MOPs were used in the strikes, with two for each target struck.
