        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New Orleans Police Department's use of facial recognition technology, particularly through its partnership with Project N.O.L.A., has sparked controversy during the manhunt for escaped inmates. Despite the police department's initial distancing from Project N.O.L.A., the organization's cameras aided in the recapture of one fugitive. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, raise constitutional and privacy concerns about the unchecked use of live facial recognition, arguing that it poses a threat to individual rights. The article highlights the debate over the balance between public safety and surveillance in modern policing.</p>

          <p>The Army is investigating an incident where air traffic controllers lost contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon, resulting in two commercial jets aborting their landings. The loss of contact, attributed to a temporary antenna, caused confusion among air traffic controllers who struggled to pinpoint the helicopter's location. This incident adds to concerns about air safety near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, especially after a deadly midair collision earlier in the year. The NTSB was not briefed on the Army's findings and expressed disappointment at the Army for releasing investigative information through a media exclusive rather than providing it directly to them.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Sakana AI K.K., a Japanese AI startup backed by Nvidia, is advocating for the Japanese government to prioritize the development of its own AI technology for defense purposes. With increasing global instability, the company sees an opportunity to collaborate with the government on defense-related solutions. The CEO emphasized that technology plays a crucial role in bolstering IT infrastructure and cybersecurity, and AI is a core part of that. He suggests that Japan should develop its own AI for defense purposes because the United States has become more U.S.-centric.</p>

The film is a warm romance that will make any bookish dreamer swoon, as Agathe experiences her own Austenesque tumble.

          <p>Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to offer consumers an alternative amidst rising domestic rice prices. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than Japanese-grown rice. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest, as they can no longer purchase rice as before due to higher prices, with the average price of rice at Japanese supermarkets reaching a record high.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has called for a trade deal with the US based on mutual respect, not threats, after President Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the EU. Trump expressed impatience with the pace of ongoing EU-US trade negotiations. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, and they are maintaining the same line: de-escalation, but they are ready to respond.</p>

The concert, Kneecap's first big gig since the investigation was launched, followed a smaller "secret" set at London's 100 club the night before.</p>
