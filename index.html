          <p>Chloe Childress, a counselor at Camp Mystic and an incoming University of Texas student, was among those killed in the catastrophic flash floods in Hunt, Texas. She is remembered by her high school community as a compassionate and empathetic leader who had a remarkable ability to make others feel valued. According to the school's head, she was a loyal friend who led with honesty and resilience, and she lost her life while selflessly committed to helping others. The floods have claimed at least 78 lives, with many still missing in the region.</p>

          <p>The most recent round of indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, held in Doha, has ended without a significant breakthrough. Mediated by Qatar and Egypt, the talks saw messages exchanged but failed to narrow the gap between the two sides' positions. Hamas continues to insist on a permanent end to hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal, conditions that Israel has previously rejected. The talks are expected to resume, occurring as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to meet with President Trump in Washington.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced that new tariffs on goods from U.S. trade partners, previously paused until July 9, will now be delayed until August 1. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified the new effective date, while President Trump stated letters dictating the new rates would be sent out. The extension offers countries a further three-week reprieve but also plunges importers into a prolonged period of uncertainty. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested several trade agreements could be announced soon, as the administration applies pressure on partners to finalize deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK's counter-terrorism apparatus is far more sophisticated, but it confronts a threat that is more complex and fragmented than ever. This analysis explores the evolution from organized al-Qaeda cells to the rise of self-radicalized, "DIY" attackers inspired by ISIS and the far-right. While new laws and better intelligence sharing have thwarted dozens of plots, the rapid, internet-fueled nature of modern extremism presents a persistent and challenging danger for security services and the public.</p>

The future of this foundational pact for scientific collaboration is seen as a bellwether for how much the U.S. is willing to engage with its primary strategic competitor.</p>
