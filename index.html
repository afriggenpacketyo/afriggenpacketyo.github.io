        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate fell short in an attempt to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs, highlighting anxieties about the potential disruption to the U.S. economy. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs, but faced strong Republican opposition. Despite the symbolic nature of the vote, it underscores the ongoing debate over the economic impact of the tariffs, especially as economic growth slows and businesses express concerns about their effects. Speaker Mike Johnson suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road, while emphasizing the executive branch's authority on trade.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have signed a joint economic investment deal, granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earths minerals and establishing a "United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund." The agreement aims to develop mineral, oil, and gas projects in Ukraine through direct investment and future U.S. aid. This partnership is intended to help diversify and secure supply chains essential to U.S. economic prosperity and national security. President Trump has framed this deal as a way for Ukraine to repay the U.S. for military aid, while Ukraine retains ownership of its natural resources and reinvests profits into its economy.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's cloud computing unit has released its Qwen3 family of AI models, featuring enhanced capabilities and a wide range of parameters. Analysts believe these models demonstrate that Chinese companies are significantly narrowing the technological gap with their U.S. counterparts. Despite U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, the pace of innovation in China's AI sector is expected to continue, fueled by the growing availability of alternative AI chips from domestic suppliers like Huawei and Cambricon Technologies. This development underscores China's resilience and growing competitiveness in the global AI landscape.</p>

          <p>Waiters, dealers, and bartenders in Las Vegas are still awaiting the fulfillment of President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, which form a significant part of their income. With inflation increasing the cost of living, the potential tax relief would free up hundreds of dollars each month for tipped workers. While the White House claims to be working with Congress, two bills are under consideration: the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act and the House Tips Act, which also proposes replacing the sub-minimum wage with the federal minimum. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests that revenue from tariffs could fund the plan inside a sweeping tax package due this summer.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article analyzes the recent report of economic contraction in the first quarter, highlighting the political risks for President Trump as he pursues an aggressive trade war. The contraction, coupled with a sharp decline in stock prices, has created uncertainty among businesses and consumers. Some of Trump's economic advisors recognize that the timing and execution of his tariff announcements could prove to be colossal mistakes, even if they applaud the underlying strategy. While Trump insists that his trade deals will bring manufacturing back to the United States and usher in a new age of prosperity, the economic pain of the tariffs could start within months, with upward pressure on prices and shortages of both industrial and consumer products made abroad.</p>

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board has voted in favor of higher rents for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords. The preliminary vote suggests increases between 1.75 and 4.75 percent on one-year leases and between 4.75 and 7.75 percent for two-year leases. Tenant advocates argue the increases will worsen the housing crisis, while landlords claim the adjustments are insufficient to cover rising expenses. The final decision, expected in the next two months, will likely reflect the priorities of Mayor Eric Adams, who has been more supportive of landlords than his predecessor.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025, with the gross domestic product decreasing at a 0.3% annual rate, as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. This slowdown comes amid growing concerns that the tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of a recession. While the tariffs were announced after the end of the quarter, businesses sought to mitigate their impact by front-loading purchases early in the year. Economists caution that the figures may be noisy due to the surge in imports, but concerns about the tariffs caused businesses and consumers to change their behavior.</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths. This seals a deal that Donald Trump has said will provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine’s defense and its reconstruction after he brokers a peace deal with Russia. The minerals deal will establish a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that the Trump administration has said will begin to repay an estimated $175bn in aid provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war. The deal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament.</p>

          <p>David Horowitz, a former Marxist who became an outspoken conservative author and activist, has died at the age of 86. Horowitz was known for his sharp political about-face, arguing against the Black Lives Matter movement, opposing Palestinian rights, and falsely claiming that Trump won the 2020 election. He was a mentor to Stephen Miller, a top domestic policy advisor for Trump. Before his turn to the far right, Horowitz was a mainstream conservative who believed that the New Left movement was too wrapped up in fantasies of revolution to see the Panthers as thugs.</p>
