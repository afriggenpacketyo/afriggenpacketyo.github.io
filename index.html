          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, a claim that has drawn strong opposition from medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue. Scientific bodies like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, along with major studies, assert there is no credible evidence supporting this connection. Health professionals express concern that such an announcement could cause pregnant women to avoid the safest available pain reliever for conditions like fever, which itself poses risks to fetal development, or turn to less safe alternatives.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction against the Trump administration's order to stop construction on the Revolution Wind farm off the coast of New England, allowing work to resume. The project's developer, Orsted, had sued the Interior Department, arguing the stop-work order was unlawful and issued in bad faith for a project that is already 80% complete. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the offshore wind industry in the United States, which it has described as too expensive and unreliable.</p>

          <p>Seven charitable organizations have severed ties with Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, after a 2011 email surfaced in which she referred to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and Julia's House children's hospice, deemed it inappropriate for her to continue in her role as patron or ambassador. A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent in an attempt to mitigate a legal threat from Epstein and that she still deeply regrets any association with him.</p>

New leadership is refocusing on core sports categories, rebuilding retail partnerships, and working to clear excess inventory, with recent analyst upgrades suggesting growing confidence in the company's recovery ahead of its next earnings report.

          <p>Stephen Miran, a new Trump appointee to the Federal Reserve's board, is publicly advocating for more aggressive interest rate cuts, diverging from the central bank's recent cautious approach. Last week, Miran was the sole dissenter in the Fed's decision, favoring a half-point cut instead of the quarter-point reduction that was approved. He argues that rates should be below 3% by year's end and dismisses concerns that tariffs are fueling inflation, cementing his role as a dissenting voice aligned with the president's economic views.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments for home equity loans have become slightly more affordable for homeowners. For a $100,000 loan, current rates result in monthly payments of approximately $1,236 for a 10-year term and $974 for a 15-year term, a modest decrease from earlier in the year. While the savings are not substantial yet, further anticipated rate cuts could make these borrowing options even cheaper, though variable-rate HELOCs may see more immediate benefits from future reductions.

          <h2>Essay Argues Bad Bunny's Producers Deserved Latin Grammy Nominations</h2>

          <p>An essay argues that despite Bad Bunny's album "Debí Tirar Más Fotos" receiving top Latin Grammy nominations, his longtime producers Tainy and MAG were unfairly snubbed in the producer of the year category. The author connects this oversight to a broader history of the Latin Academy marginalizing genres like reggaetón and música Mexicana, which have roots in working-class and Black communities. The piece contends that for the Latin Grammys to be truly representative, it must recognize the innovative contributions of producers who have been instrumental in propelling Latin music to global success.</p>

          <p>A BBC undercover investigation at Castlehill Care Home in Inverness, Scotland, has revealed serious care failures, prompting accusations of "neglect" and "cruelty" from residents' families. A reporter working as a cleaner for seven weeks witnessed vulnerable elderly residents left in soiled clothes for hours, staff shortages leading to distress, and inadequate medical care. Secret filming by one family also showed a resident being mistreated, leading to a formal complaint and the dismissal of a staff member. The home, which was already under scrutiny by regulators, has faced numerous upheld complaints this year.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the top-selling beer in the U.S., overtaking Modelo Especial, according to recent sales data. This marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline coincides with challenges for its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and weaker spending among its core Hispanic consumer base. The shift in market leadership reflects changing consumer preferences and the ongoing competitive dynamics within the American beer industry.</p>

          <p>A violent riot between rival gangs at a prison in Machala, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of 13 inmates and one guard, with another 14 people injured.

The incident is the latest in a series of deadly conflicts within Ecuador's overcrowded and gang-controlled prison system. The country has been under a state of "internal armed conflict" since January to combat rampant gang violence.</p>

          <p>The health and beauty chain Bodycare is closing all its remaining 56 stores in the UK, resulting in the loss of 444 jobs, after administrators failed to find a buyer for the business.

Founded in 1970, the retailer faced intense competition from larger chains, supermarkets, and online sellers. This collapse follows the loss of over 1,000 jobs since the company first entered administration earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it will discontinue its annual Household Food Security Report, a key data source used for 30 years to measure hunger and shape policy. The Trump administration described the survey as "redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous." Anti-hunger advocates argue that eliminating the report will leave policymakers blind to the scale of food insecurity, especially as expanded work requirements for SNAP benefits are projected to remove millions from food aid. The cancellation comes after the 2023 report showed the highest rate of food insecurity since 2014.</p>

As a traditional safe-haven asset, gold tends to perform well during periods of low interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. Most financial experts recommend investing through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), as they are more liquid and cost-effective than owning physical bullion.

          <p>Amid reports that the Trump administration may claim a link between paracetamol (acetaminophen) use in pregnancy and autism, a review of scientific evidence shows no causal connection. While some studies have suggested a correlation, they fail to account for confounding factors like genetics or the underlying reason for medication use. A large-scale Swedish study involving 2.5 million children found that the apparent link disappeared when comparing siblings, strongly suggesting other factors are at play. Health authorities continue to recommend paracetamol as the safest painkiller for pregnant women.</p>
