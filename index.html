        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing. Authorities believe Bartkus, who held anti-natalist views, died in the explosion after loading his car with explosives and intentionally targeting the clinic. Bartkus' father, Richard Bartkus, stated that his son changed after moving to Twentynine Palms and expressed shock, noting his son previously enjoyed making harmless smoke bombs as a child. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism and seeking public assistance to fill gaps in the timeline of Bartkus' movements prior to the bombing.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is Stage 4, which means it has spread. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joseph R. Biden's diagnosis of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, experts emphasize that while the cancer is serious and incurable, advances in treatment now extend survival by years. Cutting off testosterone is the first line of attack, using drugs to block its production. Additional treatments like chemotherapy or radiation may also be used, depending on the cancer's spread. Federal research funding, particularly through Mr. Biden's cancer moonshot effort, has contributed to these advancements. Survival rates have almost tripled in the last decade.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis was made after he experienced urinary symptoms. The cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9 out of 10, indicating a more aggressive form of the disease. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options. Support has come from both sides of the aisle, including President Donald Trump and former Vice-President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Portugal's right-of-center Democratic Alliance won snap parliamentary elections, but again fell short of a majority. Its leader, Luís Montenegro, promised to stimulate investment and guarantee prosperity and social justice. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos resigned after his party lost seats and ended up neck-and-neck with the far-right Chega. The Socialists could slip behind Chega when results from voters abroad are tallied, mirroring last year's election results.</p>

          <p>A day after a Mexican sailing vessel collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, killing two crew members, an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the accident. The Cuauhtémoc, a 300-foot long ship, struck the bridge after experiencing mechanical issues, causing its masts to snap. Senator Chuck Schumer called for a thorough investigation, questioning the role of a tugboat and potential impacts from Coast Guard staffing cuts.
