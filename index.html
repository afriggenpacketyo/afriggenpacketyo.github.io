          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary figure, is being remembered 150 years after his birth as a voice for democracy and a conscience of a nation during Nazi rule. Mann gained global recognition for works like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," and he used his platform to critique the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust. After escaping Germany in the 1930s, Mann emigrated to the US and delivered radio speeches to his compatriots, urging resistance against fascism. His literature and unwavering stance against authoritarianism have solidified his lasting legacy as a courageous and influential figure.</p>

          <p>Tesla experienced a rebound in Australian sales in May, reaching its highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. Despite global headwinds and declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, Tesla's Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, primarily due to a 122.5% year-over-year increase in Model Y sales. However, year-to-date sales in Australia remain down 48.2% compared to the same period last year, and the company faces increased competition and reputational challenges linked to CEO Elon Musk.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights activist, in a move officials say aligns with the administration's goal to "re-establish the warrior culture." The decision is part of a broader effort to remove references to diversity, equity, and inclusion from the Department of Defense. Former officials and politicians have criticized the move, arguing that it disrespects Milk's legacy and the values he stood for. The ship was originally named in 2016 to honor leaders who fought for civil and human rights.</p>
