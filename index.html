          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to the employment of his son-in-law at a now-defunct Thai airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law received approximately $150,000 in salary and allowances from the airline between 2018 and 2020, considered a bribe paid by a South Korean businessman and former lawmaker who controlled the airline. This indictment adds Moon to the list of former South Korean leaders facing criminal investigations, a recurring pattern in the country's political landscape. The case highlights ongoing concerns about corruption and influence peddling within South Korea's highest offices.</p>

          <p>A Chinese official has stated that there are currently no trade negotiations between China and the U.S., dismissing claims of progress as "fake news."

This stance underscores the continued friction in trade relations between the two economic giants, despite some hopes for de-escalation.

Police will issue "blue tickets" for over 100 violations to individuals aged 16 and older, allowing them to avoid indictment by paying a fine. This measure aims to address the rising number of accidents involving cyclists, particularly as bicycle commuting has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised law also requires cyclists to keep to the left and vehicles to pass bicycles safely.</p>

          <p>Sophie Lloyd, a magician who initially tricked her way into the men-only Magic Circle by disguising herself as a man in 1991, is finally being granted membership. Lloyd's deception was revealed after the Circle announced it would admit women, leading to her expulsion. Now, after a public search, the Magic Circle has apologized and is presenting her with a membership certificate. This event marks a significant step towards inclusivity for the Magic Circle and recognizes Lloyd's role as a pioneer for women in magic.</p>

          <p>Denise Fergus, the mother of murdered toddler James Bulger, is urging the government to enact a new law to curb AI-generated videos depicting child murder victims. She cited the distress caused by videos showing digital clones of her son discussing his abduction and murder. While existing laws like the Online Safety Act are intended to address harmful content, Fergus believes they do not go far enough to prevent the misuse of AI for such purposes. This advocacy highlights the need for stronger legal protections against the exploitation of victims' images and stories through artificial intelligence.</p>
