          <p>North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, citing growing partisanship in Washington. His decision follows a public clash with former President Donald Trump, who criticized Tillis for voting against a key procedural step for his signature spending bill. Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in his statement, while Trump had already vowed to support a primary challenger against him. The retirement sets up a potentially competitive Senate race in the key battleground state.</p>

This activity comes as Nvidia's stock has surged, briefly regaining its position as the world's most valuable company.

The Tijuana native expressed deep frustration with the world of boxing, stating she has been denied a deserved opportunity to unify her title against the current champion, Gabriela Fundora. Feeling that boxing's sanctioning bodies were protecting the champion and stalling her career, EnrÃ­quez decided to transition to MMA, where she has already had one successful fight.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States is dangerously dependent on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. The author contends that despite knowing about this vulnerability for over 15 years, successive U.S. administrations have failed to create a secure, independent supply chain. China's recent export controls are presented as a clear sign of its willingness to weaponize this dependence. The article calls for a long-term, coherent national strategy that treats critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power to escape China's economic and strategic leverage.

Mamdani, who recently won the Democratic primary, responded by reaffirming his commitment to taxing the wealthy and stating he doesn't believe billionaires should exist, while also denying Trump's claim that he is a communist.

          <p>The Democratic nomination of Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor highlights a significant ideological shift within the party, particularly in America's most Jewish city. Mamdani, an outspoken critic of Israel's government, secured the nomination despite his controversial stances, indicating that such positions are no longer a disqualifier for many Democratic voters. His victory over more moderate candidates reflects a growing disillusionment with Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza, especially among younger, progressive voters. The result has alarmed some in the Jewish community while being celebrated by others as a rejection of single-issue politics.</p>

          <p>Amidst rising temperatures, animal welfare charity the RSPCA is reminding pet owners that dogs are highly susceptible to heat-related illnesses, which can be fatal. The organization stresses that dogs cannot regulate their body temperature effectively and can overheat quickly, especially during exercise. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling. The article advises owners to avoid walking dogs in hot weather, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water and shade. If a dog shows signs of overheating, immediate cooling measures and veterinary attention are critical.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking aim at federal energy efficiency regulations, including the popular Energy Star program, which helps consumers identify energy-saving appliances. Following an executive order from the president, the Department of Energy and the EPA are planning to eliminate or modify dozens of rules governing appliances and plumbing fixtures. This move has drawn criticism from consumer protection groups and some manufacturers, who argue it could lead to higher utility bills and remove a trusted tool for comparison shopping. Supporters of the deregulation, however, see it as a way to reduce government overreach and increase consumer choice.</p>
