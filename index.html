          <p>A Chinese research team, comprising experts from the Beijing Institute of Technology and Guilin University of Electronic Technology, has successfully developed a novel blockchain technology engineered to resist potential attacks from quantum computers. This advancement addresses a critical vulnerability, as current blockchain encryption methods are susceptible to sophisticated quantum computing capabilities, which could undermine the security of decentralized ledgers used in finance and supply chains. The new technology seeks to ensure the long-term integrity and tamper-proof nature of digital records, a crucial step for future digital security and trust. This significant innovation aims to future-proof blockchain infrastructure against emerging cyber threats, providing a more robust foundation for its widespread application and global adoption.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi recently informed an EU delegation, led by top diplomat Kaja Kallas, that Europe's current challenges do not stem from Beijing, explicitly stating, "China is not the United States." Wang emphasized China's diplomatic approach, which upholds principles of peace, tolerance, and cooperation, asserting its superior track record among major powers on matters of peace and security. He urged Europe not to perceive China as an adversary solely due to differing histories, cultures, or values, nor to seek confrontation over disagreements. This communication aims to strengthen China-Europe ties by distinguishing Beijing's international posture from that of Washington and fostering a more cooperative relationship.</p>

          <p>Seven individuals are currently unaccounted for following a series of explosions and a large fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, Yolo County, Northern California. The incident, which began Tuesday evening at Devastating Pyrotechnics, prompted mandatory evacuations in the vicinity and resulted in multiple grass fires spanning approximately 80 acres. While two people were reported injured and no confirmed fatalities have occurred, explosions continued into Wednesday night. The Yolo County Sheriff's Office and Cal Fire are investigating the cause of the blaze at the facility, which is licensed for fireworks import, export, and public displays.

          <p>Firefighters on Greece's largest island, Crete, battled a rapidly spreading forest fire overnight, leading to the evacuation of residents and tourists from several south coast settlements, including the popular resort of Achlia. Strong winds rekindled the blaze, making containment extremely difficult, according to local officials. While some individuals received treatment for breathing difficulties, no serious injuries were immediately reported, and at least 1,500 people were moved to temporary shelters. Water-dropping planes and helicopters were grounded overnight, further complicating efforts. This latest wildfire comes as Europe experiences a historic heatwave, exacerbating the risk of such natural disasters and posing significant challenges for emergency services.</p>

The pilot reported engine trouble shortly after takeoff, attempting to return to the airport but failing to land successfully. Three people were transported to a trauma center with severe or critical injuries, while eight were treated for less serious injuries, and four had minor injuries. Emergency responders declared a mass casualty incident, crediting a recent mass casualty training exercise at the airport for the coordinated and effective response.

          <p>President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a comprehensive tax-cut and spending package, has stalled in the House of Representatives due to a handful of Republican holdouts. Despite Trump's public pressure and a procedural vote being held open for over seven hours, five Republican defectors prevented a preliminary measure from passing. The bill, which narrowly cleared the Senate, proposes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and increased spending on defense and border security, offset by significant cuts to healthcare programs like Medicaid, which could impact millions of people. This legislative setback threatens Trump's self-imposed July 4 deadline for the bill's final approval, highlighting internal party divisions. (not investment advice)</p>

Starmer took responsibility for the chaotic episode, acknowledging it had been a "tough" few days but expressed confidence the government would emerge stronger.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw has solidified his status as the greatest pitcher in Los Angeles Dodgers history, surpassing even Sandy Koufax, following his 3,000th career strikeout against the Chicago White Sox. This milestone, achieved in his 18th season, underscores his remarkable longevity and consistency, having pitched significantly more innings and recorded more strikeouts than Koufax. While Koufax had a more dominant, albeit shorter, peak, Kershaw's enduring flame and continuous presence have shaped the Dodgers' golden era. His professionalism, work ethic, and accountability have made him a cornerstone of the team's culture for nearly two decades, earning him a place among baseball's elite and a likely statue at Dodger Stadium.</p>

This renewed interest is attributed to Beijing's supportive regulatory policies, a muted pace of A-share listings, abundant market liquidity, and delisting concerns in U.S. markets. The trend reflects Chinese firms' strategy to expand globally and diversify funding, particularly through A-to-H dual listings, leveraging Hong Kong's more fungible currency.

          <p>Key evidence, including DNA from a Q-tip and a meticulously cleaned car, linked Bryan Kohberger to the murders of four University of Idaho students. Lead prosecutor Bill Thompson detailed how investigators used cell phone pings, surveillance footage, and DNA from a Q-tip retrieved from Kohberger's parents' trash to identify him. The article revealed that Kohberger, a criminology PhD student, entered the house through a sliding door, killed two victims, left a knife sheath with his DNA, then killed two more. His subsequent elaborate cover-up, including cleaning his car and changing registration, was also detailed. The plea deal avoids a trial, leaving motives unanswered.</p>
