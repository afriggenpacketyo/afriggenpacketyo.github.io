          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing, experts like Vardit Ravitsky caution against viewing it as a guaranteed solution for delaying childbearing. Egg freezing is expensive, costing upwards of $12,000 per cycle, and doesn't ensure a successful pregnancy. Ravitsky argues that society should focus on policies like paid parental leave and flexible work hours to support women having children at younger ages. While egg freezing provides options, it involves financial and medical risks with no guarantee of success.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular, offering women the opportunity to preserve their fertility and increase their chances of having children later in life. Women who choose egg freezing report feeling less pressure to find partners quickly and a reduced sense of urgency from their biological clocks. While success rates vary depending on age and the number of eggs frozen, some studies show that women who freeze at least 20 eggs before age 38 have a good chance of having a baby. The trend is growing, with younger women opting for egg freezing to align with their career and personal goals.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming more common as women seek to preserve their fertility, but the process is expensive, with a single cycle costing between $12,000 and $15,000, plus annual storage fees. The procedure involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and freezing, followed by thawing and fertilization when the woman is ready to conceive. Some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, but many women pay out of pocket. While egg freezing can provide peace of mind, experts caution that it is not a guarantee of future parenthood, and success rates vary with age and egg quality.</p>
