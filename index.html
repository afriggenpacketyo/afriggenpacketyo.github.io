          <p>Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning faced significant social media backlash following a tough game against the reigning champion Ohio State Buckeyes. Manning completed just 17 of 30 passes for 38 passing yards entering the fourth quarter, contributing to a 14-7 loss, a performance that fell far short of the high expectations for the top recruit. Fans on social media were quick to criticize his play, with some making harsh comments about his future prospects. This challenging outing, marked by a costly interception and a failed fourth-down conversion at the goal line, represents his most difficult college game to date, highlighting the intense scrutiny placed on young athletes with such prominent family legacies in sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed a sweeping executive order, the "Protecting Chicago Initiative," in anticipation of a potential federal agent deployment by the Trump administration for immigration enforcement. The order aims to protect residents' rights, requiring federal agents operating in the city to wear identification and prohibiting them from wearing masks, while also barring city police from cooperating with such federal actions. Johnson expressed strong opposition to any militarized presence, citing concerns about families being separated and the harassment of residents. This move underscores an escalating feud between local and federal authorities over immigration and crime policies, with the White House dismissing the order as a "publicity stunt" rather than a serious effort to address public safety.</p>

          <p>The temporary South Florida Detention Facility, controversially dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" and built in the Everglades, is in its final days following a judge's order for its closure. This facility became a polarizing symbol of the Trump administration's immigration policies, attracting both protests and support. Accounts from families of former detainees describe severe medical neglect and limited access to legal counsel, with one inmate allegedly left bleeding and denied proper hygiene after surgery. While the Department of Homeland Security disputes these claims, the facility's closure underscores the intense national debate surrounding the treatment of immigrants and the humanitarian conditions within U.S. detention centers.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States reported significant network issues on Saturday, with many mobile devices limited to SOS mode for several hours. The company acknowledged a "software issue impacting wireless service for some customers," stating that its engineers were actively working to identify and resolve the problem. Widespread outages were reported from California to Florida, with nearly 23,000 complaints registered on DownDetector. This incident caused considerable inconvenience and frustration for millions of users relying on their mobile services, marking a recurrence of a similar widespread outage experienced by Verizon in October 2024, raising concerns about network reliability.</p>

          <h2>Unregulated US Body Part Trade Raises Ethical Concerns and Exploitation Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 19:09:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The largely unregulated trade of human body parts in the U.S. is raising significant ethical concerns, with private "body brokers" acquiring, dissecting, and selling remains for profit to medical research and engineering firms. Unlike organ donation, which is strictly regulated, the sale of body parts for research operates in a legal grey area, allowing companies to charge "reasonable amounts" for "processing." This has led to horror stories of alleged mistreatment, such as a man's family discovering his body was "mutilated" after donation.

          <p>New government data from England indicates that pupils who were partially absent during the first week of the 2024-25 school year were significantly more likely to become "persistently absent" later on, missing at least 10% of school. Over half of those partially absent in week one became persistently absent, compared to only 14% of those who fully attended. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged parents and schools to prioritize attendance at the start of the 2025 term, emphasizing that every missed day impacts a child's future. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains higher than pre-Covid levels, prompting calls for more support beyond school gates to boost engagement.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst reportedly plans not to seek reelection in 2026, according to a senior Republican official, opening the door for a competitive Senate race. Ernst, who was first elected in 2014, made history as the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran. Representative Ashley Hinson is already planning to announce a run for the soon-to-be-open seat. During her time in the Senate, Ernst held leadership positions and advocated for federal budget cuts, though she also faced scrutiny over a vote for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth despite her record as a sexual assault prevention advocate.</p>

He suggested Trump's actions might be aimed at influencing future elections and constitute an "attack on the American people." The White House, in turn, criticized Pritzker for politicizing crime, while previous federal deployments in Los Angeles and D.C. have faced similar legal and political challenges and strong pushback from local officials.</p>

This initiative aims to reward the company's "most loyal members" but has sparked considerable controversy and division among its broader customer base.

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's highly anticipated Netflix adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, realizing a project he has envisioned for decades. The ambitious film stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature, a role Elordi took on short notice after Andrew Garfield's departure due to scheduling conflicts. Del Toro emphasized his vision for a "newborn" and "beautiful" creature, focusing on humanizing monsters and exploring the central question of what it means to be human. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its epic scale, artistic beauty, and emotional depth, while others found it somewhat safe or lacking substance, though most critics agreed it earned its significant runtime.</p>

A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report found "inconsistencies" in Pusser's accounts, with modern forensic science indicating Pauline was shot outside the vehicle and the crime scene was staged. Investigators now believe Pusser's own gunshot wound was likely self-inflicted and that Pauline had a prior nasal fracture from "interpersonal trauma." Prosecutors state there is probable cause for a murder indictment if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, finally bringing dignity and closure to Pauline's family.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebel movement confirmed that its self-proclaimed Prime Minister, Ahmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi, was killed in an Israeli air strike on Sanaa earlier this week. Several other senior Houthi officials, including foreign and justice ministers, were also reportedly killed or sustained serious injuries in the targeted gathering. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated they "eliminated" Rahawi and others based on intelligence, aiming to curtail Houthi attacks on Israel and commercial shipping. This incident marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, as the Iran-backed Houthis have been launching missiles at Israel and targeting Red Sea vessels in solidarity with Palestinians, prompting these retaliatory strikes from Israel.</p>

Transfer rumors link United to Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, indicating potential changes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that most of President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" are illegal, stating he overstepped presidential authority by imposing levies on numerous countries. The court found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, cited by Trump, does not grant the president the power to implement such broad tariffs, as this power is constitutionally reserved for Congress. This decision affects tariffs on goods from over 60 countries, including China, Canada, and Mexico, which Trump had justified by declaring trade deficits a national emergency. While Trump plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, his sector-specific tariffs (Section 232) on steel and aluminum remain unaffected. The ruling injects significant uncertainty into a core tenet of his economic agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite extensive research, there are no uniform international rules on safe screen time for children, as technology and social norms evolve rapidly. Experts generally agree on a precautionary principle, linking recommendations to developmental stages: "screen-free until age three," maximum 30 minutes for kindergarteners, and gradually increasing limits for older children. Concerns focus on how screen time replaces crucial developmental activities like motor skill development, social interaction, and language acquisition, with studies showing reduced parent-child verbal interaction. While acknowledging the benefits of technology, experts emphasize the importance of parental supervision, open communication, and setting clear boundaries to mitigate potential harms.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson warns that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could jeopardize the central bank's independence, with potentially damaging long-term economic consequences. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, highlights historical patterns in countries that lost institutional integrity, including weaker stock markets, higher inflation, and depreciating currencies. She cautions that while markets might initially react positively to lower rates, sustained inflation would ultimately harm consumption and earnings. Patterson believes replacing Cook would be Trump's initial step to stack the Fed with loyal policymakers, leading to a steeper yield curve, higher gold prices, and a weaker dollar.

Kennedy Jr. to resign as Health Secretary, accusing him of "endangering the health of the American people" and launching a "full-blown war on science, on public health and on truth itself." Sanders' op-ed in the New York Times cited Kennedy's longstanding anti-vaccine crusade and promotion of conspiracy theories, which led to the recent firing of CDC director Susan Monarez and resignations of other top officials. Sanders warned that Kennedy's policies would make it harder for Americans to access life-saving vaccines and could lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases.

However, councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne are pressing ahead, with Epping Forest considering an appeal to the Supreme Court.
