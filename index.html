          <p>The federal government will fly a migrant back to the U.S. after a judge ruled his deportation lacked due process. U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the man, known as O.C.G., to be returned after finding due process steps were ignored by the Trump administration. O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he sought asylum after violent attacks in Guatemala. The Justice Department admitted there was no witness to verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal.</p>
