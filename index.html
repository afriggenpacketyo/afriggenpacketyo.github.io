          <p>The Trump administration has launched investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review following allegations that the journal's article selection process favors authors based on race over merit. These investigations by the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services are in response to concerns that Harvard's policies may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race-based discrimination in federally funded programs. This action comes amid ongoing disputes between the administration and Harvard over DEI programs and ideological screening of international students, with $2.2 billion in grants already frozen due to concerns about antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson met with President Trump to strategize on the GOP's approach to budget reconciliation, aiming to reshape federal spending in line with the president's agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence in the unity among Republican leaders to pass a pro-growth tax package by July 4, focusing on tax cuts, job acts, and deregulation. While Republicans are pushing to cut $2 trillion from federal spending over the next decade, polls show a decline in public approval of Trump's performance, though Johnson remains optimistic about defending the GOP's congressional majority.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, is under scrutiny for potentially misleading claims about her medical degree and board certifications. While she claims to have a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, records indicate she graduated from the American University of the Caribbean (AUC) School of Medicine. Her LinkedIn profile and other statements have raised questions about her training, with medical ethicists emphasizing the importance of transparency and credibility for the Surgeon General role. Nesheiwat's nomination is further complicated by her past prescription of hydroxychloroquine and views that may conflict with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>New uncertainty surrounds the future of COVID-19 vaccines after the Trump administration imposed new requirements on Novavax, the nation's only traditional protein-based option. The FDA is reportedly asking Novavax to conduct a new clinical trial after granting full approval, raising questions about the process for updating other vaccines to address evolving strains. This move follows the ousting of the FDA's vaccine chief and concerns about Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s stance on vaccine safety, potentially leading to stricter requirements for all COVID-19 vaccines. The situation has sparked debate about whether annual strain updates should be treated as new products requiring extensive trials.</p>

This shift includes pursuing legal action against states allowing transgender athletes in girls' sports, withdrawing from a lawsuit against Georgia's voting laws, and investigating anti-Christian bias.

          <p>Canadians went to the polls to elect their next leader, a decision heavily influenced by President Trump's policies. Trump's imposition of tariffs and threats to annex Canada have shifted the focus of the election, with many voters viewing Liberal Party leader Mark Carney as the best candidate to defend the country against Trump's actions. The election outcome will determine who will navigate the complex relationship with the United States under Trump's leadership.</p>

          <p>Premiership Rugby is considering a revamp that could be implemented as early as next season, potentially including a qualification model based on financial sustainability, fanbase, and stadium criteria, rather than solely on-field performance. This change could pave the way for a resurrected Worcester Warriors to return to the top flight. Despite financial pressures, there is optimism surrounding the English top flight, with a potential broadcast deal and growing interest from younger audiences.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies and dismantling of governmental infrastructure have profoundly disrupted the global economic order. With actions including provoking trade wars, scrapping treaties, and questioning Washington's commitment to defending Europe, the changes have been substantial. While future elections could potentially reverse these policies, the deep-seated changes implemented by the Trump administration pose significant challenges for any subsequent attempts at restoration.</p>

          <p>Spain and Portugal are working to restore power after a widespread outage left millions without electricity, causing significant disruption.

As of Monday evening, 50% of power had been restored across Spain, and electricity had been restored to 750,000 customers in Portugal.</p>

          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to milkshakes and other milk-based drinks, aiming to reduce obesity. The so-called sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), already applies to manufacturers of fizzy drinks. The government also plans to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they are subject to the levy, from 5g to 4g per 100ml. The consultation will run until July 21, with the government estimating that 93% of milk-based drinks will be affected unless their sugar content is reduced.</p>

The movie blends live-action moviemaking with practical magic, emphasizing the tangible and lifelike quality of the puppeted ochi.

          <p>A college education, traditionally seen as a path to economic advancement, may not always be worth the investment, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Factors such as high out-of-pocket expenses, living on campus, extended graduation timelines, and chosen major can significantly impact the return on investment. While the typical college graduate sees a return of 12.5%, about 25% of graduates see little payoff, earning only slightly more than high school graduates.
