          <p>Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old college student, was released from ICE custody after being detained following a mistaken traffic stop in Georgia. Despite the local charges being dismissed, ICE initiated deportation proceedings against her, arguing she is in the U.S. illegally. Community members and a Republican lawmaker supported her release, citing her time in the U.S. since age four and lack of a criminal record. While released on bond, Arias Cristobal still faces deportation to Mexico, highlighting the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown that targets undocumented immigrants regardless of criminal history.</p>

Her stepfather, Peter Gregory Schuman, is also charged with conspiring with Brown.

Zhang, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1998, fears losing his home and research facility due to his nationality.

Federal authorities sought to deport him based on his role in protests against Israel's war in Gaza.

          <p>The CDC's airport screening program has detected cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., which is linked to a surge in China. Cases have been reported in international travelers arriving at airports in multiple states. Experts are closely monitoring the variant, which is now dominant in China and rising in parts of Asia. Preliminary data suggests the variant may be more transmissible but not better at evading the immune system. The FDA's vaccine advisers are considering updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming season to target the JN.1 variant.</p>
