          <p>This article explores whether gold is a suitable investment for beginners in the current economic climate. It advises new investors to consider their short-term financial goals, as gold is more of a wealth preserver than an income generator. The piece also highlights the metal's price volatility and the importance of viewing it as a tool for portfolio diversification, especially as a hedge against inflation. Prospective investors are encouraged to weigh these factors to determine if and how gold fits into their overall strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising colorectal cancer rates among younger people, health experts are highlighting four often-overlooked warning signs. These symptoms include significant changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or narrow stools. Persistent abdominal discomfort like pain, cramping, or bloating is another key indicator, as is any form of rectal bleeding. Finally, unexplained weakness, fatigue, or weight loss can also signal the disease, potentially resulting from anemia or the cancer consuming the body's energy. Early recognition of these signs is crucial for diagnosis.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned President Trump that he will initiate an effort to redraw his state's congressional maps if Republicans proceed with similar plans in Texas and other states. In a letter, Newsom accused the GOP of attempting to rig the 2026 midterm elections and destabilize democracy through gerrymandering. He stated that California cannot stand idly by and will be forced to act to neutralize any gains made by Republicans through these redistricting efforts. Newsom offered to stand down if the Republican-led states abandon their plans first.</p>

          <p>Ford is investing $5 billion to overhaul its electric vehicle production, with the goal of creating more affordable models for consumers. The investment includes modernizing its Louisville Assembly Plant and building a new battery facility in Michigan. The company introduced a new 'universal EV platform' and a tree-like assembly process, which it claims will significantly speed up manufacturing and reduce the number of parts. The first vehicle from this new system, a midsize truck starting at $30,000, is scheduled to debut in 2027.</p>

          <p>For individuals who find their bank account unexpectedly frozen by a debt collector, this article outlines five crucial steps to regain control. The first step is to contact the bank to confirm the freeze and gather information about the court order. Next, one should review the judgment for errors and explore legal challenges. It is also important to identify and claim any exempt funds, such as Social Security benefits, that are legally protected from seizure. Further actions include negotiating directly with the debt collector for a resolution and considering professional debt relief options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government of Niger has launched an investigation into the sale of the largest known piece of Mars ever found on Earth, which recently sold for over $5 million at a Sotheby's auction. The 54-pound meteorite was discovered in the Sahara Desert within Niger, and officials are concerned it was smuggled out of the country in a case of 'illicit international trafficking.' While Sotheby's maintains the meteorite was exported legally, the incident has highlighted ambiguities in international law regarding meteorites as cultural property. Niger has since suspended all exports of meteorites.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is placing the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control and deploying the National Guard to address what he termed 'crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.' Invoking the D.C. Home Rule Act, the president put Attorney General Pam Bondi in command of the local police force for up to 30 days. This action comes despite local police data showing a significant decline in violent crime in the city over the past year and a half. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move unsettling but stated the city would comply.</p>

This move avoids an immediate escalation in the trade conflict as negotiations between the U.S. and China continue.

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford was unable to participate in practice on Monday due to a lingering back issue that has kept him out since the beginning of training camp. Coach Sean McVay stated that the 37-year-old quarterback 'didn't feel good enough' to practice after waking up. Stafford is dealing with an aggravated disc and, while he had a throwing session on Saturday, the team is managing his condition on a day-to-day basis. McVay indicated that surgery has not been discussed as an option at this time.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer has described the club's pre-season as a 'nightmare,' citing a disastrous transfer window and the unresolved situation with star striker Alexander Isak. In an opinion piece, Shearer explains that Isak, who reportedly wants a move to Liverpool, cannot be sold unless the club secures two replacement strikers. He criticizes the club's lack of leadership, noting they entered the summer without a chief executive or sporting director. Shearer views the situation as a mess that has stalled the momentum from last season's success.</p>

A second blaze, the Elk fire, has scorched more than 14,000 acres but is 30% contained. The fires have prompted evacuation orders for several mountain communities and led to widespread air quality warnings due to heavy smoke.

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan have secured a new 'first look' deal with Netflix, which an analysis suggests is a continued sign of their value to the streaming giant, despite some claims of it being a demotion. This type of agreement gives Netflix the first opportunity to develop projects from the Sussexes' Archewell Productions. While financial details are undisclosed, such deals can be lucrative and may include covering the production company's operational costs. The new contract indicates that Netflix continues to view the couple as a power couple who attract significant global attention and investment.</p>

          <p>Shares of enterprise AI company C3 AI fell over 20% after it released preliminary first-quarter financial results that fell far short of expectations.

The company now expects revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million, a significant drop from $87.2 million in the same period last year. The firm also anticipates a much wider operating loss than previously reported. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Adam Aron attributed the success to a recovering industry-wide box office, a 26% increase in attendance, and growth in its premium offerings.

The killings have drawn outrage from media rights groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders, who called it a grave breach of international law. The attack brings the number of journalists killed in the conflict to at least 186, the deadliest period on record.</p>
