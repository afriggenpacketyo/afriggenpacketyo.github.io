          <p>A vast burial site from the Western Xia dynasty, located near Yinchuan in northwest China, has been added to the Unesco World Heritage list. The 40-square-kilometer complex includes nine imperial mausoleums and over 270 associated tombs, dating back to a period between 1038 and 1227. The World Heritage Committee recognized the site as a significant testament to the cultural fusion and interaction among diverse traditions along the ancient Silk Road. This designation highlights the historical importance of the Tangut people who ruled the dynasty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad has found that the plane's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position moments after takeoff, leading to a total loss of engine power. The crash on June 12 killed 261 people, including 242 on board and 19 on the ground, with only one survivor from the aircraft. Cockpit voice recordings reveal confusion between the pilots, with one asking why the fuel was cut off and the other denying having done so. The full investigation is ongoing, with a final report expected in about 12 months.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, deploying nearly 600 drones and over two dozen cruise missiles across the country, resulting in at least two fatalities in the southwestern Chernivtsi region. Ukrainian defense forces reported successfully downing 319 drones and 25 missiles, while an additional 258 drones were suppressed by electronic warfare systems. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes on civilian areas and reiterated his call for stronger international sanctions and more advanced air-defense systems to counter Russia's escalating aerial campaign. The attacks targeted a wide area from eastern to western Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has reportedly died from injuries sustained after falling approximately 30 feet from a greenhouse roof during an immigration raid at a California cannabis farm. The Department of Homeland Security stated the individual was not being pursued by law enforcement at the time of the fall. The raid, which resulted in the arrest of about 200 undocumented migrants, is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration and has sparked protests.

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is carefully managing its relationship with the United States under the Trump administration as it aims for victory in the 2027 presidential election. While ideologically aligned on some issues, the party maintains a cautious distance due to strong anti-Trump sentiment among many French voters and concerns over potentially harmful US trade policies. Analysts suggest the National Rally seeks to avoid association with Trump's more controversial aspects to broaden its appeal to moderate voters. This balancing act reflects the party's strategy to normalize its image and present itself as a viable governing force.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers, just weeks after facing backlash for a design resembling traditional Kolhapuri sandals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the footwear without acknowledging its Indian origins, prompting criticism from fashion critics and craftspeople in India. Following the outcry, Prada met with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss collaboration opportunities. This move is seen as a step toward respectful engagement between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from conducting certain immigration enforcement tactics in several Southern California counties. The ruling prohibits federal agents from making detentive stops based solely on factors like a person's apparent race, speaking Spanish, or their presence at specific locations like work sites. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other rights groups, which accused agents of unconstitutional racial profiling and other violations. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims that these violations were occurring.</p>
