          <p>Sly Stone, the frontman of Sly and the Family Stone, has died at the age of 82 after battling lung disease. Stone helped redefine pop, funk, and rock music in the late 1960s and 70s, creating a unique sound that blended psychedelic rock, soul, jazz, and gospel. The band, known for hits like "Everyday People" and "Dance to the Music," was groundbreaking for its inclusion of both Black and white musicians, as well as women instrumentalists, which was rare for the time. Stone's musical legacy continues to inspire, with his charismatic stage presence and distinctive vocals remaining influential in American music.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports. The split, expected by mid-2026, will separate streaming and studios from legacy cable networks, including TNT Sports. CEO David Zaslav indicated that U.S. sports haven't been a major driver of HBO Max sign-ups, suggesting TNT Sports could be licensed to other entities. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the future CEO of Global Networks, will decide how to monetize TNT's streaming and digital sports rights, including potential mergers or licensing deals. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the New York Times. The lawsuit stemmed from sexual harassment allegations Lively made against Baldoni during the making of the movie *It Ends With Us*, which were detailed in a New York Times article. Judge Liman ruled that Baldoni failed to show actual malice was involved in Lively's allegations and that the Times reported what it believed to have happened after reviewing available evidence.

          <p>Elected Democrats are seemingly walking back their pro-law enforcement rhetoric from the January 6th era in the face of escalating immigration protests in Los Angeles. Democrats, including Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass, have condemned federal immigration raids and the deployment of the National Guard, characterizing the actions as authoritarian. This stance contrasts with their previous support for law and order following the January 6th Capitol protest. The White House defended the National Guard deployment, accusing Democrats of failing to control the violent protests. </p>

          <p>Canada has pledged to meet NATO's 2% defence spending target within a year, significantly boosting its military budget. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that the country was “too reliant” on the United States for defence, and that Washington was “reducing its relative contribution to our collective security”. The plan includes investing in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armored vehicles, and artillery, as well as new drones and sensors to monitor activity in the Arctic and seafloor approaches to the country. Canada will also create a new defence procurement agency to expedite the acquisition process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global shift to clean energy is driving increased demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, which are essential for technologies such as solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. However, the uneven distribution of these minerals worldwide poses potential bottlenecks and environmental challenges. While efforts are underway to increase domestic production and find alternative materials, the world will still need more mines to expand supplies of critical minerals. This article discusses the challenges and potential solutions related to critical mineral constraints in the clean energy transition.</p>

          <p>The ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard University over international student visas could have a significant economic impact. Harvard's international students contribute $180 million to the Boston economy and support over 1,125 local jobs. A ban on international enrollment could destabilize this vital revenue stream, as Harvard has a disproportionately high percentage of international students. Economists warn that the impact would extend beyond Boston, affecting the New England economy as a whole.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned of peril as the world's oceans face "predatory" mining, masses of plastic waste and rising sea temperatures. At the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, Guterres addressed a major threat facing the world's oceans — deep-sea mining. He warned of the dangers of letting the ocean floor "become the wild west." He also cited collapsing fish stocks, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, plastic pollution, destructive fishing and the quest for mineral riches at the ocean floor as key threats in his remarks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's federalization of the California National Guard to confront protesters in Los Angeles is a chilling signal of his willingness to use the military against demonstrators. Legal experts question the legality of the action, citing limitations on presidential authority to federalize a state's National Guard and use the military in domestic situations. The deployment has been met with criticism, with concerns raised about the militarization of domestic law enforcement and the potential for abuse of power. The action should make us even more afraid.</p>
