          <p>France has refuted allegations made by Telegram founder Pavel Durov regarding interference in Romania's presidential election. Durov hinted that a Western European country, possibly France, had requested Telegram to suppress conservative voices. The French Foreign Ministry dismissed these claims as baseless and accused Russia of attempting to divert attention from its own interference. The ministry emphasized France's commitment to Romanian democracy and its long-standing support for the country, asserting that such allegations are insulting and break historical ties. </p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced the commencement of extensive ground operations throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip, aiming to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and ultimately destroying the group. This escalation occurs amidst indirect cease-fire talks in Doha, with Israeli warplanes conducting strikes on what they claim are Hamas targets. Despite the military actions, Prime Minister Netanyahu signaled a willingness to discuss terms for a broader deal that could end the war, contingent on the release of hostages, expulsion of Hamas leaders, and demilitarization of Gaza.

Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 273 drones, intercepting 88 while 128 went astray.

          <p>Tressie McMillan Cottom discusses the tension in country music between Nashville's manufactured pop and the rise of Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and queer artists claiming the genre. She argues that artists entering the genre must choose between reactionary whiteness or reparative multiracialism. The success of white artists like Jelly Roll and Morgan Wallen is contrasted with the exclusion of Black artists who challenge the racial code of country music. The rise of Black country artists is a direct result of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the author argues that Nashville is becoming a haven for white national mythmaking. </p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff stated that any agreement between the United States and Iran must prohibit uranium enrichment, reiterating President Trump's position. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, responded that such expectations are unrealistic and enrichment will continue. Despite the disagreement, Witkoff expressed optimism about ongoing negotiations, with further talks planned in Europe this week. Trump has emphasized the need for Iran to act quickly to avoid negative consequences, though Araqchi denied receiving a U.S. proposal. </p>

More than 5 million borrowers are currently in default, with the total potentially swelling to 10 million. The administration's move is a sharp turn from the Biden administration's relief measures. The Education Department can garnish up to 15% of defaulted borrowers' disposable income and federal benefits, as well as their entire federal tax refunds. Marceline Paul, a retiree, fears she won't be able to afford a trip home to Trinidad if her Social Security benefits are garnished. </p>

          <p>A Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Scarlett Johansson and Bad Bunny explored the misinterpretations arising from a language barrier, as two men used Spanish to confide about their relationships while onlookers misinterpreted their conversation as a heated, macho argument. The sketch played on the contrast between the superficial understanding of the barflies and the genuine emotions expressed by the characters, highlighting the subtleties often missed in translation. The subtitles elided the nuances of the Caribbean-inflected Spanish, making the punchlines land less effectively for non-Spanish speakers. The sketch challenged audiences to consider the truth they can discern from strangers across language and cultural barriers. </p>

Trump had previously criticized the company for not absorbing the costs themselves. The president announced plans for tariffs on numerous countries, leading to economic chaos. </p>
