          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $18 billion in federal funds designated for two major New York City infrastructure projects, the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway. The White House's Office of Management and Budget cited a review into "unconstitutional DEI principles" as the reason for the freeze. This move targets the home state of Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries on the first day of the government shutdown, with critics arguing it is a politically motivated action that jeopardizes thousands of jobs.</p>

This potential partnership would be a major victory for Intel's foundry business, which aims to produce chips for other companies. Securing a major rival like AMD as a customer would signal strong confidence in Intel's manufacturing capabilities and could attract other significant clients, marking a key step in the company's turnaround strategy.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader series, this article explores the birthplace of cumbia in Colombia's Caribbean coastal region, where African, Indigenous, and European cultures converged. The music's roots are tied to the history of enslaved Africans, whose drum rhythms blended with Indigenous flutes and European song structures. Despite historical suppression and regional conflict, the genre has endured as a powerful form of cultural expression, with Black and Afro-descendant women playing a central role in preserving its legacy.</p>

Supported by the National Geographic Explorer Program, photographers traveled through six countries to capture the people and places that keep the vibrant musical tradition alive.</p>

          <p>Citing the government shutdown, the Department of Justice has filed a motion to postpone all deadlines in the deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was previously wrongly deported. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. to face separate charges but was detained again by immigration authorities after his release pending trial. The DOJ's request states that furloughed attorneys are prohibited from working on the case, which could extend the legal proceedings for Abrego Garcia, whose lawyers oppose the delay.</p>

          <p>The federal government shutdown is exacerbating economic uncertainty, particularly in the commercial real estate sector, due to a policy of canceling federal office leases. This initiative, known as DOGE, has already voided hundreds of leases, creating a ripple effect that destabilizes local markets and the broader commercial lending system. Experts warn that the loss of the government as a reliable "anchor tenant" leaves private landlords with vacant properties and could spread financial risk across thousands of loans nationwide, with rural areas facing acute impacts.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing against home equity has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A $70,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term now carries an average monthly payment of around $677, which is marginally lower than costs seen earlier in the year and last fall. While rates have declined, the article advises homeowners to carefully compare options, as the savings may be negligible and alternatives like a HELOC could be more suitable depending on individual financial circumstances.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximately 8% increase in their third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by record demand for electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush to purchase EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive at the end of September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's saw a 30% increase. This surge helped the overall industry achieve a higher-than-expected sales pace, with EVs capturing a record market share during the quarter.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin have temporarily suspended abortion services in response to a new federal law that blocks them from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. The provision, part of a Trump administration spending bill, targets abortion providers and has created a funding crisis, as clinics rely on Medicaid to cover non-abortion services like cancer screenings and contraception. This move is an attempt to preserve funding for other essential healthcare services, making Wisconsin the first state where the affiliate has ceased abortions even though the procedure remains legal.</p>

          <p>Amid rising financial stress for many households, this article explores several alternatives to filing for bankruptcy, a step with long-term negative consequences for credit. Strategies include debt consolidation through a personal loan to simplify payments and lower interest rates, and working with a credit counseling agency on a debt management plan. Other options are negotiating lower lump-sum settlements directly with creditors or enrolling in temporary creditor hardship programs. These methods can provide significant relief without the lasting damage that bankruptcy can inflict on one's financial future. (not investment advice)</p>
