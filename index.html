          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attributes recent market declines primarily to a significant downturn in major technology stocks, rather than President Trump's newly implemented tariffs.  He highlights the impact of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's competitive language models on U.S. tech giants, causing a sell-off in the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Bessent downplays the role of Trump's tariffs, though they did briefly push the S&P 500 into correction territory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs could impact the UK economy and consumers in several ways.  While initially higher prices for US consumers are expected, the impact on the UK could be indirect, affecting the value of the pound and potentially leading to higher import costs for UK businesses.  However, there's a possibility of lower prices in the UK if businesses shift exports away from the U.S. to avoid tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs is likely to negatively impact the U.S. economy.  The across-the-board tariffs are expected to raise prices and invite retaliatory measures, potentially leading to slower economic growth and higher inflation.  The lack of consultation and the disregard for economic consequences reflect the administration's prioritization of Trump's personal instincts over expert advice.</p>
