          <p>The Trump administration is ending the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, which is half of the total force sent to address protests over immigration policies. The initial deployment was highly controversial, as President Trump federalized the troops, bypassing the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom. Both Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment as political theater and are calling for the remaining troops to be sent home immediately. Local officials are framing the withdrawal as a victory achieved through peaceful protest and community unity.</p>

          <p>The National League has won the 2025 MLB All-Star Game in a historic conclusion, defeating the American League in the first-ever swing-off tiebreaker. The game ended in a 6-6 tie after nine innings, with the AL staging a late comeback to force the novel home run derby-style finish. Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber was named MVP for his performance in the tiebreaker. The game also marked the debut of the Automated Ball-Strike System, which was successfully challenged by players from both leagues, adding another layer of novelty to the event.</p>

          <h2>Chinese State Media Encourages Local Governments to Use Legislation to Boost Economic Growth</h2>

          <p>An article in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has urged China's local governments to use their legislative powers to stimulate economic and social development. The piece argues that tailored local laws can create a stable and open system, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. Since 2015, legislative powers have been expanded to hundreds of Chinese cities. The article suggests that this decentralized approach, moving from top-down orders to a legal framework, is crucial for adapting to local needs and securing long-term economic benefits.</p>

          <p>Leaders from UC Berkeley, Georgetown, and CUNY faced questioning from a House committee regarding antisemitism on their campuses. The university officials condemned antisemitism but stressed their obligation to protect free speech, arguing that pro-Palestinian expression is not inherently antisemitic. Republicans on the committee accused the schools of failing to discipline faculty and allowing unchecked bias. Democrats criticized the hearing as 'political theater' and pointed to the Trump administration's dismantling of the very federal offices tasked with investigating civil rights violations, including antisemitism in schools.</p>

          <p>The UK government secretly relocated 4,500 Afghans after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked the personal data of nearly 19,000 applicants seeking refuge after the Taliban takeover. The breach, which occurred in 2022, was discovered in 2023, and its existence was concealed from the public by a super-injunction. Details were only revealed after a High Court judge lifted the order, citing free speech concerns and a 'scrutiny vacuum.' Defence Secretary John Healey has apologized for the 'serious departmental error,' though many at-risk individuals, including former Afghan soldiers, remain in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information on Jeffrey Epstein that she deems 'credible,' as he faces a rare backlash from his own supporters on the issue. The controversy grew after Bondi stated there was no evidence of an Epstein 'client list,' which many in Trump's base believe exists and is being suppressed. Prominent allies like House Speaker Mike Johnson are now publicly calling for more transparency. Trump, while encouraging the release of credible information, also questioned the continued fascination with the case, calling it 'sordid but boring.'</p>

Thousands of people, including current President Bola Tinubu, attended the service. Buhari led Nigeria twice, first as a military dictator in the 1980s and later as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His legacy is often associated with a clampdown on human rights, isolationist economic policies, and escalating insecurity. The nation has declared seven days of mourning to honor his life.</p>

          <p>Michael Bernard Bell, 54, has been executed in Florida for the 1993 murders of Jimmy West and Tamecka Smith. Bell shot the two victims outside a bar with an AK-47 rifle in what authorities described as an attempted revenge killing targeting the car's previous owner. This was the 26th execution in the U.S. this year, surpassing last year's total, with Florida having carried out more than any other state. Bell was also convicted of three other murders committed in separate incidents. His final appeals were denied by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, some migrant workers are using mobile apps that provide crowdsourced locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to avoid potential detention. One such app, Coqui, was developed to help workers, some of whom are in the country legally, travel with less fear of being arrested and detained. An ICE official expressed concern that such apps are dangerous and could be used to ambush agents or impede law enforcement efforts. For users, the apps provide a sense of security while navigating the heightened risk of deportation.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Prosecutor-General has formally requested that the Supreme Court find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an 'armed criminal association' to 'violently overthrow the democratic order.' The charges are linked to Bolsonaro's spreading of unfounded voter fraud claims and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are increasingly buying gold directly from domestic mines to bolster their reserves as global prices reach new highs. This strategy allows them to acquire the precious metal using local currency, preserving their foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. While this method can be cheaper and supports local industry, it also carries risks if the gold is sourced from small-scale mines with poor labor or environmental practices. The trend reflects a global push by central banks to diversify assets and strengthen financial buffers against geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has stayed a lower court ruling, allowing the Trump administration to continue with its plan to dismantle parts of the U.S. Department of Education. This decision permits mass layoffs, which had been previously blocked, to proceed while the case is further litigated. An education policy expert noted that the offices most affected are those for Financial Aid and Civil Rights, raising concerns about the department's ability to handle student loan processes and discrimination complaints. However, he also suggested that most K-12 students and teachers are unlikely to feel a direct impact due to the federal government's limited role in daily schooling.</p>
