          <p>The United Nations Security Council will convene an emergency meeting to address escalating border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia. The conflict, rooted in a long-standing dispute over territory near ancient temples, has intensified with both nations using heavy artillery and rockets. Thailand has reported 14 deaths and evacuated over 100,000 civilians, while Cambodia has also suffered casualties and evacuated residents. International powers, including the US, China, and the EU, have called for an immediate de-escalation and a return to dialogue to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order aimed at regulating college athletics, focusing on athletic scholarships and name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to protect non-revenue sports, including many women's and Olympic sports, by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels. It also aims to restrict "pay-for-play" NIL deals that lack fair market value, a move that aligns with NCAA priorities. Legal experts question the order's enforceability, but it signals increasing federal intervention in the governance of college sports.</p>

          <p>Public and state media calls for a thorough investigation are growing in China following the deaths of six university students in a mining accident. The students from Northeastern University were on a field trip at a copper-molybdenum mine in Inner Mongolia when a grating panel reportedly gave way, causing them to fall into a flotation tank. An official investigation team has been assembled by the regional government to determine the cause and recommend safety improvements. The incident has raised significant questions about safety protocols during educational industrial visits.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal fraught with political controversy. The approval followed Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit with President Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," whose host had been critical of the deal. Democratic officials have condemned the timing, suggesting the approval was a corrupt exchange for favorable actions by Paramount. Skydance has pledged to install an ombudsman to ensure unbiased journalism at CBS News.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its "sanctuary city" laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty CBP officer by an undocumented immigrant, which intensified the administration's criticism of such policies. The lawsuit argues that NYC's laws obstruct federal law enforcement and endanger public safety by releasing criminals. City officials and immigrant advocates defend the policies, stating they are crucial for ensuring all residents, regardless of status, feel safe reporting crimes.</p>

The scientists at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics made the discovery while studying folded graphene, a single-atom-thick layer of carbon. They observed that friction did not always increase with thickness and that some thicker folds slid more easily, a counterintuitive effect traced to how bending altered electron movement. This breakthrough could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-power nanodevices with minimal wear and tear, revolutionizing tiny machines.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced an amended stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders, moving the team closer to building a new venue at the RFK Stadium site. This development comes despite President Trump's recent threat to block any deal unless the team reverts to its former "Redskins" name. The council chairman dismissed the president's comments as a distraction and expressed confidence that the deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, will pass. The proposal still faces a crucial council vote and technical challenges related to the federal land transfer.</p>

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges who were recently fired by the Justice Department are speaking out, describing their terminations as arbitrary and an attack on judicial independence. The judges, who handled thousands of cases, claim they were fired by email without cause and allege they had been pressured on how to rule in certain cases to facilitate deportations. Their firings come amid a growing backlog of nearly four million cases in immigration courts and reports that over 100 judges have been fired, transferred, or retired since the Trump administration took office.</p>

          <p>Four former traders convicted of manipulating the Libor inter-bank lending rate are now appealing to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a landmark UK Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, in a related case. The original convictions were part of a major investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the rate-rigging scandal that was central to the 2008 financial crisis. The Supreme Court's ruling has opened a clear path for these four individuals to challenge their own convictions.</p>
