          <p>The Metropolitan Police have received 146 new reports of crimes, including sexual assault, in their ongoing investigation into historical allegations against the late former Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed. This significant increase in reported incidents, more than double the previous count, follows a BBC documentary and podcast that brought the extent of his alleged predatory behavior to light. Authorities are also scrutinizing whether others enabled his actions, while Harrods has launched a compensation scheme, with over 100 victims already seeking redress. The investigation faces challenges due to the high number of survivors and some reluctance to trust the police, as the force works with international agencies to address these complex cases.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, is facing potential record-breaking floodwaters as rainwater and snowmelt escape Suicide Basin, dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier. Authorities have intensified evacuation warnings, with water levels expected to crest at a new high, surpassing previous records. This annual phenomenon, exacerbated by climate change, has caused significant damage in recent years, including the destruction of homes. City officials have installed temporary barriers and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning a long-term study for permanent solutions, as residents grapple with the immediate threat and ongoing concerns about glacial outbursts for decades to come.</p>

          <p>President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and leaders from NATO nations are holding a virtual meeting to coordinate efforts regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine, ahead of Trump's scheduled summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. European allies and Ukraine express concern about being excluded from peace discussions, fearing a settlement that could favor Moscow. Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not cede any territory, emphasizing that negotiations concerning Ukraine must include its participation. Trump frames his upcoming meeting with Putin as an initial assessment of the Russian leader's intentions, while allies stress the importance of comprehensive security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asserts there is "no sign" of Russian President Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the war, as preparations for the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska advance. Zelenskyy underscored the necessity for Ukraine and its allies to exert coordinated pressure on Russia for a fair peace, cautioning against potential deception. While the White House characterizes Trump's upcoming meeting as a "listening exercise" to understand how to end the conflict, Zelenskyy is not slated to attend, instead engaging with European leaders to advocate for Ukrainian and European inclusion in peace talks. Meanwhile, both sides continue to report long-range strikes, indicating persistent military engagement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Washington D.C., with orders to maintain a visible presence near the National Mall as part of his mission to combat perceived "out of control" crime. The troops, approximately 100 initially, are tasked with logistical support, transportation, and administrative duties for local law enforcement, but will not carry weapons. This move has sparked debate over the legality and necessity of military deployment on U.S. soil for domestic law enforcement, particularly in an area generally considered safe for tourists. Trump's control over the D.C. police force is set to expire in 30 days, requiring Congressional review.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that only 54% of U.S. adults now consume alcohol, representing the lowest percentage in nearly 90 years. This significant decline is primarily driven by an increasing public perception, especially among young adults, that even moderate alcohol intake is detrimental to health. The shift aligns with a changing scientific consensus, which now emphasizes alcohol's links to various negative health outcomes, including cancer, rather than any perceived benefits. Consequently, federal dietary guidelines are under review, with suggestions for clearer labeling on alcoholic beverages to highlight these health risks, influencing consumption habits across different age groups.</p>

          <p>Cava's stock plunged nearly 20% after the restaurant company lowered its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth, citing a disappointing second quarter. The chain's same-store sales rose only 2.1%, significantly below Wall Street's 6.1% projection, primarily due to slowing growth after the one-year anniversary of its grilled steak introduction. This performance mirrors struggles faced by rival fast-casual chains like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, which have also reported slumping sales.

The scheme, allegedly based in the Dominican Republic, involved call centers impersonating grandchildren in distress or lawyers demanding bail money.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai is currently facing an "extraordinary" media backlash from Japanese outlets, notably the Yomiuri Shimbun, following his ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) public support for a failed mass recall vote against opposition lawmakers. Japanese editorials have sharply criticized the DPP, accusing it of attempting to "eliminate opposition parties" and urging President Lai to prioritize national unity through dialogue rather than deepening partisan divides. This incident underscores significant international scrutiny of Taiwan's domestic political landscape and its potential implications for diplomatic relations, particularly with key regional allies like Japan, amidst concerns over democratic processes.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has ordered authorities in Delhi to relocate all stray dogs from residential streets to shelters within two months, citing an increase in dog bites and rabies cases. This directive has sparked anger among animal rights activists, who argue it's impractical, inhumane, and contravenes existing animal birth control (ABC) rules that advocate for sterilization and vaccination followed by return to territory. With an estimated 800,000 to 1 million stray dogs and limited shelter capacity, critics emphasize that mass removal could exacerbate public health issues by disrupting established populations. Activists propose scientifically proven ABC programs and responsible pet ownership as sustainable solutions.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are finding more affordable borrowing options through home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), with average interest rates significantly lower than personal loans or credit cards. As of August 8, 2025, typical 5-year home equity loans average 8.25%, while HELOCs are around 8.13%, with rates expected to decline further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. These products, which use home equity as collateral, offer lump sums or revolving credit and may provide tax benefits for eligible home improvements. However, borrowers must carefully assess their needs and budget due to the risk of foreclosure if payments are missed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated a shift in Gaza ceasefire negotiations towards a comprehensive deal to release all remaining hostages simultaneously, moving away from a previous phased release plan. Hamas leaders are reportedly in Cairo for preliminary talks with Egyptian officials, as mediators seek a window of opportunity for a breakthrough. Despite diplomatic efforts, intense Israeli strikes continue in Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting significant casualties. Netanyahu maintains that the war will only end with the return of all hostages and Hamas's surrender, while also stressing Israel's need for open-ended security control over Gaza.</p>

China's massive investment in solar and wind capacity, significantly outpacing the rest of the world, is driving down global clean energy costs. The article suggests that while the U.S. leans towards protectionism, China is underwriting the global green transition, shaping the 21st century's economic landscape.</p>

Lilli, described as a "sassy secretary" but interpreted by some as a high-class call girl, became a popular plastic doll in 1955, sold in tobacco shops. Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel, discovered Lilli in Switzerland and subsequently launched Barbie in 1959, modeled after Lilli and named after Handler's daughter. Mattel later acquired the rights to Lilli, ceasing its production, while Barbie went on to become a global phenomenon, inspiring one of the highest-grossing films.</p>
