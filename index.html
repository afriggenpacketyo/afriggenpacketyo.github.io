          <p>A second federal court has ruled that President Trump does not have the power to unilaterally impose tariffs, further challenging the administration's trade policies. Judge Rudolph Contreras restricted the administration's ability to collect tariffs from Learning Resources, Inc., and hand2mind, Inc. The Department of Justice requested a stay to Wednesday's ruling, citing potential harm to foreign policy and national security. The ruling marks the first time a federal court has issued a ruling on the legality of Trump's tariffs, with the case now heading to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump to discuss economic developments, including growth, employment, and inflation. Powell emphasized that monetary policy decisions would depend on incoming economic data and its impact on the outlook, stressing that analysis would be careful, objective, and non-political. The meeting occurred amid Trump's repeated calls for the Federal Open Market Committee to lower interest rates, using his Truth Social media outlet to express his views. This was their first meeting since Trump began his second term, during which Powell confirmed he would not initiate a meeting with the President.</p>

          <p>New research reveals a surge in sexual exploitation and domestic violence following the 2023 Lahaina wildfire, exacerbated by pre-existing gender inequalities. One in six female fire survivors reported being forced into sexual acts for basic necessities. Immigrant women, especially those with limited English, felt unsafe in shelters, leading some to engage in "survival sex" for safer accommodations. The report highlights failures by FEMA and the Red Cross to provide culturally sensitive support and adequate reporting mechanisms for sexual and domestic violence, especially among displaced people of color. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled a nearly $600 million contract with Moderna intended to develop a vaccine for humans against bird flu. This decision also forfeits the U.S. government's right to purchase doses ahead of a pandemic and cancels an agreement set up by the Biden administration in January to prepare the nation for a potential bird flu pandemic. The Department of Health and Human Services had previously indicated it was reviewing the contract. Health Secretary Robert F.

The report, commissioned by the Trump administration to examine the causes of chronic illness, includes references to seven studies that appear to be entirely invented, and others that researchers say have been mischaracterized. This revelation comes as Kennedy has criticized medical publishing, branding top journals as "corrupt" and alleging they are controlled by pharmaceutical companies, outlining plans for creating government-run journals instead.

          <p>The Trump administration has given Harvard University 30 days to challenge the revocation of its certification to enroll international students, backtracking from its earlier stance. A federal judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the administration from immediately revoking Harvard's SEVP certification without following proper legal procedures. Harvard has argued that the revocation is retaliatory and violates the school's First Amendment rights. The administration claims Harvard failed to provide information about international students and allowed antisemitism on campus.</p>

This marks the first time fossil fuel companies have been sued over the death of an individual as a result of climate change. The case argues that the heat dome that led to Leon's death would have been virtually impossible without man-made climate change.</p>

While the star, Ben Wang, is charming, the film is too divided in its storytelling aims, with a frenetic pace and rapid-fire montages.
