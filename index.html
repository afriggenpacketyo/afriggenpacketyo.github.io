          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of President Trump's tax bill, addressing contentious elements related to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions (SALT), and the debt ceiling. The Senate proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes and permanently extending the $10,000 SALT deduction, differing from the House version. House Republicans from blue states have already voiced opposition to the Senate's SALT proposal, threatening the bill's passage in the House. Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to pass the legislation before the July 4th recess, potentially keeping senators in Washington, D.C., to meet the deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's stance on the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, oscillating between supporting Israel and distancing himself. He faces three potential paths: escalating military involvement under Netanyahu's pressure, maintaining the current course of limited involvement, or heeding MAGA voices to withdraw. Escalation carries risks, while holding the course risks further attacks; pulling back could alienate traditional Republican support. The US has bunker buster bombs that Israel believes can destroy Iran's underground uranium enrichment site at Fordow, but Trump has expressed opposition to targeting Iran's Supreme Leader.</p>

Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal treatment for depression, but had begun seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.

The lawsuit targets orders that cut off security clearances and contracts for firms taking on pro bono clients or engaging in diversity practices. The ABA argues that these actions violate the First Amendment and have a "chilling effect," intimidating firms from taking cases opposing the administration's agenda. Several targeted firms have also filed lawsuits, resulting in injunctions from federal judges, while others have struck deals with the administration to avoid targeting.</p>

          <p>Fire victims from the Pacific Palisades and Altadena are suing State Farm, alleging their homes were severely underinsured, leaving them without funds to rebuild. The lawsuit claims State Farm deliberately set replacement costs lower than actual costs, engaging in an illegal scheme to mislead homeowners. This follows a similar lawsuit against AAA and USAA, and comes as the California Department of Insurance launches an inquiry into State Farm's handling of fire claims. The lawsuit alleges negligence and breach of contract, seeking compensatory and punitive damages and policy reform.</p>

          <p>The recent feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, involving threats and accusations, may solidify China's perception of Trump as an erratic politician. Diplomatic observers suggest this could make China more cautious in negotiations with Trump and complicate potential summits. Sun Chenghao of Tsinghua University notes that Trump's behavior aligns with the Chinese public and government's view of him as a transactional leader. The fallout could further strain relations and impact future diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>In a short period, several significant events have occurred in the United States under President Trump, including escalating immigration enforcement, controversial appointments, and international tensions. The administration federalized the California National Guard, fired members of the CDC panel on vaccine recommendations, and faced backlash over political speeches before soldiers. These actions have sparked protests and legal challenges, highlighting a pattern of provocation and division. The analysis suggests that these tactics are politically ineffective and contribute to public disapproval.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have introduced legislation to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during interactions with the public. The proposed bill, SB 627, also requires officers to wear identifying information to ensure transparency and accountability. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers during natural disasters. The legislation comes amid protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration policies and aims to prevent "secret police behavior."</p>
