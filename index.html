          <p>The Flanders Festival Ghent canceled a Munich Philharmonic concert due to Israeli conductor Lahav Shani's perceived insufficient distancing from Israel's government actions, sparking widespread outrage, particularly in Germany. Critics, including German Minister of State for Culture Wolfram Weimer, condemned the move as antisemitic and a dangerous precedent, drawing comparisons to historical anti-Jewish boycotts. Other European theaters, like Philharmonie Luxembourg, affirmed their commitment to working with artists regardless of nationality, highlighting the intensifying debate over cultural boycotts and artistic freedom in political conflicts.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes hails Jack Grealish's Premier League Player of the Month award for August as merely the beginning of his impact at the club. Grealish, who recently turned 30, joined Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City and has already recorded four assists in two league starts, surpassing other players this season. This marks his first time winning the accolade, making him the first Everton player to do so since September 2020. Moyes emphasizes Grealish's hard work and renewed mindset, believing his performances are a strong bid for a return to the England team ahead of next summer's World Cup.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, to address the city's crime issues, following a similar federal intervention in Washington, D.C. Trump stated that both Tennessee Governor Bill Lee and Memphis Mayor Paul Young supported the decision. This move comes despite previous intentions to deploy troops to Chicago, which faced strong opposition from local officials. The administration has yet to clarify the legal framework for such deployments in U.S. cities, with prior attempts in D.C. and Los Angeles facing legal challenges over constitutional authority.</p>

          <p>A Thai safari park, Safari World, has temporarily closed its predator zone after five lions mauled a 58-year-old zookeeper to death when he exited his vehicle. The incident has intensified scrutiny on the park's animal treatment practices, which already faced controversy for staged shows with orangutans and elephants. Wildlife officials found damaged fences and inadequate safety measures during an inspection, noting the zoo's permit had expired. Conservation groups are now calling for stricter controls on dangerous animal ownership in Thailand, highlighting the risks even in regulated environments.</p>

          <p>Brian Gavidia, a 29-year-old U.S. citizen, is suing the Trump administration, alleging racial profiling by federal immigration agents who accosted him in Los Angeles. Gavidia claims agents twisted his arm and demanded his birth hospital when he couldn't recall it, despite his assertions of citizenship. This lawsuit, backed by the ACLU, challenges the Supreme Court's recent decision that lifted restrictions on agents stopping individuals based on appearance or language, which advocates warn legalizes racial profiling. Gavidia's business remains closed due to fear, but he vows to continue his fight against what he views as an attack on his community.</p>

          <p>China's DF-5C nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) demonstrates significant advancements in liquid-fuel rocket technology, enabling it to be "ready to launch any time." Unlike older liquid-fuel missiles that require lengthy fueling processes and cannot be stored fueled for extended periods, the DF-5C's improved fuel storage, possibly indicated by protected rocket nozzles, allows for long-term silo readiness. This development aims to dispel doubts about China's nuclear deterrence capabilities, as liquid-fuel missiles inherently offer advantages in carrying larger payloads, heavier warheads, or multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles compared to solid-fuel counterparts.</p>

          <p>The mockumentary "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" reunites the fictional heavy metal band after four decades, coinciding with Black Sabbath's final show and Ozzy Osbourne's death, ironically synchronizing with real-world metal events. Directed by Rob Reiner, the sequel sees the band members, now in mundane pursuits, brought back for a final concert after an accidental viral clip. The article explores the original film's impact on rock-and-roll self-awareness and questions the necessity of a sequel, ultimately finding humor in the band's continued irrelevance and the genre's perceived exhaustion. The film features cameos from real-life rock icons, contributing to its "End Times in-joke" atmosphere.</p>

Analysts suggest these four-day meetings are decisive for a potential summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, and for achieving a lasting settlement rather than another temporary detente. The intensification of discussions is crucial if the two economic superpowers aim for a resolution beyond mere extensions.</p>

          <p>Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, exceeding its initial range and valuing the company at $3.3 billion. The strong demand led to the sale of 15.2 million shares, despite the company reporting widening losses in 2024 and the first half of 2025. Nasdaq's strategic $50 million investment and Gemini's growing credit card sign-ups indicate institutional confidence. The IPO's performance will be a key indicator for the broader crypto IPO market, especially given recent consolidations in blue-chip cryptocurrencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has issued a stern warning, announcing "zero tolerance" for military personnel or Department of War civilians who celebrate or mock the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This directive comes after reports of inappropriate comments circulating online following Kirk's death. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Secretary of the Navy John Phelan emphasized that such behavior brings discredit upon the departments and will be dealt with swiftly and decisively. Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden also threatened to seek Phelan's ouster if prompt action isn't taken to address the issue within the Navy's ranks.</p>

          <p>South Africa has reopened the inquest into the 1977 death of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, 48 years after he died in police custody. Apartheid police had claimed Biko died from accidentally hitting his head, but the government now seeks to uncover what truly happened in "room 619" where he was held. Biko, a Black Consciousness Movement leader, died at age 30 from extensive brain injury and acute kidney failure after being transported unconscious and shackled. The reopening aims to provide closure to his family and society, following earlier Truth and Reconciliation Commission findings and recent inquiries into blocked apartheid crime prosecutions.</p>

This denial follows a BBC investigation questioning how Ferrari could afford the property and whether Farage avoided over £44,000 in stamp duty by putting it in her name. Farage stated the money was "legally hers" and that he sought expert tax advice to confirm the legality of the transaction, refuting accusations of hypocrisy after criticizing former Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner for similar issues.

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been convicted by the Supreme Court of plotting a coup and sentenced to over 27 years in prison, ending his political career until 2060.

His administration faced major challenges, including a widely criticized response to the pandemic and escalating clashes with the Supreme Court.

This development comes after Israel was narrowly defeated in the previous contest, and amid calls from over 70 former Eurovision contestants to ban Israel from the competition.

          <p>As the US Social Security trust fund faces depletion in eight years, necessitating reforms to avoid a 23% benefit cut, experts are debating solutions. Raising the retirement age, a common bipartisan proposal, is highlighted as a regressive cut, disproportionately affecting poorer workers due to widening life expectancy gaps between income brackets. A plan from Brookings economists Wendell Primus, Tara Watson, and Jack Smalligan suggests a progressive approach: raising the retirement age only for the top 40% of earners, while keeping it stable for others. This complex but equitable solution, combined with other progressive benefit cuts and tax hikes, aims to ensure the program's solvency without harming vulnerable populations.

Key pitfalls include failing to "look under the hood" to understand underlying assets, "chasing performance" based on past returns, and frequent trading that can erode returns.
