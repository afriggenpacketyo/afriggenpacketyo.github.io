        <p>Asia-Pacific stock markets showed mixed reactions to a soft US inflation report that boosted two Wall Street indices.  The report showed a 0.2% month-on-month increase in the CPI in February, resulting in an annual inflation rate of 2.8%.  While this was seen as positive news, analysts cautioned against premature optimism regarding the Federal Reserve's stance on inflation.  Markets in Japan, South Korea, and mainland China saw gains, while Hong Kong and Australia showed more muted responses.  Indian inflation cooled to 3.61% in February, potentially supporting GDP growth.</p>
