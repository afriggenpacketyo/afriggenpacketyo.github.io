          <p>Hurricane Erin has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is expected to re-intensify after completing a natural structural cycle. Its outer bands are currently bringing heavy rain and high winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, causing power outages and prompting flood warnings. While weather models predict the hurricane will turn north and stay offshore, avoiding a direct impact on the U.S. mainland, it is still expected to generate dangerous surf, high waves, and significant beach erosion along the East Coast from Florida to New England later in the week.</p>

          <p>Weeks before President Trump federalized Washington D.C.'s police force, the city's police union alleged that department leadership was manipulating crime statistics. The union chairman claimed that commanders were directing officers to report serious felonies as lesser offenses to create a more favorable impression of public safety. These accusations, which involve an ongoing investigation into a specific police commander, have been highlighted by the Trump administration as justification for assuming federal control over the city's law enforcement, a move contested by Democratic leaders who cite different data showing a drop in violent crime.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's federalization of the police force in Washington D.C., mayors of other Democratic-led cities are preparing for similar potential actions against them. City leaders from Seattle, Minneapolis, and Baltimore are coordinating with their police chiefs and legal teams to resist what they describe as an illegal usurpation of local authority under the pretext of fighting crime. They argue that Trump is creating chaos to distract from other issues and that his narrative of "liberal hellholes" is disconnected from the reality of declining crime rates in many of their cities.</p>

          <p>Evie Parts, a transgender long-distance runner, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Swarthmore College, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team. The suit claims the NCAA, as a private organization, cannot override federal and state anti-discrimination laws like Title IX with its policy that restricts women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth. Parts was removed from the team the same day the NCAA's new policy was issued and was allegedly denied coaching and team privileges until being reinstated two months later, an experience her complaint says caused significant emotional distress.</p>

Sullivan also defended the state's environmental record while arguing that resource development is crucial for both national security and the economic well-being of Alaska's communities, including its Indigenous populations.</p>

European officials are reportedly concerned about a repeat of a previous tense encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy and want to present a united front to prevent Ukraine from being pressured into an unfavorable deal with Russia.</p>

          <p>Community violence prevention leaders are criticizing President Trump's strategy of using increased police and military presence to combat crime in cities like Washington D.C. They argue this approach ignores the root causes of violence and undermines the progress made by community-based intervention programs, which focus on supporting at-risk individuals and addressing systemic issues like poverty. Advocates state that true safety is built through investment in local infrastructure and programming, not through punitive, response-based policing, which they contend is a short-sighted reaction that will not create lasting change.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Department of Justice's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's case, stating they contain no significant new information about Jeffrey Epstein's network. This decision has intensified public frustration and speculation about a potential cover-up, shifting focus to other investigative files that the Trump administration could release but has not. Legal experts and victims' advocates argue that the Attorney General has the authority to disclose these non-grand jury documents, and the administration's continued inaction is fueling criticism and questions about its commitment to transparency and justice for Epstein's victims.</p>

Williams, who piloted flights for Queen Elizabeth II, committed 82 burglaries to steal women's underwear before murdering two women, Corporal Marie-France Comeau and Jessica Lloyd. His crimes were uncovered after investigators matched tire tracks at a victim's home to his vehicle, leading to a lengthy interrogation where he confessed in detail. Williams was sentenced to life in prison in 2010, and his case remains a shocking example of a betrayal of trust.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is demanding that universities submit detailed admissions data to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling that ended race-based affirmative action. The White House suspects institutions are using "racial proxies" to circumvent the ban, a concern that could also threaten class-based affirmative action programs. Progressive policy advocate Richard Kahlenberg, who testified against race-based preferences, argues that class-based systems are a legal and effective way to achieve diversity but worries the administration's scrutiny may now target these programs as well, despite their benefits for working-class students of all races.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster implemented a series of "brotherhood meetings" during training camp to help bond a team with 55 new players and a new coaching staff. In these sessions, coaches and players shared personal stories and vulnerabilities, leading to what Foster described as emotional and tearful moments that strengthened their connection. The exercises were designed to build trust and a collective "we over me" mindset as the team prepares for the upcoming season, aiming to translate this off-field chemistry into on-field success.</p>

          <p>Despite a new "one in, one out" migrant agreement between the UK and France, over 2,500 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats since the deal took effect 11 days ago. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one person with a strong asylum case, but removals have not yet begun. With over 50,000 crossings since the Labour government took power, ministers are under pressure to show results, though the deterrent effect of the new policy remains uncertain until deportations start.</p>

This escalation in fighting comes as European leaders prepare to join Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for talks with President Trump in the U.S., aiming to maintain a united front in diplomatic efforts to end the nearly three-and-a-half-year-old war.</p>

          <p>Several Chinese universities are facing intense online criticism for hosting events with Darius Longarino, a research scholar from Yale Law School. Social media users highlighted Longarino's past posts on X that were critical of Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region, leading to a nationalist backlash against the institutions. In response to the controversy, at least three universities, including Central South University, have removed online announcements related to the academic lectures he delivered on topics unrelated to Xinjiang, such as sexual harassment cases in Chinese courts.</p>

          <p>A wildlife photographer in Lithuania was stunned to capture footage of a brown bear on his trail camera, a significant sighting in a country where the species was once considered extinct. This discovery, along with another recent sighting of a bear cub, suggests that brown bears may be making a comeback to the region's ecosystem. Conservationists see the return of this keystone species as a positive sign of a healthy and recovering natural environment, potentially leading to the animal being added back to the country's list of protected species.</p>

          <p>A program facilitated by officials in the Mexican state of Zacatecas is helping elderly parents obtain temporary U.S. visas to reunite with their undocumented children, many of whom they haven't seen in decades. The article follows the emotional reunion of José Antonio Rodríguez, who left Mexico 24 years ago, with his parents at an event in East Los Angeles. This initiative provides a rare opportunity for families separated by immigration status to reconnect, though the visa approval process is difficult, with only a small fraction of applicants being successful in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is championing a ballot measure that would redraw the state's congressional districts to favor Democrats, a move he frames as a necessary response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in other states. The proposal, which would temporarily override the state's independent redistricting commission, could help Democrats gain several House seats and is being cast as a way to fight back against what Newsom calls Donald Trump's "assault on institutions." This high-stakes political gamble is seen as a way for Newsom to elevate his national profile, though it faces criticism for abandoning the principle of non-partisan redistricting.</p>

          <p>A veteran LAPD Internal Affairs detective, Sgt. Joseph Lloyd, has earned the nickname "The Grim Reaper" for his reputation in pursuing career-ending misconduct investigations. Critics, including officers he has investigated, accuse him of twisting facts and ignoring evidence to secure terminations, making him a symbol of what they see as a biased disciplinary system. However, his supporters within the department maintain that Lloyd is a meticulous and dogged investigator entrusted with the most sensitive cases precisely because he is unafraid to hold fellow officers accountable, regardless of their rank or connections.</p>

          <p>The article profiles the Washington, D.C. neighborhood of NoMa ("North of Massachusetts Avenue"), formerly an industrial area known as "Swampoodle," as a prime example of successful pro-development urban policy. Through rezoning and strategic planning over the past two decades, the area has transformed into a high-density, mixed-use community with thousands of new apartments, offices, and retail spaces. This rapid growth showcases the principles of the "Yes In My Backyard" (YIMBY) movement, which advocates for building more housing to address affordability crises, making NoMa a case study in urban revitalization.</p>
