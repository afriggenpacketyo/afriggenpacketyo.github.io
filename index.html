        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Fox News article examines the impact of inappropriate text messages sent by the lead homicide detective, Michael Proctor, regarding Karen Read in the John O'Keefe murder case. Although the prosecution attempted to mitigate the damage by not calling Proctor as a witness, experts argue that the texts, particularly those revealing Proctor's early opinions on the investigation, could be detrimental to the state's case. The defense believes Proctor prematurely concluded Read was guilty before the medical examiner's report, potentially overlooking other evidence. The article also discusses the defense's strategy of calling Proctor's childhood friend to testify about the texts and the risks and benefits of this approach.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article explores the life of Xi Zhongxun, father of current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and how his experiences of being purged by the Communist Party and later helping to reform Chinese politics shaped his son's leadership. The article suggests that understanding Xi Zhongxun's life provides insights into the authoritarian rule of his son, who is considered the most authoritarian leader since Mao. Xi Zhongxun's complex relationship with the Communist Party and his eventual role in reform offer a unique perspective on the current political climate in China, and how his father's legacy influences his son's decisions. The article emphasizes the contrast between Xi Zhongxun's reformist tendencies and Xi Jinping's more authoritarian approach.</p>

Due to rising prices caused by tariffs, Geng had to remove a popular dish of American-imported salt-baked chicken feet from the menu.

          <p>This ABC News article reports that Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to run against Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026. Scholten's decision was partly motivated by Ernst's remarks at a town hall meeting regarding potential Medicaid cuts, where she responded to concerns about people dying with the statement, "Well, we're all going to die." Scholten, who has previously run for higher office, intends to make the race a referendum on President Donald Trump's trade policies, particularly their impact on Iowa soybean farmers. The article notes that while some House seats in Iowa are considered competitive, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008.</p>

Moore and Mansell believed the longline was illegal and reported it to state wildlife officers, taking photos as they freed the sharks. The longline belonged to a vessel permitted by NOAA to harvest sandbar sharks for research, and the divers were found guilty despite their belief that they were doing the right thing.

The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, indicating contraction for the first time since September of the previous year, driven by a decline in new export orders due to prohibitive U.S. tariffs. The article notes that foreign demand decreased significantly, with new export orders falling to their lowest level since July 2023.

The article explains that Oyun-Erdene received insufficient support in parliament, leading to his resignation and a warning that the confidence motion could destabilize the country's democracy. The protests were fueled by reports of lavish spending by the Prime Minister's son and Mongolia's decline in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.

          <p>This ABC News article recaps the 18th day of Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, focusing on the conclusion of testimony from a former assistant, identified as "Mia," who alleges she was tormented and sexually assaulted by Combs. Defense attorneys challenged Mia's credibility by presenting affectionate text messages and social media posts she sent to Combs. Prosecutors attempted to counter this by emphasizing that Mia's job required her to portray Combs in a positive light and that her silence about the abuse was due to fear and brainwashing. The article also details testimony from a hotel manager regarding Combs' use of aliases and unusual charges for cleaning damage in hotel rooms.</p>
