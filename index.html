          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson pushed a Buffalo Bills fan who smacked him and DeAndre Hopkins on the helmet following a touchdown pass. The incident occurred late in the third quarter, after Jackson threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins, extending Baltimore's lead. The NBC broadcast captured the fan's actions and Jackson's reaction, but no penalty was assessed. The Ravens were seeking revenge for a previous playoff loss to Buffalo, and Jackson's performance helped them take control of the game with 194 passing yards and two touchdowns. The Ravens ultimately defeated the Bills. The optimism score reflects the typical excitement and intensity of a football game.</p>

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot has secured approximately $100 million in funding led by Alibaba Cloud, marking its eighth financing round in under two years. The company also released an open-source AI model for embodied AI called Wall-OSS, aiming to accelerate the development of autonomous robots. X Square Robot anticipates "robotic butlers" could become a reality within five years, though acknowledges AI for robots lags behind generative AI. The startup plans to prepare for an IPO next year and is already generating revenue from sales to schools, hotels, and retirement homes with the aim of eventually entering the consumer market with lower priced robots. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the potential but also the challenges in the robotics industry.</p>

          <p>A China-US study analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core, a finding that contradicts previous expectations.
