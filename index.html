          <p>The article reports that the UK Parliament is set to debate the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England and Wales, after significant changes were made to it. The bill has undergone intense scrutiny and several amendments, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off on each request. The government also quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year. MPs will have a free vote on the bill, which has divided Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides, but ultimately, the passing of the bill would be a historic change for society.</p>

          <p>Trade ministers from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations convened in South Korea amidst concerns over U.S. tariffs. The meeting provided an opportunity for countries to engage with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer before the expiration of a 90-day pause on tariffs. Many countries, initially planning to send vice ministers, instead sent ministers to push for meetings with Greer. The article explains that President Trump had imposed tariffs on goods from numerous countries, claiming they exploited the U.S. through trade surpluses, but later suspended them for negotiations. Tensions between the U.S. and China loomed large, impacting the region's economic outlook, with APEC cutting its growth forecast due to trade frictions and policy uncertainty.</p>

The article notes that while the realism of these figures is debated, the Gulf states aim to be at the forefront of partnerships with the U.S. in business, military, and technology. The Gulf states see President Trump as a business-first leader who symbolizes fast money, big defense, and access to American tech, and they are competing with other regions for closer relations with the U.S. administration.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the potential for a far-right candidate, George Simion, to win Romania's presidential election. Simion's rise is attributed to decades of economic failure, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, leading to anti-establishment anger. The article explains that traditional parties have failed to address the broken economic model, resulting in Romania's slide to the far right. Simion's economic agenda caters to the domestic business class and promises tax cuts, but offers no genuine alternative for poor Romanians. The author fears Romania is falling into an abyss due to the lack of a political project offering a genuine alternative to the status quo.</p>

          <p>Legendary Motown singer Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department following sexual assault allegations. The accusations stem from a civil suit filed by four former housekeepers accusing him of sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence, and creating a hostile work environment. The article mentions that Robinson's attorney denies the allegations, claiming the accusers filed their police report after the civil suit to publicize their case. The accusers, identified as Jane Does 1 through 4, allege repeated sexual assaults during their employment, prompting the Sheriff's Department to open an investigation.</p>
