        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of International Trade panel will hear arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, questioning whether he exceeded his power by enacting tariffs on over 180 countries. Five domestic businesses filed the lawsuit, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the sweeping duties. The Department of Justice argues that IEEPA clearly authorizes the president to impose tariffs, and the court's decision could significantly impact Trump's ability to unilaterally impose import taxes. This article highlights the legal challenges facing the President's economic agenda.</p>

          <p>The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in April, resulting in a 12-month inflation rate of 2.3%, the lowest since February 2021, which was slightly below forecasts. This report indicates that President Trump's tariffs are beginning to affect the slowing U.S. economy, with shelter prices being the main driver of the increase.

The court found the conviction unsafe, and Sullivan, now 68, was released, marking one of the longest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended Prime Minister Keir Starmer's use of the phrase "island of strangers" in a speech on immigration, arguing he sought to highlight the impact of rising migration. Some Labour MPs criticized the language as divisive, comparing it to Enoch Powell, but Cooper rejected the comparison. The Prime Minister stands by his words and the argument he was making that migrants make a massive contribution to our country, but migration needs to be controlled. This article reports on the controversy surrounding the Prime Minister's comments on immigration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's promises that China needs America more than America needs China have not materialized, leading to a temporary reduction in tariffs. The administration cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent, with China reciprocating by lowering its levies from 125 percent to 10 percent. Despite Trump's claims, America seems to need other countries' trade as much as they need ours, diminishing Trump's negotiating position. (not investment advice)</p>
