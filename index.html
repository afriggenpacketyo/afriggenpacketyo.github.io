          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities, including the key uranium enrichment site at Fordo, which is buried deep underground and heavily defended. This consideration follows ongoing strikes between Israel and Iran. However, there is not full agreement among Trump's advisors on how to proceed. The issue was expected to be discussed in a White House Situation Room meeting with key national security officials, including the Vice President and Secretaries of State and Defense. The article highlights the potential target and the internal debate within the Trump administration regarding the appropriate course of action. Optimism is muted given the serious implications of such a decision. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, maintains her innocence, claiming the bloody bedroom was not a crime scene. Bob Dorotik was found dead in 2000, and investigators determined he was killed in the couple's bedroom, where they found bloodstains. Jane claimed the blood was from a nosebleed and their dogs, but authorities dismissed her explanations. After spending years in prison, Dorotik was temporarily released in 2020 due to COVID concerns, and in 2022, prosecutors dropped the charges, stating the evidence was insufficient to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The article recounts Dorotik's legal battle and her fight to clear her name after being convicted of murder.</p>

          <p>While Israel focuses on its conflict with Iran, the situation in Gaza worsens, with a recent day marked by numerous Palestinian deaths as they sought food. Health officials report that at least 59 people were killed and over 200 wounded by Israeli military actions while trying to access food aid, mainly at a distribution site in Khan Younis. Aid restrictions imposed by Israel, intended to prevent supplies from reaching Hamas, have led to severe hunger, with half a million Gazans facing starvation.

          <p>A federal appeals court is weighing whether President Trump can continue deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations. The legal battle centers on whether the president exceeded his authority by invoking Title 10 to federalize the National Guard in response to protests. A district judge previously ruled that Trump's actions were illegal and blocked the deployment. The article examines the arguments from both the Trump administration and California officials regarding the legality and necessity of the deployment.</p>

          <p>Tennis players, including Harriet Dart and Alex de Minaur, are calling for the introduction of identification measures when creating social media accounts to combat online abuse. Players cite the mind-blowing amount of abuse they receive, with data showing thousands of abusive messages sent to players' accounts. Some athletes avoid managing their own social media accounts due to the negative impact of this abuse. Jack Draper and Carlos Alcaraz also shared their concerns about the impact of online hate, particularly on younger players. </p>

          <p>The standard charge for car drivers using the Dartford Crossing will increase from Â£2.50 to Â£3.50 in September. The crossing links the M25 in Essex and Kent. Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood said the road was used by as many as 180,000 vehicles each day and the current charge was "no longer sufficient" to manage demand. Discounts will be available for local residents and drivers with pre-pay accounts. The fees were last increased in 2014, and the new charges are said to be lower than if they had increased in line with inflation since then.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break to tipped workers as part of their tax cut package, aiming to fulfill President Trump's campaign pledge. The Senate measure is similar to a House GOP provision but differs in two key ways: it caps the tax deduction at $25,000 per year and gradually reduces the deduction's value for individuals earning over $150,000. Tax experts note that the tax break would only benefit a small percentage of workers. (not investment advice)</p>
