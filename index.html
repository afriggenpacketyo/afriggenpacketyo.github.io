          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back from the brink of a major upset to secure her place in the Wimbledon semi-finals. She defeated 37-year-old German qualifier Laura Siegemund in a grueling three-set match that lasted nearly three hours. Siegemund's unconventional style, featuring slices and drop shots, frustrated the title favorite, who had to overcome a break in the final set to clinch the victory. Sabalenka credited her improved mental fortitude for helping her stay calm and pull through the difficult match, setting up a semi-final clash with Amanda Anisimova.</p>

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers is partnering with Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI to launch a $23 million National Academy for AI Instruction. The initiative aims to train educators on how to effectively and ethically use artificial intelligence in the classroom, addressing both the potential benefits and concerns like cheating. The AFT's goal is to empower teachers to harness AI as a tool to enhance learning, rather than being replaced by it. The academy will offer free virtual training to all 1.8 million union members, with a goal of training 400,000 educators in person over five years.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to finalize a new agreement to curb migrant crossings in the English Channel during Macron's state visit. The talks are focused on a "one in, one out" returns deal, which would allow the UK to send migrants back to France in exchange for accepting asylum seekers with family ties in Britain. The deal would also grant French police new powers to intercept boats in shallow waters. Macron emphasized that while bilateral cooperation is increasing, a broader European-level solution is essential for long-term success.</p>

The legislation introduces a new $6,000 deduction for seniors, which will reduce the taxable income for some, particularly middle-income retirees, but it does not remove the tax on benefits outright.

          <h2>MP James McMurdock Quits Reform UK to Sit as an Independent</h2>

          <p>James McMurdock, the Member of Parliament for South Basildon and East Thurrock, has announced he will not return to the Reform UK party and will continue as an independent MP. His decision follows a request to be suspended from the party amid a Sunday Times investigation into the eligibility of £70,000 in Covid-19 support loans his companies received. McMurdock stated that while his business dealings were compliant, sitting as an independent will allow him to focus entirely on his constituents. He is the second of five Reform MPs elected in the 2024 general election to leave the party.</p>

          <p>Alphabet-owned Waymo is expanding its driverless ride-hailing service by offering accounts for teenagers aged 14 to 17, starting in Phoenix. Parents can invite their teens to the program through their own Waymo accounts, allowing the minors to hail fully autonomous rides independently. The service includes safety features such as specially-trained support agents and the ability for parents to track trips in real-time. The move follows a similar offering from Uber and is part of Waymo's broader strategy to increase ridership and expand its service to new demographics and cities.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has detailed a plan to concentrate hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip into a sealed "humanitarian city" in Rafah, along the Egyptian border. According to reports, the goal is to separate the civilian population from Hamas and eventually transfer Gaza's entire population to this zone, where they would not be permitted to leave. Critics and human rights groups have condemned the plan, warning it could amount to forcible displacement and create catastrophic conditions akin to a large concentration camp, echoing dark historical chapters.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's Supreme Leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court found "reasonable grounds" to believe they have committed the crime against humanity of persecution, specifically targeting women and girls in Afghanistan. Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has imposed severe restrictions on female education, employment, and freedom of movement. The Taliban rejected the warrants, stating it does not recognize the ICC, while human rights groups have praised the move as a step toward justice.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new spending package, which includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, is expected to have a varied impact on the pharmaceutical industry. While the cuts will reduce revenue for most drugmakers, some are more exposed to the Medicaid market than others. According to a Leerink Partners analysis, companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead, which have significant sales from cystic fibrosis and HIV treatments covered by the program, will likely see a larger impact. Conversely, companies like Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer have the lowest exposure, with Medicaid accounting for a small percentage of their U.S. revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey suggests that the post-pandemic trend of "revenge spending" is giving way to "revenge saving," as many Americans adjust their financial habits based on their feelings about the economy. This "vibe-based budgeting," particularly common among younger generations, is driven by anxiety over rising prices and potential recession, leading consumers to build up emergency funds. Financial experts caution against letting emotions solely drive financial decisions and recommend a more intentional approach. They advise savers to assess their finances, use "reverse budgeting" to prioritize saving, and automate contributions to build a secure financial future.</p>
