          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, will have her memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,' published posthumously in the autumn. Giuffre, who alleged she was sexually trafficked to Prince Andrew, completed the manuscript before her death in April, as confirmed by publisher Alfred A Knopf. The book is expected to reveal intimate and disturbing new details about her experiences with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their associates. Giuffre's final wish was for the memoir to be released, emphasizing its importance in shedding light on systemic failures that enable the trafficking of vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of defense company Anduril, advocates for AI-powered autonomous weapons as the future of warfare, arguing the U.S. military relies on outdated technology. Anduril develops systems like the Roadrunner drone interceptor and the Fury unmanned fighter jet, designed to operate with artificial intelligence and minimal human intervention. While international groups raise ethical concerns about 'killer robots,' Luckey contends that smart weapons are safer than 'dumb' ones, and can reduce risks to American soldiers. He believes these systems promote peace by deterring adversaries, with Anduril securing billions in government contracts globally.</p>

Mahmoud, a 27-year-old doctor, hopes to study global health policy at the London School of Economics to help rebuild Gaza's healthcare system. While hopeful, students like Mahmoud and Mohammed face the heartbreaking prospect of leaving their families behind in a region grappling with constant displacement, famine, and insecurity. Campaigners urge the UK government to extend support to dozens of other Gazan students with scholarships, emphasizing the urgency of their situation.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has strongly denounced President Donald Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, labeling it a "most flagrant violation of our Constitution." Johnson asserted that Chicago does not require a military occupation and instead needs investment in its communities to build safety and affordability. He highlighted recent declines in homicides, robberies, and shootings in the city, arguing that federal intervention would erode public trust. The mayor and state leaders are evaluating legal options to protect Chicago from what they perceive as unconstitutional federal overreach.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to Maryland Governor Wes Moore's invitation to Baltimore by demanding the city "clean up this crime disaster" before he would visit, also threatening to reconsider federal funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge. Moore criticized Trump's rhetoric as "purely performative," highlighting a 20% decrease in statewide homicides since his inauguration and double-digit reductions in gun violence in Baltimore. Trump, who recently deployed National Guard to Washington D.C., claimed the capital was now crime-free and suggested similar interventions for other cities. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott also rejected military assistance, advocating for increased federal law enforcement resources instead.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has been recognized by the Catholic Church for over 70 medical miracles in 163 years, drawing millions of pilgrims annually.

Two new miracles were recognized since 2022, bringing the total to 72, each backed by extensive medical documentation and patient cooperation.

Investigators believe Bayoumi, an alleged Saudi intelligence operative with ties to two hijackers, conducted pre-operational surveillance of the Capitol, a likely target for Flight 93.

The French foreign ministry deemed Kushner's allegations "unacceptable" and a violation of international law regarding non-interference in internal affairs. France firmly rejected the claims, stating its authorities are fully mobilized against a rise in antisemitic acts since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.

          <p>Ukraine celebrated 34 years of independence amidst ongoing conflict, with Russia accusing it of drone attacks on a nuclear power plant and fuel terminal. Meanwhile, US Vice President JD Vance stated that Russia has made "significant concessions" to President Trump for the first time in years, showing flexibility on core demands in peace negotiations. However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov clarified that a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin is not yet planned, as the agenda remains unready. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy emphasized national resolve, while Canada and Norway pledged substantial new military aid, and Pope Leo XIV prayed for peace.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer provides his market analysis following a significant stock rally triggered by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signals of impending interest rate cuts. Cramer explains that the Fed's shift was driven by a dramatic deceleration in hiring, outweighing concerns about tariffs and inflation. He advises investors to focus on housing-related stocks, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, viewing them as bellwethers for market recovery. Cramer also highlights specific industrial and software stocks, while cautioning against enterprise software and autos. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel conducted air strikes on Houthi targets in Sanaa, Yemen, in retaliation for a missile attack on Friday that Israel claims involved cluster munitions. The Israeli operation targeted a military complex, a fuel depot, and power stations, resulting in four deaths and 67 injuries, according to Houthi officials. This Houthi strike marks their first reported use of such internationally banned bombs in the current conflict with Israel. The Israeli military is investigating why the missile carrying the munitions was not intercepted before dispersing bomblets, one of which caused minor damage in central Israel.</p>

          <p>A proposed cannabis excise tax cut in California has ignited a contentious debate between child-care advocates and the legal weed industry, threatening to reduce annual funding for crucial social services. The industry-backed bill, aiming to lower the tax from 19% to 15%, would slash $81 million annually from subsidized child-care slots for approximately 8,000 low-income children. Child care advocates express alarm, fearing further cuts amidst declining federal funding and the inherent instability of relying on "sin taxes." Governor Newsom's office pledges to prevent cuts if the measure passes, but the source of replacement funds remains unclear. (not investment advice)</p>
