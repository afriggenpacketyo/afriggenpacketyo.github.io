          <p>A natural gas plant in Dresden, New York, which also powers a large-scale Bitcoin mine, is causing distress for local residents due to constant noise and environmental concerns. The facility discharges hot water into Seneca Lake, potentially harming aquatic life and tourism, and emits significant amounts of greenhouse gases. Despite some community donations from the plant's owner, many residents and environmental groups argue the economic benefits, like a small number of jobs, do not outweigh the negative impacts on their quality of life and the local tourism-based economy.</p>

          <p>Canada has scrapped its planned 3% digital services tax on large tech companies just hours before it was set to take effect, prompting the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The tax, which would have impacted major US firms like Amazon and Meta, had been criticized by President Trump, who threatened retaliatory tariffs and paused negotiations.

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the CHP, is facing a critical court case that could nullify its recent leadership change and plunge it into chaos. The legal challenge, brought by the party's old guard, contests the legitimacy of the congress that elected a new, reform-minded leadership team. A ruling against the current leaders could effectively decapitate the party, which has been mobilizing large anti-government protests, and would be seen by many analysts as a strategic victory for President Erdogan, who has a history of exploiting internal divisions within his opposition.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary has unleashed a torrent of racist and Islamophobic attacks from political figures and commentators. The author argues that Mamdani, a progressive Muslim politician, has been unfairly targeted not just for his identity, but for his challenging political stances on the economy and Israel. The piece suggests that the vitriol directed at him reveals the establishment's fear of marginalized views gaining mainstream power and reflects a broader, anti-democratic impulse to discredit beliefs by attacking the person who holds them.</p>

The Japan Fair Trade Commission found that Harley-Davidson Japan K.K. imposed excessive sales quotas on its dealers. The company allegedly pressured dealerships by suggesting their contracts might not be renewed if targets were not met, which reportedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to fulfill the quotas.

While Ukraine is developing its domestic weapons industry and launching audacious drone attacks, Russia's wartime economy is facing headwinds, with officials warning of a potential recession and depleted financial reserves, casting uncertainty on the long-term conflict.</p>

          <p>In Kabul, the ancient and brutal blood sport of cockfighting continues to thrive in the shadows, despite being outlawed by the Taliban government since 2021. For many Afghan men, the practice is driven not only by tradition but also by widespread unemployment and economic desperation, with large sums of money gambled on the outcomes of the fights. The events, held in makeshift arenas, are a source of both livelihood and potential ruin, reflecting a grim reality where some owners reportedly prioritize the care of their fighting birds over their own families.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to buy the US operations of TikTok, with their identities to be revealed within weeks.

Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline, suggested that any deal would likely need approval from Beijing, but expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would agree to it.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing criticism for his recent comments about imposing new auto tariffs on Japan, during which he appeared to forget the name of the Japanese Prime Minister. In a television interview, Trump described a hypothetical letter he would send, beginning with "Dear Mr. Japan," to announce a 25% tariff on cars, claiming the current trade relationship is unfair. Critics pointed out the gaffe and also noted that the vast majority of Japanese cars sold in the United States are already manufactured domestically, making them less susceptible to the proposed import tariffs.</p>
