        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sig Hansen, the veteran captain from the television series "Deadliest Catch," has admitted that his perspective on retirement is changing due to a growing fear of his own mortality. After decades on the treacherous Bering Sea, the 59-year-old says the loss of fellow fishermen and his own health scares have made him more fearful each time he goes out. Hansen explained that his priorities are shifting towards spending more time with his wife and four grandchildren. While not ready to retire immediately, he acknowledged that the call of home is becoming stronger than the call of the sea.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has announced successful attacks on key infrastructure deep inside Russia, including a major oil refinery in Ryazan and an oil storage facility in the Voronezh region. The strikes, carried out by drones, also targeted a military airfield used for launching drones at Ukraine and an electronics factory supplying the Russian military. These operations represent a continued effort by Kyiv to disrupt Russia's war machine by hitting strategic assets far from the front lines. Meanwhile, a fire near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was reportedly brought under control.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, have exposed a significant graft scheme involving the procurement of military drones at inflated prices. A sitting lawmaker, local officials, and national guard personnel are accused of taking kickbacks of up to 30% on state contracts, with four people arrested. The announcement came just two days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament following public protests against a government move to curb their powers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the investigation, emphasizing a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption.</p>

          <p>A recent panel discussion highlighted the growing pressure on Israel, particularly from former President Donald Trump, regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Panelists noted that Trump appears to believe he has significant leverage over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, they also pointed out that Netanyahu's own domestic political considerations limit how much external pressure can influence his actions. The discussion reflects a complex geopolitical dynamic where international and U.S. political pressures are intersecting with Israel's internal political landscape during the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The nonprofit organization Black People Will Swim is working to combat a legacy of aquatic segregation and save lives by making swimming lessons more accessible to Black communities. Founder Paulana Lamonier started the group to address the stark statistic that Black people are significantly more likely to drown than their white counterparts, a disparity rooted in historical exclusion from public pools. The organization provides lessons and aims to create a ripple effect of more Black swim instructors and lifeguards. The initiative highlights a public health crisis and a determined effort to ensure everyone has a safe connection to water.</p>

The suspect, who was reportedly visibly intoxicated, was captured on video driving the cart through the airport's hallways. The joyride culminated in him driving the vehicle down a moving walkway that was too narrow, crushing metal and shattering glass along the path. Video of the destructive incident circulated widely on social media, gaining millions of views before the man's arrest in the early morning hours.</p>

          <p>Florida has emerged as a new leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year despite a state policy that removed climate change from official consideration. This growth is primarily driven by large utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are building solar farms because it has become cheaper than natural gas. Streamlined state regulations for projects under 75 megawatts have also accelerated development. However, the future faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing constraints on the state's power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that past critical comments from Sean “Diddy” Combs could complicate any consideration of a presidential pardon for the music mogul. In a recent interview, Trump acknowledged that while he considers Combs "sort of half-innocent" following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, the hostility Combs expressed towards him in 2017 and 2020 makes a pardon "more difficult." Trump admitted that while he tries not to let such things cloud his judgment, "we're human beings," suggesting Combs's past statements are a significant factor in his thinking.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis reveals how much apartment space a monthly rent of $1,500 can secure in major U.S. cities, highlighting significant regional disparities. In Manhattan, that budget gets an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it can afford a spacious 1,329 square feet. The most expensive markets are predominantly large coastal cities like Boston and San Francisco, where high demand and limited housing stock drive up prices. Conversely, renters find the most space for their money in Midwestern and Southern cities where housing is more affordable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has ordered Tesla to pay more than $240 million in damages after finding the company partially responsible for a 2019 crash that killed one person and severely injured another. The jury determined that Tesla's Autopilot technology was defective and that the company bore significant responsibility, even though the driver admitted to being distracted. The case is notable for having reached a trial, as many similar cases are settled out of court. Lawyers for the victims also claimed Tesla hid key data, which was later uncovered by a forensic expert.</p>

          <p>The cost of nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of over €3,200 per month, a sum that is crippling for many retirees. The dramatic increase is straining the country's long-term care insurance system, with nearly one-third of residents now relying on welfare payments. Experts attribute the rising costs primarily to necessary wage increases for historically underpaid nursing staff and an increase in staffing levels. Germany's Health Minister and other experts are calling for urgent, fundamental reforms to address the growing financial gap and ensure the system's future viability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A newly declassified annex from special counsel John Durham's report has further weakened claims by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard of a "deep state" conspiracy against Donald Trump. The document confirms that emails used by Trump supporters as evidence of a plot by Hillary Clinton's campaign were likely fabricated by Russian intelligence. This finding contradicts the narrative that U.S. officials manufactured intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The revelation presents a significant challenge to Gabbard's ongoing efforts to prove a "treasonous conspiracy" by the Obama administration.</p>
