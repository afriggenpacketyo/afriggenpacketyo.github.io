        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25%, even as inflation remains above the Bank's target rate, hinting at potential rate cuts as early as August. Governor Andrew Bailey acknowledged the unpredictable global landscape, particularly the impact of the conflict between Israel and Iran on energy costs. While marginally raising expectations for the UK economy, the Bank noted underlying growth remains weak, with signs of softening in the labor market. Policymakers are carefully monitoring events in the Middle East and their potential effects on oil prices, indicating a cautious approach to future monetary policy decisions. Optimism remains that a summer rate reduction could provide relief for borrowers, but the situation remains complex. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, originating on June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. Celebrations include parades, parties, concerts, and educational workshops. Despite some corporate sponsors tapering their support, communities continue to honor the day as a symbol of unity and resilience. The name "Juneteenth" combines June and nineteenth, marking the date when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce the Emancipation Proclamation, which had been issued two years prior. Opal Lee, known as the "Grandmother of Juneteenth," has played a significant role in advocating for its recognition.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the current state of Juneteenth, now a federal holiday, against the backdrop of a perceived national retreat from racial egalitarianism. The author notes that the holiday, intended as a celebration of emancipation, now stands in stark relief as policies and structures that enabled progress are being dismantled. With the election of Donald Trump to a second term, the article suggests a rollback of affirmative action, federal protections against discrimination, and voting rights. The author argues that the promise of a racial reckoning has been replaced by a day off, highlighting the hypocrisy of celebrating emancipation while the government undermines the history and progress it represents.</p>
