          <p>Italy is facing a severe demographic crisis, marked by a record-low birth rate of 1.18 babies per woman and a shrinking population. In towns like Fregona, the declining number of children threatens to close local primary schools, which mayors fear could lead to the slow death of their communities. Despite government incentives like cash bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient to address the high costs and lack of accessible childcare. Some private companies have started their own initiatives, like creating subsidized creches, but experts argue that massive, systemic changes and increased immigration are necessary to reverse the trend.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has identified Deputies Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn as the three officers killed in an explosion at a training facility. The blast, considered one of the agency's deadliest internal tragedies, occurred Friday morning at an East Los Angeles County site. The three men, who had a combined 74 years of service, were all assigned to the Special Enforcement Bureau's Arson Explosives Detail. An investigation is ongoing to determine if the explosion is connected to explosives seized by the same deputies the previous day.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers' 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from the injured list. He pitched six innings and allowed only one run, showcasing increased fastball velocity and effective control, a positive sign for the team's rotation. Glasnow has struggled with injuries and has been working to simplify his mental approach on the mound to achieve more consistent results. His solid outing is a crucial development for the Dodgers, who are counting on him to bolster their pitching staff for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China, focusing on strategies to counter Beijing's "economic coercion." Morrison's government faced significant trade tariffs from China after calling for an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19. His testimony comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, pursues warmer relations with China. Also testifying is Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan and a vocal critic of China's use of economic pressure against other nations.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, may inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings could explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis despite successful initial treatment. The research team also identified that using specific drugs alongside chemotherapy could inhibit this process in mice. A clinical trial based on these findings is now underway with human breast cancer patients to explore potential strategies for improving cancer treatment outcomes.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid an investigation into an alleged coup plot. The restrictions, which also include a ban on social media and contact with his son, were imposed over fears he might obstruct justice or flee the country. The case has drawn international attention, with U.S. President Trump threatening tariffs on Brazilian goods in what he calls an effort to stop a "witch hunt" against his ally.

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning as thunderstorms are expected to bring torrential rain and potential flash flooding. The Met Office forecasts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, creating a risk of fast-flowing, deep floodwaters. This severe weather follows a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and less able to absorb the intense rainfall, increasing the likelihood of surface water flooding. The warning covers London and a stretch of the south coast, with likely disruptions to transport and potential power cuts.</p>

          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have proposed a new design for an electromagnetic railgun that could nearly double the firing power of existing models. The proposed "X-railgun" involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single weapon system. This innovation aims to overcome the power limitations of the current naval railgun, which struggles with projectiles that are too light for effective warfare. According to the project team, the new design would allow for firing heavier shells up to 30kg at speeds of Mach 7, significantly enhancing the weapon's military application and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a U.S. Marine veteran, has brought a vision that helped him endure the Vietnam War to life by creating the "Carousel of Happiness." During the war, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a peaceful carousel in a mountain meadow to cope with the brutality around him. After struggling with PTSD for years, he decided to build that carousel, spending 26 years hand-carving animals for the ride. Now a nonprofit in Nederland, Colorado, the carousel has delighted over a million people and has become a source of healing and joy for Harrison and the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills. Supporters believe the law will legitimize digital currencies, bolster the U.S. dollar's global status, and revolutionize financial technology. However, critics express concern over potential loopholes for money laundering and the growing influence of the crypto industry, which heavily funded pro-crypto political candidates.

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to prepare for a future dominated by tokenization. The rise of stablecoins, which are digital tokens pegged to assets like fiat currencies, presents new challenges for payment infrastructure, anti-money-laundering efforts, and customer verification due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature. This warning comes as the market for digital currencies gains momentum, driven by the Trump administration's embrace of the technology and increased regulatory scrutiny from financial authorities worldwide.

He also stated that while he is not a proponent of the practice, he will continue to allow ICE agents to wear masks during operations due to safety concerns, citing a significant increase in attacks against officers. Lyons attributed the rise in community enforcement actions to more jurisdictions adopting "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>

The president's subsequent move to ask the Attorney General to release Epstein-related grand jury testimony was celebrated as a victory by leading supporters.

          <p>Travelers to the United States who require a nonimmigrant visa will soon have to pay a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250. This fee, part of the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is in addition to existing visa application costs and applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students. The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa conditions, such as not working without authorization and departing on time. However, implementation details remain unclear, and the U.S. Congressional Budget Office expects few travelers will ultimately seek reimbursement.</p>

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his physician. The White House doctor described the condition as "benign and common," especially in older individuals, and confirmed that tests showed no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins struggle to transport blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and wearing compression stockings, with the president's condition considered mild and manageable.</p>

          <p>A Nashville judge has ruled that Tennessee officials must deactivate a death-row inmate's implanted heart-regulating device just before his scheduled execution. The order was issued for Byron Black, whose attorneys argued that the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator could repeatedly shock him as the lethal injection drug stops his heart, causing extreme pain and a torturous death. The state had argued this was unlikely and that the inmate would be unconscious. The judge's ruling requires medical professionals to be on hand to disable the device moments before the execution proceeds on August 5.</p>

The move comes amid intense public pressure and criticism of the administration's handling of the Epstein files, particularly after it previously announced no further documents would be released. The request argues that releasing the materials is a matter of public interest, though the final decision rests with a judge. The process of redacting sensitive information to protect victims means any potential release could take a significant amount of time.</p>
