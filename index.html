          <p>An opinion piece explores the reasons why millennials are increasingly hesitant to become parents, noting the record low fertility rate in the U.S. The author suggests that one overlooked reason is the redefined understanding of ‚Äúharm,‚Äù ‚Äúabuse,‚Äù and ‚Äútrauma,‚Äù leading to higher standards for parenting. Adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents, citing emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, contributing to an almost impossible standard for parents to meet.

          <p>Counselors are advising international students applying for U.S. schools to carefully review and adjust their social media accounts due to increased scrutiny from the State Department. The Trump administration is expanding social media vetting as part of the student visa application process, though the specific content being targeted remains unspecified. Advisors recommend students eliminate political posts, particularly those related to controversial topics, and avoid sharing unverified information. Some critics worry that this scrutiny will inhibit students' freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that piracy of premium video services, especially live sports, is occurring on an "industrial scale," enabled by a lack of action from big tech firms. Enders Analysis accuses companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of "ambivalence and inertia" regarding the issue, which is costing broadcasters revenue and exposing users to cyber-crime risks. The report identifies the Amazon Fire Stick as a key enabler of piracy, while also noting the risk of malware and phishing scams for users who access illegal streams. Sky and DAZN executives have warned that piracy is causing a financial crisis in the broadcast industry.</p>

          <p>Proposed changes in the House Republicans' spending and tax package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," could extend federal student loan repayment terms to 30 years. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz warns that a 30-year repayment term equates to ‚Äúindentured servitude‚Äù. The House-passed bill would offer two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan (IDR) called the ‚ÄúRepayment Assistance Plan‚Äù (RAP), which would conclude in loan forgiveness after three decades. Monthly bills for borrowers on RAP would be set as a share of their income. (not investment advice)</p>
