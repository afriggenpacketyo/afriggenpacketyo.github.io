        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the growing trend of using electric grills as a more climate-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel grills. Many people are switching to electric grills due to their convenience and the increasing cost of propane, while also reducing their carbon footprint. Electric grills are becoming more advanced, with some models reaching high temperatures and offering precise temperature control, appealing to younger consumers and those in apartments where gas grills may be restricted. Some chefs note electric grills are convenient for cooking items that cook quickly, though purists may miss the flavors imparted by wood or charcoal. </p>

          <p>The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," encompassing President Trump's legislative agenda, narrowly passed the House but faces significant changes in the Senate. Senate Republicans aim to modify the bill, primarily due to concerns about its impact on the national debt, with some senators calling for steeper spending cuts. Democrats are criticizing the bill for favoring the wealthy while cutting social safety net programs. The Senate's modifications risk a complicated path for the bill when it returns to the House, with a Fourth of July deadline looming for both chambers to pass the legislation. </p>

          <p>This article reports on Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's return to the Cannes Film Festival after more than two decades, despite facing a 20-year ban on filmmaking and international travel in Iran. Panahi's new film, "It Was Just an Accident," confronts state violence and repression, telling the story of ex-prisoners seeking revenge on their torturer. The film was shot in secret and features unveiled female characters, defying Iran's hijab law, and is a sharp break from Panahi's previous works. Panahi insists he's simply doing the only thing he knows how, and that no regime can stop him from making films. </p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner for top investors in the $TRUMP meme coin, sparking accusations of corruption from protestors and Democrat senators, who called it an "orgy of corruption." Critics argue it's a way to buy access to the President, while the White House defended the event. Trump expressed his desire to be the nation's first "Crypto President" and has benefited from crypto industry campaign contributions. The Trump family also holds a majority stake in the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. </p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's top exporting city, experienced a 2.9% decline in exports in April, despite stronger-than-expected national growth. This decline suggests that traders are still facing challenges due to ongoing tariff tensions with the US. The city's export performance was volatile in the first four months of the year, indicating that trade remains susceptible to global tensions. </p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is set to vote on whether to renew an arms embargo on South Sudan, with Amnesty International warning that the conflict could worsen without it. The embargo, dating back to 2018, aims to prevent arms transfers to conflict parties, but violations have been reported, including the deployment of Ugandan soldiers and military equipment. Some citizens question the impact of UN peacekeeping efforts, while the UN insists it is doing all it can to stop the conflict. </p>
