          <p>A private dinner with Tan Su Shan, the CEO of DBS Group, was auctioned for approximately $14,790, more than doubling its pre-sale estimate. The event, managed by Sotheby's, was part of the National Gallery Singapore's 10th-anniversary gala, which raised over $2.8 million Singapore dollars in total. Such auctions offering experiences with high-profile business leaders are a common fundraising method, famously exemplified by dinners with Warren Buffett that have fetched millions. The proceeds from this event will support the gallery's mission to enhance art accessibility through new exhibitions, research, and community engagement programs.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced its intention to appeal a High Court decision that temporarily halted the deportation of an Eritrean man to France. The man's removal was part of a "one in, one out" deal, but he made a last-minute claim of being a modern slavery victim. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood criticized such claims as attempts to "make a mockery of our laws," while the UK's anti-slavery commissioner expressed concern over the rhetoric, stating there is no evidence of systemic misuse. This legal challenge questions the viability of the new migrant deal, a key government policy aimed at curbing small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK includes high-level diplomatic meetings following a day of royal pageantry at Windsor Castle with King Charles III. On Thursday, the president is scheduled for talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the country estate of Chequers to discuss a UK-US trade deal and other matters. The visit is considered unusual, as second-term US presidents are not typically offered a full state visit. The itinerary also includes a business reception and a joint news conference, while First Lady Melania Trump will participate in separate events at Windsor Castle.</p>

          <p>The Italian protest song "Bella Ciao" has entered the spotlight after the phrase was found on a bullet casing linked to the suspect in the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This article explores the song's complex history, from its disputed origins with early 20th-century female rice paddy workers to its adoption as an anti-fascist anthem in post-war Italy. The melody has since become a global symbol of resistance, utilized by various movements including feminist activists in Iran, pro-choice advocates in Poland, and demonstrators in Israel. Its recent resurgence in popular culture, notably through the Netflix series "Money Heist," has introduced it to a new generation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union environment ministers are struggling to agree on an updated emissions-cutting plan before a UN climate summit, highlighting deep divisions within the bloc. The European Commission's proposal to cut emissions by 90% by 2040 is supported by countries like Denmark and Spain but faces opposition from others, including Hungary and Poland, who fear economic damage. Due to the disagreement, a decision on the 2040 target has been delayed until at least October, meaning the EU will likely attend the upcoming summit without a finalized plan. The delay reflects a broader shift in focus towards security and economic concerns over climate action.</p>

          <p>He Lei, a former high-ranking general in the People's Liberation Army, has stated that mainland China would not need to use its most advanced, high-end weaponry to resolve the Taiwan issue by force. Speaking to Phoenix Television, the retired lieutenant general asserted that conventional weapons would be sufficient to achieve victory with minimal cost and casualties. He emphasized that the PLA's strength lies in its capacity for joint operations and system-based warfare rather than a direct weapon-for-weapon comparison. His comments provide insight into the strategic thinking within certain Chinese military circles regarding a potential conflict over Taiwan.</p>

It suggests that public figures, including Donald Trump, harness this anger as a political tool, and that media institutions reward outrage for engagement.

          <p>Abu Agila Mas'ud, the Libyan man accused of building the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, is claiming he was forced into a false confession. His lawyers have filed a motion in a U.S. federal court to have the alleged confession ruled inadmissible ahead of his trial. Mas'ud alleges that while in custody in post-revolution Libya in 2012, three masked men threatened his family and forced him to memorize and repeat a fabricated account of his involvement. This confession forms a key part of the prosecution's case against him for the terrorist attack that killed 270 people.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, intend to submit scientific and photographic evidence in a U.S. defamation lawsuit to prove that Mrs. Macron is a woman. The lawsuit targets right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has repeatedly promoted a conspiracy theory that the First Lady was born male. According to their lawyer, the Macrons find the claims incredibly upsetting and are resolved to do what is necessary to set the record straight, even if it means undergoing an unpleasant and public process. Owens's legal team has responded by filing a motion to dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds.</p>

          <p>Fraud investigators are warning of a significant increase in the misuse of Blue Badges, the UK's disabled parking permits. According to the Blue Badge Fraud Investigation agency, there are "more fakes than ever before," with permits being stolen, doctored, and sold online. The most common form of abuse involves family members using a relative's badge without the holder being present, and in some cases, using the badge of a deceased person. This fraud limits the availability of essential designated parking for genuinely disabled individuals, who describe the lack of accessible spaces as a constant challenge.</p>

          <p>Edward Enninful, the former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, has expressed concern that the fashion industry is at risk of regressing on diversity and inclusion. He stated that "anti-woke" rhetoric is currently having a cultural moment, leading to a potential return to an era where being super-thin and European is considered the primary standard of beauty. Enninful, who championed diversity during his tenure at the magazine, made the comments ahead of the launch of his new inclusive media platform. He believes the industry is in a state of flux and must decide what it stands for regarding representation.</p>

          <p>Pitcher Blake Snell delivered his best performance as a Dodger, leading the team to a 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. The two-time Cy Young Award winner pitched seven scoreless innings, recording a season-high 12 strikeouts and allowing just two hits. In a key moment, manager Dave Roberts showed confidence by allowing Snell to pitch out of a jam in the seventh inning, a decision that paid off. The win was supported by home runs from Freddie Freeman and Shohei Ohtani, helping the Dodgers maintain their two-game lead in the National League West division.</p>

          <p>A union representing workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the agency has paused approvals for remote work as a reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities. This follows a new telework policy from the parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, which no longer explicitly includes telework as an accommodation. The union, AFGE Local 2883, says the change has caused confusion and anxiety among disabled staff who rely on remote arrangements. According to an internal memo, the CDC is awaiting further clarification from HHS before processing any new or pending requests.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece argues that the United States is at a dangerous crossroads of hatred and violence following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, with few signs of reconciliation. The author contends that the political and media ecosystems incentivize extreme rhetoric and outrage, making it difficult to lower the political temperature. Unlike past tragedies, the current era is uniquely inflamed by social media, which amplifies division. The article notes that in the aftermath of the shooting, political camps have retreated into opposing narratives rather than seeking common ground, a trend exacerbated by President Trump's rhetoric blaming the "radical left."</p>

The ruling states that Khalil, a legal permanent resident, misrepresented his background on his green card application by failing to disclose certain past associations. His lawyers plan to appeal the decision, arguing the deportation effort is retaliation by the Trump administration for his activism. Khalil was previously detained for three months, and his case is part of a broader crackdown on foreign students involved in protests critical of Israel's actions.</p>
