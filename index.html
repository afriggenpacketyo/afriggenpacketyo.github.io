          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron stated at the G7 Summit that President Donald Trump suggested an Israel-Iran ceasefire offer was on the table, aiming to initiate broader discussions. Macron emphasized the positive nature of Trump's announcements and highlighted the key role the United States would play alongside France, Britain, and Germany in resuming serious discussions. Trump abruptly left the summit due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, adding urgency to the situation. The situation underscores the complex dynamics and diplomatic efforts underway amidst the ongoing conflict. Optimism remains cautious as stakeholders evaluate the proposed ceasefire. </p>

Attendees described long lines, disposal of water bottles before entry, and crowded misting stations, with temperatures reaching at least 88F (31C). One fan expressed reluctance to attend future events, including the World Cup, due to the poorly managed experience. Despite the Rose Bowl's capacity to handle large crowds, the combination of heat and inadequate water provisions led to significant discomfort and safety concerns, with some attendees requiring medical assistance for sun stroke.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles that has successfully intercepted thousands of rockets in Israel. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's size and the different types of missiles that would need to be intercepted. The scale and nature of potential threats to the U.S. pose substantial challenges compared to the Israeli context.</p>

          <p>An analyst argues that Israel's recent attacks have negatively impacted Iran's progress towards liberty and prosperity, which had been gradually improving due to the efforts of the Iranian people. Despite facing an oppressive government, Iran had been experiencing modest improvements in its political, economic, and social conditions. The election of President Masoud Pezeshkian aimed to repair Iran's social contract, and the country had made strides in regional diplomacy and negotiations for a nuclear deal with the U.S. However, Israel's attacks undermine these efforts and disregard the aspirations of the Iranian people for greater security and freedom.</p>

          <p>President Trump faces several options in addressing the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, ranging from escalating involvement to holding the course or pulling back. The Israeli prime minister has applied constant pressure on Trump to take a military path, and Trump may feel the need to deliver on his more belligerent threats to Tehran's leadership. Some advisors at the National Security Council are likely to be cautioning against any action that could add to the intensity of Israel's attacks. The pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson wrote a stinging criticism on Friday saying the administration's claims not to be involved weren't true, and that the US should "drop Israel".</p>

The G7 statement affirmed Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Iran as a source of terror.

          <p>President Donald Trump departed the Group of Seven summit early, citing reasons "much bigger" than planning a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, and urging Iranians to "immediately evacuate Tehran." G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel while calling for a resolution to escalating tensions in the Middle East. The statement condemned Iran as the "principal source of regional instability and terror," reiterating that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. The conflict has prompted concerns about global economic growth and Trump's tariff policies, adding to the complexity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and his South Korean counterpart Lee Jae Myung will meet on the sidelines of the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Canada. This will be their first face-to-face meeting since Lee replaced impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol earlier in the month. During a phone conversation last week, Ishiba and Lee expressed a shared commitment to developing bilateral relations in a stable manner. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic ties, signaling an opportunity to strengthen cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Gold Outperforms Treasurys, Yen, and Swiss Franc as Safe Haven</h2>

          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys this year, with spot prices surging 30%. Market experts attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities. Concerns about fiscal sustainability and geopolitical instability have fueled demand for gold as a safe store of value. While the dollar and U.S. Treasurys have historically served as safe havens, recent events have shaken confidence in these assets, leading investors to seek alternatives like gold.</p>
