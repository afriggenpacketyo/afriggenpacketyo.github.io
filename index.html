          <h2>Rugby League Community Mourns Passing of Legendary Player and Commentator Ray French at 85</h2>

          <p>Ray French, a revered figure in rugby league as both a dual-code international player and a celebrated BBC commentator, has passed away at the age of 85. French famously commentated on every Challenge Cup final for the BBC from 1982 to 2008, becoming the definitive voice of the sport for a generation. Before his broadcasting career, he was a distinguished player for St Helens and Great Britain, and also earned caps for England in rugby union. Tributes from across the sport have highlighted his immense contribution, warm personality, and the lasting legacy he leaves behind as a player, teacher, and broadcaster, for which he was made an MBE in 2011.</p>

          <h2>India Shows Resilience Against England After Ben Stokes Achieves Historic Century</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India mounted a determined resistance against England, closing the fourth day at 165-2 after a shaky start. Shubman Gill and KL Rahul forged an unbroken partnership, blunting an English attack that was missing the bowling of Ben Stokes. Earlier, Stokes scored his first Test century in over two years with a powerful 141, helping England to a formidable total of 669. This achievement made him only the fourth Englishman to score a century and take a five-wicket haul in the same Test, leaving England as strong favorites to win the match and clinch the series despite India's fourth-day fightback.</p>

          <p>A significant heat dome is causing dangerously high temperatures across the U.S. Midwest and Southeast, prompting widespread heat advisories and warnings. Forecasters predict temperatures in the upper 90s and heat indexes reaching up to 115°F in some areas, affecting over 30 million people from Florida to Virginia and westward into Missouri and Iowa. The National Weather Service is urging residents to take extreme precautions, such as staying hydrated, limiting sun exposure, and remaining in air-conditioned spaces to prevent heat-related illnesses. The extreme conditions are expected to persist through the coming week with little overnight relief, posing a significant health risk to the public.</p>

          <p>A major security operation was implemented as Donald Trump began a private visit to Scotland, playing golf at his Turnberry resort. While the day at the resort was uneventful, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to protest his visit, citing his political stances on various issues. During his trip, Trump is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The visit has sparked debate over its security costs and the controversial timing of the Scottish government announcing public funding for a golf tournament at another of Trump's courses in Aberdeenshire.</p>

          <p>An internal analysis by USAID officials found no evidence of systematic, widespread diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza, challenging claims made by the Trump administration and Israeli officials. The report, which examined over 150 incidents of aid loss between October 2023 and May 2025, concluded that in most cases the perpetrator could not be identified. This finding contrasts with the justification used for supporting the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to manage aid distribution. The State Department and the IDF have strongly pushed back against the report, asserting that significant aid diversion by Hamas is well-documented.</p>

          <p>BBC analyst Jeremy Bowen argues that airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza is a deeply flawed, last-resort measure that will not solve the growing starvation crisis. Drawing on his experience covering past conflicts, he describes airdrops as a crude process that delivers minimal supplies and often leads to tragic accidents, such as people being killed by falling pallets or entering minefields to retrieve them. Bowen contends that with functional ports and land borders nearby, the reliance on airdrops is an act of desperation, not a practical solution. He concludes that only a sustained, unrestricted ground-level aid operation following a ceasefire can truly address the severe hunger in Gaza.</p>

The recall campaign was initiated by critics who accused the KMT of obstructing key legislation and passing laws that favor China. However, the failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance, maintaining the current political balance of power on the self-ruled island.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats are formally requesting that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a copy of a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for the disgraced financier in 2003. The request follows reports that the book contains a letter signed by President Trump, a claim he has denied and sued over. Lawmakers state the book is relevant to congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related files. This move intensifies the political pressure surrounding the case, coming just before Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell is scheduled for a deposition with the House Oversight Committee.</p>

          <p>Despite Elon Musk's bold pronouncements about self-driving cars and an expanding robotaxi service, Tesla investors are showing increased concern over the company's immediate financial performance. Following a weak earnings report showing a 16% decline in automotive sales, Tesla's stock fell sharply, reflecting worries about slumping demand and rising competition. Analysts note that while long-term projects like robotaxis are promising, the market is currently focused on the company's core profitability, which is facing headwinds from expiring EV credits and tariffs. The skepticism marks a shift from the past, when futuristic promises often overshadowed lackluster financial results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Political analysts suggest that Donald Trump is unable to shake the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case because it strikes at the core of his populist appeal. The case involves powerful individuals allegedly engaging in illicit activities behind closed doors, a narrative Trump often uses against his opponents. However, his administration's handling of the Epstein files and his past association with the financier now position him as a defender of the elite in the eyes of some supporters. This perceived contradiction makes it difficult for him to control the narrative and deflect public interest, particularly among his own base.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic challenges the notion that reading is a strictly indoor activity, advocating for the unique pleasures of reading outdoors. It suggests that taking a book outside can be a form of play and a practice in sustained attention, sharpening one's perception of the surrounding natural environment. The piece argues that combining the intellectual engagement of reading with the sensory experience of being outdoors can create a richer, more memorable activity. To encourage this practice, the article provides a curated list of books that are particularly well-suited for being read in an open-air setting, from parks to beer gardens.</p>

While the TSA permits travelers to bring pets, including turtles, through security, they must be removed from their carriers and transported openly, not concealed on one's person. The agency used the bizarre incident to remind the public not to hide animals in strange places when traveling.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. study has detected the presence of PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," in nearly a third of tested reusable period products, including underwear, menstrual cups, and pads. These toxic substances are linked to serious health issues like cancer, fertility problems, and immune system effects. Researchers found that while some products had low levels likely from packaging, others contained high concentrations, indicating PFAS were intentionally used in manufacturing.

As his lung function rapidly declined, doctors gave him less than a year to live. Despite initial reservations, Kennedy, at age 74, was approved for and successfully underwent a double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. Now 75, his lung capacity is at 98%, and he is returning to his active life of training therapy dogs.

The article argues that the album's downtempo and melancholic yet intricate sound resonates with the current cultural mood, which seems to favor reserved, simmering music over high-energy party anthems. This trend is seen as a reflection of a collective malaise, making Bieber's gentle and emotionally complex music a fitting soundtrack for the season.</p>

          <p>The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a major U.S. global health initiative, has successfully avoided a proposed $400 million funding cut, thanks to bipartisan support in the Senate. However, the program's future is still precarious, as its congressional authorization has expired and the Trump administration has proposed significant cuts for the next fiscal year. The recent halt on foreign aid has already caused severe disruptions to HIV services in many countries, impacting treatment and prevention efforts. While advocates are relieved PEPFAR's funding was preserved for now, there is significant uncertainty about its long-term stability and operational scope.</p>
