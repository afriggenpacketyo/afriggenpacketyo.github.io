          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that Americans hold mixed opinions regarding the Trump administration's deportation program, with approval contingent on the perceived targets. A majority supports the program if it prioritizes deporting dangerous criminals, believing it enhances U.S. safety. However, support declines sharply if the program is viewed as targeting non-criminals or deporting an unexpectedly large number of people. Views on the program's economic impact are also divided, with more Americans believing it will weaken the economy, particularly those who think immigrants fill jobs Americans won't do.

          <p>The Guardian examines America's cultural infatuation with narratives surrounding boy geniuses and powerful men, arguing this obsession has detrimental societal consequences. The article critiques the romanticization of figures like Adam Neumann, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk, suggesting that their stories often overshadow ethical considerations and perpetuate harmful myths about success. The piece further contends that this fascination extends to historical figures, influencing political and economic structures. The author urges a reevaluation of these narratives, advocating for a shift away from celebrating individuals solely for their intelligence or ability to 'change the world,' and to stop blindly celebrating people for so low and ambiguous a bar as 'changing the world'</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles for resolving disputes in the South China Sea, aiming to foster peace and cooperation in the region. These principles include resolving disputes through equal consultation, managing differences through rules-based co-management, achieving mutually beneficial outcomes through cooperation, and opposing external interference. China's expansive claims over the South China Sea are contested by several ASEAN member states, leading to frequent face-offs, particularly with the Philippines, near disputed territories.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign in the recent Holyrood by-election, alleging that the SNP's tactics pushed voters toward Reform UK. Swinney defended his remarks by stating that Labour's vote share had collapsed, and SNP data showed a surge for Reform. Labour's Davy Russell won the seat, defeating the SNP candidate. The by-election was triggered by the death of Christina McKelvie, who had held the seat since 2011.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has sacked head coach Robert Vilahamn after two years in charge, despite leading the team to their first Women's FA Cup final in May 2024. The club cited disappointing results and performances this season, which saw them finish second-bottom in the Women's Super League. Women's managing director Andy Rogers stated that it was the right time to make a change.</p>

          <p>The Economist argues that the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles following immigration protests is not solely about restoring peace but also sends a message to Democratic-run cities resisting immigration enforcement. The article suggests that the move is a thinly-veiled threat to those who oppose the administration's deportation policies. The deployment is seen as a means of retribution against cities that stand in the way of mass deportations.</p>
