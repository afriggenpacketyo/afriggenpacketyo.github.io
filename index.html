          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a collapsed tunnel in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred in a seven-mile-long wastewater outfall tunnel currently under construction. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, was deployed to the scene. Fortunately, none of the workers sustained injuries and were able to climb over a pile of dirt to escape about an hour after the collapse.</p>

          <h2>Former Conservative Party Chairman Defects to Reform UK, Shifting Political Landscape</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's political dynamics are shifting as Reform UK gains momentum, highlighted by the defection of Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister. This follows several other former Tory MPs joining Nigel Farage's party, signaling a growing trend of conservative figures moving to Reform. The article notes that this has prompted the ruling Labour party to refocus its political strategy, now viewing Reform as a more significant long-term challenger than the Conservatives. This strategic pivot from Labour underscores the perceived sustainability and impact of Reform's rise in British politics.</p>

          <p>Poland has reintroduced spot checks at its borders with Germany and Lithuania, mirroring Germany's own measures that began in 2023. The move is a response to Germany's toughened migration policies, including the controversial practice of refusing entry to asylum seekers at the border. The article details the significant impact on daily life in border cities like Slubice and Frankfurt an der Oder, which have long promoted cross-border integration. Residents and local officials express concern over increased travel times and the strain on economic and personal relationships, fearing the erosion of the Schengen Agreement's free travel principles.</p>

          <p>Cierra Ortega, a contestant on "Love Island USA," has issued an apology after being removed from the reality show due to a past social media post containing a derogatory term for Asian people. In a video message, Ortega stated the post was from 2024 and that she deleted it immediately after being educated on its offensive nature. She expressed remorse and agreement with the network's decision but also revealed that she and her family have received death threats and harassment. This follows the recent departure of another contestant for using a racial slur, highlighting ongoing issues with contestants' past online behavior.</p>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a Salvadoran journalist who founded a Spanish-language news outlet, remains detained by ICE in Georgia even after an immigration judge granted him a $7,500 bond. Guevara was arrested in June while covering a protest, and though local charges were dropped, he was turned over to ICE. His lawyer claims ICE is appealing his release and making a "concerted effort" to keep him detained. Guevara, who has a work permit and a path to citizenship, has pleaded for his release, stating he is being persecuted for his journalistic work.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread fear among congregants, Bishop Alberto Rojas of the Diocese of San Bernardino has issued a decree allowing parishioners to miss Sunday Mass. The decision comes amid a major federal immigration enforcement push by the Trump administration that has led to nearly 2,800 arrests in the Los Angeles area. The bishop stated that the "fear of attending mass due to potential immigration enforcement action" constitutes a grave inconvenience. He encouraged those who stay home to maintain their spiritual connection through prayer and scripture, as some churches report attendance has dropped by as much as half.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has failed to rebound completely since the COVID-19 pandemic, remaining nearly a year lower in 2024 than in 2019. While the virus was the primary driver of the decline during the pandemic's peak, the current shortfall is now largely attributed to drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The study highlights significant disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower recovery than white and Asian residents. These findings suggest that while the acute phase of the pandemic has passed, its ripple effects and underlying health inequities persist.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods, explicitly linking the trade measure to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a statement, President Trump called the trial against his political ally a "witch-hunt that should end immediately." In response, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva asserted his country's sovereignty and the independence of its judiciary, rejecting any "tutelage." Lula also refuted Trump's claims of an unfair trade balance, pointing out that the U.S. actually runs a trade surplus with Brazil. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is the latest escalation in the administration's campaign against international bodies and officials it deems hostile to Israeli interests, including the International Criminal Court.

          <p>Former Representative George Santos, before beginning his seven-year prison sentence for wire fraud and identity theft, made a final public statement on social media. In his post, he declared he was not suicidal and warned against believing any reports to the contrary, citing the dangers for gay men in federal custody. When a follower asked about a presidential pardon, Santos claimed, without evidence, that House Speaker Mike Johnson had blocked President Trump from granting one. This allegation has been met with skepticism, as the House Speaker has no formal power to prevent a presidential pardon.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 jobs at NASA, targeting high-ranking employees with specialized and management skills. According to documents obtained by Politico, the cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements. This move would deprive the agency of significant institutional knowledge and experience as it faces proposed budget cuts that could cancel numerous science programs. The news has caused concern within the space industry and among former NASA officials, who warn it could cede U.S. leadership in space exploration to China.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly flooding in Kerr County, Texas, was exacerbated by delays in the emergency alert system, according to a former county official and emergency radio traffic. A firefighter's request to activate the CodeRED alert system to warn residents was delayed because it required supervisor approval. While the National Weather Service issued multiple warnings, including a "PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION" alert, many residents said they received no local notification. This failure in the local warning system is being scrutinized as a contributing factor to the disaster's high death toll, which has now reached at least 120 statewide.</p>
