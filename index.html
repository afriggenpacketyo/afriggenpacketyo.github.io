          <h2>Expert Identifies Five Principles for Achieving Happiness Independent of Wealth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 17:32:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychology expert, Morgan Housel, asserts that genuine happiness is cultivated through contentment, not material wealth, and outlines five principles to achieve this state. The article emphasizes appreciating the beauty in everyday life and finding satisfaction with what one already has, rather than perpetually desiring more, which often leads to less happiness. It highlights that the happiest individuals are frequently the most content, irrespective of their financial status, and that low expectations can foster significant psychological wealth. The piece concludes that happiness is ultimately the state where nothing feels missing, encouraging a shift in perspective to realize one's inherent richness and avoid the endless pursuit of more.</p>

          <p>Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, remained silent when reporters pressed him on whether his party's attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, should withdraw from the race. This intense questioning followed the surfacing of texts from Jones that depicted violent scenarios, including a hypothetical murder of former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert. Warner also notably averted questions about a significant $25,000 donation he made to Jones's campaign, which has drawn scrutiny. His refusal to comment starkly contrasts with Senator Tim Kaine's public defense of Jones, who cited the nominee's apology and suggested the remarks were uncharacteristic. Jones is currently facing growing calls to step down amid these ongoing controversies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 17:27:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Numerous U.S. airports, including major hubs like Denver, Newark, and Burbank, experienced significant flight delays as a result of a critical shortage of air traffic controllers, a problem intensified by the ongoing government shutdown. Federal officials reported an uptick in sick calls among controllers, who, despite being essential workers, are required to continue working without pay during the shutdown. This staffing crisis forces the Federal Aviation Administration to reduce the number of takeoffs and landings to maintain safety, leading to thousands of delayed flights across the nation. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association emphasized the aviation system's fragility, advocating for urgent acceleration of training and hiring to address these vulnerabilities and prevent future disruptions.</p>

          <p>UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick stated that extreme lack of integration can lead the country into a "very dark place," defending past remarks about the Handsworth area of Birmingham. Jenrick had previously described Handsworth as poorly integrated, noting a lack of diversity during his visit. West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker criticized these comments as racist, a claim Jenrick strongly denied. Jenrick linked integration issues to national security, citing a recent terrorist attack in Manchester where the perpetrator was not well-integrated. The Conservative party is addressing integration as a key theme, with leader Kemi Badenoch acknowledging fragmentation but rejecting generational failure.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has officially formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season, according to the National Hurricane Center. The system, currently positioned over 1,300 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, is projected to steadily intensify over the coming days and is expected to reach hurricane strength. A tropical storm watch has been issued for several Caribbean islands, including Barbuda, Anguilla, and St. Martin, as a precautionary measure. Although Jerry is not currently forecast to make landfall, it is anticipated to generate dangerous swells, leading to life-threatening surf and rip currents, along with up to four inches of rain in the Leeward Islands, raising concerns for potential flash flooding.</p>

          <p>A new study by the National Council on Aging and the University of Massachusetts Boston reveals that low-income Americans over 60 die an average of nine years earlier than their wealthier counterparts. The analysis, based on data from 2018-2022, also found that middle-income seniors experience reduced longevity compared to the affluent. Researchers attribute this disparity to factors such as inadequate preventative care, inability to afford medical treatment, and the chronic stress of financial instability. With the senior poverty rate rising to 15% last year, the findings underscore widening economic inequality and its severe impact on health outcomes for older adults.</p>

The hackers had attempted to extort £600,000 in Bitcoin and even posted some children's profiles on their darknet site before blurring images and eventually claiming to delete all stolen data.

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived in Illinois, sparking strong condemnation from Governor J.B. Pritzker, who labeled the deployment an "authoritarian march" by the Trump administration. The Illinois governor, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, stated they received no advance notice and filed a lawsuit to block the federalization and deployment, calling it "illegal, unconstitutional, and dangerous." Texas Governor Greg Abbott confirmed the deployment was authorized by the President to ensure safety for federal officials. Illinois officials accuse the Trump administration of using military force as political props to create chaos and justify federal intervention in cities.</p>

          <p>California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is preparing for imminent layoffs as the U.S. government shutdown continues, impacting its NASA funding. Although JPL employees are not directly furloughed as they are CalTech staff, the laboratory's budget is entirely dependent on federal appropriations. The Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to NASA, particularly targeting planetary and Earth-observation missions, create significant uncertainty for JPL's future. The ongoing budget stalemate in Congress, with differing House and Senate proposals, has left employees anxious about job security. This situation highlights the vulnerability of scientific research institutions to political gridlock and budgetary disputes.</p>

He stated President Trump's desire for U.S. AI leadership and the goal of the world building on the American tech stack, including chips and platforms from Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. Huang's remarks follow an agreement where Nvidia and AMD would give 15% of China sales revenue to the U.S. government for export licenses. He cautioned that a complete ban on chip exports to China would ultimately hurt American companies more in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire tech investor Orlando Bravo, co-founder of Thoma Bravo, declared that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently in a "bubble," drawing comparisons to the dot-com era. He cautioned that investors cannot justify valuing a $50 million annual recurring revenue company at $10 billion, as it would require immense future free cash flow to double investor money. However, Bravo noted a key distinction from the dot-com collapse: large companies with healthy balance sheets are now financing AI businesses. This suggests a more stable, albeit still inflated, market for AI investments, despite examples like OpenAI's $500 billion valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock fell 3% after a report from The Information raised concerns about the profitability of its cloud business, particularly its strategy of renting Nvidia chips to clients like OpenAI. The report indicated Oracle achieved only 14% gross margins on $900 million in sales from its Nvidia cloud operations, significantly lower than its overall 70% gross margin. This suggests that the high cost of Nvidia chips and aggressive pricing for AI chip rentals could pose profitability challenges for Oracle's ambitious cloud expansion plans. The company had previously forecasted substantial growth in cloud infrastructure revenue, largely driven by its involvement in the Stargate project with OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles, despite its rich literary history, has seen its writing community struggle with dwindling support and spaces. To address this, poet Christopher Soto founded the Center for California Literature, aiming to connect and advocate for L.A. writers through readings, workshops, and community building. The initiative emerged from Soto's observation of writers leaving L.A. due to lack of opportunities, a problem exacerbated by cuts to arts funding and library losses. Supported by renowned authors like Roxane Gay, the center's launch showcased diverse literary talents and highlighted a strong demand for a dedicated hub to foster L.A.'s vibrant, though often overlooked, literary scene.</p>

The computer maker now anticipates annual revenue growth of 7% to 9%, up from its previous 3% to 4% forecast, and diluted earnings per share to increase by at least 15%, compared to prior expectations of 8% or higher. CEO Michael Dell attributed this revised guidance to the "unprecedented pace of change in technology," particularly in artificial intelligence, and strong customer demand for AI infrastructure solutions.

Reports of Combs' legal team reaching out to the Trump administration for a pardon surfaced months ago.

She consistently refused to discuss "personnel matters" or "ongoing investigations," instead pivoting to the administration's focus on crime reduction.

          <p>Furloughed federal workers face unprecedented financial uncertainty as a White House draft memo suggests they may not be entitled to back pay once the government reopens. This interpretation contradicts the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, signed by President Trump, which was widely understood to guarantee retroactive pay. Trump himself stated that back pay would "depend on who we're talking about," and has threatened mass firings. Federal employee unions are challenging this stance as a "frivolous" misinterpretation of the law, with legal experts suggesting potential class action lawsuits.

While her ousting is unlikely, the votes reveal fragile trust within the political center.
