          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for an expedited review of its executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and undocumented immigrants. This move follows lower court rulings that blocked the order, which reinterprets the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. The administration argues the policy is crucial for border security, while opponents like the ACLU contend it is unconstitutional and a departure from over a century of legal precedent. The case could have profound implications for hundreds of thousands of people born in the U.S. each year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal officials have confirmed that the suspect who attacked an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas was acting alone and specifically targeting ICE agents. The shooter, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, used a legally purchased rifle from a nearby rooftop, resulting in the death of one detainee and critically injuring two others. Investigators found notes indicating the attack was premeditated and driven by animosity towards ICE, with the suspect reportedly using apps to track agent locations. The incident has heightened concerns about violent rhetoric directed at law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-EU party, led by President Maia Sandu, is set to win a majority in parliamentary elections, a result seen as crucial for the nation's path toward joining the European Union. The election was marked by tensions and allegations of "massive Russian interference," including disinformation campaigns and efforts to buy votes. Despite a pro-Russian opposition leader prematurely claiming victory and calling for protests, Sandu's party secured a commanding share of the vote. The outcome reinforces the country's Western-oriented trajectory, even as it navigates economic challenges and the influence of the nearby war in Ukraine.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:04:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland. Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield argue the president's action is unlawful, as there is no "rebellion" or widespread lawlessness to justify federalizing state reservists. State officials assert that local law enforcement has the situation under control, which involves small protests at a single ICE facility. They accuse the president of acting on false information, potentially from misleading media reports that conflated current events with larger 2020 protests.</p>

          <p>A major overnight Russian aerial assault on Ukraine, involving dozens of missiles and drones, has resulted in at least four deaths and numerous injuries in the capital, Kyiv. The attack, which targeted civilian areas including residential buildings, is the most significant bombardment of the city in over a month and included the death of a 12-year-old girl. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike, stating it demonstrates Russia's desire to continue the conflict following the UN General Assembly. Ukrainian air defenses successfully intercepted a majority of the projectiles, but the attack caused widespread damage.</p>

In an interview, Trump expressed confidence that the public would support his position, which focuses on cutting spending and linking any healthcare discussions to stricter immigration policies. Democrats have pushed back, seeking to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies and accusing the administration of creating a crisis. A high-stakes meeting between the president and congressional leaders is scheduled for Monday to attempt to avert the shutdown.</p>

While these drugs are available on the UK's NHS, strict eligibility criteria and regional disparities mean the vast majority of users pay privately, with costs running up to £350 a month. This financial barrier disproportionately affects lower-income communities, which already have higher rates of obesity.

          <p>In an exclusive interview, acclaimed Chinese author Yan Lianke reflects on the recurring speculation that he is a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The 67-year-old writer states that he no longer feels any external pressure from the prospect of winning awards, as his focus remains on the internal challenges of his own writing and existence. He comments on the nature of literary greatness, asserting that the best works invite diverse interpretations and discussions. Yan Lianke also upholds the principle that all aspects of human experience are valid subjects for literature, without any hierarchy of importance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels have finished in last place for the second consecutive season, marking a decade of underperformance despite having star players and a significant payroll. The team's struggles are attributed to a lack of organizational depth, poor fundamentals, and an inability to develop a consistent winning core around its veterans. With owner Arte Moreno not expected to sell the team, questions remain about the future of the front office and coaching staff. The article suggests that without significant changes to the organization's philosophy and investment in development, the cycle of losing seasons is likely to continue.</p>

          <p>A field of Democratic candidates for California governor gathered for their first major debate, largely agreeing on key issues such as affordability, immigration, and countering President Trump. The forum featured prominent figures like Katie Porter, Xavier Becerra, and Antonio Villaraigosa, who sought to differentiate themselves through their personal backgrounds and subtle policy nuances. With the primary eight months away and no clear front-runner, the candidates emphasized their immigrant roots and commitment to building more housing. One point of divergence was on a past anti-crime ballot measure, revealing differing approaches to criminal justice reform.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to introduce new requirements for migrants seeking to gain permanent settlement status, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is expected to announce. Under the proposal, legal migrants would need to demonstrate their contribution to society by learning English, maintaining a clean criminal record, and volunteering in their communities to qualify for indefinite leave to remain. The policy aims to ensure migrants are integrated and is positioned as a fair but firm approach to immigration. Labour also intends to double the time it takes to gain this status from five to ten years.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer refutes comparisons between the current artificial intelligence buildout and the dot-com bubble of 2000, arguing the circumstances are vastly different. He points out that today's massive AI investments are being made by highly profitable tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google, not by speculative startups funded by debt. While the dot-com era was fueled by a rush of unprofitable public offerings and a fiber-optic network built on credit, the AI revolution is driven by established companies that require this technology to maintain their market dominance. He contends that AI is a necessity for these firms, not a speculative bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the United States, Mexico, and Canada prepare for a 2026 review of their trade agreement (USMCA), Asian economies should actively participate in the public consultation process to protect their interests. Trade and investment from Asia into North America have surged, with Asian exports to the region reaching $1.7 trillion in 2024. Foreign direct investment from Asia into Mexico has more than tripled since 2019, as companies seek to leverage USMCA tariff preferences and diversify supply chains.

          <p>A new record was set for the most people to cross the English Channel in a single small boat, with a vessel carrying 125 individuals arriving in the UK on Saturday. This crossing was part of a larger movement that saw 895 migrants arrive in 12 boats on the same day, bringing the year's total to approximately 33,000. The event coincided with another tragedy in the Channel, as the body of a migrant was discovered on a French beach, marking at least the 27th death from crossing attempts this year. The continued crossings are placing sustained pressure on the UK government's immigration policies.</p>

His withdrawal significantly alters the race, which now primarily features Democrat Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo.
