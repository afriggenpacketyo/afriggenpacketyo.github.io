          <p>President Trump highlighted the Trump Savings Account initiative within the GOP's megabill during a White House roundtable with lawmakers and CEOs. The program aims to provide a $1,000 deposit into a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund for each newborn, with potential annual contributions up to $5,000. These accounts are intended to support future expenses like college or home down payments, fostering lifelong success for millions of children, while House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasized the transformative potential of this policy for American families. The accounts will be open for additional private contributions from family, friends, employers, churches, private foundations and more. Optimism surrounding the program's potential impact on future generations is tempered by economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that could significantly cut funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially impacting millions of Americans. A KFF survey reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA health plans identify as Republicans, with a large portion identifying as "MAGA" Republicans. This presents a challenge as proposed cuts could disproportionately affect Republican constituents, especially those who are self-employed or reside in states that did not expand Medicaid. The situation is further complicated by the fact that many red states did not expand Medicaid, leaving a broader population eligible for ACA tax credits.</p>

Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, while The New York Times expressed gratitude for the court's protection of honest reporting. While Baldoni can amend claims related to Lively allegedly breaking her contract, the initial defamation claims did not hold up in court because Lively's accusations were part of legal filings and therefore protected.</p>

Reverse mortgages, on the other hand, offer a longer-term solution, allowing retirees to borrow money without repayment until they die or sell the home. The choice between the two depends on individual financial circumstances, the intended use of funds, and the ability to repay the loan.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) can help individuals save money in an economy with persistent inflation by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. Today's leading accounts come with strong returns, and rates can be locked in for the term of the CD, making them safe investments. Online banks tend to offer more competitive rates, and short-term CDs can sometimes provide better yields than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, by buying some one year, some two years, and some three years, is one way to take advantage of high rates while also saving for the long-term. (not investment advice)</p>
