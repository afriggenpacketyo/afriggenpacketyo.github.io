          <p>Musician John Fogerty reflects on his career and the emotional journey of re-recording his classic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a new album, "Legacy." After losing control of his music catalog following the band's breakup in 1972, Fogerty endured years of legal and personal struggles, which he compares to a form of death for an artist. Encouraged by his wife Julie, he eventually repurchased the rights and recorded the new versions with his sons, an experience he describes as both a family affair and a deeply personal process of revisiting the feelings from when he first created the iconic tracks.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the contract will support approximately 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates to operate in northern Europe, representing a significant win for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

Organizers state the mission aims to bring essential supplies like food and medicine to a region that food experts have warned is experiencing famine. The effort highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid the nearly 23-month war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker strongly condemned the Trump administration's plans to deploy federal agents, and potentially National Guard troops, for immigration enforcement in Chicago. In an interview, Pritzker argued that such actions are illegal, disruptive, and create fear within communities, affecting U.S. citizens as well as immigrants. He stated that the administration has not coordinated with state or city officials and accused the president of using the deployment for political purposes rather than genuinely addressing crime.

          <p>Two climate activists from the group Futuro Vegetal were arrested after smearing red and black paint on Barcelona's iconic Sagrada Familia basilica. The protest was intended to highlight government inaction on climate change, which the group links to the devastating summer wildfires that have ravaged Spain. Citing government data, the activists claim a significant percentage of wildfires are related to livestock farming. This act of vandalism is one of many similar protests staged by the group, which has previously targeted famous artworks and superyachts to draw attention to what it calls a climate emergency.</p>

          <p>Research based on interviews with formerly incarcerated Black men in Philadelphia highlights the profound and lasting mental health challenges they face after release. The study reveals that experiences of violence, racism, and the psychological weight of incarceration contribute to higher rates of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Many participants described feeling that the confinement continues through parole, probation, and the struggle to find employment, which isolates them from supportive relationships and resources. The findings underscore the need for trauma-informed services to address these deep-seated issues.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a student explains the decision to turn down an admission offer from Yale University in favor of attending a small Bible college. The author argues that elite institutions like Yale have shifted from promoting intellectual rigor to enforcing ideological conformity, which stifles dissenting views. The choice was framed not as a rejection of academic challenge, but as an embrace of a different kind of formation focused on character, faith, and wrestling with eternal questions. The author contends that this path offers a more genuine intellectual freedom and a deeper sense of purpose than the prestige associated with an Ivy League degree.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," delves into the complexities of chronic pain, revealing that its source often lies within the brain rather than the site of a physical injury. The article highlights the case of a musician with complex regional pain syndrome whose debilitating pain was traced to his brain memorizing an old injury incorrectly. Through an experimental deep brain stimulation treatment, doctors were able to predict and interrupt his pain signals before he consciously felt them. This research suggests a revolutionary approach to managing pain, framing it as a neurological condition that can potentially be retrained or controlled.</p>

Badenoch argued it was "absurd" for the UK to leave resources untapped while neighboring countries extract them.

While some of the tech job decline began before the widespread use of AI, economists believe the technology is accelerating the trend by automating routine tasks.

White found a connection with the character's inability to form real connections off-stage, drawing parallels to his role in "The Bear."

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, including his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, are raising concerns about the central bank's long-standing political independence. Experts suggest that if the executive branch gains significant control over the Fed's board, it could impact monetary policy, bank regulation, and the stability of the U.S. financial system. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, critics warn that politicizing the Fed could undermine its credibility and lead to economic instability, similar to situations in countries where leaders dictate monetary policy.

          <p>A decade ago, the declining industrial town of Altena, Germany, volunteered to accept more migrants than required, hoping to revitalize its economy and shrinking population. While the initiative brought some new life to the town, with many newcomers finding homes and jobs, it was not a panacea for its deep-seated problems. Some migrants moved on to larger cities for better opportunities, while others struggled with integration, adding to welfare costs. The town's experience reflects the broader complexities of Germany's migration policy, with recent election results showing rising support for the anti-immigration AfD party amid local frustrations.</p>

          <p>The recent release of transcripts from an interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has drawn criticism over the Justice Department's line of questioning. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that associates of Jeffrey Epstein were serving in President Trump's cabinet, but Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche did not press her for names. Critics and former prosecutors argue that many questions were superficial and failed to challenge Maxwell's frequent claims of a poor memory. Attorneys for Epstein's survivors also noted they have not been contacted by the DOJ, suggesting a lack of commitment to uncovering the full extent of the trafficking network.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that many of President Donald Trump's policy decisions are rooted in a fundamental lack of understanding rather than ideology, citing his first-term Secretary of State's alleged description of him as a "moron." The piece uses the example of Trump ordering a massive water release in California, based on a flawed belief it would prevent wildfires 200 miles away, as evidence of dangerous decision-making. The author contends that this pattern of acting on incorrect information, from trade tariffs to scientific matters, poses a significant risk to the country, distinct from standard political disagreements.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, commemorates the 140th anniversary of three Hawaiian princes introducing surfing to the American mainland. In 1885, teenage royals David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui were studying at a nearby military school when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood and rode the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of what was then a royal Hawaiian sport captivated locals and planted the seed for surfing culture in the United States. The exhibition aims to shed light on these little-known origins of the now-popular sport.</p>

          <p>A trend of taxing the real estate of the wealthy is gaining momentum across the U.S., with states like Rhode Island and Montana implementing new levies on expensive second homes. Dubbed the "Taylor Swift Tax" in Rhode Island, the measure imposes a surcharge on non-primary residences valued over $1 million, driven by tight state budgets and populist sentiment over housing affordability. Real estate brokers and some residents argue these taxes unfairly target seasonal homeowners who contribute significantly to local economies without heavily using municipal services. Critics of the policy warn it could deter investment and may not generate the revenue projected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of a broader initiative to combat plastic pollution, the Australian state of South Australia has banned single-use, fish-shaped soy sauce containers. The small, pre-filled plastic containers are a staple in many Asian restaurants but are difficult to recycle due to their size, often ending up as environmental waste. The ban is an extension of previous legislation that targeted other single-use plastics like straws and carrier bags. Officials hope the policy will help reduce plastic flow into the ocean and protect marine life, though consumers will still have access to soy sauce from larger bottles and sachets.</p>
