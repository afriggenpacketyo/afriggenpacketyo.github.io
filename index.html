          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported an additional 11 deaths due to malnutrition, bringing the total of such fatalities to 212, including 98 children.

The plan has drawn widespread condemnation from international bodies and humanitarian agencies, who warn it will exacerbate an already catastrophic situation where famine conditions are emerging and aid delivery remains severely restricted.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's second-term economic policies, characterized by high tariffs, reduced subsidies, and attacks on scientific institutions, amount to a strategy of "degrowth." While not intentional, these actions are raising prices, suppressing consumption, and lowering productivity, effectively shrinking the economy. The author contends that policies like the global trade war and cuts to renewable energy and education funding will lead to a future where Americans pay more for less, harming long-term prosperity and innovation.

          <p>Tesla is reportedly abandoning its in-house AI supercomputer project, known as Dojo, as key staff members leave for a competing data center firm. The project was intended to process vast amounts of visual data to train the company's Full Self-Driving software. CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged the project was a "long shot" and stated that it is more sensible to focus resources on a single AI chip design. This move signals a strategic shift, with Tesla now expected to rely more on external partners like Nvidia for its AI infrastructure needs.</p>

          <p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The U.S.-brokered deal includes the creation of a major transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, which will be named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity." The agreement is a significant diplomatic achievement for the Trump administration and marks a shift in geopolitical influence in the South Caucasus region, diminishing Russia's long-standing role as mediator.</p>

          <p>A makeshift immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is facing severe criticism from human rights advocates and lawyers over its reported conditions. Detainees and their families describe vermin infestations, extreme heat due to power outages, and inadequate water supplies. The state-run facility was built to house what officials called the "most menacing migrants," but reports indicate many detainees have no criminal convictions. The administration defends the facility as being run to federal standards, while critics call it a human rights violation.</p>

          <p>A series of protests has erupted across the UK over the government's use of more than 200 hotels to house asylum seekers, with some residents expressing fear and anger. The demonstrations, sometimes promoted by far-right activists but also involving local community members, highlight a shift in public mood. A case involving an asylum seeker charged with sexual assault in Epping, Essex, has fueled the debate. Critics point to a lack of transparency from the government about the asylum seekers and the high costs of the hotel system.</p>

          <h2>The Future of Food Hinges on the Difficult Trade-offs Between Land Use and Intensive Farming</h2>

          <p>New analyses on global food production highlight a critical dilemma: feeding a growing population sustainably requires confronting the vast amount of land used for agriculture. This article explores the argument for "sustainable intensification," which posits that high-yield, industrial farming, including factory farming, is necessary to produce more food on less land, thereby preserving vital ecosystems. However, this approach creates a brutal trade-off, as it often involves practices with severe animal welfare consequences, forcing a difficult choice between environmental preservation and the ethical treatment of animals.</p>

          <p>A captain with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Thomas Merryman, is facing multiple felony charges for allegedly faking a work injury to fraudulently collect over $25,000 in disability insurance payments. Prosecutors allege that Merryman forged doctors' notes and impersonated another fire captain to submit the false claims to an insurance company. The L.A. County District Attorney's office stated that such fraudulent claims will not be tolerated, as they undermine the system for those with legitimate injuries. If convicted, Merryman could face up to five years in prison.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) removed crosswalks painted by a group of community volunteers, citing concerns over liability and the need for holistic safety studies. The incident highlights a broader issue of governmental inefficiency, or low "state capacity," in Los Angeles, where ambitious public projects are often stalled by bureaucracy. While the city quickly repainted the crosswalks after public pressure, the event sparked a debate about whether procedural red tape is preventing simple, effective improvements to public safety and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Gobekli Tepe, a nearly 12,000-year-old archaeological site in Turkey, has become the focus of widespread conspiracy theories, amplified by figures like Joe Rogan and Graham Hancock. These theories suggest the site was built by a lost advanced civilization and that archaeologists are deliberately hiding discoveries. Lee Clare, the lead archaeologist at the site, refutes these claims, explaining that the slow pace of excavation is necessary to preserve the delicate layers of history for future generations. The controversy highlights the clash between scientific methodology and popular misinformation.</p>
