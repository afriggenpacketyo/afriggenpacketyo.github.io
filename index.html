        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making it "unlikely" the company will break even this year. CEO Joanna Geraghty announced plans to cut off-peak flights, trim unprofitable routes, and pause the refurbishment of some older Airbus A320 jets. The carrier is also reassessing hiring plans and considering combining leadership roles to reduce expenses. This decision reflects the airline's struggle to return to profitability and its reliance on borrowed cash to sustain operations, with hopes for a future rebound in travel demand.</p>

          <p>This article examines Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, a site of significant concern to international experts due to its deeply buried location and potential for clandestine nuclear weapons development. Despite U.S. intelligence suggesting Iran isn't currently building a nuclear weapon, Israel claims to have evidence of a secret program focused on weaponization. The IAEA has declared Iran non-compliant with monitoring efforts, raising concerns about transparency at Fordo. Experts highlight the facility's fortified structure and advanced centrifuges, indicating its potential for military purposes and rapid uranium enrichment, thus making it a point of contention in the ongoing geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Republicans are proposing to eliminate economic hardship and unemployment deferments for federal student loan borrowers as part of their "big beautiful" bill. These deferments currently allow borrowers to pause payments during periods of joblessness or financial hardship, often without accruing interest. Critics argue that nixing these deferments could lead to more defaults, especially during unexpected financial setbacks. The Trump administration has projected a significant rise in student loan defaults in the coming months, highlighting the potential impact of this policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict, countering criticism from supporters like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon who oppose U.S. involvement. Vance emphasized Trump's consistent stance against Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and his efforts to negotiate a deal to prevent uranium enrichment. He assured that Trump is focused on American interests and would only use the military to achieve those goals. Vance's defense comes as some Trump allies warn that further involvement in the conflict could undermine the president's agenda, particularly on immigration.</p>

While Israel's strikes have targeted Khamenei's inner circle, experts note that Iran's clerical regime has a system in place to maintain stability. Even if the entire theocratic system collapses, it doesn't guarantee a more friendly government, as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps could take over. Internal tensions, such as those seen in the 2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement, may pose a greater threat to the regime than external actions.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's handling of Iran, addressing criticism from conservatives like Tucker Carlson who oppose U.S. involvement. Vance emphasized Trump's commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and his efforts to negotiate a deal. He assured that Trump is focused on American interests and would only use the military to achieve those goals. These comments come amid a growing divide among Trump's supporters regarding U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has stated that the small boats situation in the English Channel is "deteriorating," ahead of a UK-France summit focused on border security. Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to "work closely" to address the crossings, with migration as a key focus during Macron's state visit. Official figures indicate over 1,500 migrants crossed the Channel last week, pushing the year's total to over 16,000, a 42% increase from last year. Ministers are pushing for France to implement stricter rules to intercept boats, while Labour has pledged to "smash the criminal boat gangs."</p>

At 30 days late, act fast to minimize the impact by making the minimum payment and calling the credit card company to ask if they'll waive the late fee. At 60 days late, reach out to your creditor again, consider a balance transfer or personal loan, and start aggressively tracking your budget. Once you're 90 days late, contact a credit counselor and consider debt relief options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Investors Anticipate Stagflation But Predict Gradual Interest Rate Cuts, CNBC Survey Reveals</h2>

          <p>According to the June CNBC Fed Survey, investors foresee stagflation ahead, with a forecast of weaker growth and higher inflation compared to earlier this year, alongside lingering uncertainty regarding tariff policies. Despite a decrease in the likelihood of a recession within the next year to 38%, it remains above January's level before President Trump's tariff policy was introduced. The survey indicates that most anticipate the Federal Reserve to maintain its current stance at the June meeting, with rate cuts expected to commence in September, projecting two rate cuts this year, bringing the funds rate down to 3.9% by year end.
