          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at an ICE detention center while protesting with other demonstrators and U.S. House Democrats. The interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey stated that Baraka disregarded warnings from Homeland Security officials, while a fellow representative claimed the mayor did nothing wrong and was arrested after leaving the property. The incident occurred amidst ongoing efforts by Baraka and city officials to close the facility.

          <p>The acquittal of three former Memphis police officers in the death of Tyre Nichols, despite video evidence of the brutal beating, underscores the challenges in achieving meaningful police reform. The article reflects on the initial outrage following George Floyd's murder and the subsequent push for law-enforcement reforms, noting that Chauvin's conviction was an outlier. The author argues that the Memphis verdict, along with stalled reform efforts, indicates a regression in accountability. The article concludes that without systemic changes and accountability, unjust deaths like Nichols' will continue to occur.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to steep tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, making it too expensive for U.S. retailers to import goods. Shipments from China to the U.S. decreased by 21% compared to the previous year, while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount. President Trump suggested the levies on China could be lowered to 80%, but this would still be prohibitively expensive for many U.S. businesses. The disruption in trade patterns has led retailers to rethink their supply chains and reduce their reliance on China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump hailed the new trade pact with the U.K. as a "maxed out deal," but experts are skeptical, noting that high tariffs remain in place. Although the deal offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains on U.K. imports. Economists warn that even with a slow rollout of trade deals, the effective average tariff rate will be high, causing businesses to pay more for goods and raise prices for consumers. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs also makes it difficult for businesses to plan their spending, hiring, and supply chains.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Ambassador to Zambia, Michael Gonzales, publicly cried while announcing a $50 million cut in aid due to the theft of U.S.-donated medications and medical supplies. Gonzales revealed that 95% of pharmacies in Zambia were selling stolen drugs. Despite offering assistance to the Zambian government, minimal action was taken, leading to the aid cut. The incident has been met with gratitude from many Zambians, who see the U.S. as exposing corruption, but also with fear about the potential health crisis the aid cut may cause.</p>

South Africa denies these allegations, stating that crime statistics do not indicate that any racial group has been targeted. The U.S. State Department maintains it is prioritizing resettlement for Afrikaners who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.</p>
