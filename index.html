          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being brought back from El Salvador. Federal prosecutors accuse him of conspiring to transport thousands of undocumented migrants, including children, from Mexico and Central America. The government's case relies on a 2022 traffic stop and allegations of Abrego Garcia's ties to MS-13, claiming he used his gang affiliation to intimidate others. His attorneys argue the charges don't warrant detention and that he is not a flight risk, dismissing the gang allegations as baseless and stating that the government has cited no facts suggesting that he has a history of evading arrest. </p>

The court was told that his actions compromised lawful intelligence-related activity and resulted in huge economic loss, and he was described as "intellectually arrogant" during sentencing.

          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, signaling optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs, ending six months of worsening attitudes. The University of Michigan survey data showed improvements across all demographics, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping from 6.6% to 5.1%. Trump's easing of tariffs, including a trade agreement with China, contributed to the surge in the stock market and softened forecasts of an economic downturn. However, warning signs remain about potential price increases, with retailers voicing alarm and the OECD expecting U.S. inflation to reach 4% by the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders, according to the Israeli military. The strikes targeted multiple sites in Tehran and Natanz, a key uranium enrichment site, prompting Iran to launch over 100 drones in retaliation. Israel claims the underground area of the Natanz site was damaged, but the UN's nuclear watchdog agency reported no increase in radiation levels outside the site. The U.S. Secretary of State said the U.S. was not involved in the strikes, which occurred as the Trump administration was attempting to negotiate an agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program. </p>

Netanyahu informed the Americans in advance of the attack, and he cited Iran's nuclear facilities as the primary target, due to his belief that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose an existential threat to Israel. The directive to attack Iran was given after the death of a former Hezbollah leader, and Netanyahu had previously sought support for such an attack but was unable to secure a political majority.

The court declined to rehear Trump's arguments, potentially leading to a Supreme Court appeal in the yearslong case. Trump challenged the admissibility of evidence, including the Access Hollywood tape, arguing it was irrelevant, however, two Trump-appointed judges dissented, stating the tape was propensity evidence. Carroll's lawsuits stemmed from her claim that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, which Trump denied. </p>

          <p>President Trump faces a foreign policy crisis and diplomatic dilemma following Israel's attacks on Iran, struggling to maintain a consistent message. While U.S. diplomats initially reacted coolly, Trump's comments ranged from sombre warnings to the Iranian leadership to expressing support for Israel's actions. Experts note Israel's willingness to defy American preferences, but Trump's varied responses illustrate the complex relationship between the two allies. With key Iranian leaders killed and Iran appealing to the UN, the prospects for peace appear dim, and Trump's strategy involves distancing the U.S. while leveraging the situation for negotiations. </p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to fire all members of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee has sparked controversy and uncertainty in the public health sector. Kennedy appointed new members, including vaccine skeptics, to the committee, which advises the federal government on vaccine policy. The move has raised concerns about the future of vaccine recommendations and public trust in the CDC, potentially leading to confusion among patients and healthcare providers. Experts are now suggesting that patients and providers consult with professional medical societies for vaccine guidance. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers indicate that most Americans can no longer afford a 'minimal quality of life' due to wages failing to keep up with rising costs. According to the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), the bottom 60% of households by income fall well short of the threshold for a minimal quality of life. The LISEP's "Minimal Quality of Life Index" considers essentials, basic leisure costs, and opportunities for upward mobility. Wages have not kept pace with increases in medical premiums, travel expenses, rent, and the cost of raising children, resulting in a decrease in consumers' real spending power. </p>

The company is shifting more production out of China, expecting receipts from the country to decrease substantially, and is also delaying the launch of a new concept until 2026.

          <p>Pollen levels are forecast to be high or very high in many parts of the UK, causing severe hay fever symptoms for many individuals. The warm weather has created ideal conditions for birch tree pollen, a major trigger, and recent dry days have spread pollen through the air, creating a 'pollen bomb'. While there's no cure, treatments include antihistamine tablets, steroid nasal sprays, and eye drops, and experts recommend avoiding triggers and maintaining good hygiene to reduce symptoms. Immunotherapy treatment might be available for the worst affected, though the NHS stopped offering steroid injections due to the risk of serious side-effects.</p>
