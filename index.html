          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 06:22:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Roadhouse is experiencing strong same-store sales growth, particularly in April, reflecting continued customer demand for quality meals at fair prices. However, the company faces potential challenges due to rising beef costs and tariff impacts, leading to a revised full-year commodity inflation outlook of approximately 4%. While competitors like Darden Restaurants and Bloomin' Brands project lower inflation, Texas Roadhouse acknowledges the impact of tighter cattle supplies and seafood tariffs. Despite these cost pressures, analysts maintain a positive outlook, citing the restaurant chain's value proposition and recent sales performance, while investors are advised to monitor the stock's overbought condition.

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Burberry plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,700 jobs as part of a cost-cutting initiative aimed at saving £60 million by 2027. The announcement follows a reported £66 million loss in the last financial year. The job cuts will primarily affect head office teams and include potential redundancies at its Castleford factory in West Yorkshire, where trench coats are manufactured. The company plans to reorganize staff rotas and scrap night shifts at the factory, but will also invest in renovating the facility to safeguard UK manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Following MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's decision to remove Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list, ESPN's Tony Kornheiser clarified that Rose's Hall of Fame induction is not guaranteed. Kornheiser highlighted that baseball writers, known as "guardians of the game," ultimately decide Hall of Fame eligibility and take violations seriously. He noted that Rose's gambling on games as a manager, similar to Joe Jackson's fixing games, could hinder his chances, and that Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, and Roger Clemens have not been voted into the Hall of Fame yet either. While Kornheiser personally supports Rose's induction with his sins and accomplishments noted on the plaque, he doesn't see him as a first-ballot Hall of Famer.</p>

          <p>Burberry has announced organizational changes that may lead to a reduction of approximately 1,700 roles globally by 2027, as part of ongoing turnaround efforts. The cost-cutting measures, including procurement and real estate adjustments, are projected to save £60 million, adding to the £40 million in savings announced previously. These cuts will impact around 20% of Burberry's overall headcount, primarily in office-based and store roles, as well as at its Castleford factory. Despite sales declines across all regions, shares jumped 8.5% after the announcement, and the company remains optimistic about future sustainable profitable growth despite macroeconomic challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Endangered Species Act of 1973, lauded by biologists as a crucial conservation law, faces potential dismantling by the Trump administration, which claims the law needs updating. Critics argue that the proposed changes, including removing the regulatory definition of "harm," could unravel the act's protections for critical habitats and endangered species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service seeks to rely solely on the definition of "take," which refers to direct actions that harass or kill species, rather than considering indirect threats to their habitats. Removing the "harm" definition could dissolve the act's power to preserve essential habitats and protect plants and animals, ultimately harming biodiversity and human interests.</p>

The protest is also aimed at the Trump family's business deals in the Gulf. Trump's son, Eric Trump, recently signed a deal to develop a $5.5 billion golf club north of Doha.

Customers and workers report that inaccurate pricing is common due to chronic understaffing, leading to frustration and anger.

          <p>Amid worsening climate hazards, the Trump administration is weakening FEMA and shifting disaster response onto states, raising concerns about the nation's preparedness for increasingly frequent and destructive environmental disasters. Recent actions, including the firing of FEMA's acting director, budget cuts, and grant cancellations, have strained the agency's resources and shifted responsibilities to state and local governments. Experts warn that this rebalancing of responsibilities requires thoughtful cooperation and a slow transition to ensure states have the necessary resources to protect the public. The defanging of FEMA and other climate programs will affect states across the country and shift the onus of recovery onto individuals.</p>

          <p>Making meaningful friendships in adulthood can be challenging, requiring intentional effort and refined social skills. Psychologists suggest checking assumptions, switching up socialization methods, and actively listening to others to nurture new connections. Small talk is essential for building rapport, and sharing in moderation can help avoid overwhelming new friends. By practicing these skills and embracing vulnerability, adults can cultivate lasting friendships and combat feelings of loneliness.</p>

          <p>Salmon sperm facials, also known as salmon DNA facials, have emerged as a popular skincare trend, promising youthful and smooth skin through microneedling. The procedure involves applying salmon DNA topically to the face after creating channels in the skin via microneedling. Originating from wound healing studies in Italy in the 1980s and gaining popularity in Korea, the treatment uses polynucleotides from salmon sperm to stimulate collagen production and reduce inflammation. While proponents cite scientific evidence supporting its efficacy, some dermatologists remain skeptical, citing potential harm to patients with rosacea and sustainability concerns related to salmon populations.</p>

          <p>Grigory Melkonyants, the head of Russia’s only independent election watchdog, Golos, was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of working with an “undesirable organization.” Melkonyants was jailed in 2023 after President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine and led a broad crackdown at home. The charges against Melkonyants relate to the group’s past affiliation with the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations, which the Russian authorities declared “undesirable” in 2021. Amnesty International has listed Melkonyants as a prisoner of conscience, stating he is being “persecuted solely for his civil activism.”</p>

The court rejected the commission's argument that text messages are “short-lived” and do not contain important information.

After the United States and China agreed this week to a temporary truce in trade tensions, that tariff is now 54 percent. The changes, which took effect on Wednesday, were described in a White House executive order and guidance from Customs and Border Protection.

          <p>Qatar's charm offensive, which includes spending millions on lobbyists, appears to be paying off as President Trump prepares to visit the emirate and may receive a luxury jet as a gift. This marks a significant turnaround from Trump's past criticism of Qatar as a funder of terrorism. Despite objections from Democrats and some MAGA supporters, Trump defends the potential gift, highlighting Qatar's role in mediating the Gaza conflict and its strategic relationship with the United States. The visit underscores Qatar's efforts to compete with regional rivals and solidify its global reputation.</p>
