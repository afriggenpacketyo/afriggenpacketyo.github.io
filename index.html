          <p>Following his release from immigration detention, Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil stated that the Trump administration's attempts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have been unsuccessful. Khalil, who was a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University last year, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. The U.S. government seeks to deport him, arguing that his activism is detrimental to foreign policy interests. Khalil's release and subsequent remarks highlight the ongoing tensions between activism and government policies regarding foreign affairs. The activist's legal team is now focused on preventing his deportation. Optimism around the activist's cause is tempered given the government's continued efforts to deport him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Jack Reed, D-R.I., has criticized President Trump's dismissal of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggests that Trump's rejection of this intelligence may be politically motivated, especially given potential plans for an attack against Iran. He highlights the testimony of U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who stated that the intelligence community believes Iran has not authorized a nuclear weapons program since suspending it in 2003. Reed emphasizes the importance of correcting the record if Gabbard's testimony is found to be false. The senator's remarks underscore the growing tension between the executive branch and the intelligence community regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities, and the potential implications for U.S. foreign policy. The senator's skepticism is warranted.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Minnesota shootings, Vance Boelter, who is accused of fatally shooting a lawmaker and her husband, was described as a doomsday "prepper" by the FBI. Boelter's wife told investigators that the family was part of a group preparing for catastrophic incidents. Boelter is charged with killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and seriously wounding a state senator and his wife. Police found a list of about 70 targets, including Democratic politicians, in Boelter's possession, and evidence suggests he was planning to target others. The incident has been called an act of targeted political violence. The investigation continues to uncover the motives behind the attacks.</p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention in Louisiana following a federal judge's order. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for months as the Trump administration sought to deport him due to "foreign policy" concerns. Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, and criticized the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. Khalil's release comes after a series of protests and discussions over free speech. The government is expected to appeal the decision, but Khalil is now able to return to his family and continue his activism. The courts have now ruled in favor of his release.</p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly moving B-2 bombers to Guam as President Trump considers potential involvement in Israel’s strikes against Iran. It remains unclear whether this deployment is directly related to the tensions in the Middle East. The B-2 bomber can carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which is designed to destroy deeply buried targets, such as Iran's nuclear facilities. Experts are closely monitoring whether the bombers will move to Diego Garcia, a U.S.-British military base in the Indian Ocean. This deployment occurs amid ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, with Trump indicating he will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. will intervene. The military deployment is a sign of heightened tensions.</p>

The move has drawn mixed reactions, with some applauding it as a way to pander to Trump's ego, while others criticize it as compromising national dignity.

England had led 24-12 heading into the final 10 minutes after a try from Alex Dombrandt, but France rallied with tries from Paul Mallez and Romain Taofifenua. Antoine Hastoy kicked the conversion to win the match. England's Immanuel Feyi-Waboso was sent off for a high tackle. England's preparations for their tour of Argentina and the United States are now in question.</p>

          <p>The White House Rose Garden is undergoing renovations initiated by President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, sparking criticism. The grass center square has been replaced with gravel, and construction equipment is present. The renovations, described as a "restoration" by a White House official, aim to enhance practical use and guest experience. Trump stated that the changes were made because the terrain was difficult for press conferences, particularly for women wearing high heels. The renovations have faced backlash on social media, with some criticizing the removal of Kennedy's Rose Garden and the installation of a patio. The renovations are controversial.</p>

          <p>At least eight people have died in a hot air balloon accident in Brazil, according to a state governor. The accident occurred in Praia Grande, with 21 people on board. According to the pilot, a fire started inside the basket, causing him to lower the balloon and instruct passengers to jump. Some passengers were unable to jump, and the balloon began to rise again before falling due to a loss of suspension. The state government is investigating the cause of the accident. There is an investigation underway.</p>

This decision involves outsourcing engine development and manufacturing, potentially leading to shared engines across different brands.
