          <p>Earl Enderson Riley IV has been charged with multiple counts of residential burglary and robbery for allegedly targeting the homes of Seattle-based professional athletes. Prosecutors allege that Riley stole over $6,000 in Louis Vuitton bags from Seattle Mariners pitcher Luis Castillo's home and more than $194,000 in high-end purses and jewelry from the home of Mariners' center fielder Julio Rodriguez. The thefts also included watches worth over $100,000 from former Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman's home, and an attempted burglary at Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell's home. The arrest follows a warning from the FBI to sports leagues about crime organizations targeting professional athletes for high-end goods. </p>

          <p>The NHS app will become the primary communication method for millions more patients in England, aiming to save the health service Â£200m over three years. A Â£50m investment will enable the app to send test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly to smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, freeing up NHS phone lines. This move aims to improve patient access to healthcare management and informed decision-making, with over 11 million people using the app monthly.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a public dispute after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending package. Trump claimed Musk opposed the bill due to the elimination of an electric vehicle tax credit, while Musk denied being shown the measure. Separately, Trump met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to discuss the war in Ukraine, suggesting a need to let the conflict play out. Trump also spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss trade negotiations, following earlier criticism of China for violating a trade agreement.</p>

          <p>A West Virginia prosecutor warned that women who experience a pregnancy loss could face criminal charges under state laws related to the disposal of human remains. The prosecutor advised women to report miscarriages to law enforcement to protect themselves, though experts caution against involving law enforcement in reproductive matters. While abortion is nearly banned in West Virginia, miscarriages are not explicitly criminalized, but existing laws could be creatively interpreted to punish women. This situation highlights the legal limbo many women face after the overturning of Roe v Wade.</p>

Childhood cancer death rates have fallen dramatically since 1950, and five-year survival rates for all cancers have risen.

          <p>Japan and the European Union are preparing to launch a "Japan-EU Competitiveness Alliance" to strengthen their companies' competitiveness and promote trade and economic security cooperation. The alliance, expected to be announced at a summit meeting in July, aims to counter concerns over U.S. tariffs and Chinese trade practices. The framework will focus on diversifying supply chains for rare earth minerals, aligning subsidy conditions for environmental technology, and promoting reform of the World Trade Organization. Both sides also intend to collaborate with emerging economies that share values of free and fair trade and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is consistently innovating new drone warfare tactics, often catching Russia by surprise, as demonstrated by a recent attack on Russian warplanes using small drones hidden in trucks. These tactics have forced Russia to scramble for defensive measures, and Ukraine has also pioneered the use of sea drones, even shooting down a Russian warplane with one. Drones have become critical for Ukraine's defense, helping to offset Russia's troop advantage and inflict significant casualties. Russia has responded by developing its drone arsenal, including mass-producing Iranian drone technology.</p>

While some wind turbine blades end up in landfills, efforts are underway to improve recycling and repurposing.

          <p>This article explores the debate around federal rental aid time limits, focusing on Delaware's program that combines rental assistance with work requirements and savings incentives. The Delaware program allows tenants to save money while receiving aid, but housing experts caution that time limits alone are not effective without additional support. Other states, like Washington, have abandoned time limits due to the lack of affordable housing and the difficulty for people to save money. The success of the program hinges on factors such as savings accounts, budgeting assistance, and support for childcare and health insurance.</p>
