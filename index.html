          <p>A U.S. District Judge has disqualified Sigal Chattah, the interim U.S. attorney for Nevada, from supervising certain criminal cases, ruling her appointment is not legally valid. The judge found that the Justice Department's maneuver to keep her in the role after her temporary appointment expired violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This decision marks the second instance of a judge sidelining a prosecutor appointed during the Trump administration over legality concerns, though the indictments in the current cases were not dismissed.</p>

          <p>Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, has publicly called for an international aid flotilla to cease its journey toward Gaza, expressing fears it could disrupt a fragile U.S.-led peace proposal. The flotilla, carrying over 500 activists including Greta Thunberg, aims to break Israel's naval blockade to deliver humanitarian aid directly. Despite warnings from Italy and Israel, which has suggested the aid be delivered to an Israeli port instead, the organizers have vowed to continue their mission into contested waters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, alleging unconstitutional delays in processing concealed carry weapon applications. The complaint argues that these prolonged waits, sometimes stretching for years, infringe upon residents' Second Amendment rights. The sheriff's department disputes the claims, citing a significant backlog inherited from the previous administration and ongoing staffing shortages while asserting they have increased the rate of permit issuance.</p>

          <p>The global coffee industry is facing significant challenges that could alter the availability and taste of the popular beverage, with climate change being a primary driver. Rising temperatures are projected to shrink suitable coffee-growing land by half by 2050, forcing farmers to seek higher elevations and adapt to unpredictable weather. Compounded by economic hardships, a shrinking labor force, and volatile market prices, experts suggest the industry must innovate with climate-resilient beans like stenophylla to ensure its long-term survival.</p>

The attacks, one at a church and the other at a waterfront bar, left a total of seven people dead and over a dozen injured, with authorities still working to determine the motives. While one suspect was killed by police, the other has been charged with murder; friends of the Michigan shooter noted he had previously expressed anger towards Mormons.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County supervisors have sharply criticized a $1.9 million external investigation into the government's handling of the deadly January Eaton fire, calling it incomplete and insufficient. Residents and officials, including Supervisor Kathryn Barger, expressed frustration that the report fails to explain why evacuation alerts were severely delayed for the west Altadena area, where 18 of the 19 fatalities occurred. The report was also hampered by the refusal of several non-county fire agencies to cooperate, leaving critical gaps in understanding the timeline of the response.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that top officials violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian students for deportation. The judge found that the actions of the Homeland Security and State Departments were intended to suppress constitutionally protected speech and instill fear among international students. In his 161-page decision, the judge described the government's conduct as a "scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech" aimed at silencing unwelcome political views on college campuses.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's lead tariff negotiator has affirmed that the island would not accept a U.S. proposal to split semiconductor production evenly between the two countries. The statement follows a suggestion by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce for a 50-50 arrangement to rebalance the global supply chain, which is currently dominated by Taiwanese manufacturing. Taiwan, home to industry giant TSMC, is engaged in ongoing trade talks with Washington but maintains that such a condition was not discussed and would not be agreed to.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed an antitrust lawsuit against real estate platforms Zillow and Redfin, accusing them of an illegal agreement to reduce competition in the online rental advertising market. The lawsuit alleges that Zillow paid Redfin $100 million to exit the market for advertising multifamily properties, effectively eliminating a key competitor. Both companies deny the allegations, claiming their partnership is pro-consumer, but the FTC is seeking to end the deal to restore competition for renters and property managers.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown imminent, the National Park Service has released a contingency plan that will keep many parks partially accessible while furloughing nearly two-thirds of its employees. While open-air areas like trails and roads will remain open, services will be severely limited, and gated facilities will close. The plan allows parks to use fee collections and third-party donations to maintain basic services, a response to criticism from a 2018-19 shutdown where unstaffed parks suffered significant environmental damage.</p>

          <p>Catastrophe bonds, a financial instrument where investors bet on whether a natural disaster will occur, are becoming a key tool for making homeowners insurance more affordable in high-risk areas. Insurance companies issue these bonds to secure capital for paying claims after a major event; if no disaster happens, investors receive a return. A new model in North Carolina is even using a portion of investor profits to fund home resilience projects, such as fortified roofs, to reduce future losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Solano County, California, has agreed to a $17 million settlement with Nakia Porter, a Black woman who was knocked unconscious by sheriff's deputies during a 2020 traffic stop. Body camera footage showed deputies pulling guns on Porter, who had stopped to switch drivers, before slamming her to the ground while her young children watched from the car. The settlement resolves a federal civil rights lawsuit that accused the deputies of unlawful seizure and excessive force, marking one of the largest of its kind in the state.</p>
