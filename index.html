          <p>India has responded to potential U.S. tariff hikes by defending its increased oil trade with Russia, stating it was a national necessity to stabilize energy costs for its citizens. The country's foreign ministry highlighted that it only began significant Russian oil imports after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe following the 2022 conflict, a move it claims was encouraged by the U.S. at the time. New Delhi also pointed out that both the U.S. and the EU continue to engage in substantial trade with Russia, suggesting India is being unfairly singled out. The statement follows former President Trump's threats to impose steeper tariffs on Indian goods.</p>

CEO Murray Auchincloss expressed optimism about recent oil and gas discoveries, particularly a new find in Brazil, reinforcing the company's strategic shift back towards fossil fuels. Amid takeover speculation, the energy giant is also increasing investor returns through a dividend hike and a continued share buyback program. The positive results and a new cost review initiative aim to boost the company's profitability and shareholder confidence after a period of underperformance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A zoo in Aalborg, Denmark, has publicly requested donations of pets such as rabbits and guinea pigs to be used as food for its predators. The zoo defends the practice as a way to provide natural nutrition and behavior for its carnivores, stating that donated animals are "gently euthanized" by trained staff. Officials from the zoo noted that this is a common and accepted practice within Denmark, intended to mimic the natural food chain. The initiative, which has drawn international attention, is part of the zoo's effort to ensure nothing goes to waste while promoting the well-being of its lions and tigers.</p>

          <p>China's military has stated it is on "high alert" after India and the Philippines conducted their first joint naval patrol in the South China Sea. The two-day exercise involved multiple warships from both nations, including a guided-missile destroyer, and spanned strategic waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal. The Philippines' Armed Forces chief confirmed that Chinese vessels shadowed the patrol but reported no "untoward incidents." This military cooperation highlights a growing security partnership between New Delhi and Manila, aimed at reinforcing their presence and collaboration in the contested Indo-Pacific region, which Beijing views as a potential disruption.</p>

The victims were the parents, grandmother, and uncle of an infant who was discovered abandoned but alive.

Investigators believe the attack was targeted, as Drummond had a prior relationship with the family.

An expert suggests this case highlights potential flaws in the educator screening process, noting that checks can vary in thoroughness and may miss early behavioral red flags. The suspect, Andrew James McGann, taught in Texas and Oklahoma before being hired in Arkansas, with previous districts confirming he left on his own accord without disciplinary action. This situation has prompted calls for school administrators to conduct more rigorous reviews of their hiring and background check procedures.</p>

          <p>A growing cluster of Legionnaires' disease in New York City's Harlem area has resulted in two deaths and at least 58 diagnosed cases. Health officials are urging residents and workers in the affected zip codes to seek immediate medical attention if they experience flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia, is caused by Legionella bacteria found in warm water sources like cooling towers and plumbing systems, and is not transmissible from person to person. Early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are crucial, especially for high-risk individuals like those over 50, smokers, or the immunocompromised.</p>

This line of inquiry delves into the mechanisms that link prolonged stress to accelerated cellular aging, potentially opening new avenues for understanding and intervening in these processes. The research aims to shed light on the intricate biological pathways involved, offering potential insights into how to mitigate the negative health impacts of stress on a cellular level and promote healthier aging.</p>

While the Mueller report found no proof of a Trump-Russia conspiracy, this new legal proceeding re-examines the origins and conduct of the initial FBI investigation.

With a poor recent record in Australia and a squad largely inexperienced in those conditions, Stokes' all-around contributions as a player and leader are seen as indispensable. The article highlights England's strong batting lineup but questions the depth and fitness of its bowling attack. The challenge is compounded by the psychological pressure and hostile environment in Australia, making a series victory a monumental task that would rank among Stokes' greatest career achievements.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 after a late-game collapse. Newly acquired relief pitcher Brock Stewart, in his first game back with the Dodgers since 2019, entered a tie game in the ninth inning and surrendered the go-ahead run on three hits. Both teams' bullpens struggled after strong seven-inning starts from their respective pitchers, Tyler Glasnow for the Dodgers and Sonny Gray for the Cardinals. Despite the loss, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts affirmed his confidence in Stewart, stating the right-hander will continue to be used in high-leverage situations as the team looks to stabilize its overworked bullpen for the pennant race.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is launching a 12-month pilot program that will require some business and leisure travelers to post bonds of up to $15,000 to enter the country. The temporary rule targets visitors from countries with high rates of visa overstays or those deemed to have insufficient screening and vetting processes. Consular officers will have the discretion to set bond amounts at $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 based on an applicant's circumstances. The program is intended to test the feasibility of using bonds to ensure compliance with visa terms and to encourage foreign governments to reduce their nationals' overstay rates.

          <p>Thirty years after Croatia's Operation Storm, which ended its war of independence, Croatia and Serbia commemorate the event with starkly different perspectives. In Croatia, the military offensive is celebrated as a heroic victory that reunified the country, marked this year with a large military parade in Zagreb. Conversely, Serbia views the event as a tragic pogrom that led to the mass exodus and killing of ethnic Serbs, holding a memorial under the banner "Oluja is a pogrom." The divergent narratives highlight the deep-seated historical grievances that persist between the two nations, with both sides using the anniversary to emphasize national strength and historical injustice.</p>

          <p>Recent UK news includes a growing controversy surrounding Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who is accused of "fanning the flames of hate" for his comments on a child sexual assault case. Farage accused police of a "cover-up" regarding the suspects' immigration status, prompting a debate on transparency. In other news, the Labour government's new 20% VAT on private school fees has reportedly been circumvented by many parents who paid fees in advance. Additionally, the Metropolitan Police are warning of potential mass detentions at a planned rally for the banned group Palestine Action, while hundreds of Jewish figures have protested the ban as "illegitimate."</p>

          <p>Countries are meeting at a UN conference in Geneva to resume negotiations for a legally binding global treaty to address the plastic pollution crisis. After two years of talks, no agreement has been reached on how to curb the nearly 200 trillion pieces of plastic estimated to be in the world's oceans. Key points of contention include setting targets for reducing single-use plastic production, banning harmful chemicals, and establishing universal design and financing standards. While nearly 100 countries support limiting production, oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia are pushing for a focus on recycling rather than production caps, creating a major obstacle to a comprehensive deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that Poland is experiencing a resurgence of populism less than two years after the Law and Justice party was voted out, a trend that holds warnings for liberal democracies worldwide. The authors contend that Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government has become bogged down in reversing his predecessors' policies and has failed to offer a compelling future vision. By adopting some nationalist rhetoric and failing to deliver on key promises like liberalizing abortion laws, the ruling coalition has lost public enthusiasm. This "Gorbachev syndrome" of being admired abroad but unpopular at home demonstrates that simply ousting populists is not enough without a forward-thinking, imaginative agenda.</p>

          <p>China is developing a new, advanced early warning and control aircraft, the KJ-3000, based on a modified Y-20B transport plane. Recent footage of a prototype reveals its most distinct feature: a large, rotating radar dome, or rotodome, on its fuselage, which houses advanced surveillance equipment. This design suggests Beijing remains committed to this type of airborne early warning system, even as other militaries, like the U.S., have shifted away from such platforms for modern warfare. The development of the KJ-3000 indicates a continued focus by the People's Liberation Army on enhancing its long-range detection and command capabilities as part of its ongoing military modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>In response to falling prices and strong competition from imports, China has announced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry and promote consumption of local beef. The policy, introduced by the nation's top economic planner, includes implementing a quality-grading system for Chinese beef to enhance its appeal. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to bolster key agricultural sectors and unlock new consumption potential for high-quality domestic products. Average wholesale beef prices have fallen significantly from their 2023 highs, prompting Beijing to intervene to support local producers and encourage a more balanced, protein-rich diet among its citizens.

Since 2023, over 27,000 job cuts have been directly attributed to AI's advancement, reshaping the labor market.

          <p>More than 40 people were arrested during a protest outside the Trump International hotel in New York City, organized by the Jewish-American anti-occupation group IfNotNow. Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered to demand an end to the war in Gaza and to pressure the Trump administration to ensure more humanitarian aid enters the territory amid reports of starvation. Protesters, including a former Biden administration official who resigned in protest, held signs reading "stop starving Gaza" and "not in our name." The arrests occurred after the group moved to the hotel and blocked the street, with police taking dozens into custody for civil disobedience.</p>
