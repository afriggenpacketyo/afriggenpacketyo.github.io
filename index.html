        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, approved by its parliament, carries significant risks for Tehran itself. Vanda Hari of Vanda Insights believes the possibility of closure is minimal, as it could alienate neighboring oil-producing countries and provoke hostilities. Andrew Bishop of Signum Global Advisors adds that disrupting supplies would antagonize China, a major importer of Iranian oil, and invite potential retaliation against Iran's oil infrastructure. Clayton Seigle of the Center for Strategic and International Studies notes that China's national security interests align with stabilizing oil flows through the Strait. </p>

          <p>Analysts warn that escalating uncertainty in the Middle East, fueled by potential Strait of Hormuz closure, could raise crude prices, intensify US inflation, and complicate Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. China International Capital Corporation suggests markets may struggle to gauge escalation potential, leading to risk aversion. Zhongtai Securities analyst He Jiahua notes that while current tensions have limited impact due to broader oil price downtrend, a Strait closure could surge prices to $100-120 per barrel. Gold is expected to benefit from geopolitical shocks, while Chinese assets may remain relatively shielded. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge increased defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, during their annual summit. The U.S. is pushing for this increase, comprising 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure, but some members are hesitant. Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO, anticipates potential clashes if messaging is not aligned, as some allies may try to dilute spending pledges. The summit occurs amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Middle East tensions, making it a crucial meeting in NATO's history, as some European aerospace and defense companies are eager for concrete government procurement commitments to scale up their production capacity.</p>

Economist Yevgeny Nadorshin predicts an uncomfortable situation until late 2026 with defaults and bankruptcies, but dismisses any suggestion of a meltdown.

This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. Professor Andrew McIntosh believes ketamine could provide additional hope for patients who do not respond well to other treatments. </p>
