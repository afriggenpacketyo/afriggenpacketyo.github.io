          <p>EchoStar's stock price increased significantly after AT&T agreed to purchase its wireless spectrum licenses for $23 billion in cash. The deal will provide AT&T with approximately 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum across over 400 markets in the United States. The transaction is expected to finalize by mid-2026, subject to regulatory approvals. This sale is part of EchoStar's efforts to address inquiries from the Federal Communications Commission regarding its compliance with requirements to build a 5G network, resolving concerns raised by SpaceX regarding underused spectrum.

          <p>President Trump has moved to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board, citing false statements on mortgage documents, an action Cook disputes and plans to challenge in court. Cook's attorney asserts Trump lacks the authority to remove her, as Fed board members have 14-year terms and can only be dismissed "for cause." The Federal Reserve has acknowledged Cook's plan to sue and will abide by any court decision, emphasizing the importance of governors' long tenures for independent monetary policy decisions. This action follows months of Trump's criticism of the Fed's handling of interest rates and could reshape the board's composition as he seeks appointees aligned with his economic views.

          <h2>Reverse Mortgages Offer Seniors Financial Flexibility This September</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the potential benefits of reverse mortgages for seniors in September 2025, noting record-high home equity levels. A reverse mortgage allows seniors to receive monthly payments from their home equity without immediate repayment obligations. It also eliminates concerns about fluctuating interest rates and can help pay down high-interest debt. However, it's important for seniors to carefully consider the terms and conditions before proceeding with a reverse mortgage to ensure it aligns with their financial needs and goals.

The party aims to deport 500,000-600,000 people, requiring secure facilities for 24,000 individuals monthly. Achieving this would necessitate significant resources, potentially costing £12 billion for detention facilities alone. The plan also involves new laws to fast-track detention and removal, which may face legal challenges. The party's proposal to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights could lead to legal and trade complications.</p>

          <p>Adam Frisby, the founder of In The Style, says he has "no regrets" about leaving the company, detailing its rise and fall after being founded in 2013. In The Style was listed on the London Stock Exchange with a value of more than £100m in 2021 but was delisted two years later and sold to an investor for £1.2m. Frisby spoke about the toll the company's problems took on him, including death threats and homophobic abuse. He also discussed a legal battle over accusations of stealing the company's idea, which he won.</p>

          <p>A haboob, a massive wall of dust, recently hit the Phoenix area, disrupting travel and knocking out power. Haboobs are dust storms caused by outflowing winds from thunderstorms over dry regions. These storms differ from other dust storms, which can be caused by cold fronts or warm fronts. The National Weather Service advises drivers to pull off the road and turn off their lights if a haboob approaches, due to the rapid reduction in visibility. Haboobs are common in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southwestern United States.</p>

The author argues that conservatives are raising concerns about the government intruding on constitutional rules and norms, with Democrats (and the media) almost invariably responding with contemptuous eye-rolling and mockery. The author is concerned with the idea that the rules should apply to both teams, and not just one, and that the other should be able to do whatever it wants with no restrictions.</p>
