          <p>China's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, BYD, reported its first monthly sales decline of the year in July, a significant development amid an intense price war reshaping the industry. While some competitors like Li Auto and Nio also saw delivery drops, others including Xpeng and Xiaomi posted strong growth, highlighting a shifting competitive landscape. The aggressive discounting, which saw some models reduced by 30%, has prompted Chinese policymakers to warn against excessive competition as it affects the stability of the burgeoning EV sector.

The proposed map could create up to five new Republican congressional seats, prompting strong opposition from Democrats who call the process rigged.

          <p>Several German states, including Bavaria and Hesse, are increasing their use of the controversial surveillance software "Gotham" from US firm Palantir, raising significant privacy concerns. Civil rights organizations argue the tool's AI-powered data analysis capabilities could wrongly implicate innocent individuals and violate constitutional rights to informational self-determination. Despite a successful legal challenge in Hesse and a pending one in North Rhine-Westphalia, the software's adoption is growing, prompting public backlash and a petition with over 264,000 signatures.</p>

Ong admitted to helping the ex-minister obstruct justice by covering up evidence of expensive gifts, including Formula 1 tickets and private jet travel, received during official business dealings. This case has drawn significant attention in Singapore, a country known for its low tolerance for corruption and high salaries for public officials intended to prevent such misconduct.</p>

          <p>A new report from the UK-China Transparency think tank suggests that Chinese students at British universities are being coerced by officials to spy on their peers, aiming to suppress discussions on topics sensitive to Beijing. The report also highlights incidents of academics being warned against covering certain subjects and facing harassment, raising serious concerns about academic freedom and foreign interference. This comes as a new UK law empowers regulators to fine universities that fail to protect free speech, though some institutions are reportedly hesitant to act due to financial reliance on Chinese student fees.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, journalist Rokhaya Diallo describes the constant challenge of being a Muslim in France, where individuals are often treated as a suspicious "enemy within." She recounts being publicly pressured to denounce terrorism and facing baseless accusations of inciting violence for criticizing Charlie Hebdo, illustrating a broader societal pattern. The article argues that whether in politics, sports, or fashion, French Muslims face a double standard, being blamed for both "separatism" and "infiltration," which fuels a dangerous climate of Islamophobia.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for millions of motorists who may have been overcharged for car loans due to hidden commission arrangements. The regulator stepped in after a Supreme Court ruling narrowed the scope for individual legal claims but affirmed that some deals with excessively large commissions were unfair. The proposed scheme, expected to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, will aim to provide redress for consumers with agreements dating back to 2007. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to record-high infection rates, sexual health clinics across the UK have begun administering a vaccine for gonorrhoea, a world-first national program of its kind. The vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, will initially be offered to those at highest risk, primarily gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple partners. Health officials hope the rollout will prevent up to 100,000 new cases over the next decade and help slow the spread of increasingly antibiotic-resistant strains of the infection.</p>

          <p>A BBC Africa Eye investigation has uncovered a child sex trade in the Kenyan transit town of Maai Mahiu, facilitated by women known as "madams." Secretly filmed footage shows these women admitting to involving children as young as 13 in prostitution to service truck drivers and other clients, manipulating the vulnerable minors for profit. Despite the evidence being handed to Kenyan police, no arrests have been made, highlighting the difficulties in prosecuting such cases and protecting children from exploitation in the region.</p>

He specifically criticized credit cards, student loans, and car payments as primary culprits that prevent individuals from building their own wealth. Ramsey advocates for a strict financial plan that includes creating a zero-based budget, aggressively paying down debt using the "debt snowball" method, and paying for all purchases with cash instead of financing.

          <p>Russia's Krasheninnikov volcano, located on the remote Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles into the sky.

According to volcanologists, this is the first historically confirmed eruption of Krasheninnikov, with its last known activity dating back to the 15th or 16th century.</p>
