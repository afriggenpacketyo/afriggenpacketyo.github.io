          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a review of Harvard University's patents derived from federally funded research, threatening to seize control of them. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick alleges Harvard has breached the Bayh-Dole Act, which requires such inventions to benefit the American public, and has demanded a full accounting of these patents. This action is the latest development in an ongoing conflict where the administration has already frozen billions in research funding over claims of campus antisemitism, which Harvard contests as a retaliatory measure for defending its academic freedom.</p>

          <p>Bed Bath & Beyond is relaunching over two years after its bankruptcy, with the first new 'Bed Bath & Beyond Home' store opening in Nashville. The revived brand, managed by The Brand House Collective, aims to attract former customers by promising to honor the company's iconic legacy coupons. While this marks a significant step in resurrecting the retailer, which previously closed all its brick-and-mortar locations, experts note the company's underlying financials remain troubled. The brand plans to open four more test stores in the Nashville area to refine its strategy for a broader 2026 rollout.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. He is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 "successful failure," where an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft, yet the crew returned safely to Earth. Lovell also flew on the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, where he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." His family and NASA remembered him as a hero whose character and courage were instrumental in space exploration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has reported a significant increase in complaints regarding models in high street fashion ads who appear "unhealthily thin." Recent rulings have banned adverts from major retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S, sparking debate about a potential return to the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s. While retailers defend their models as healthy, the ASA has cited posing, lighting, and styling for creating a misleadingly thin appearance. Activists and industry experts express concern over the harmful body image ideals being promoted, linking the trend to both social media and broader cultural shifts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15, amid ongoing efforts to broker a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. The summit follows a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a deal or face severe economic sanctions, including potential secondary sanctions on its trade partners. While the administration's tone has recently shifted to be more optimistic following an envoy's "very productive" meeting in Moscow, the specific terms of any peace deal remain highly uncertain. Trump has expressed an expectation of "some swapping of territories" between Russia and Ukraine to achieve peace.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has demanded a $1 billion settlement from UCLA to resolve allegations of discrimination and antisemitism on campus. The proposal, which comes after the administration froze $584 million in federal grants to the university, also requires a $172 million fund for victims. The University of California's president stated that a payment of this magnitude would "completely devastate" the public university system. This action follows similar, though smaller, settlements with Columbia and Brown universities and a previous $6 million settlement by UCLA over claims of a "Jew Exclusion Zone" during campus protests.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, named the Canyon fire, has forced thousands of evacuations in a mountainous region of Southern California. The blaze, which started in Ventura County and spread into Los Angeles County, has burned nearly 5,400 acres and was only 25% contained as of Friday afternoon. Firefighters are contending with extreme heat, low humidity, and record-low moisture levels in the vegetation, creating dangerous conditions. This event coincides with another major blaze, the Gifford fire, which has become the state's largest of the year, highlighting the elevated wildfire risk across California amid an intensifying heatwave.</p>

          <p>According to sources, President Trump has authorized the U.S. military to target drug cartels operating in Latin America, though the timing and specifics of any potential action are unclear. This directive follows earlier administration moves to designate several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which provides greater legal authority for using national security and military resources against them. The policy aims to combat the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into the United States.

To ensure authenticity, Negret collaborated closely with the local Indigenous community, who participated in the production and provided guidance on Kichwa language and traditional rituals.

While filled with anecdotes of his rudeness and lavish lifestyle, the biography also explores a more vulnerable side, suggesting a lonely figure whose bombastic exterior concealed insecurity.

          <p>President Trump has removed Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service after he served in the position for less than two months. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as the acting commissioner in the interim. Long, a former congressman whose term was meant to run until 2027, is now expected to be nominated for the post of U.S. ambassador to Iceland. His brief tenure at the IRS came after the agency had absorbed significant job cuts and as the administration enacted new tariffs and tax code changes.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic U.S.-brokered peace deal at the White House, aiming to end nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised President Trump's role in facilitating the agreement, which establishes diplomatic relations and mutual respect for territorial integrity. A key component of the deal is the creation of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave, with the U.S. granted exclusive development rights.</p>

          <p>Michael Paul Brown, the 45-year-old suspect in a mass shooting that left four people dead at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been apprehended after a seven-day manhunt.

Family and community members noted that Brown, a military veteran who served in Iraq, had a history of mental health struggles, with one resident saying he would tell strange stories about being a secret agent.</p>

          <p>The recent death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell leaves only five surviving astronauts who journeyed to the Moon during the Apollo program. This dwindling number of pioneers highlights the passage of time as NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. The remaining Moon voyagers are Buzz Aldrin, Charles Duke, Harrison Schmitt, and David Scott, all of whom walked on the Moon, and Fred Haise, who was part of the perilous Apollo 13 mission. Their stories represent a foundational era of space exploration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to approve a plan to occupy Gaza City is being driven by his need to appease the hard-right, pro-settler parties in his narrow coalition, according to an analysis in The Atlantic. This strategy directly conflicts with the views of both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the Israeli public, who oppose a long-term occupation and favor ending the war with a hostage deal. The analysis suggests that Netanyahu is beholden to these extremist partners for his political survival, leading him to pursue their goals over the strategic advice of his military leaders.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe has admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. Lowe had urgently alerted authorities and called for mass deportations before the crew's identity was confirmed by the Coastguard. The rowers, who are attempting a journey from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research, said they found the incident "hilarious." In a subsequent post, Lowe explained it was a false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected the idea of U.S. military intervention in Mexico, stating "there will be no invasion" in response to reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to target drug cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico collaborates with the U.S. on security issues, any presence of U.S. troops on Mexican soil is "absolutely rejected." Her statement addresses nationalist fears in Mexico and comes after the Trump administration designated several Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move many in Mexico saw as a prelude to unilateral U.S. action.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it is lowering the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. This move aligns Canada with the European Union and the United Kingdom, who recently made the same adjustment. The coordinated action is intended to further increase economic pressure on Moscow and limit a key source of revenue funding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. According to Canada's Finance Minister, the measure is part of a broader strategy by allied nations to ratchet up economic pressure on Russia for its illegal war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite numerous previous investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the Trump administration is launching a new probe, seemingly to reach a different conclusion. This article discusses the context for this new investigation, including the recent declassification of documents by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, who accused the Obama administration of pushing a false narrative. With Attorney General Pam Bondi now authorizing an investigation into the original investigators, NPR questions what new information could possibly be learned from re-examining the long-settled issue of the 2016 Trump campaign's relationship with Russia.</p>
