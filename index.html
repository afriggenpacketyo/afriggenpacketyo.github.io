          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously decided the case of Ames v. Ohio, involving a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against due to her sexual orientation. Marlean Ames sued the Ohio Department of Youth Services after she was denied a promotion and later demoted, with her positions filled by a lesbian and a gay man, respectively. The court's decision underscores the principle of treating individuals as individuals rather than as members of a group. Justice Jackson's authorship of the opinion was notable, given the case's relevance to diversity, equity, and inclusion debates.</p>

He played 43 games for Sunderland in the 2024-25 season, showcasing his ability to contribute both defensively and offensively. His move to the Bundesliga is seen as a positive step, offering a balance between the Championship and the Premier League, with former Sunderland striker Marco Gabbiadini noting the financial advantages of playing abroad.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common sources of conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone signals contempt, a key predictor of divorce, while family disagreements often stem from unmet needs and differing values. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication further contribute to relationship strain. The article suggests strategies for resolving these conflicts, such as naming the effect of condescension, reassuring partners, acknowledging the invisible load of chores, and using a designated word to signal the need for a time-out.</p>

          <p>Costco has introduced a new frozen strawberry lemonade at its food courts, generating mixed reactions from members. The drink, priced at $2.99, is made with real fruit and contains no artificial flavors or colors. While some customers praised it as refreshing, others found it too tart or preferred the previous strawberry banana smoothie. Some customers also complained about the fruit getting stuck in the straw, while others expressed a desire for the return of the churro. The new beverage has replaced the strawberry banana smoothie, which was introduced earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein discusses the unexpected controversy surrounding his book "Abundance," co-written with Derek Thompson, which has ignited debate within the Democratic Party. The book critiques how Democrats have governed in power, focusing on the need to address what is stopping us from getting more of what we need. While some high-profile Democrats have embraced its arguments, anti-corporate populists view it as a threat to their rising influence. The debate centers on whether the focus of Democratic politics should be on addressing concentrated power or removing bottlenecks to increase production.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has accused President Donald Trump of rapidly moving the United States toward an authoritarian state. Sanders' comments followed Trump's order to deploy the National Guard to disperse protesters in Los Angeles who were demonstrating against the president's immigration crackdown. Sanders argued that Trump disregards the Constitution and rule of law, citing actions such as suing media outlets, persecuting law firms, and threatening judges. The senator criticized Trump's decision to mobilize the National Guard without requests from California or Los Angeles, asserting that Trump believes he has the right to do whatever he wants.</p>

          <p>President Trump's rapid intervention in Los Angeles, deploying the National Guard in response to immigration protests, has drawn criticism for potentially inflaming tensions. Despite reports that the protests were largely peaceful, the Trump administration cited injuries to immigration agents and a slow response from local law enforcement as justification for federal intervention. Trump federalized 2,000 California National Guard soldiers over Governor Gavin Newsom's objections, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatening to deploy US Marines, a rare use of active duty military on US soil. Trump declared victory and thanked the National Guard for restoring peace, even before the guard had fully assembled.</p>
