          <p>The article discusses the recent shooting in Washington, D.C., where a young couple was murdered, allegedly by someone shouting "Free Palestine." The author argues that this was a political assassination fueled by a deranged ideology that is spreading through American institutions. They claim this ideology divides people into oppressors and oppressed, resents Jewish achievement, embraces violence, and sees Western civilization as illegitimate. The author calls for a clear line to be drawn against political violence and the normalization of bigotry, emphasizing the need to uphold civic norms and enforce the law to prevent further tragedies. The article also notes that the suspect was at one time affiliated with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a U.S.-based Marxist group tied to China, Iran, and Russia.</p>

          <p>An elementary school in England hosted a mobile prison to teach students about the realities of life behind bars. The project, led by former police officer Mick Amos, aims to deter crime by showing children the consequences of their actions. Students dressed as inmates are scanned, photographed, and fingerprinted before entering replica jail cells complete with stainless-steel toilets. The experience is designed to open conversations about drugs, alcohol, violence, sexting, and knife crime, providing information to help young people make informed choices and understand their responsibilities under the law. The mobile prison also visits youth clubs and sports organizations, funded by cash seized from criminals.</p>

          <p>Former New York Representative Charles Rangel, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in the House from 1971 to 2017, and was the first Black chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.

          <p>Spain has called for a European arms embargo on Israel due to escalating violence in Gaza, but the effectiveness of such a measure depends on the actions of major weapons suppliers. The United States and Germany are the primary providers of arms to Israel, accounting for a significant portion of its weaponry. While some European nations have reduced or suspended arms exports, a substantial impact would require the US and Germany to join the embargo. The article also notes Italy contributes around one percent of Israel's arms. Despite calls for an embargo, Germany remains committed to supporting Israel's security.</p>
