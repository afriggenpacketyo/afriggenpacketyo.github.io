He was last seen on Tuesday, and a multi-agency search involving the U.S. Coast Guard, local police, and fire departments was initiated after his truck was found unattended. The search is being conducted in challenging weather conditions, including strong winds, high seas, and reduced visibility.

The storm, the world's most powerful this year, brought torrential rain and high winds, causing significant damage to undersea cables and leading to outages. While over a million people were evacuated in Guangdong with no reported casualties there, the typhoon was deadly in its path through the Philippines and Taiwan, where it caused at least 24 fatalities.

          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com has announced a share buyback program for its employees, establishing a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its $40 billion valuation during a 2022 funding round, although it's slightly up from a reported internal markdown later that year. The move provides liquidity for staff as the company, a competitor to Stripe and Adyen, continues to grow, forecasting 30% revenue growth and $300 billion in annual payment volume. This trend of offering liquidity through share sales is becoming more common among large private tech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several European Union member states are set to hold initial discussions on creating a comprehensive anti-drone defense system, dubbed a "drone wall." The talks, which include nations bordering Russia as well as Denmark and observer Ukraine, were prompted by recent Russian drone incursions into EU airspace. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has advocated for the initiative to counter the growing threat. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drone attacks continue to impact Russian infrastructure, with a recent strike causing a fire at the Afipsky oil refinery, further straining Russia's processing capacity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new series of tariffs, set to take effect on October 1st, targeting specific industries to protect U.S. manufacturers. The measures include a 100% levy on imported branded pharmaceuticals unless the company is building a factory in the U.S., a 25% tax on heavy-duty trucks, and a 50% tax on kitchen and bathroom cabinets. President Trump stated the tariffs are a response to foreign countries "flooding" the U.S. market with these products.

          <p>High-level officials from the United States and China have agreed to increase communication to better manage their strategic differences following a meeting in New York. Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu reiterated Beijing's stance on Taiwan as an internal affair, while U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau pressed for action on the fentanyl crisis. Both sides described the talks as "candid, in-depth and constructive," signaling a mutual desire to maintain dialogue and explore areas of cooperation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities worldwide, including New York, London, and Toronto, are experiencing a significant increase in rat populations, a phenomenon some are calling "Ratmageddon." Experts point to factors like increased food waste and urban development, but a recent study also links rising temperatures, particularly warmer winters, to accelerated rat breeding cycles. This surge poses public health risks, as rats can transmit diseases like leptospirosis and hantavirus. Pest control methods are struggling to keep up, as rats are neophobic and have developed resistance to many poisons, leading cities like New York to focus on better waste management as the primary solution.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black will test Europe's ability to win on American soil for the first time since 2012, following a trend of home-team dominance in recent competitions. Key factors for victory will include securing a fast start in the opening foursomes, which has been decisive in the last five events. Europe will also need to manage the notoriously boisterous New York crowd and leverage its greater collective Ryder Cup experience against a U.S. team led by world number one Scottie Scheffler. The presence of President Donald Trump on Friday is also expected to add to the electric atmosphere of the event.</p>

          <p>Sir Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is reportedly involved in high-level discussions regarding a potential leadership role in a transitional authority for Gaza following a ceasefire. The proposal, discussed by U.S. and Arab leaders, envisions a UN-backed body with Gulf support to govern the territory before it is returned to Palestinian control. Blair, who previously served as a Middle East envoy, has participated in White House meetings on post-war plans for Gaza. This development comes as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has expressed readiness to work on a two-state solution and rejected any future governing role for Hamas.</p>

It details how China's five-year plans, managed by the National Development and Reform Commission, have evolved from Soviet-style targets to proactive strategies for growth and reform. This structured process allows for long-term goals, such as the current focus on a consumer-led economy. In contrast, the article argues that the U.S. system, which theoretically relies on market forces guided by monetary and fiscal policy, has become dysfunctional due to intense political division, hindering its ability to implement coherent, long-range economic strategies.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the deadly January wildfires in Los Angeles County has found that the emergency response was hampered by a lack of resources, staffing shortages, and outdated communication policies. The report, commissioned by county supervisors, highlighted that these issues led to delayed evacuation warnings for residents in areas like Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Critical problems included an under-resourced Office of Emergency Management, unreliable cellular connectivity for first responders, and a convoluted multi-step process for issuing public alerts. While praising the heroic actions of individual responders, the report calls for clearer policies and better-integrated tools.</p>

          <p>China has opened an international operations center in Shanghai to promote the global use of its central bank digital currency, the e-CNY. The People's Bank of China aims to establish the digital yuan as an alternative in the international financial system, which is currently dominated by the U.S. dollar. The center will focus on three platforms designed to improve the efficiency of cross-border transactions, enable on-chain payments, and help existing financial infrastructure integrate with blockchain technology. This move is part of China's broader strategy to reshape the global financial architecture and increase the international footprint of its currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks secured a 23-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals with a last-second field goal in their Thursday night game. Kicker Jason Myers successfully converted a 52-yard attempt as time expired, giving the Seahawks their eighth consecutive win against their division rival. The dramatic finish came after Seattle blew a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, allowing the Cardinals to tie the game with just 33 seconds remaining. A penalty on the subsequent kickoff and a key pass from quarterback Sam Darnold set up the game-winning kick, allowing Myers to redeem himself after an earlier miss.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is being widely interpreted as a fulfillment of President Donald Trump's repeated calls to prosecute his political adversaries. This move raises serious concerns about the weaponization of the Department of Justice and the erosion of the traditional firewall between the White House and federal law enforcement. The charges were brought shortly after Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to act against Comey and others. Legal experts note that this direct presidential pressure is unprecedented and suggests that the prosecution may be perceived as vindictive, regardless of its legal merits.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated he is ready to leave office once the war with Russia is over, emphasizing that his goal is to achieve peace, not to secure another term. In an interview, he also committed to holding elections if a stable ceasefire is established, confirming he would proceed with a vote even under a temporary truce. Zelenskyy's five-year term officially would have ended in May 2024, but elections are suspended under the martial law imposed since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. His remarks address questions about Ukraine's democratic process during the protracted conflict.</p>

          <p>The parents of 8-year-old Cile Steward, who remains missing after a deadly flood at Camp Mystic in Texas, have condemned the camp's decision to reopen in 2026. The July 4th flood killed 27 campers and counselors, and the Stewards called the announcement "unthinkable" while their daughter has yet to be recovered. In a letter, they criticized the camp for proceeding with business as usual while families are still grieving and search efforts continue. Other families of victims echoed the sentiment, stating the priority should be finding Cile, not planning memorials or reopening, and called the move unconscionable.</p>

He believes AI will have a profound global impact on everything from drug development to the job market. While acknowledging that parts of the market are currently "frothy" and overvalued due to short-term hype, he argues the long-term transformation is real. Ganguly also noted that the next decade of tech will be defined by "deep" technologies like AI and advanced semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

The bridge, which spans a deep and narrow gorge known as the "Earth's crack," will also be the world's longest mountain bridge at 2,890 meters.

          <p>Arcadio Rodriguez, a former Orange County sheriff's deputy, has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges for sexually assaulting two female inmates but will serve no jail time. He was sentenced to time already served under home confinement, one year of formal probation, and is required to register as a sex offender. The assaults, which occurred in 2022, involved Rodriguez touching the inmates over their clothes and showing them pornographic videos. The District Attorney's office noted that state law only permitted misdemeanor charges because the assault was not skin-to-skin, and stated they are seeking changes to the law for harsher penalties.</p>
