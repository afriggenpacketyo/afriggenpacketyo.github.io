          <p>At least five tourists have been killed in the Indian-administered Kashmir region after gunmen opened fire in Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in the Himalayas.

          <p>A federal judge in Georgia has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after their F-1 student visas were terminated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security (DHS). Judge Victoria Calvert found that the terminations exceeded legal authority and likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. The lawsuit was filed by the ACLU and other groups in the Northern District of Georgia. The case will now be heard for a preliminary injunction, potentially offering longer-term relief, on Thursday, April 24.</p>

          <p>A top Beijing official, Xia Baolong, has strongly criticized US tariffs on Hong Kong, asserting that they aim to undermine the city's very survival. Xia's speech, delivered at a National Security Education Day ceremony, condemned the tariffs as arrogant and shameless, despite Hong Kong being a major source of the US trade surplus.

          <p>Chinese shipyards are experiencing relief as the United States has scaled back its plan to impose port fees on Chinese-linked ships. The final plan, unveiled by the USTR, includes a phased fee structure with exemptions, alleviating pressure on Chinese shipbuilders. A key change is the removal of a previous plan to charge companies based on the number of Chinese-made vessels they own or order, which had caused concern among clients. This adjustment is expected to reduce concerns about placing orders with Chinese shipbuilders.</p>

To break the deadlock, the author suggests two diplomatic paths: Beijing could publicly invite the US to negotiate in China, or a neutral third party could broker a meeting during a regional summit. The US has barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip to China, further inflaming tensions, as the US seeks to leverage trade negotiations to pressure other countries into isolating China.</p>

          <h2>Tariffs and the Climate Crisis: Twin Inflation Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 08:00:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While tariffs will raise prices, disproportionately affecting the poor, the climate crisis poses a more significant long-term inflation risk. Rising insurance costs due to climate-related damages and the impact on food supplies are already affecting prices. The Trump administration's war on climate change research and the backing off of decarbonization efforts exacerbate these risks. The author argues that addressing the climate crisis is crucial to mitigate future inflation, as central bank actions alone cannot accommodate these underlying forces.</p>

          <h2>China's Politburo to Counter Trump's Tariffs</h2>

          <p>China's Politburo is expected to address the intensified tariff war with the US at its upcoming meeting, focusing on implementing existing policy tools rather than immediately rolling out new fiscal stimulus. Urgent problems created by the conflict will be prioritized, alongside expectations for further monetary easing in the second quarter. Analysts suggest that the Politburo is likely to implement existing stimulus measures swiftly, given the decent first-quarter data and the potential for further developments in the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Bath & Body Works is well-positioned in the face of tariffs due to its high percentage of US-produced goods. The retailer manufactures 80% of its products domestically, providing a key advantage over competitors who rely on imports. Analysts note that this domestic exposure allows Bath & Body Works to maintain prices and profitability without incurring import tariffs. The company's US manufacturing facility, Beauty Park, enables quick testing, reaction, and movement to meet consumer demands.</p>

          <p>The Republican coalition is held together by a synthesis of authoritarian and libertarian elements, with traditional conservatives accepting Trump's authoritarianism and corruption because he stays loyal to them on key issues like low taxes for the rich.

The alliance is maintained by giving each faction what it cares about most, with traditional conservatives getting low taxes and national conservatives getting a free hand to wield state power.</p>

          <p>Florida's public universities are cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), with at least ten institutions signing agreements that grant campus police immigration enforcement powers. This collaboration has led to revoked visas and student protests, as Governor Ron DeSantis has prioritized immigration enforcement. The agreements allow campus police to question, arrest, and prepare charges for those suspected of immigration violations, effectively expanding the state's immigration enforcement capabilities. These actions contrast with the resistance seen at elite universities in the Northeast.</p>

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch argues that these incidents waste police time on ideology and grievance instead of justice. Policing Minister Diana Johnson, however, contends that the plan is unworkable and would hinder the monitoring of serious antisemitism and other racist incidents.
