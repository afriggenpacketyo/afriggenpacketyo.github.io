          <p>Lando Norris secured his first victory since the season-opener in Australia at the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a race win. The race was relatively straightforward for the front-runners, with Norris managing both pit-stop periods effectively. Verstappen, disadvantaged by limited tire sets, finished fourth after Red Bull's strategy didn't yield a desired safety car intervention. The Dutchman's strategy involved starting on hard tires and switching to mediums, delaying his final pit stop to back Norris into Leclerc and Piastri, but ultimately he had to stop with one lap remaining. The top three drivers, Norris, Leclerc, and Piastri, followed a similar strategy, each using medium tires initially, followed by two stints on hard tires.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the passage of the House budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," while downplaying concerns about rising federal deficits. This statement contrasts with a Congressional Budget Office analysis, which suggests the tax provisions in the package could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Johnson argued that the bill will stimulate the economy by increasing wages and incentivizing business expansion and U.S. manufacturing. Republican senators have expressed reservations about the bill, citing concerns about the soaring deficits it could create.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's sovereignty and independence amid perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. This event marks a rare occasion, as a British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977. The visit is intended to underscore Canada's unique identity and traditions, distinguishing it from the United States, and to strengthen ties with Europe. While the Canadian population remains largely indifferent to the monarchy, the visit also serves as a means for Prime Minister Carney to improve relations with Trump, who is known to admire the British monarchy.</p>

The Israeli military stated it struck suspects near Israeli forces and is investigating if uninvolved civilians were harmed.

The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in over 50,000 deaths in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and this incident is part of a renewed round of fighting.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts are questioning current screening guidelines, which recommend against routine PSA testing for men over 70. Dr. Marc Siegel argues that all men over 45 should be screened, citing advancements in treatment with fewer side effects. Dr. Shawn Dason suggests that men in their 50s and 60s should discuss the potential benefits and risks of screening with their healthcare providers, but notes that there is limited data supporting screening for men over 70 due to increased risks of over-treatment. The importance of discussing individual health situations with a medical provider is emphasized.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that the Labour government cannot guarantee cheaper train tickets under renationalisation, despite bringing South Western Railway into public ownership. While she "would love to be able" to promise lower fares, she emphasized that the day-to-day running of trains is already heavily subsidized by taxpayers. The government's focus will be on improving services and infrastructure, with the aim of integrating SWR trains into Great British Railways. The Conservative Party criticized Labour for failing to deliver on promised lower ticket prices, while members of the public questioned the purpose of renationalising without reducing costs.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how the Trump administration is monetizing the presidency to an unprecedented degree, normalizing activities that would have previously sparked significant controversy. The Trump family has reportedly collected millions in fees from cryptocurrency ventures, brokered overseas real estate deals, and opened an exclusive club in Washington. The acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar is also highlighted as an example of potential conflicts of interest. Despite these activities, the usual mechanisms of official review and public outrage have been largely absent, indicating a shift in accepted behavior in Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Vatican may serve as a neutral ground for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, with Pope Leo XIV signaling a willingness to mediate. This possibility has gained traction after discussions with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and requests from US President Donald Trump and European leaders. Pope Leo XIV has emphasized peace in his initial addresses and has met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, US Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. While cautious experts emphasize the importance of neutrality, the Vatican's potential involvement reflects a shift in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.</p>

Shelters received a letter from FEMA raising concerns about illegal activity and demanding information, yet ICE continued to request housing for migrants. Despite these concerns, some shelters continue to provide assistance, citing moral obligations.

          <p>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) faces challenges, particularly with habitat destruction, prompting a debate on protecting ecosystems directly. Conservationists propose a native ecosystem-protection act to supplement the ESA, ensuring sufficient protection for each ecosystem type.

While some advocate for maximizing the current ESA's potential, others see an ecosystem-protection act as a unifying cause, recognizing the bipartisan love for American landscapes.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision to stay lower court rulings protecting officials from being fired by the president has raised concerns about the consolidation of power in the executive branch. The court's order effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument. Critics argue that the decision sends a dangerous message to the White House, suggesting that the administration can disregard statutes and court rulings in pursuit of its agenda. This action risks undermining the rule of law and emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional norms.</p>
