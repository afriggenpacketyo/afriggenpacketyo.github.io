          <p>Exit polls in Poland's presidential runoff election indicate a very tight race between liberal Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki. An Ipsos exit poll predicted Trzaskowski winning with 50.3% of the vote, while Nawrocki secured 49.7%. Trzaskowski has already claimed victory in the second round of the election, although the final results are pending.
