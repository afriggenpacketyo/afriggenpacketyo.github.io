          <p>Republicans secured victories in two Florida congressional special elections, increasing their House majority to 220 seats.  The wins for Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronis, though narrower than expected, provide the GOP more leeway to advance President Trump's agenda.  These elections are significant as the first since Trump's return to office, serving as an early test of the GOP's strength.</p>
