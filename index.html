          <p>An independent inquiry has substantiated 45 allegations against "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace, including claims of unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate language. Wallace issued an apology for any distress caused, while the BBC confirmed it has no plans to work with him in the future. The report, covering a 19-year period, also noted Wallace's recent autism diagnosis but stated he does not wish to use it as an excuse for his behavior. The findings have prompted calls for greater accountability and cultural change within the creative industries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychotherapist and sex therapist with over two decades of experience outlines four common but often overlooked factors that can damage intimacy in a relationship. The article identifies excessive phone use, unresolved feelings about ex-partners, a persistent negativity bias, and unmanaged stress as key intimacy blockers. It suggests that intimacy is about more than physical connection, emphasizing vulnerability, honesty, and open communication. The therapist provides practical advice for couples to address these issues, such as setting screen-free zones and reframing negative thoughts.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents. Firefighters rescued numerous people from the building, and over 30 individuals, including five firefighters, were hospitalized with one resident remaining in critical condition. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but officials do not suspect it was intentional, pointing instead to a possible electrical or mechanical failure. The tragedy has prompted an outpouring of support and condolences from state and local officials.</p>

          <p>Former National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that President Trump has the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell "if there's cause." The comments come amid escalating criticism from the Trump administration over the Fed's management, particularly a $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project that is allegedly over budget. Officials like OMB Director Russell Vought have accused Powell of mismanagement, suggesting the administration may be building a case for his removal before his term expires. This development highlights the ongoing political pressure on the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC internal review concluded that the documentary "Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone" violated editorial standards on accuracy by not disclosing that its child narrator was the son of a Hamas official. While the independent production company bears most responsibility, the BBC admitted to a lack of sufficient oversight and apologized for the failure. The report found no evidence that the family connection influenced the program's content, but stated the use of the child narrator was inappropriate. The BBC has announced it will implement new leadership roles and editorial processes to prevent similar breaches.</p>

          <p>A communication coach and former journalist advises against using phrases like "I've been there" when trying to empathize with someone, as it can shift the focus away from their experience. Instead, the article recommends four techniques for showing genuine empathy and support. These include being fully present with open body language, repeating a key word the person used to encourage deeper reflection, embracing silence to allow space for thought, and using the phrase "Tell me more" to foster curiosity and deeper sharing. These methods help the speaker feel truly heard and understood, strengthening the connection.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has signaled its intention to carefully manage its "moderately loose" monetary policy to support the nation's goal of achieving around 5% economic growth this year. A deputy governor of the bank stated that the full impact of previous supportive measures, such as cuts to interest and reserve ratio rates, is still unfolding. Future policy adjustments will be based on close monitoring of domestic and international economic conditions. The approach aims to stimulate domestic demand and stabilize market expectations without deploying all measures at once. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Air China passenger jet traveling from Shanghai to Milan was involved in a near-miss incident with another aircraft over Siberia. The plane reportedly changed its altitude without being instructed to do so by air traffic control, bringing it within 300-400 feet of the other plane, far below the standard 1,000-foot separation minimum. Investigators are considering the possibility that the Air China pilot may have misunderstood an instruction intended for the other aircraft. The event is currently under investigation to determine the exact cause of the dangerous maneuver.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, boxing trainer Dave Coldwell explains his refusal to watch Manny Pacquiao's comeback fight against Mario Barrios, calling it a nod to nostalgia over merit. He argues that the 46-year-old legend, who has not had a competitive professional win in six years, should not be allowed to bypass the standard comeback process and jump directly into a WBC world title fight. Coldwell expresses concern for Pacquiao's health, noting that his high-energy style is difficult to maintain at his age. He fears the fight sets a bad precedent and undermines other deserving fighters.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for the 161 people still missing after the catastrophic July 4th floods in Kerr County, Texas, were suspended due to a new flood threat.

Authorities urged all search crews and volunteers to evacuate the river corridor as water levels were expected to rise to a moderate flood stage.
