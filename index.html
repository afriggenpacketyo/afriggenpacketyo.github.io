          <p>Coinbase shares declined after its second-quarter revenue of $1.5 billion fell short of analyst expectations. While net income was buoyed by investment gains, this failed to mask a drop in transaction revenue and retail trading volume, which missed forecasts. The company's subscription and services revenue also underperformed, reflecting a market slowdown from the previous quarter. Coinbase announced plans to expand its app to include tokenized assets and derivatives to boost future engagement.</p>

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter results that significantly beat Wall Street estimates, reporting its largest quarterly revenue growth since December 2021.

Mac sales also saw impressive growth of nearly 15%, and the services division continued its steady expansion. Despite these strengths, iPad and wearables sales saw a decline during the quarter.</p>

She reportedly attended the show, part of Gaga's Mayhem Ball Tour, with her husband, Paul Pelosi. The article provides a lighthearted glimpse into the public figure's personal life.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, with revenue growing 13% to $167.7 billion, but its stock fell due to a weaker-than-anticipated operating income forecast for the next quarter. The guidance raised concerns among investors about the returns on the company's massive AI investments. Amazon Web Services (AWS) saw its revenue grow 18% to $30.87 billion, though this lagged behind the growth rates of competitors Microsoft and Google. A bright spot was the advertising business, which surged 23%.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled plans for a new $200 million ballroom to be built in the White House's East Wing, a project President Trump has long desired. The 90,000-square-foot facility, with a seating capacity of 650, will be funded by Trump and other private donors. Officials state it will eliminate the need for large tents for state dinners and other major events. Construction is slated to begin in September and is expected to be completed well before the end of Trump's term.</p>

Critics of the era, like Henry David Thoreau, expressed anxieties about the newspaper's effect on the public's intellect, fears that echo contemporary concerns about social media and AI.

          <h2>Deep Staff Cuts at Federal Health Agency Jeopardize Local Health Programs</h2>

          <p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency distributing over $12 billion annually to community health programs, has reportedly lost about a quarter of its staff since February. These cuts, part of the Trump administration's staffing purges, are raising concerns about the agency's ability to manage grants for addiction treatment, rural hospitals, and maternal care. Former leaders warn the staff reductions threaten the oversight and distribution of critical funding, with some grant competitions for disadvantaged students already being canceled, potentially harming the nation's healthcare safety net.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department announced it will impose sanctions, including visa denials, on officials from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The U.S. cited the Palestinian leadership's actions to "internationalize its conflict with Israel" through international courts and their alleged support for terrorism. The move is seen by some as a response to a recent UN conference and growing international support for Palestinian statehood. Palestinian leaders described the sanctions as "revenge" and punishment against the victim.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's process for handling the rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he noted that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass Congress, more legal challenges are inevitable, forcing the court to intervene. Kavanaugh acknowledged criticism about the lack of explanation in some emergency rulings but stated the court has improved its process. He emphasized that the justices are thoughtfully engaging with difficult issues even when they disagree.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court intensely questioned the Trump administration's legal authority to impose sweeping tariffs on trading partners using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). During arguments, judges probed whether the law, which does not mention tariffs, could be used to bypass trade statutes enacted by Congress. The case, brought by 12 states and several businesses, challenges the centerpiece of the president's economic agenda. The court's decision will be a major test of presidential power and is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>In a rare public forum, three federal judges detailed the alarming increase in threats and harassment they have faced, which they link to political rhetoric from the Trump administration and its allies.

They condemned the inflammatory language used by political leaders to attack the judiciary, warning that it emboldens individuals to do them harm. The judges called for a defense of judicial independence and the rule of law.</p>
