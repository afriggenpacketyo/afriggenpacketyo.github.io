          <p>Fans of the Oklahoma State Cowboys are publicly calling for the firing of head coach Mike Gundy following a historic 19-12 home loss to Tulsa, the team's first such defeat in 74 years. Chants of "Fire Gundy" were audible during the game's broadcast, reflecting growing frustration as the team's record dropped to 1-2 this season. This loss comes after a difficult 3-9 season last year, which was the worst in Gundy's 21-year tenure. Despite the public outcry, Gundy praised the fans for their energy after the game and stated that decisions about his employment are not his to make.</p>

          <p>The threat of flash flooding is expected to return to the Desert Southwest on Sunday and Monday due to another surge of monsoonal moisture. This comes after recent heavy rains caused significant flooding, including a tragic incident where a two-year-old was swept away by floodwaters in Barstow, California. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is strengthening and is forecast to become a hurricane by late Sunday. However, Gabrielle is not expected to make landfall and will remain east of Bermuda before moving northeast across the ocean, posing no direct threat to land.</p>

          <p>Sonny Curtis, a pioneering rock 'n' roll musician and prolific songwriter, has passed away at the age of 88. A childhood friend of Buddy Holly, Curtis was a member of The Crickets and penned enduring classics such as "I Fought the Law" and the Everly Brothers' hit "Walk Right Back." He is perhaps most widely known for writing and performing "Love Is All Around," the iconic theme song for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Curtis's expansive career saw his work covered by numerous artists, and he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with The Crickets in 2012.</p>

          <p>The qualifying session for the Formula 1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix was marked by chaos, as difficult, windy conditions on the Baku street circuit led to a record six red flags from numerous driver crashes. Championship rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both made errors, qualifying in a disappointing seventh and ninth place, respectively. The challenging conditions, including wind, cold temperatures, and light rain, made the track exceptionally difficult to navigate, catching out over a quarter of the field. Max Verstappen secured pole position, positioning him favorably for the upcoming race while his main competitors start further down the grid.</p>

          <p>Top Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, have formally requested a meeting with President Trump to negotiate a solution to prevent an impending government shutdown. In a letter, they accused Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan talks to keep the government funded beyond the September 30 deadline. The request follows the failure of competing short-term spending bills from both parties in Congress. Both sides appear to be positioning the other to take public blame should federal agencies be forced to close due to the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with so-called sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois of potential lawsuits and funding cuts for refusing to honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers. ICE issued letters demanding the states comply with requests to hold undocumented migrants for federal custody, but the states declined, citing state laws and constitutional concerns. The Trump administration argues these policies release dangerous individuals into communities, while the states maintain that honoring the requests is not mandatory and could lead to legal liability for wrongful detention.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Gavin and Stacey" star Joanna Page has alleged that she was groped by an unnamed television host while filming. Page claims a female producer had warned her beforehand that the host could be "very handsy" and was likely to touch her. The actress states that when the host began groping her midway through the shoot, she hit his hands and verbally confronted him, which made the behavior stop. Page described the incident as bizarre and noted it was the kind of conduct one became accustomed to in the industry at the time.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used its newly acquired "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers.

After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened, U.S. Steel reversed its decision to idle the facility.

          <h2>Analysts Argue Trump is Exploiting Charlie Kirk's Killing for Political Retribution</h2>

          <p>Critics and political analysts suggest that President Trump is leveraging the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to fuel a campaign of vengeance against his political adversaries. Over the past ten days, the administration has escalated threats against the "radical left," considering measures like designating certain groups as domestic terrorists, despite no evidence linking them to the killing. Observers warn this response mirrors authoritarian tactics, using a tragedy as a pretext to suppress dissent, undermine political opponents, and erode civil liberties. The upcoming memorial service for Kirk is feared to be a platform to further this narrative.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law designed for national emergencies and wartime, to address the UK's asylum backlog and reduce reliance on costly hotels. The party's plan involves establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of asylum caseworkers to expedite claims. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart argued that invoking these emergency powers is necessary to secure the funds and resources for a rapid and effective response. The proposal is part of the party's focus on law and order at its annual conference.</p>

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man suspected of shooting into the lobby of the ABC10 news station. The incident occurred a day after protesters had gathered at the location to demonstrate against ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. While a motive is still under investigation, the shooting damaged a window of the occupied building, though fortunately, no one was injured. The arrest was made after police linked the suspect to a vehicle believed to have been used in the shooting, which has heightened concerns about press safety amid political tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of his killing, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being positioned as a martyr for the Christian nationalist movement in the United States. Religious and political allies are using his death to issue a "battle cry," framing the event as part of a spiritual war against evil and leftism. This narrative aligns with Kirk's own political evolution, as he increasingly embraced Christian culture war rhetoric in recent years. Analysts note that this framing could be a powerful tool to galvanize supporters and further entwine the MAGA movement with Christian nationalist ideology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market achieved new record highs this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq responding positively to the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-point.

Lewinsky discussed how cultural perspectives, particularly among younger generations, have shifted to be more critical of power imbalances and misogyny. She emphasized the importance of telling one's own story, using humor to cope, and insisting on a different ending than the one written by others.</p>

Following what both sides described as a productive call, Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a potential visit to China early next year. While the dialogue is seen as a positive step, analysts caution that significant points of friction remain, including tensions over Taiwan, confrontations in the South China Sea, and potential U.S. tariffs related to China's international trade.</p>

For many, the lower tuition fees in countries like the Netherlands offer a more affordable path to a degree without accumulating substantial debt.

The total number of crossings for 2025 has now exceeded 32,000, a record for this point in the year. The influx occurred on the same day the UK government confirmed it had deported two men to France under a new "one-in-one-out" agreement. This deal allows the UK to return a migrant to France in exchange for accepting another with a strong asylum case, a plan ministers hope will eventually deter crossings.</p>
