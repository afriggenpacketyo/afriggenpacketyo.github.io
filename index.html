          <p>A Department of Health and Human Services official refuted the NIH director's announcement about creating an autism registry, stating that the department is instead developing a real-world data platform to link existing datasets for autism research. This reversal follows intense criticism from advocacy groups and researchers concerned about patient privacy and potential misuse of data to support unfounded claims. The NIH maintains that its data repository will analyze de-identified data in compliance with privacy laws. The HHS plans to invest $50 million in the research effort, aiming to understand the causes of autism and improve treatments through data resources and collaboration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched an investigation into the New York Department of Education (NYDOE) over its ban on Native American-inspired mascots in high school sports teams. The NYDOE mandate requires public schools to retire such mascots or risk losing state funding, targeting the Massapequa School District on Long Island for its continued use of the Chiefs mascot. The Native American Guardian's Association filed a complaint, claiming the ban violates federal civil rights law. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that the department will not stand by as New York attempts to erase Native American heritage.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine are "very close to a deal" and called for high-level officials to meet and finalize it. Trump criticized both countries for failing to agree to a peace deal and threatened to withdraw from negotiations if no progress is made. His envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss a US-brokered peace plan. Ukraine has repeatedly stated it will not accept a deal conceding land or sovereignty to Russia.</p>

          <p>The federal government is reversing course and will restore the records of international students whose entries in a crucial database were abruptly terminated, which had complicated their ability to stay in the country. ICE had been terminating students' SEVIS records over minor disciplinary issues uncovered in background checks. International students filed nearly a hundred federal lawsuits, and a government lawyer announced in court that terminated SEVIS records would be restored temporarily while the government adopts a formal policy for revoking records. Immigration attorneys have documented close to 5,000 students whose SEVIS records have been terminated in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>The CBS newsmagazine "60 Minutes" is facing an unprecedented crisis following the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited interference from Paramount Global. The interference is alleged to be related to a merger with Skydance Media that requires regulatory clearance from the Trump administration, which is suing CBS over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. There are fears that Paramount Global may settle the lawsuit with an apology and payment to Trump, which could undermine the program's independence. Despite the challenges, the staff of "60 Minutes" is expected to maintain its journalistic values.</p>

This arrangement is considered a security risk, as it gives Hegseth access to his personal communications within a sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF).
