          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss following the firm's controversial agreement with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The agreement, which involved auditing hiring practices and dedicating funds to pro bono legal services, was criticized in the legal community. Dunn, known for representing high-profile clients and advising Democratic candidates, is departing along with Bill Isaacson, Jessica Phillips, and Jeannie Rhee. It is unclear if their departures are directly related to the deal with the Trump administration, which initially sought to penalize the firm for employing individuals critical of the president.</p>

The government plans to release 300,000 tons of rice initially and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution.

          <p>Fears of a trade war between the U.S. and EU have resurfaced after President Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods, claiming trade talks were "going nowhere." The European Commission has refused to back down, emphasizing that trade must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. EU leaders have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, stressing the need for de-escalation and readiness to respond. Trump has also threatened a 25% tariff on Apple if the company does not shift iPhone production to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite White House claims that President Trump's gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin was a personal event, several attendees visited the White House the following day for a special VIP event. Investors, including those from overseas, toured the White House, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and special access. The black-tie event, held at Trump's golf club, granted admission to those who invested heavily in the $TRUMP coin, with some funds directly benefiting the Trump family.

None of the 16 crew members were injured, and Norwegian police have launched an investigation. This is reportedly the same ship that ran aground twice before, in 2023 and 2024.</p>

The study, published in Global Change Biology, found that the birds' beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders. Male hummingbirds' beaks also grew pointier over time to help them compete for food at feeders. The increased availability of food has allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward, according to the article.</p>
