          <p>Kavan Markwood, a Pittsburgh Pirates fan who fell 21 feet at PNC Park, is recovering faster than expected from skull, brain, spine, rib, and lung injuries. According to Allegheny General Hospital, he is now off the breathing machine and out of intensive care, preparing for physical therapy. Markwood can talk, walk, and perform simple tasks, although he is still in pain, and his sister and aunt expressed gratitude for the support he has received. While the cause of the fall is under investigation, a Pirates spokesperson stated that Markwood showed no signs of intoxication, although he had consumed two beers, and friends and coaches describe his recovery as a miracle.</p>

          <p>North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The missiles were fired from the Wonsan area and traveled approximately 800 kilometers before falling into the sea. This launch follows a previous missile launch on March 10, which occurred shortly after South Korea and the United States began their annual joint military exercise called Freedom Shield. Japan has strongly protested the launch, with one missile potentially following an irregular trajectory, and confirmed that none of the missiles breached Japan's exclusive economic zone.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were taken into police custody after occupying Butler Library at Columbia University, seeking to revive the protest movement from the previous spring. The protesters, who renamed the library ‚Äúthe Basel Al-Araj Popular University,‚Äù faced a standoff with Columbia security before the NYPD was called in to clear the building. The university cited safety concerns and the presence of non-affiliated individuals as reasons for requesting police assistance, with the acting president, Claire Shipman, noting the necessity to secure the community's safety. The protests come amid ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Columbia over the handling of antisemitism complaints, potentially complicating the restoration of federal funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump has selected Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer and author, as his new nominee for U.S. Surgeon General after his initial pick, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, withdrew her nomination. Trump stated that Means would collaborate with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to address the chronic disease epidemic and improve American health. Means, known for her book 'Good Energy,' advocates against the influence of the pharmaceutical and food industries and has raised concerns about vaccines and the FDA.</p>
