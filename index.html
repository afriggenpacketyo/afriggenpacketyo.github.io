          <p>Disgraced former U.S. Representative George Santos has surrendered to a federal prison in New Jersey to begin his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. Santos pleaded guilty to a wide range of offenses, including fabricating his biography to defraud voters, faking donations, and using campaign funds for personal luxury expenses. Prosecutors stated he "made a mockery of our election system" to enrich himself. Following his sentencing, Santos appealed to former President Trump for a future pardon, claiming his sentence was politically influenced, but the White House has not commented on any clemency requests.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, is being integrated into the prediction market platforms Kalshi and Polymarket, where users bet on the outcomes of real-world events. The AI will provide context and summaries on market fluctuations, a move that raises concerns given Grok's history of generating controversial and false information. Prediction markets, which operate like gambling platforms, are touted by proponents like Musk as being more accurate than polls due to the financial stakes involved. The partnership highlights the growing intersection of AI, finance, and online betting, alongside questions about potential conflicts of interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Russia Enacts New Law to Penalize Searching for "Extremist" Content Online</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 15:44:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia's parliament has approved a sweeping new censorship law that imposes fines for searching for or accessing online content that the government has labeled "extremist." The legislation also penalizes the promotion of VPN services, which many citizens use to bypass existing state censorship. The law represents a significant escalation, as it targets the mere act of seeking information, not just its distribution, bringing it closer to what critics call "thoughtcrime." This move further tightens the Kremlin's control over information and free speech, which has been severely restricted since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life sentences in Idaho for murdering her two children, has received two more consecutive life sentences in Arizona. The new convictions are for conspiring with her late brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and for the attempted murder of her niece's ex-husband. During the sentencing, the judge condemned her "unparalleled" manipulation and blatant disregard for human life, highlighting that her motives were money and sex. The hearing featured emotional victim impact statements from family members, including her surviving son, who called his mother the true "family tragedy."</p>

          <p>Fresh details about Donald Trump's relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are causing controversy as the president travels to Scotland. A new report confirms Trump's name was on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday, adding to previous claims that he contributed a lewd drawing, which Trump denies and is suing over. This comes as Trump's administration has reversed promises to release the full Epstein investigation files. The steady emergence of photos, videos, and documents suggesting a close relationship continues to undermine the president's attempts to distance himself from the disgraced financier.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has floated the idea of providing a "little rebate" to some American consumers, particularly those at certain income levels, using revenue generated from tariffs. The administration is reportedly considering the proposal, though it is unclear if it could be enacted without congressional approval. While Trump also mentioned using the funds to pay down national debt, experts quoted in the article expressed skepticism, noting a rebate could be challenging to implement and could potentially exacerbate the inflationary effects of the tariffs. The Treasury Department recently reported an unexpected surplus in June, boosted by a 301% year-over-year gain in customs duties. (not investment advice)</p>

The story follows Leonardo, an arrogant literature student in Siena, as he navigates intellectual pretension, loneliness, and the chaotic temptations of youth. The review praises the film's energetic and stylish filmmaking, which mirrors the protagonist's internal tornado of emotions, though it can occasionally feel tiring. First-time actor Manfredi Marini is highlighted for his compelling performance as the lost antihero in this messy, funny, and ultimately poignant exploration of being on the cusp of adulthood.</p>

While the NHS aims to keep non-urgent services running and has urged patients to attend appointments unless canceled, significant disruption is expected. The BMA, which is seeking pay restoration to 2008 levels after adjusting for inflation, has begun agreeing to limited requests for doctors to return to work in critically pressured hospital units.</p>

In April, large sections of the border were designated as militarized zones, giving troops authority to apprehend individuals on federal land.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review of Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" finds the film to be handsome and well-acted but ultimately lacking in fun. Despite its retro-futuristic aesthetic and a strong cast including Pedro Pascal, the movie dispenses with the team's quirky family dynamic and dives immediately into a world-ending crisis. The reviewer argues that by focusing on the cosmic threat of Galactus from the outset, the film loses the playful chemistry that defined the source material, flattening the characters. While visually impressive, the adventure is described as "all end-of-the-world menace, all the time," missing the opportunity to be a lighter, bouncier entry in the franchise.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker and associate of Jeffrey Epstein, has completed a second day of interviews with Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche. Her lawyer stated that Maxwell answered every question asked of her "honestly and truthfully" and did not invoke any privilege. The meeting's purpose was for Blanche to determine if Maxwell has information about others who may have committed crimes. This development occurs as Maxwell appeals her 20-year sentence and as pressure mounts on the Trump administration to release federal files related to the Epstein investigation, which it had previously promised to do.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump arrived in Scotland for a five-day trip, the Scottish newspaper The National published a provocative front page that has since gone viral. The cover features a picture of Trump with the headline "Welcome to Scotland... just don't get any ideas about staying," reflecting local sentiment and planned protests against his visit. The article highlights strong social media reactions praising the cover for its bluntness and contrasting it with what some perceive as more deferential U.S. media coverage. The incident underscores the contentious international reception awaiting the president during his visit.</p>

          <p>England's Joe Root scored a masterful 150 against India, an innings that moved him past Australian great Ricky Ponting to become the second-highest run-scorer in Test cricket history. His 38th Test century anchored England's dominant performance on day three of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, helping the team build a substantial lead of 186. Root's chanceless innings saw him share significant partnerships with Ollie Pope and Ben Stokes, grinding down the Indian bowling attack. England is now in a commanding position to win the match and secure an unassailable 3-1 series lead.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami stars Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba have been suspended for their next MLS match after they were absent from the league's All-Star Game. While Messi's absence was attributed to fatigue and Alba's to a minor injury, neither player received prior approval from the league to miss the event, triggering the automatic sanction. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged Messi's immense contribution to the league but stated that the long-standing policy had to be enforced without exception. However, he also committed to reviewing the rule with players to see how it should evolve in the future.</p>

          <p>Rapper GloRilla, whose real name is Gloria Woods, was arrested on felony drug charges after police responded to a burglary at her Atlanta-area home. Woods, who was not home at the time, stated it was "crazy" that instead of focusing on the intruders, police focused on cannabis found at the residence. Deputies investigating the break-in, during which an occupant fired a weapon at the suspects, reported a strong odor of narcotics and obtained a search warrant. Woods' attorneys called the arrest a sign of "warped law enforcement priorities," arguing their client is a victim, not a suspect.</p>

          <p>This historical article details the 1933 conflict between Adolf Hitler and Hans Luther, the fiscally conservative and independent president of Germany's central bank, the Reichsbank. Immediately after becoming chancellor, Hitler's regime clashed with Luther, who refused to fund the Nazis' massive rearmament plans, citing the bank's independence and international obligations. Despite legal frameworks designed to protect him, Luther was ultimately forced to resign after Hitler made unmistakable extralegal threats against him. The episode illustrates how the Nazi regime dismantled democratic and financial institutions, replacing the independent Luther with the more compliant Hjalmar Schacht to finance its agenda.</p>

The company's valuation is now ahead of established giants like Home Depot and Procter & Gamble. Despite its high market cap, the stock trades at a very high multiple of 273 times forward earnings.

The company, which has been unsuccessful in securing significant external foundry customers, is canceling chip facility projects in Germany and Poland. This uncertainty about the future of its manufacturing ambitions has alarmed investors, wiping out most of the stock's gains for the year. (not investment advice)</p>
