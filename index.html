          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was already serving a 200-year sentence for a 1973 murder when he was convicted on federal charges in 1997 for overseeing the gang while in prison. His attorneys expressed their gratitude to President Trump for delivering justice for Hoover, who has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at a maximum-security prison in Colorado. It is unclear when Hoover will be released from federal custody as he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois.</p>

          <p>Canada is considering culling 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm due to an avian flu outbreak, prompting objections from figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Oz. The ostriches were exposed to the H5N1 virus, leading to the order for their destruction. Kennedy and others have suggested further testing to gain scientific knowledge from the birds, while Dr. Oz offered to relocate them to his Florida ranch. However, most veterinarians argue that keeping potentially infected birds alive poses a public health risk, as outbreaks have killed millions of birds and infected people in the United States. </p>

This decision comes as the Department of Homeland Security considers restructuring FEMA, with Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting the agency has failed and should be downsized. An internal review also indicated FEMA is "not ready" for the 2025 hurricane season due to staffing limitations and reorganization efforts.</p>

Trump's short attention span and frustration with slow progress lead to impulsive actions, such as premature declarations of victory and broadsides at policymakers. This impatience poses a threat to the constitutional order, as Trump seeks to bypass due process and legal procedures. It also undermines his own agenda, particularly in trade policy, where his unpredictable actions have yielded few actual agreements.</p>

          <p>Andrew and Tristan Tate are facing 21 criminal charges in the U.K., including sexual assault, assault, and human trafficking. The charges stem from allegations dating back to 2012 and 2015 in Bedfordshire. The brothers will face these charges upon extradition from Romania, where they are involved in separate criminal proceedings related to forming a criminal gang to exploit women. Both brothers deny all charges. Four other women in the U.K. have also filed a separate civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate, accusing him of sexual assault and physical abuse.</p>

          <p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has determined that the Defense Department lacks a clear strategy for the construction, deployment, and management of the missile defense system being built on Guam. Without a comprehensive plan, the effort risks cost and schedule overruns, as well as infrastructure unprepared to accommodate additional personnel. The GAO report highlights concerns about transferring responsibilities from the Missile Defense Agency to service leads, as well as the lack of firm personnel numbers and deployment schedules. The report recommends that the Pentagon develop a strategy with a timeline for transferring responsibilities and a long-term strategy for the Army's organization on the island.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry due to these restrictions. The company's gaming division also saw significant growth, and its automotive and robotics division reported a 72% increase in sales. (not investment advice)</p>
