            <p>President Trump reiterated his idea of sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons, specifically mentioning El Salvador and suggesting the country should build more prisons to house them. Legal experts have stated that this proposal would be unconstitutional. El Salvador's President Bukele expressed his willingness to help the Trump administration, joking that imprisoning some people is necessary to liberate others. The administration is studying the legal aspects of this proposal, focusing on violent offenders.</p>

            <p>Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in an antitrust trial where the FTC is challenging Meta's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing it gives the company excessive control over the social media market. The FTC seeks to force Meta to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to restore competition. Zuckerberg admitted Facebook struggled with mobile users in the early 2010s and eyed Instagram's progress. Meta argues the acquisitions were not anticompetitive and that it faces strong competition from platforms like TikTok and YouTube.</p>

            <p>House Democrats are demanding a briefing from the Department of Homeland Security after immigration agents attempted to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools to speak with students. The agents claimed they were conducting welfare checks but were denied access by school principals. Lawmakers are concerned the agents falsely claimed to be conducting welfare checks while actually targeting children for deportation, undermining public trust. They are requesting the agency desist from immigration enforcement activity involving children who do not pose a public safety threat.</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering a temporary pause on auto tariffs to give carmakers more time to relocate production to the U.S. He stated that automakers "need a little bit of time" to shift production from Canada, Mexico, and other places. Car manufacturers' supply chains are tightly interwoven with other nations, making it almost impossible to make vehicles entirely in the United States. The 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars are likely to boost car prices significantly.</p>
