          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, potentially worth over $1 trillion within a decade. The package is contingent on the company achieving ambitious milestones, including a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and significant production targets for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. This proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided Musk's previous $56 billion pay package from 2018, and is presented by the board as essential for retaining his leadership through a critical growth period.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security plans to use the Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois as a command center for an upcoming immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago area. According to an internal memo, the base will accommodate approximately 250 federal agents for "removal operations" targeting undocumented immigrants, with the operation expected to last for about 30 days. This move reflects the Trump administration's expanded use of military facilities to support its mass deportation efforts, a strategy that has previously faced legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial occurs under a shadow of political tension, as Germany's far-right AfD party has criticized the institution for promoting "globalist uniformity," echoing historical denunciations by the Nazi party. The Bauhaus Dessau Foundation's director expressed concern over the party's cultural attacks but remains committed to the celebration, which focuses on the evolution of modern materials and sustainable design.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling significantly short of economists' expectations and signaling a notable slowdown in the labor market. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, while previous months' figures were revised, showing a net job loss in June. This report, the first since the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner was fired, is likely to reinforce the Federal Reserve's decision to implement an interest rate cut later this month to support the weakening job market.

          <p>Ferrari demonstrated strong early performance at its home race in Monza, with drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc securing the top two spots in the first practice session for the Italian Grand Prix. Hamilton set the fastest time, despite facing a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming race, finishing just ahead of his teammate. The session was eventful, featuring a red flag caused by gravel on the track and a power loss issue for Mercedes driver George Russell, setting an intriguing stage for the rest of the race weekend.</p>

          <p>European stock markets traded higher as investors reacted to a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report, which showed the creation of only 22,000 payrolls in August. This economic softness has solidified market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut, a move generally seen as positive for global equities. The news also caused the U.S. dollar to decline against the euro and sterling, reflecting investor sentiment that a rate cut is imminent to support the slowing American labor market.

          <p>The full texts of Angela Rayner's resignation letter and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's reply reveal the circumstances surrounding her departure as Deputy Prime Minister. In her letter, Rayner accepts responsibility for inadvertently paying an incorrect rate of Stamp Duty Land Tax, citing the toll of media scrutiny on her family as a key factor in her decision. The Prime Minister's ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, concluded that while she acted with integrity, the error meant she did not meet the "highest possible standards" required by the Ministerial Code, leading to her resignation.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Criticizes Free Speech Hypocrisy of Donald Trump and Nigel Farage</h2>

          <p>This opinion column critiques the "free speech crusade" led by Donald Trump and UK politician Nigel Farage, arguing their advocacy is self-serving and hypocritical. The author points out that while Farage complains to U.S. lawmakers about an "authoritarian situation" in the UK, his own Reform party's council leader in Nottingham attempted to ban local press from speaking to councillors. The piece also highlights Trump's own actions against free press and his admiration for dictators, suggesting their definition of free speech applies only to themselves and not to their critics.</p>

          <h2>Strained Relations Between Trump and India's Modi Signal Broader U.S.-India Friction</h2>

          <p>The once-strong "bromance" between U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly soured, reflecting broader tensions in the U.S.-India relationship. The friction is attributed to punishing U.S. tariffs against Indian goods and geopolitical maneuvering involving India's rival, Pakistan, which Trump has recently courted. This breakdown in personal diplomacy between the two populist leaders has complicated a strategic partnership that has been a cornerstone of U.S. policy in the Indo-Pacific for decades, creating new uncertainty for both nations.</p>

          <p>Chinese municipal governments are intensifying efforts to lead in artificial intelligence, with the city of Wenzhou becoming the first in the nation to establish a dedicated AI bureau. This new government body will oversee AI policy, coordinate computing and data resources, and promote AI integration across various industries. The move is part of a broader national strategy by Beijing to leverage local governments to build a competitive edge against the United States in the escalating global AI race, with other cities expected to follow suit.</p>

          <p>A cultural commentary piece argues that the US Open has become one of the worst places to watch actual tennis due to a constant, distracting hum of conversation from the audience. The author suggests the event has successfully transformed into a major social gathering, akin to Coachella, attracting attendees more interested in socializing, celebrity-spotting, and consuming expensive cocktails than the sport itself. This shift, while commercially successful, has created an environment where the on-court action is secondary, frustrating dedicated tennis fans and turning spectators into the main characters.</p>

          <p>Germany's new environment minister, Carsten Schneider, has emphasized that the government remains committed to its climate protection goals, including achieving climate neutrality by 2045. This affirmation comes amid pressure from conservative coalition partners who have questioned the feasibility of the targets and prioritized economic revival over costly climate regulations. Schneider, a career politician with little prior environmental policy experience, aims to work quietly and pragmatically to advance the climate agenda both domestically and through international cooperation with major emitters like China and India.</p>

          <p>In a tense Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended his changes to U.S. immunization policy and reiterated false claims about vaccine safety. He stated his agreement with a new appointee to a key vaccine panel who claimed mRNA vaccines cause "serious harm, including death," a position contrary to extensive scientific evidence. Kennedy clashed with Democratic senators, denying he was limiting access to COVID-19 shots while also acknowledging that availability now depends on state policy and that the government no longer recommends them for all healthy people.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Angela Rayner, tracing her remarkable rise from a difficult, working-class upbringing in Stockport to becoming the UK's Deputy Prime Minister. A teenage mother who left school with no qualifications, she built a career through the trade union movement before entering Parliament and becoming a powerful, outspoken figure in the Labour Party. Her spectacular ascent, however, has been matched by a sudden fall, as she resigned from her high-profile government and party roles after admitting to an error in her personal tax affairs.</p>
