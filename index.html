          <p>Christian Brückner, the primary suspect in the Madeleine McCann disappearance case, has declined an interview request from the Metropolitan Police. The request was made via an international letter ahead of his potential release for a separate offense. Brückner is currently serving a seven-year sentence in Germany for the sexual assault of an elderly woman in Portugal in 2005. Despite being a suspect, he has never been charged in connection with McCann's disappearance and denies any involvement. The investigation into Madeleine's disappearance remains ongoing, with British police treating it as a missing persons case while German authorities suspect murder. The suspect will not be interviewed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of drivers are finding themselves "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicles are worth, impacting new car purchases. Edmunds reports that 26.6% of trade-ins for new cars had negative equity in the second quarter of 2025, the highest in four years. The average amount owed on these upside-down loans was $6,754. Factors contributing to this include longer loan terms and smaller down payments. Experts advise consumers in this situation to consider keeping their current vehicle, researching loan options, and understanding their credit score before buying a new car. This trend indicates a potential financial strain on consumers and highlights the importance of careful financial planning when purchasing vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

He notes that the team looks more compact and organized under Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation. However, individual mistakes and players being used in the wrong roles are costing the team points. Murphy suggests that players like Bruno Fernandes and Luke Shaw are not ideally suited for their current positions, leading to defensive vulnerabilities.

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK ambassador to the United States. Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, said the appointment "speaks to how deep the corruption goes in our systems." Business Secretary Peter Kyle said it was "highly unlikely" Lord Mandelson would have been appointed if the extent of his relationship with Epstein was known. Lord Mandelson was sacked after emails showed supportive messages to Epstein. The family believes there are still people out there, still people in that book who could be doing this to other young women and children right now.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals a surge in maternal deaths in Afghanistan following the Trump administration's decision to cut US aid. The closure of USAID-supported clinics has left many women without access to essential healthcare services. The article shares several stories of women who died during childbirth after clinics closed, highlighting the devastating impact of the aid cuts. The US government has stated that it had concerns that funding was benefiting the Taliban, who govern the country. The Taliban government's policies have meant that after four years in power, it is still not recognised by most of the world.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 people participated in pro-Palestinian protests that disrupted the final stage of the Spanish Vuelta, forcing organizers to cut the race short. Clashes between police and protesters occurred near the route in Madrid, with some protesters blocking the road. Jonas Vingegaard was confirmed as the overall winner, but the podium ceremony was canceled due to security concerns. The Grand Tour event turned into a diplomatic battleground due to protests against the presence of the Israeli-owned team Premier Tech. The protests resulted in the alteration or interruption of seven of the last eleven days of racing.</p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) plans are gaining popularity among consumers as an alternative to credit cards, allowing purchases to be split into short-term, interest-free installments. An estimated 86.5 million Americans used BNPL loans in 2024, with projections indicating further growth. However, banks and credit card companies are wary of BNPL plans due to the direct challenge they pose to credit card revenue and transaction activity. BNPL loans also create a "giant black hole" in understanding consumer credit quality. As BNPL usage grows, financial institutions are increasingly cautious about the potential risks and disruptions to traditional credit models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, the state's open carry permit law is under fresh scrutiny. The law, passed in August, allows people with concealed-carry permits to openly carry firearms on college campuses. University staff had previously voiced concerns about the law's potential impact on campus safety. Utah has a history of second amendment-friendly legislation, including permitless open and concealed carry since 2021. Experts argue about the effectiveness of gun laws in deterring politically driven violence. The article explores the debate surrounding gun control and campus safety.</p>
