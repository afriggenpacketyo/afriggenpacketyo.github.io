        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant outage at an Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center in Virginia caused widespread disruptions across the internet, affecting major websites, apps, and services globally. The issue was identified as a DNS problem with its DynamoDB service, impacting companies like Disney+, Reddit, and even Amazon's own internal tools for warehouse and delivery operations. While AWS reported that services were recovering, the incident highlighted the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers. Experts suggest the outage was a technical fault rather than a cyberattack, underscoring the fragility of centralized digital infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pizza Hut is set to close 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations in the UK, resulting in the loss of 1,210 jobs after the operating company, DC London Pie Limited, entered administration. However, Pizza Hut's global owner, Yum! Brands, has stepped in to acquire and save 64 other locations, thereby preserving 1,276 jobs. This move comes less than a year after the UK operations were last rescued from insolvency. Analysts attribute the brand's struggles to increased competition from more upmarket pizza chains, rising operational costs, and a failure to effectively engage with consumers on social media.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a specific blend of cannabis oil was more effective than a placebo and offered better relief than opioids for chronic low back pain. The studies, described as groundbreaking, showed that patients using the cannabis tincture experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to those on opioids. While the findings support anecdotal evidence, researchers caution that the pain reduction was modest and the treatment is not a panacea. The German company behind the product, Vertanical, plans to seek market approval in Europe, but FDA approval in the U.S. could take years.</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. While automakers like GM and Ford are expected to report lower earnings, overall sales and production have held up better than anticipated, leading some financial firms to upgrade their sector outlook from negative to neutral. However, persistent headwinds remain, including slowing consumer demand, stress in the subprime auto lending market, and the economic uncertainty of a government shutdown. The industry continues to navigate a complex balancing act of costs and opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Career Expert Offers Strategies for Managing a Controlling Supervisor</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive coach and human behavior professor outlines five practical strategies for effectively dealing with a 'control freak' boss without becoming exhausted or frustrated. The advice includes presenting work as rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve preemptively seeking their opinion to get ahead of criticism and directly asking for positive feedback to balance the focus on adjustments. These methods are designed to conserve an employee's energy while navigating a challenging professional relationship by working with the manager's tendencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case questioning whether a federal law that prohibits habitual illegal drug users from possessing firearms violates the Second Amendment. The Trump administration is seeking to uphold the law after a lower court sided with a Texas man, an alleged regular marijuana user, who was charged under the statute. The government argues the restriction is necessary to prevent danger to society, while the defendant's lawyers contend the law is overly broad. The case brings the issue of gun rights and drug use before the court's conservative majority, which has generally favored an expansive view of the Second Amendment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose their value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include historically heavy government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline value for the used market. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, can make older EV models seem obsolete more quickly. As more affordable, mainstream EVs enter the market and the technology stabilizes, experts anticipate that this depreciation gap could begin to narrow, making used EVs a more attractive option for value-oriented buyers.

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the agency responsible for safeguarding the U.S. nuclear stockpile, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees as the government shutdown extends into its 20th day. This is the first time the NNSA has had to furlough workers since its creation in 2000, leaving a skeleton staff of fewer than 400 to continue operations. While officials assure that the nuclear stockpile will remain secure, the furloughs are expected to impede efforts to modernize older weapons. The move underscores the widespread impact of the shutdown, which has left thousands of federal workers on unpaid leave.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Chapter 7 bankruptcy can offer a path to eliminating most unsecured debts, qualifying for it is not automatic and can be challenging for some individuals. The primary obstacle is the 'means test,' which compares a person's household income to their state's median income. Those earning below the median typically qualify easily, but higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. Other disqualifying factors include a recent bankruptcy filing, failure to complete required credit counseling, or any attempts to hide assets or abuse the system by running up debt immediately before filing.</p>

          <p>Ange Postecoglou's dismissal after just 40 days as Nottingham Forest's manager is analyzed as the inevitable result of a fundamental mismatch. The club had found success with a deep-sitting, counter-attacking style, which is the antithesis of Postecoglou's high-pressing, aggressive football philosophy. The article questions the judgment of both the club's owner for making such an unsuitable appointment and Postecoglou for accepting a job with a squad so ill-equipped for his system. This brief, unsuccessful stint has likely damaged Postecoglou's reputation and prospects for future Premier League management, turning his idealistic coaching image into a cautionary tale.</p>

          <p>As market volatility increases, an Invesco portfolio manager suggests that income-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) utilizing options-based strategies can offer a sound approach for risk-averse investors. These funds can provide a more reliable form of downside protection and generate income that is not dependent on interest rate fluctuations, which is advantageous in the current rate-cutting cycle. This strategy aims to address the core investor needs of income generation and defense against equity drawdowns. Investors are advised to seek out ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and be wary of those with unsustainably high yields and fees. (not investment advice)</p>

Industry leaders express concern that such a tariff, while complex to enforce, would disrupt the collaborative nature of modern filmmaking and could force British producers to seek more co-production opportunities with European and Asian partners instead.

The report noted a trend of previously affordable cities, particularly in Texas, becoming unaffordable due to rising rents driven by an influx of middle-class workers. In total, 41 of the ranked cities were deemed unaffordable for a single person on a median income.</p>
