          <h2>Tesla Seeks to Launch Robotaxi Service in Phoenix, Competing with Waymo</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 17:39:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has applied for permits to test and deploy its robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, a market currently dominated by Google's Waymo. The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, where the company uses human safety supervisors. Tesla's approach relies heavily on cameras rather than more expensive sensors like lidar, which it claims will make its autonomous vehicles more economically viable. The expansion comes amid regulatory scrutiny following several documented incidents of its robotaxis violating traffic rules in Austin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and France have agreed to a new pilot scheme to return some migrants who arrive in Britain via small boats. Under the "one in, one out" deal, the UK would send a number of arrivals back to France in exchange for accepting an equivalent number of asylum seekers who apply through a formal process. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the plan aims to break the business model of people smugglers and deter dangerous Channel crossings. Critics argue the plan is insufficient, while human rights groups raise concerns about its effectiveness and humanitarian impact.</p>

          <p>Space manufacturing startup Varda has raised $187 million in a Series C funding round to expand its efforts in producing pharmaceuticals in orbit. The company's mission is based on the premise that the microgravity environment of space allows for the creation of superior drug crystallizations that are difficult to achieve on Earth. Varda has already conducted successful launches and is the first company to process materials outside the International Space Station. The new capital will be used to increase flight frequency and build out its biologics lab for identifying suitable drug molecules.</p>

          <p>Data from the CDC indicates that emergency room visits for tick bites are at their highest point in years, with a notable spike in the U.S. Northeast. Experts attribute the rise to record-high tick populations and a longer active season for ticks, driven by a warming climate. Tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, babesiosis, and Powassan virus are a significant public health concern. Health officials are urging the public to take preventative measures, such as wearing protective clothing, using insect repellent, and performing thorough tick checks after being outdoors.</p>

A potential nuclear armament by South Korea could be a tipping point, creating a scenario where Japan feels compelled to develop its own nuclear weapons.

Huang has previously stated these controls have effectively cut off the $50 billion Chinese market for U.S. companies, impacting Nvidia's planned sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government is formulating a response to President Trump's surprise decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports, which he claimed was punishment for "unfair trade barriers" and political issues. Brazilian officials are wary of direct retaliation that could harm their own industries, which rely on U.S. machinery and parts. Instead, the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is considering actions permitted under its Reciprocity Law, such as suspending patents or taxing U.S. profits.
