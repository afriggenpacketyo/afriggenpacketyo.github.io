          <p>A vehicle deliberately plowed into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with seven in critical condition. Police report the driver made a U-turn before the attack, striking people waiting in line, a taco truck, and a valet stand. Following the crash, bystanders assaulted the driver, who was also shot by another individual who then fled the scene. The driver is in custody at a hospital, and the incident is being investigated as an intentional act of assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

          <p>An inconspicuous building in Washington, D.C., houses the Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office Museum, a landmark commemorating a pivotal post-Civil War effort. After the war, Clara Barton established an office to locate and identify thousands of missing or deceased Union soldiers, a revolutionary undertaking that forever changed the military's approach to accounting for its members. This article highlights the museum's role in preserving the story of Barton's compassionate and meticulous work. Her efforts provided closure to countless families and established a precedent for how soldiers are honored.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Me, But Better," by author Olga Khazan details her journey to consciously alter her own personality traits, moving from being anxious and introverted to more outgoing. The article discusses the scientific basis for personality change, suggesting that seemingly fixed traits can be modified through deliberate effort and stepping outside one's comfort zone. It features insights from a psychology professor who affirms that it is possible to change ingrained aspects of one's personality. The book chronicles Khazan's use of techniques like improv comedy to foster this transformation.</p>

          <p>In the region of Naples, Italy, half a million people reside within the "red zone" of Campi Flegrei, a massive volcanic caldera showing increasing signs of activity. Scientists have recorded thousands of earthquakes recently, raising concerns about the potential for a significant eruption in this densely populated urban area. The supervolcano lies just 30 miles west of the more famous Mount Vesuvius, presenting a unique and constant geological threat to the local population. This article explores the lives of those in the area and the scientific efforts to monitor the situation.</p>

          <p>Former World Championship Wrestling (WCW) star Marcus "Buff" Bagwell has had his right leg amputated above the knee.

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on a strengthened security alliance with France and the United Kingdom, often referred to as the "E3."

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized that Europe must become more independent in its defense capabilities. The cooperation aims to leverage the nuclear deterrents of France and the UK to supplement, and if necessary, replace US protection for the continent.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza hospital officials and witnesses, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians seeking food, killing 32 people and wounding dozens more. The incidents occurred near distribution centers run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in southern Gaza. Witnesses reported that troops fired indiscriminately as people massed to receive aid, while the Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after suspects approached its forces. The GHF, which seeks to replace the UN's aid system, said the shootings happened far from its sites before they opened.</p>

          <h2>Gen Z Activists Promote 'Chastity' as a Countercultural Stance at the Jersey Shore</h2>

          <p>This article explores the efforts of Generation Life, a faith-based group of Gen Z activists who visit the Jersey shore to advocate for chastity before marriage. Framing their message as a "countercultural" response to modern dating and social media pressures, they engage with young people about love, relationships, and self-worth. The activists argue that chastity is not merely about abstinence but about seeing people for their whole selves, a message they believe resonates with a generation feeling the negative effects of a hyper-sexualized and superficial online culture. Their approach attempts to rebrand a traditional concept for a contemporary audience.</p>

          <p>As Japan heads into an election, far-right political parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are using rhetoric similar to Western populist movements, blaming foreigners for crime and social disruption. This sentiment is fueled by a surge in tourism from the weak yen and media reports on crimes committed by foreigners. While Japan faces severe labor shortages due to an aging population, these nationalist groups advocate for limiting foreign workers and preserving Japanese cultural purity.

          <p>A government report has concluded that the collapse of a five-story apartment building in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable." The investigation found that numerous red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored for up to a year before the tragedy in May 2024. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest, yet work continued. The Public Works Minister called for criminal accountability for the negligence that led to the disaster, as survivors and families continue to deal with trauma and financial hardship.</p>

Muncy, who was injured in a slide at third base on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings. Doctors told him he was extremely lucky to have avoided a more severe, season-ending injury. His return is highly anticipated by the team, whose offense has struggled significantly since the slugger was placed on the injured list.</p>

The team, which finished second at the time, was upgraded from silver after the winning US team was disqualified due to a doping admission by team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The British athletes—Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton—received their long-overdue medals in a ceremony at the London Diamond League meeting.

          <p>The US has revoked the visas of eight Brazilian supreme court judges in an escalation of pressure related to the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro. The move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targets the judge leading the coup investigation against Bolsonaro, Alexandre de Moraes, and his allies on the court. Brazil's President Lula condemned the action as unacceptable interference in the country's sovereignty. The sanctions follow an earlier US threat of 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, actions that critics say are an attempt to shield the Trump-allied Bolsonaro from facing justice.</p>
