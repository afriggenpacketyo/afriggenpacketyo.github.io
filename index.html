          <p>European equities experienced mixed trading as the UK economy reported zero growth in July, prompting considerations for the Bank of England's monetary policy. Corporate news included Sabadell's rejection of BBVA's takeover bid and Vestas Wind shares falling after the U.S. indicated it would not use offshore wind under the current administration. Investors are now keenly anticipating the U.S. Federal Reserve's next meeting, with strong expectations of a rate cut following recent inflation data, which could influence global markets. These developments paint a picture of an economy navigating various challenges and opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, detained in a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have returned home, sparking outrage and straining US-South Korea relations. This incident, which delayed the factory's opening by at least two months, has prompted South Korea's president and Hyundai's CEO to express significant concerns about future US investments. South Korea's foreign ministry has urged the US Congress to consider a new visa category for Korean firms to prevent similar disruptions, highlighting the need for diplomatic solutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, with a notable 1.3% contraction in manufacturing output. This economic flatlining adds considerable pressure on the government to boost growth ahead of the upcoming Autumn Budget, where significant potential tax hikes are widely anticipated. Economists now suggest a broader slowdown is expected in the latter half of 2025, with concerns about prolonged uncertainties potentially delaying crucial investment decisions across various sectors. This poses a challenge for the government's economic agenda.</p>

          <p>The UK economy's growth flatlined in July, primarily due to a contraction in production output, signaling an expected slowdown in the latter half of 2025.

The Bank of England faces a complex decision, balancing economic stagnation with persistent inflation, as it prepares for its upcoming monetary policy meetings.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the US industrial policy, aimed at containing China and reindustrializing, is undermined by its anti-immigrant policies, exemplified by the recent raid on a Hyundai-LG plant in Georgia. The author contends that the crackdown on undocumented workers, many of whom are skilled technicians, exposes a contradiction between the desire for domestic manufacturing and the available labor force. This approach risks hurting US and its allies while disrupting globalization and world trade. (not investment advice)</p>
