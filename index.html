          <h2>Small Businesses Advocate for Tariff Exemptions Amid Rising Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 18:28:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small businesses are seeking exemptions from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, arguing that they lack the financial resources to absorb rising costs and navigate complex supply chain changes. Senator Ed Markey has urged the Small Business Administration to protect these vulnerable enterprises, noting that larger corporations have already received tariff protections. Small business owners express concerns that the tariffs are jeopardizing their livelihoods, potentially forcing them to abandon orders and face significant financial losses, highlighting the disproportionate impact of trade policies on smaller entities. The tariffs, which include hikes on Chinese imports and reciprocal tariffs on trading partners, are defended by the Trump administration as measures to protect domestic manufacturing and foster economic growth.</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating violence in Kashmir, including a deadly attack on tourists, a look into the major militant groups operating in the region. These groups, though often banned in Pakistan, are alleged by Indian officials to receive support from Pakistani military intelligence. The groups aim to challenge Indian control over Kashmir and potentially merge the region with Pakistan, some with ties to global jihadist movements like the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The militant landscape is fluid, with groups frequently changing allegiances and sharing fighters, making it difficult to track and contain the insurgency. Groups such as The Resistance Front, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen, and Jaish-e-Mohammed are among the key players in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old man from Brooklyn, Sheldon John, was fatally stabbed on a No. 5 subway train in Manhattan following an argument with another man. The altercation began when one man stepped on the other's shoe, escalating into a physical fight. The assailant stabbed John multiple times, both on the train and on the platform of the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station. Responding officers found John unconscious with chest wounds, and he was later pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has revoked a Biden-era policy that limited subpoenas of journalists' phone records in criminal investigations, arguing that federal employees who leak sensitive information are engaging in potentially treasonous conduct. Bondi's memo asserts that the Justice Department will not tolerate disclosures undermining President Trump's policies or harming the American people. While acknowledging the importance of a free press, Bondi stated that the department would continue to employ procedural protections, but the Attorney General must approve efforts to question or arrest members of the news media. This decision follows concerns about leaks in the intelligence community and escalates attacks on the media by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing its decision to terminate visas for hundreds of foreign students, a move that had caused widespread fear and confusion across U.S. universities. The decision follows over 100 lawsuits filed by students who were abruptly stripped of their legal right to study in the U.S., many of whom had participated in political protests or had previous minor criminal charges. The Justice Department informed a federal court that immigration officials are working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students, and records would be restored in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS). While ICE maintains the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons, attorneys for the students hail the decision as a reprieve.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal status of Ahwar Sultan, an Ohio State University graduate student from India, whose F-1 student visa was revoked after his arrest at an anti-Israel protest. Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled that the administration must immediately return Sultan's visa and cannot modify his record solely based on his arrest, especially as the charges were dismissed and expunged. The lawsuit, brought by Sultan and Students for Justice in Palestine at OSU, names several high-ranking officials, including President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This decision follows a similar ruling in Georgia, where a judge ordered the reinstatement of 133 international students' visas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California regulators have proposed new rules to allow the testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks on public roads, potentially opening the door for companies to test autonomous technology on vehicles over 10,001 lbs. Currently, California is the only state with regulations explicitly banning such testing, although other states like Texas, Arizona, and Arkansas already permit it. The proposed regulations aim to enhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers and give the DMV more authority to apply incremental enforcement measures. The proposal is likely to face opposition from safety advocates and labor unions concerned about job losses and the safety of autonomous vehicles, especially given research showing higher fatality rates in collisions involving vehicles with higher front ends.</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Tommy Pham has been suspended and fined by MLB for making a crude gesture toward Angel fans after a fan touched him during a game. Pham, who has a history of contentious interactions with fans and other players, is appealing the suspension. The incident adds to a list of controversial moments in Pham's career, including a stabbing in 2020 and a suspension in 2022 for slapping Joc Pederson over a fantasy football dispute. Despite these incidents, Pham is recognized for his perseverance in overcoming a degenerative eye disease and for acts of sportsmanship, such as giving up an at-bat in the 2023 World Series.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved $160 billion by cutting wasteful spending, but an analysis suggests these actions may cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The Partnership for Public Service (PSP) estimates the costs stem from paid leave for federal employees, rehiring mistakenly fired workers, and lost productivity. The IRS, facing significant workforce cuts, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade. While DOGE defends its efforts, critics argue the cuts are creating waste and harming essential services like health and science research, potentially leading to economic losses and job cuts.</p>

          <p>Chelsea forward Cole Palmer's recent struggles on the pitch are attributed to mental factors by manager Enzo Maresca. Palmer, who scored 14 goals in his first 23 games, has gone 16 games without scoring despite having numerous chances. Maresca emphasizes that Palmer's tactical and technical abilities remain unchanged, but his confidence has been affected by the team's performance. Maresca believes Palmer is worried about helping the team and is struggling mentally, but remains confident that he will start scoring again soon.</p>

          <p>American consumers are beginning to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with Amazon sellers raising prices on nearly 1,000 products since April. The average price hike is nearly 30%, affecting items ranging from tech accessories to women's clothing. Other major e-commerce players, including Shein and Temu, have also increased prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. While some anticipate potential tariff reductions, uncertainty remains over the long-term impact on consumer prices and supply chains.</p>

Critics argue that the nonprofit's mission to ensure AI benefits all of humanity is incompatible with the for-profit model. They assert that selling control of OpenAI would violate the fiduciary duty owed to the nonprofit's beneficiaries, namely all of humanity. The Attorneys General of California and Delaware are being urged to intervene and prevent the restructuring, arguing that OpenAI's mission is priceless and cannot be sold.</p>

          <p>The FBI arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on felony charges of interfering with immigration agents, escalating the Trump administration's crackdown on local officials who oppose its deportation agenda. Dugan is accused of sending federal agents away and allowing an undocumented immigrant facing domestic violence charges to leave her courtroom through a non-public door. The arrest highlights the tension between federal immigration enforcement and local courts, as local officials argue that immigrants won't attend court if they fear deportation.
