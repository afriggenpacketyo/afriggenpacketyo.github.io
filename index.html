            <p>Severe storms sweeping across the US Midwest and South have resulted in at least 20 fatalities across multiple states, including Tennessee, Missouri, and Kentucky, with children and elderly people among the victims. The storms brought flash flooding and tornado damage, causing rivers to swell and prompting warnings of major flood stages from the National Weather Service. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in some areas, and the storm system is expected to move towards the southeast Atlantic coast. The situation has been described as the worst flooding in decades by some residents, with continuous rainfall exacerbating the crisis.</p>

            <p>A soccer coach in the San Fernando Valley has been charged with murder after a 13-year-old boy on his team, Oscar Omar Hernandez, was found dead after being reported missing.

            <p>Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the sole woman on NATO's military committee, was reportedly fired by the Trump administration due to comments supporting diversity in the force. Officials believe Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made the decision following pressure to remove leaders promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. Chatfield's dismissal has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it weakens alliances and undermines the position of decorated military officials. The move aligns with a broader effort to eliminate DEI programs and content within the military.</p>

            <p>New Mexico has enacted a “turquoise alert” system to aid in the search for missing Native Americans, addressing the disproportionately high rates of disappearances and killings within these communities.

This legislation aims to ensure that Indigenous people receive the protection they deserve and rectifies the historical oversight of Native women and girls' cases.

Free resources like Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites and the IRS's Direct File program can assist taxpayers in navigating these options.

            <p>President Trump's implementation of "reciprocal" tariffs has created a climate of economic uncertainty, prompting various nations to respond with different strategies. Some countries are attempting to negotiate with the White House to avoid the tariffs, while others, like China, are retaliating with their own tariffs. Trump's actions have sparked concerns among allies and within Congress, raising questions about whether his strategy is a negotiating tactic or a long-term plan to restructure the global economy.

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can use a wartime law to deport alleged members of foreign crime gangs, but only if they are given the opportunity to challenge the government's claims.

Abrego Garcia's deportation was attributed to an "administrative error," but the administration opposes his return due to alleged gang affiliation.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has supported the Trump administration's efforts to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members, overturning a lower court order that had prevented the deportations.

However, the order also mandates judicial review for those facing deportation under the Alien Enemies Act.
