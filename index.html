          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba affirmed Japan's commitment to advocating for the removal of U.S. tariffs. Ishiba emphasized that this stance remains unchanged, despite recent geopolitical events. He plans to address Japan's position on this matter at the upcoming G7 summit in Canada, highlighting Japan's reliance on crude oil from various countries, including the U.S. This move underscores Japan's continued efforts to foster stable economic relations amid global tensions. The prime minister's remarks come as resource-poor Japan seeks to balance its diplomatic approach between its close security ally, the United States, and other Middle Eastern nations. Optimism surrounding the resolution of tariff disputes remains cautious. </p>

          <p>A second federal judge has halted further aspects of President Trump's executive order concerning voting regulations. Judge Denise Casper affirmed the pause on requiring documentary proof of citizenship for national voter registration. Casper also blocked a provision that would prevent states from counting mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day but received afterward, citing the Constitution's grant of election rule-setting power to states, not the president. This decision follows concerns from Democratic attorneys general who argued the order was unconstitutional and would create chaos by forcing states to rapidly implement new election procedures. The ruling also blocked provisions affecting overseas voters, including military members, who would have faced new requirements for registration and absentee voting. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores whether opening a $10,000 high-yield savings account remains a worthwhile financial move in the current economic climate. While interest rates are still relatively high compared to traditional savings accounts, experts anticipate potential rate cuts later in the year. High-yield savings accounts offer accessibility to funds, unlike certificates of deposit (CDs), but CDs generally provide greater interest-earning potential due to fixed rates and compounding interest. The decision to invest in a high-yield savings account depends on individual financial priorities and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that young women, primarily from Africa, are being exploited in Russia's war factories under the Alabuga Start program. Recruited with promises of well-paid careers, many find themselves assembling cheap drones under poor conditions in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone. Participants report being turned into hard laborers with low wages, exposed to dangerous chemicals, and assigned to drone assembly instead of the promised logistics or service roles. Parents in countries like Zimbabwe express concern over their daughters' forced labor and withheld passports, while Interpol investigates potential human trafficking in Botswana. This exploitation highlights labor shortages in Russia and the vulnerability of migrant workers from the Global South. </p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a downturn and oil prices rose sharply following Israel's military strike on Iran. The attack, targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and military personnel, prompted concerns about potential disruptions to global energy supplies. Analysts suggest that the primary risk to the global economy stems from higher oil prices, particularly if Iran attempts to block the Strait of Hormuz. While Iranian crude exports are already restricted by sanctions, a sustained increase in energy prices could hinder progress in lowering U.S. inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven men have been convicted of sexually exploiting two teenage girls in Rochdale over a five-year period. The girls, groomed from the age of 13, were subjected to repeated sexual assault and treated as "sex slaves." The men, who worked on the town's market or as taxi drivers, plied the girls with drugs, alcohol, and places to stay. The victims reported that police and social workers were aware of the situation but failed to take adequate action. </p>

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, questions arise about Hezbollah's restrained response and its ability to assist Iran. Despite being Iran's best-equipped militia group in the region, Hezbollah issued a statement condemning the attack but did not offer to join in retaliation. Analysts suggest that Hezbollah may be too weak due to major losses in the previous year's war with Israel, or it could be prioritizing internal restructuring. The situation raises concerns about Iran's ability to retaliate from Lebanon and the growing pressure on Hezbollah within Lebanon. </p>

However, some experts question the environmental costs of large-scale fish farming in the desert. The farm uses groundwater, a nonrenewable resource, raising concerns about its sustainability. </p>
