            <p>Former Kent State coach Kenni Burns was fired after an independent investigation revealed he took over $100,000 in loans from a school booster, who was also a vendor. The loans began in 2023 after Burns claimed his house flooded and he was struggling financially, and he paid them off over 14 months without any evidence of interest payments. The loans may have violated state ethics laws, which prohibit state employees from receiving benefits from boosters. Burns had a poor record as head coach, going 1-23, and Kent State currently holds the longest losing streak in NCAA Division I football.</p>

            <p>In La Valencia, Ecuador, at least five gunmen disguised as soldiers opened fire on spectators at a cockfight, resulting in the deaths of 12 unarmed individuals and several injuries. The attackers, believed to be part of the "Los R7" organized criminal group, used automatic rifles and wore replica military uniforms, a tactic commonly employed by criminal gangs in Ecuador. Security footage captured the chaotic scene as spectators sought cover, and police later recovered discarded uniforms, weapons, and cash from the scene. Ecuador is currently grappling with a surge in violence due to transnational cartels vying for control of drug trafficking routes.</p>

            <p>In the trial of Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, a judge ruled that a former roommate can testify about seeing an intruder with "bushy eyebrows" around the time of the crime. The defense argued the testimony was unreliable, but the judge stated it's a matter for cross-examination. The judge also ruled that Kohberger's defense can't use his medical diagnoses to explain his courtroom demeanor unless he testifies. Kohberger is charged with the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has declined to its lowest point amid widespread dissatisfaction with his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey revealed that the post-reelection economic optimism has waned, with more Americans anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic stock market outlook. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become increasingly negative. Key issues driving disapproval include tariffs, inflation, and federal government spending, though immigration remains a strong point.</p>

While the U.S. emphasizes that all options remain on the table to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, these talks represent a historic moment considering the decades of strained relations between the two nations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The survey identifies booking NHS appointments as the most frustrating, but also points to issues with local council services, energy suppliers, and other private sector entities. This frustration is seen as having a political dimension, potentially driving voters towards parties promising radical change.

            <p>The White House claims that a letter sent to Harvard University with a list of demands was an "unauthorized" mistake, according to the New York Times. The letter, which demanded the elimination of DEI programs and screening of international students, was signed by three federal officials. Harvard has rejected the demands, leading to a public dispute and the potential freezing of federal funding. The situation remains unclear as differing accounts emerge about the letter's handling.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced a step toward making thousands of federal workers easier to fire by stripping them of civil service protections and reclassifying them as "at-will" employees. The new "Schedule Policy/Career" classification will affect about 50,000 federal workers who work on policy matters. Trump stated that these workers must advance the policy interests of the President and should be fired if they refuse or engage in corrupt behavior. The change will require an executive order after OPM issues a final rule.</p>

            <p>The article argues that the new populism is driven not by poverty, but by wealth and financial security, leading to a more selfish outlook focused on individual freedom and lower taxes. This shift has resulted in a new social contract where affluent voters prioritize their own interests over those of the less fortunate. Academics have found that financial security reduces risk aversion, making voters more tolerant of radical right policies. The piece suggests that younger generations, with higher education levels, are less likely to support this trend.</p>
