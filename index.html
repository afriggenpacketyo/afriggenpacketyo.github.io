          <p>A 30-year-old man, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, has been charged with multiple counts of second-degree murder after a vehicle was deliberately driven into a crowd at a Filipino cultural festival in Vancouver, resulting in 11 deaths and numerous injuries. Police have ruled out terrorism as a motive, citing the suspect's history of mental health issues. The incident occurred at the annual Lapu Lapu festival, deeply impacting Vancouver's Filipino community, with organizers expressing profound grief and confusion, and the city's acting police chief calling it the "darkest day" in Vancouver's history.</p>

European officials, attending IMF meetings, expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's trade policies, which they believe could attract investors to European assets. Valdis Dombrovskis, a European commissioner, highlighted the stability, predictability, and respect for the rule of law within the trade bloc as strengths that are already drawing stronger investor interest in Euro-denominated assets.</p>

Homan argued that the mother chose to take the child with her, and that having a U.S. citizen child does not exempt individuals from immigration laws. Homan claimed he was unaware that one of the children deported had Stage 4 cancer.</p>

This statement followed Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy at the Vatican, and contradicts Zelenskyy's firm stance on the issue. Leaked peace plans indicate the U.S. may be proposing that Moscow retain captured territory, including Crimea, a proposal criticized by Germany as a capitulation. Trump also expressed newfound sympathy for Zelenskyy and claimed progress in trade talks with China, despite denials from Chinese officials.</p>

Repowering offers economic benefits, including increased electricity output and longer lifecycles, but faces challenges like permitting processes and public opposition.

          <p>While some big tech companies are pausing planned data center projects, the AI data center market is not going bust but experiencing a strategic reallocation amid strong demand. Companies like Amazon and Nvidia reaffirm the market's strength, but factors like China's DeepSeek, President Trump's AI initiative, and tariff concerns are prompting a temporary pause. Power proximity is driving the marketplace, with data center builders seeking areas with access to plentiful power, and long-term enterprise adoption will continue to fuel demand for the next decade.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted over 800 strikes in Yemen as part of an ongoing air campaign against the Houthi militia, targeting command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, and weapons manufacturing sites. These strikes, part of Operation Rough Rider, have targeted antiship ballistic and cruise missiles used by the Houthis against ships in the Red Sea. The campaign's cost is estimated to be over $1 billion, raising concerns among strategic planners about the rapid rate of munitions usage.</p>
