          <p>Demonstrations regarding the housing of asylum seekers in hotels have taken place in multiple locations across the United Kingdom, including England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The protests, which call for an end to this practice, were frequently met by anti-racism counter-demonstrations, leading to police intervention to keep the opposing groups separated. These events follow a recent High Court ruling that blocked one hotel in Essex from being used for this purpose, prompting other local authorities to consider similar legal challenges. The government has stated its commitment to closing asylum hotels, though figures show the number of people housed in them has increased over the past year.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lieutenant General Jeffery Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The dismissal comes shortly after the White House publicly contradicted a leaked DIA report which assessed that American strikes had only minimally set back Iran's nuclear program. President Trump had declared the strikes a major success, and the White House called the agency's assessment "flat out wrong." The move is seen by critics, such as Senator Mark Warner, as part of a pattern of removing officials whose analyses conflict with the president's political narrative.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that the country's extensive social welfare system can no longer be financed by its economic output, signaling a need for significant reform. Speaking at a party conference, Merz called for cuts to social spending while simultaneously ruling out any tax increases on medium-sized businesses under his leadership. His comments create potential friction within the government's coalition, as his Social Democrat partners have expressed a need for imaginative solutions beyond simple cuts. The debate highlights the growing fiscal pressures and political divisions over Germany's economic future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Scottish women's rugby team secured a decisive victory over Wales in their World Cup opening match, winning with a record 30-point margin despite recent off-field turmoil regarding player contracts. In front of a record crowd in Salford, Scotland delivered a powerful performance, with Francesca McGhie scoring a hat-trick. Wales struggled throughout the game, unable to match Scotland's intensity and execution in almost every aspect of play. The surprising result sets a positive tone for Scotland's tournament campaign while leaving Wales to regroup before their next match against Canada.</p>

While the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new all-time high, the tech-heavy Nasdaq finished the week with a loss, as lower borrowing costs are seen as less impactful for large tech firms whose growth is more tied to AI development.

Ábrego García was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March before being returned to the U.S. to face trial.

This warm spell is attributed to tropical air being pushed towards the UK by the remnants of Hurricane Erin. The pleasant weather is expected for major events like the Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festival. However, the warmth will be short-lived, as the storm system is predicted to bring more unsettled and cooler weather with wind and rain starting from Tuesday.

Civil society groups had campaigned for decades for the change, which was initially approved in 2020 but delayed by lawsuits from residents.

The incident highlights the growing risk of such events in regions where glaciers are rapidly retreating due to climate change.

This marks the 31st eruptive event since December, with the activity currently contained and posing no threat to nearby homes. The spectacle is visible from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, attracting visitors and online viewers to the U.S. Geological Survey's popular livestreams. Scientists are continuously monitoring the volcano, as the pattern of frequent, episodic eruptions could potentially shift to a more continuous flow in the future.</p>

          <p>Multiple national postal services across Europe and in India have announced the temporary suspension of package shipments to the United States. The halt is a response to new U.S. import duties, set to take effect on August 29, which will apply tariffs to international goods previously exempt if valued under $800. Postal operators cite a lack of clarity on the new rules and insufficient time to update their systems to collect and remit the duties as required. The disruption affects commercial goods, causing significant uncertainty for businesses and consumers involved in transatlantic e-commerce.</p>

          <p>Israeli military operations in Gaza on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 25 people, including those sheltering in tents and seeking aid. This comes as the world's leading authority on food crises officially declared that famine is now present in Gaza's largest city. The famine determination has intensified international calls for Israel to halt its offensive and allow more humanitarian aid into the territory. Israel has denounced the famine report as a lie and is continuing preparations for a major operation in Gaza City, while ceasefire negotiations remain stalled.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a controversial Republican-led redistricting bill, sending the measure to Governor Greg Abbott, who has pledged to sign it swiftly. The bill, which aims to redraw the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, was approved after a heated debate and a previous weekslong standoff in the House. This unusual mid-decade redistricting effort was encouraged by President Trump to bolster Republican chances in the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have strongly opposed the map, arguing it dilutes minority voting power and have vowed to challenge its legality in court.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were both denied parole this week after separate hearings that provided insight into their decades behind bars for the 1989 murders of their parents. Parole commissioners cited the brothers' prison behavior, rather than the original crime, as a primary reason for the denials. The hearings revealed that both had engaged in rule-breaking, including possessing contraband mobile phones, with Erik also involved in fights and a tax-fraud scam. While both expressed remorse for the killings, the boards concluded they still struggled with anti-social traits that made them unsuitable for release.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has found that users on Roblox, a massively popular gaming platform with a large youth audience, are able to bypass moderation to spread hate speech. In a popular game called "Spray Paint!", players were observed creating graffiti of swastikas and racist slurs targeting minority groups. While Roblox has a 24/7 moderation system and chat filters, players can circumvent these by creating the prohibited content as in-game art. The findings raise serious concerns about child safety on the platform, which is currently facing multiple lawsuits over inappropriate content and exposure to predators.</p>

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has been ranked as the top public college in the U.S. for providing the best return on investment, according to The Princeton Review. The ranking considers factors such as academics, financial aid, college costs, and post-graduation salary data. Georgia Tech's strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields contributes to the high median earnings of its alumni. The report highlights that while sticker price is a factor, the best value often comes from schools that provide significant aid and lead to successful careers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, a woman sentenced to 31 months in prison for inciting racial hatred, has been released and claims she was made a "political prisoner" of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Connolly was jailed for a social media post calling for people to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers following a violent attack in Southport in 2024. In an interview after her release, she criticized the prime minister, a former human rights lawyer, for his stance on her case. The Crown Prosecution Service maintains that inciting racial hatred is a criminal offense not protected by freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>A restaurateur who had lost movement in his left arm and leg after a stroke has seen significant improvement thanks to a new medical device. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. For patient Tommy Fello, whose progress had plateaued with traditional therapy, the implant has helped reduce pain and restore function. This first-of-its-kind technology is offering new hope for stroke survivors who struggle to regain motor skills months or even years after their initial injury.</p>

The administration has used threats of withholding federal research grants to force universities to comply with its agenda, particularly regarding criticism of Israel.

          <p>A new state report has found alarming levels of PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in the blood of individuals living and working near Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico. The contamination is linked to Pfas-laden firefighting foam used at the base, which has polluted local drinking water sources. Blood levels in the affected population were approximately 10 times higher than in those outside the contaminated zone, raising significant health concerns. The findings provide stark evidence of the harm caused by the military's pollution and intensify the state's legal battle to compel the Air Force to address the toxic plume.</p>
