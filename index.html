          <p>President Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia, marking the start of his four-day tour through the Gulf, his first major overseas trip of his second term. He aims to secure business deals worth over $1 trillion with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, focusing on investments in artificial intelligence, energy, and arms purchases. The trip is under scrutiny due to the Trump family's pending deals with Saudi-owned real estate firms, a UAE cryptocurrency deal, and a Qatari-backed golf project. The article notes the ethical concerns surrounding the potential donation of a luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One. Relevant context includes the history of Trump's relationships with these nations and the potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has banned the far-right group "Kingdom of Germany," a faction of the "ReichsbÃ¼rger" movement, accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state." Police raids were conducted, resulting in arrests, including the group's self-declared monarch. Dobrindt stated that the group undermined the rule of law and used antisemitic conspiracy narratives. The group, with around 6,000 members, denies the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic, and the ban includes associated splinter groups. The article also references a previous plot to overthrow the German government uncovered in 2022.</p>

          <p>Honda Motor is facing significant financial headwinds, including a 76% plunge in operating profit for the latest quarter. Currency exchange rate fluctuations are expected to further reduce profits by 452 billion yen. Additionally, Honda is delaying the construction of an electric vehicle plant in Canada due to a slowdown in demand. These challenges come amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., which has imposed tariffs on foreign automobile imports. Back in February, Honda and rival Nissan terminated talks over a $60 billion merger.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling. Wage growth has slowed but remains faster than inflation, while job vacancies have also decreased. The Office for National Statistics has cautioned that the unemployment figures should be treated with caution due to low response rates. Increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage in April are believed to have impacted recruitment. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates but is monitoring wage growth closely due to concerns about inflationary pressures.</p>

          <p>Cities worldwide are exploring public transportation as a means to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and carbon emissions.

Cities like Jakarta are improving bus services and infrastructure to encourage public transport use.

          <p>A power struggle between President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. and Vice-President Sara Duterte has resumed in the Philippines. The mid-term election results were not favorable for the Marcos camp, potentially weakening his administration's authority. The Marcos-Duterte relationship has deteriorated, with President Marcos sending Sara's father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, to the International Criminal Court to face charges. Impeachment proceedings against Sara Duterte are a key point of contention.</p>
