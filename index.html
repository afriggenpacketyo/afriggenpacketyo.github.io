          <p>A former student launched an attack at Switzer Learning Center in Torrance, California, stabbing three staff members and attempting to injure a fourth before fleeing. Upon his arrest, the suspect disclosed planting two pipe bombs, which were subsequently located and safely disarmed by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Bomb Squad. Two victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, and a third received immediate treatment at the scene. Authorities have confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public, though the investigation into the assailant's identity and motive remains active. This incident highlights the critical need for swift emergency response and effective threat neutralization in school environments.</p>

          <p>China has sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, causing an 8% drop in its shares. Beijing accused these entities of assisting U.S. government probes and measures against China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors, expressing strong dissatisfaction. The sanctions, effective immediately, prohibit Chinese organizations and individuals from doing business with the listed companies. This action follows the U.S. imposing steep fees on Chinese ships, to which China retaliated with similar charges on American vessels, escalating trade tensions between the two economic powers. The broader context includes Beijing's new rare earths export restrictions and expanded U.S. company blacklist.</p>

          <p>A spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), revealed that two UK government schemes designed to insulate homes and cut energy use were severely botched, leaving tens of thousands of properties in need of repair. The report found that 98% of homes with external wall insulation and nearly a third with internal insulation have problems that could lead to damp and mold. Energy Consumer Minister Martin McCluskey acknowledged the "unacceptable, systemic failings" and promised comprehensive reforms, assuring that affected homes would be fixed at no cost to consumers. The NAO cited an "under-skilled workforce" and businesses cutting corners as key reasons for the substandard work, with potential fraud claims totaling millions.</p>

          <p>The UK experienced a slight slowdown in wage growth over the summer, with annual earnings increasing by 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% previously. Concurrently, the national unemployment rate saw a minor uptick to 4.8% in August from 4.7% in July, primarily driven by younger individuals. While private sector earnings growth was the lowest in four years, it still outpaced inflation, offering some relief to workers. Public sector wage growth was higher at 6%, influenced by earlier pay rises compared to the previous year. The Office for National Statistics noted that the unemployment figures should be interpreted with caution due to ongoing data quality concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

Subsequently, the upper stage performed a planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy praised the achievement as a major step toward landing Americans on the Moon, underscoring the continuous progress in the Artemis program and Starship's evolving capabilities for future space exploration.</p>

Under-21s manager Lee Carsley has also highlighted the need for more orthodox number nines.

His call comes as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its previous stance against routine screening. A report by Prostate Cancer Research, for which Sunak is an ambassador, estimates a targeted program for high-risk men (45-69 with family history, and Black men) would cost £25 million annually, similar to other cancer screenings. While some medical experts express skepticism due to risks of overtreatment and side effects, Sunak argues that advancements like MRI scans make the program more reliable and timely.</p>

          <p>European politicians are grappling with what they describe as a "three-body problem," a term borrowed from Chinese science fiction, to characterize the current chaotic global order. They face simultaneous challenges: the U.S. undermining the global order it created, China weaponizing critical minerals to impede European industry, and Russia waging war on the EU's borders. This confluence of unpredictable forces creates extreme instability, leading officials to believe the problem is not solvable but merely survivable. The analogy reflects a deep sense of geopolitical uncertainty and the urgent need for Europe to forge a new, stable trajectory amidst collapsing traditional alliances and escalating international tensions.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Falcons defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-14, handing the Bills their second consecutive loss, largely due to Bijan Robinson's career-high 170 rushing yards, including an 81-yard touchdown run. Falcons coach Raheem Morris lauded Robinson as the "best player in football" after his 238 yards from scrimmage. In the second Monday Night Football game, the Chicago Bears secured a 25-24 victory over the Washington Commanders with a game-winning 38-yard field goal from newly signed kicker Jake Moody. Both games provided late-game drama, with the Falcons defense notably containing Josh Allen, and Caleb Williams leading the Bears to their third consecutive win.</p>

          <p>A helicopter crashed in Huntington Beach, California, injuring five people, including a child, who were subsequently hospitalized. The aircraft spun multiple times before colliding with palm trees and a pedestrian bridge near a parking lot. Both occupants of the helicopter were safely extricated from the wreckage, and three pedestrians on the ground also suffered injuries. The crash scattered debris widely, with the tail section of the Bell 222 aircraft breaking off. Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board officials are investigating the cause of the incident, which occurred during an "exclusive helicopter landing party" event, although event organizers confirmed the main event would proceed.</p>

          <p>Tina, a 59-year-old woman, found a transformative new way to communicate through British Sign Language (BSL) after a traumatic brain injury in 2018 left her struggling with speech. Her inspiring journey, featured in a BBC series, illustrates how BSL helped her express words she could no longer speak, significantly boosting her confidence. Tina and her husband, Mark, who now teaches BSL, moved to a retirement village for enhanced support and participated in a program led by deaf celebrity Rose Ayling-Ellis. Tina's achievement of a Level 1 BSL qualification underscores how visual sign language can profoundly improve lives, particularly for individuals facing communication challenges or hearing loss.</p>

These discussions were held under a bilateral economic and trade consultation mechanism established earlier in the year. The talks occurred after U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that Beijing's expansion of rare earth export controls had surprised the U.S. and that China had refused to discuss the matter, highlighting the complex and often contradictory nature of current U.S.-China relations.</p>

Manufacturing and construction sectors saw softened growth, while global AI investment is expected to support manufacturing.
