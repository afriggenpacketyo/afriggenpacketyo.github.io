          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 22:07:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a major trade agreement, which President Trump described as "massive." The deal establishes a new 15% tariff on Japanese exports, notably lowering the duty on automobiles from the current 25% rate. In a significant move, Japan has also committed to investing $550 billion into the U.S. and will open its domestic markets to a wider range of American goods, including vehicles and key agricultural products. This agreement, reached after a period of intense negotiations, is expected to create hundreds of thousands of American jobs and has already caused a surge in Japanese automaker stocks.

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams secured a landmark victory at the DC Open, becoming the second-oldest woman in the professional era to win a tour-level singles match. At 45 years old, Williams defeated Peyton Stearns, an opponent 22 years her junior, in straight sets, marking her first singles win in nearly two years. The victory represents a significant comeback for the former world number one, who had been listed as inactive after undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids. Williams' performance, highlighted by her signature powerful serves and groundstrokes, was met with overwhelmingly enthusiastic support from the crowd in Washington.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Automaker Stocks Surge Following US Tariff Reduction Announcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 21:58:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following the announcement of a reduced U.S. tariff rate on their products. The new 15% tariff on automobiles, down from 25%, provided immediate relief to Japan's cornerstone auto industry, which had seen exports to the U.S. decline sharply in recent months. Toyota's stock jumped nearly 12%, while others like Mazda saw gains of over 17%, reflecting market optimism and relief from previous uncertainty. Analysts noted that while the news is a welcome short-term boost, the industry still faces long-term competitive challenges from other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family has accused Castle Hill Hospital in the UK of a cover-up after their father died following a heart procedure, alleging the hospital issued two different death certificates to conceal a medical error. An unpublished review, seen by the BBC, reportedly found that the patient received "very poor care" and that the second death certificate inaccurately described the cause of death by omitting reference to the failed operation. This case is part of a broader police investigation into multiple deaths following the same TAVI heart procedure at the hospital, where the mortality rate for the operation is reportedly above the national average.</p>

          <p>A professional violinist from Worcestershire, UK, has spoken out about her experience with cyberflashing and the subsequent lack of police action, which made her feel like a "nuisance." Anna Downes reported receiving unsolicited pornographic images from a fellow musician, a crime that took nearly six months to result in an arrest and conviction. She stated that she felt forced to investigate the crime herself due to jurisdictional delays and a perceived lack of seriousness from law enforcement. Her story highlights the challenges victims of online harassment can face in seeking justice, even after new laws have been enacted to criminalize such behavior.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed its national governing bodies to comply with a presidential executive order, effectively barring transgender women from competing in women's sports. The new policy cites an "obligation to comply with federal expectations" outlined in the order titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," which threatens to rescind funding from non-compliant organizations. This move aligns the USOPC with a similar policy change made by the NCAA and has drawn condemnation from civil rights groups like the National Women's Law Center. The decision shifts eligibility rule-making and could impact athletes from the grassroots to the elite level across numerous sports.</p>

The dam is projected to generate three times more energy than the Three Gorges Dam, with an estimated annual capacity of 300 billion kilowatt-hours. The project, first announced in 2020 and authorized in late 2024, is a critical part of China's strategy to exploit the region's hydropower potential.

          <p>A commentary piece from the Los Angeles Times frames recent events as part of a broader trend of capitulation to the Trump administration. The article connects the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" by Paramount, which is seeking federal approval for a merger, with the House GOP's move to recess early to avoid a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein documents. It argues these actions demonstrate a fear of political repercussions from the White House, with institutions choosing to become innocuous to avoid being targeted. The author suggests that this perceived appeasement is a defining, and troubling, characteristic of the current political climate.</p>

The haunting photo raised widespread awareness about the dangers of neglected fire escapes.

In a rare and direct rebuttal, Obama's office called the claims "outrageous," "ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction." The statement affirmed the widely accepted intelligence conclusion that Russia worked to influence the election, a finding also supported by a 2020 bipartisan Senate report led by then-Chairman Marco Rubio.</p>

One month after the attack, which Iran calls a "war crime," families of political prisoners say the new locations are severely overcrowded, lack basic hygiene, and are infested with insects. Prisoners also report being housed with those convicted of violent crimes, a tactic rights groups say is used for intimidation. Amnesty International has called for a criminal investigation into the initial airstrike, stating there is no credible evidence that the prison was a lawful military objective.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will be raising the prices of its candy products by a "low double-digit" percentage to combat the unprecedented cost of cocoa. The price hike will affect brands across its confection portfolio, including Hershey Kisses, Reese's, and KitKat. The company attributes the change directly to a global cocoa shortage, driven by disease and poor weather in West Africa, which has caused commodity prices to skyrocket. In response, Hershey also plans to focus more on its non-chocolate products, such as sweets and salty snacks, to diversify its offerings and mitigate the impact of volatile cocoa markets.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is deliberately purging women from the highest ranks of the U.S. military. The article points to the recent reassignments of several top female officers, including the first female head of the U.S. Naval Academy and the first female Chief of Naval Operations, as evidence of a pattern. It cites the writings of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who has expressed views against what he calls "social engineering" in the military. The author contends that these actions send a chilling message that women are not welcome in leadership, despite the military's reliance on them to meet recruiting goals.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges in New Jersey has declined to permanently appoint Alina Habba, a defense lawyer for Donald Trump, as the state's U.S. Attorney, effectively ending her tenure. Habba's interim appointment expired after 120 days without a permanent confirmation. The decision was followed by a contentious response from the Justice Department, which then removed Habba's replacement, a career prosecutor. Habba's time in the role was marked by criticism from Democratic senators over her lack of prosecutorial experience and for pursuing what they called politically-motivated actions, such as creating an "Election Integrity Task Force."</p>

Residents claim the area is losing its character and utility for locals, as essential businesses like grocers and butchers are replaced by stores selling souvenirs. The number of international visitors to the city has grown by a million per year over the past decade, increasing pressure on housing and infrastructure. While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs, locals feel the balance has tipped too far, making the Old Town feel less like a residential community.</p>

However, the company is struggling to meet its initial deployment milestones, which require launching hundreds of satellites by 2025.
