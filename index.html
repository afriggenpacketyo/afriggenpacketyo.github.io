          <p>General Motors plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, shifting production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox from Mexico to the U.S. This move is influenced by the Trump administration's tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The investment will enable GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the U.S. by 2027. GM's CEO, Mary Barra, emphasized the company's commitment to American innovation, manufacturing expertise, and job support, aiming to provide customers with a wide range of vehicle choices.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles experienced several days of demonstrations protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, which began after federal agents executed search warrants at businesses suspected of unlawfully employing undocumented immigrants. The protests escalated when President Trump deployed the National Guard, leading to clashes between protesters and police, with solidarity protests emerging in other cities. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized the raids, while Governor Newsom filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the National Guard deployment. Demonstrators protested ICE activity, denouncing the federal response and new travel ban, while SEIU held a rally supporting a union leader arrested during the protests.</p>

          <p>A woman in California, Sadie Novotny, is suing Costco for over $14 million after a heavy liquor cabinet display allegedly fell on her at a Santa Rosa store, causing a traumatic brain injury.

Novotny seeks compensation for pain, suffering, emotional distress, medical expenses, and lost wages, while her attorney claims Costco refused to share video footage of the incident.

          <p>Demonstrations have arisen in Los Angeles over immigration-enforcement operations by federal agents and are beginning to spread to other cities, which appear to be the first mass movement against the second Trump administration. Some worry these protests will bring about disaster, citing the potential for violence and concerns about protesters carrying Mexican flags. However, the existence of large demonstrations is itself a sign of Trump’s vulnerability, with his turn to the military to try to enforce his will indicating his weak sway over the public. Trump reversed his family-separation policy in summer 2018 because of widespread horror.</p>

Huckabee's remarks contrast with the long-held international backing for a two-state solution and align with positions frequently taken by ultranationalist groups in Israel.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to promptly block President Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles. The lawsuit argues that Trump broke the law by federalizing the California National Guard without Newsom's consent. Trump defends the deployment, citing the scale of protests against ICE operations, while Newsom argues that the unrest does not warrant such action. The lawsuit claims Trump's actions are stoking more fear and civil unrest in Los Angeles.</p>
