          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has announced an end to its decades-long armed conflict with Turkey, initiating a disarmament process. This move, which includes demands for the release of leader Abdullah Ocalan and legal reforms, presents a significant opportunity for peace after a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives. While Turkey's government remains cautious, a successful resolution could enhance its stability and improve relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria. The process is seen as a pivotal step that could positively alter Turkey's geopolitical standing in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Construction workers installing a water pipeline in the historic harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, have discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found buried approximately 30 inches beneath the seabed in the city's Old Town, a location famous as a filming site for "Game of Thrones." Marine archaeologists have confirmed the ship's age through radiocarbon dating and are now working to protect the wreck for further examination. This discovery adds to a series of recent maritime archaeological finds across Europe.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging business climate in China, high-end hotels are adopting unconventional strategies to survive, including selling street food. For example, a five-star hotel in Changzhou is now offering affordable boxed meals, featuring popular night market dishes prepared by its catering team. This pivot from expensive banquets to budget-friendly options reflects a broader trend of businesses adapting to shifting consumer behavior and economic pressures. The move highlights the necessity for even luxury brands to prioritize survival and meet customers where they are.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) and the UK Health Secretary are scheduled to meet next week in an attempt to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The dispute centers on pay, with doctors arguing that a proposed 5.4% increase is insufficient to restore real-terms pay levels from 2008. The government has stated it cannot improve the offer, while the BMA insists the strike will proceed without a credible new proposal. Public support for the strikes has reportedly declined, adding pressure to the negotiations.</p>

          <p>On the 40th anniversary of Live Aid, the monumental 1985 benefit concert is remembered as a landmark event in global broadcasting and fundraising for famine relief in Ethiopia. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, it united billions of viewers and featured iconic performances from music legends. However, retrospective analysis highlights significant flaws, including a lack of African performers and female representation, and criticism of perpetuating a "white savior" narrative. Despite these critiques, the event's impact on charity concerts and its ability to place humanitarian issues on the global political agenda remain undeniable.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all recording their warmest day of 2025 on Saturday. Temperatures peaked at 33.1C in Herefordshire, England, prompting amber heat health alerts across southern and eastern regions. The hot weather has led to hosepipe bans for millions and warnings of extreme wildfire risk in Scotland. The Met Office forecasts that the heatwave will break on Monday, bringing cooler temperatures and much-needed rain to many parts of the country.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing the impact of two large Chinese dams on the Brahmaputra River suggests they may alleviate, rather than worsen, dry-season water shortages in downstream India. Contrary to fears that China's dam-building activities in Tibet could trigger droughts, the research found that low-flow water levels in February increased by over 50 percent. The data, collected since 2014, indicates that regulated water release from the dams significantly boosts river flow throughout the dry season. This finding provides a new perspective on the contentious issue of transboundary water management between the two nations.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied entry, Florida lawmakers toured the controversial new migrant detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for access, described the conditions as "appalling," citing extreme heat in the medical area and claims that detainees' drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site found the conditions satisfactory, with one senator calling the beds comfortable. The visit follows claims from detainees of inhumane conditions, which state officials have repeatedly denied.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. Mexico's president called the plan an "unfair deal," while the EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, warned of "proportionate countermeasures" if the tariffs are implemented. President Trump has stated that he will escalate the tariffs further if either trading partner retaliates. The move marks a significant escalation in trade tensions, undermining ongoing negotiations and drawing sharp disapproval from leaders of key U.S. allies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly supported Attorney General Pam Bondi following internal disputes over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation records. Tensions flared after the DOJ and FBI announced they would not release additional files and that a rumored "client list" never existed, disappointing many of the president's supporters. The decision reportedly led to a confrontation between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. In a social media post, Trump defended Bondi, urged unity within his movement, and dismissed the Epstein case as something "nobody cares about."</p>
