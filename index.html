          <p>Michail Chkhikvishvili, the leader of an eastern European neo-Nazi group, has been extradited to the United States from Moldova to face charges related to a terrorism plot. He allegedly instructed an undercover FBI agent to dress as Santa Claus and distribute poisoned candy to Jewish children and racial minorities in Brooklyn. Chkhikvishvili, also known as ‚ÄúCommander Butcher,‚Äù is the leader of the Maniac Murder Cult, an international extremist group that promotes violence against racial minorities and the Jewish community.

          <p>Boeing has reached a $1.1 billion deal with the Department of Justice to avoid criminal prosecution for the two 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. The agreement requires Boeing to invest in improving its compliance, safety, and quality programs, with $445 million set aside as compensation for the families of the victims. This deal stems from the Lion Air Flight 610 crash in 2018 and the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash in 2019, allowing Boeing to avoid criminal charges for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the 737 Max jetliner. Relatives of the victims have expressed grief and anger, viewing the deal as inadequate for the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled all upcoming concerts, including a large-scale tour, due to a brain disorder known as normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus, or N.P.H., is a rare condition that occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing symptoms that include trouble walking and controlling one‚Äôs bladder. Joel, 76, expressed his sincere apologies to his audience and thanked them for their understanding as he undergoes physical therapy and refrains from performing during his recovery.</p>

          <p>The Quilcene School District in Washington state has voted 3-2 to maintain sports competition based on athletes' birth gender, defying a state policy that allows transgender students to participate based on their gender identity. The ruling goes against the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) policy enacted in 2007. Board member Ron Frantz cited Title IX as the basis for keeping sports based on birth gender, while another member, Vivian Kuehl, deemed it "immoral" to exclude transgender females from girls' sports. This decision reflects ongoing debates and proposed legislation regarding transgender athletes' participation in sports.</p>

          <p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security announced it would block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of a "campaign of retribution" for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. A federal judge swiftly issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that its implementation would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university. Harvard enrolls about 6,800 international students, representing about 27 percent of its student body.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily halted lower court orders requiring the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to turn over information to a government watchdog group. The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), testing whether DOGE must comply with federal public records law. Roberts' order allows the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief. The case involves questions about the role and authority of DOGE and its relationship with Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold can be a smart move, particularly in uncertain economic times, but beginners should be aware of key considerations. It's important to understand the different types of gold assets, such as physical gold, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks, each with varying risks and benefits. The price of gold is influenced by multiple factors, and it's best to view gold as a long-term hedge rather than a quick profit opportunity. Investors should be cautious of scams and high premiums, sticking to reputable dealers and well-known platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

The condition is rare but more common with age, and can be diagnosed through brain imaging and spinal taps.
