          <p>Three far-right extremists, Brogan Stewart, Christopher Ringrose, and Marco Pitzettu, have been convicted of terrorism offenses after planning attacks on targets, including a mosque. The individuals, part of an online group idolizing the Nazi regime, amassed a collection of weapons and detailed plans for violence, including torturing a Muslim leader. The convictions highlight the ongoing threat posed by extremist groups and the efforts of counter-terrorism police to disrupt their activities. Stewart, Ringrose, and Pitzettu were found guilty at Sheffield Crown Court on Wednesday, marking a significant victory for law enforcement in combating domestic terrorism.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before House and Senate committees, defending the Trump administration's proposed budget and massive workforce reductions at HHS. Kennedy emphasized his focus on tackling chronic diseases and improving agency efficiency by cutting costs, including eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion funding. Democratic representatives criticized the cuts, warning of dire consequences for public health programs. Kennedy also addressed the agency's response to measles outbreaks, asserting that the U.S. is leading globally in controlling the spread, though this claim was disputed by some committee members.</p>

          <p>The FDA is initiating a scientific review aimed at potentially removing prescription ingestible fluoride products for children from the market by October 31. Citing concerns about the impact of ingested fluoride on the gut microbiome and possible links to thyroid disorders, weight gain, and decreased IQ, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. supports the move. Dental experts, however, largely disagree, pointing to decades of data showing fluoride's safety and effectiveness in preventing cavities. The FDA's decision has sparked debate about balancing potential risks and benefits, especially for low-income children lacking access to fluoridated water and dental care.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which manage the wealth of ultra-rich individuals, are facing a growing challenge in recruiting and retaining qualified money managers. With the number of family offices expected to increase significantly by 2030, the demand for skilled advisors is outpacing the supply. Trust is a critical factor for family offices, often leading them to prioritize long-term relationships over expertise. This selectivity, combined with competition from banks and private equity firms, makes it difficult to find candidates willing to work in the relatively informal and potentially risky environment of a family office.

The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity's Minimal Quality of Life index indicates that low-income households earning an average of $38,000 per year need $67,000 to cover basic needs. The report highlights that traditional economic indicators do not reflect the lived reality of many Americans, as the cost of necessities has doubled since 2001 while median earnings for lower earners have fallen.</p>

A survey indicates that nearly half of the girls struggle to afford pads, impacting their school performance.

The use of unsafe cloth pads leads to infections, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable solutions to address period poverty and improve girls' access to education.</p>

The charges, criticized as politically driven, stem from the group's past affiliation with a European election monitoring network. Melkonyants, a co-founder of Golos, which documented election fraud, was jailed following a crackdown ordered by President Putin. The verdict has been condemned by human rights organizations as a brazen attempt to suppress peaceful activism.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies, particularly tariffs on imported cars, are significantly impacting the German auto industry and raising concerns for US manufacturers. German carmakers are stockpiling exports to the US in anticipation of higher duties, while uncertainty surrounding trade policies makes long-term planning difficult. The tariffs could lead to increased prices, decreased demand, and reduced profits for both European and American companies. Some German carmakers are considering moving production to the US to avoid high tariffs, but this strategy also faces challenges due to reliance on imported parts.</p>

While his death would be a tactical success, its long-term strategic impact is uncertain, as Hamas has repeatedly survived the assassination of its leaders. Experts suggest that even without Sinwar, Hamas's strategic outlook and operational abilities may not significantly change, and Israel's approach to cease-fire negotiations remains a critical factor.
