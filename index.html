          <p>The Budapest Pride march is proceeding despite legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. A new "child protection" law restricts pro-LGBTQ gatherings, and attendees face potential fines up to â‚¬500, with organizers facing possible prison time. Despite the pressure, organizers and participants, including EU officials, are defying the ban, with Budapest's liberal mayor asserting the event is legal as it is co-organized by the city. The event highlights the growing tension between Hungary's conservative government and civil rights advocates within the country and the broader European Union.</p>

          <p>A series of decisive military strikes against Iran and its allies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, has reasserted Israel's military dominance in the Middle East. This follows the major conflict that began with the Hamas attack in October 2023. While Israel has degraded the military capabilities of its adversaries, significant political challenges remain, particularly the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a tarnished international reputation due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The article suggests the region is at a crossroads, potentially entering an era of Israeli military supremacy or a more dangerous stalemate if political issues are not addressed.

          <p>Financial planners suggest that paying for a laundry service can be a smart decision for some, but it requires careful consideration. Experts advise asking four key questions: if the service costs less than your personal hourly rate, if outsourcing the chore will genuinely boost your emotional wellbeing, if you are truly comfortable with the premium price, and if the expense will not compromise your long-term financial goals like retirement savings. The core idea is to treat personal finances like a business, strategically outsourcing tasks to free up time and mental energy for more valuable activities without sacrificing future security.

          <p>Iran held a large state funeral in Tehran for approximately 60 high-profile individuals, including military commanders and nuclear scientists, who were killed during the recent 12-day conflict with Israel. The deceased included Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of Iran's armed forces. The event saw large crowds of mourners and was attended by top government officials. The funeral comes amid escalating rhetoric, with U.S. President Donald Trump stating he would consider bombing Iran again, and Iran's foreign minister warning against disrespectful comments towards the country's Supreme Leader.</p>

          <p>The New York Islanders chose defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the first overall pick in the NHL draft during an emotional ceremony. Schaefer, who lost his mother to cancer 16 months ago, was visibly moved when he donned the Islanders jersey, which featured a pink ribbon patch and his mother's initials in her honor. The 17-year-old from the OHL's Erie Otters is considered an exceptional two-way player. The draft also saw high-scoring forward Michael Misa go second to the San Jose Sharks and Swedish forward Anton Frondell third to the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>

The second half was a dominant display, with standout performances from players like Joe McCarthy, though the victory was marred by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams.

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled against the use of nationwide injunctions, a significant change in the remedial power of lower federal courts. The case, *Trump v. Casa*, concerned the remedy for a challenge to an executive order on birthright citizenship, not the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that such broad injunctions, which halt a policy for everyone, are a recent invention with no historical basis. While this ends one tool for challenging executive actions, the Court left open other avenues for broad relief, such as class-action lawsuits and "complete relief" for plaintiffs.</p>

The author contends that years of grassroots activism by Palestinians and their allies have shifted public opinion, making his stance an asset rather than a political liability. The campaign's success was built on a coalition of organized people, including student activists and groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, who were drawn to his rejection of the pro-Israel Democratic establishment. This victory is presented as evidence that Palestine has become a central issue in domestic progressive politics.</p>

While some gay conservatives support Trump, rights groups like the HRC and ACLU are fighting these policies in court.

They fear that Beijing could attempt to replicate these covert warfare tactics to undermine Taiwan's political and defense systems. Experts suggest that Taiwan is vulnerable due to its proximity and the extensive social and cultural exchanges with mainland China, which could allow Chinese intelligence operatives to operate and recruit more easily. The concern is that Beijing's existing intelligence network may already be laying the groundwork for such a high-stakes covert campaign against the island.</p>

The company is fighting back, notably by suing AI firm Anthropic for unfair business practices related to data scraping, arguing that commercial use of its data requires payment. Simultaneously, Reddit is embracing AI on its own terms, launching "Reddit Answers," a chatbot that generates responses based solely on its platform's content.

Although a deal has been reached to expedite some shipments to the U.S., the situation remains volatile. This crisis highlights the world's dependence on China for critical minerals and may spur efforts to develop alternative sources, recycling, and innovation to reduce that reliance.

          <p>Eric Trump has suggested that he or another member of the Trump family might run for president after his father's term concludes. In an interview, the co-executive vice president of the Trump Organization stated that the political path "would be an easy one" for him or other family members if they chose to pursue it. He noted that the main deterrent was the "brutality of this system" and the toll it takes on one's family. The 41-year-old, who has largely focused on the family business, also expressed that he was "wholly unimpressed by half the politicians" he sees.</p>

          <h2>Mass Deportations from Pakistan and Iran Force Afghan Refugees into Dire Humanitarian Crisis</h2>

          <p>Human rights advocates are raising alarms as Pakistan and Iran escalate the forced deportation of Afghan refugees, sending tens of thousands back to a country facing a severe humanitarian crisis. Many of these refugees have lived in the neighboring countries for decades and are now returning to an Afghanistan where millions need aid, but funding from international donors has been drastically cut. Returnees, many of whom are women and children, arrive with nothing and face a dire lack of food, shelter, and work, especially as the Taliban restricts women's employment. The timing is described as catastrophic.</p>
