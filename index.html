          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles following President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard in response to demonstrations against federal immigration enforcement operations. Demonstrators halted traffic on the 101 Freeway, leading to the police deeming it an unlawful assembly. California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized the deployment as "purposefully inflammatory" and requested its rescission, fearing it would escalate tensions. The White House stated that the deployment of 2,000 National Guardsmen was to address the "lawlessness" in California, as protests opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations continued.</p>

          <p>China's export growth fell short of expectations in May, primarily due to a sharp decline in shipments to the U.S., despite a temporary trade truce. Exports rose by 4.8%, while imports nosedived by 3.4% due to weak domestic consumption. Chinese exports to the U.S. plummeted by 34.5%, offset partially by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the EU, and Africa.

Factory-gate prices also declined, marking the steepest drop since July 2023, while core inflation saw a slight increase.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board has criticized President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling it an overreach of presidential authority. The board argues that there was no justifiable emergency necessitating the deployment, and that Governor Newsom did not request or want the troops. They further contend that Trump's invocation of a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code on Armed Services is based on false pretenses. The editorial draws a parallel to John F. Kennedy's deployment of troops to desegregate the University of Alabama in 1963, highlighting the controversial nature of such federal intervention.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an extension to the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing practice, across English waters. The proposal aims to expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The plan, which is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in dispute over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, centering on differing interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump deployed the National Guard following reported attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during raids. Newsom has requested the Trump Administration rescind the deployment, claiming it inflames tensions and breaches state sovereignty. The Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, with exceptions including congressional decree or the inability of state governments to maintain order.</p>

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the award as inadequate and crucial in determining the next steps. The RCN argues that nursing has been undervalued and that the pay increase does not address over a decade of pay erosion. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action over pay, potentially casting a shadow over the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>
