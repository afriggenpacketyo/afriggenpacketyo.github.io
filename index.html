        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the significant differences between American and European food regulations, highlighting that many additives like Red Dye 40, common in U.S. products, are banned or restricted in Europe. While these substances are a concern, the piece argues that the larger health crisis in the U.S. stems from excessive consumption of sugar, saturated fats, and ultra-processed foods in general. It calls for a comprehensive shift toward whole foods and better dietary habits, suggesting that regulatory changes alone are insufficient to address America's lagging life expectancy compared to its European peers.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted the first-known unmanned semi-submersible vessel designed for drug trafficking in the Caribbean, notably equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna for remote operation. Although the drone submarine was empty, authorities believe it was a trial run by the Gulf Clan cartel, with the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine. This discovery highlights a technological escalation by cartels, moving toward sophisticated, unmanned systems that are difficult to detect and reduce the risk of crew capture. The use of drone vessels makes it harder for authorities to identify the drug lords behind the shipments.</p>

          <p>A drive-by shooting outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in downtown Chicago resulted in at least four fatalities and fourteen injuries late Wednesday night. The incident occurred as patrons were leaving an album release party for a local rapper.

This location has a history of violence, as a previous mass shooting took place in November 2022 when the establishment was under a different name, leading to its temporary shutdown before reopening as Artis Lounge.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly advanced President Trump's major budget and tax legislation after a prolonged overnight session, overcoming resistance from some Republican members. The key procedural vote, which concluded in the early morning, was delayed for hours as party leaders and the president worked to persuade holdouts concerned about changes made by the Senate. The bill extends tax cuts and increases spending on border security and defense, offset by significant cuts to social programs. Final passage is expected shortly, marking a significant legislative push for the administration.</p>

          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence provided by the city council. Some documents were so obscured that they were evidentially useless, hindering probes into cases involving hundreds of victims and suspects. While the report notes that Greater Manchester Police has since improved its processes and that a new information-sharing protocol is in place, past failings have led to an "irrecoverable loss of trust" for some victims who felt repeatedly failed by the system.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, Samuel Moyn argues that Donald Trump's presidency does not represent a break from the past but rather a continuation of long-standing American policies. He contends that Trump's major domestic bill, with its tax cuts for the wealthy and cuts to social programs, is a clear example of neoliberalism. Similarly, the recent military strike on Iran is framed as a revival of neoconservative, interventionist foreign policy. Despite populist rhetoric, Trump's actions in office have ultimately reinforced the very political and economic consensus that his rise initially seemed to challenge.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the policy platform of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, arguing that his proposals are less radical than critics claim. Policies such as a temporary rent freeze, publicly owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses have been tested in other cities and contexts with some success. For example, the Rent Guidelines Board has frozen rents before, and several states operate publicly owned liquor stores. The piece suggests Mamdani's agenda is fundamentally about making government more effective and responsive to residents' needs, which proved to be a politically successful message in the primary.</p>

The CDC's website now hosts conflicting information, and its vaccine recommendations have been changed without typical scientific input, leading major medical associations to denounce the new guidelines.

          <p>South Korea exemplifies a global trend of a widening ideological gap between young men and women, with recent elections showing a strong rightward shift among men in their 20s and 30s. Experts attribute this phenomenon to a combination of socioeconomic pressures, a hypercompetitive job market, and a backlash against feminism, which many young men perceive as unfairly blaming them for societal issues. These voters helped elect a conservative president who claimed structural sexism no longer exists. This political polarization is fueled by a sense that men are now the primary victims of discrimination, creating a complex dynamic that defies traditional political classifications.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global's decision to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from Donald Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview has caused anger and fear within CBS News. Many journalists at the network view the settlement as a corporate capitulation to clear the way for Paramount's merger with Skydance Media, given that 1st Amendment experts considered the lawsuit frivolous. However, there is also a sense of relief among some veterans that the company did not issue a formal apology, which was seen as a critical line that could have triggered an internal rebellion.

City leaders are now questioning the LAPD's role and demanding protocols to verify the identity of federal agents, as the confusion erodes public trust and creates fear within communities. The department has since created new guidelines requiring a supervisor to respond and verify agents' legitimacy.</p>

          <p>A new music subgenre, dubbed "toddler techno," is gaining popularity by blending classic children's songs with electronic dance beats, creating an experience enjoyable for both kids and their millennial parents. Australian DJ Lenny Pearce, a former boy band member, is at the forefront of this trend, hosting sold-out "baby raves" across the U.S. where families can dance together. While some critics question the appropriateness of rave culture for children, proponents and some experts note that these daytime events can promote joy and parent-child bonding. The events are carefully managed to be kid-friendly, with controlled sound levels and sensory support.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the declining allure of the American road trip, once a symbol of discovery and freedom, but now often characterized by digital detachment and corporate sameness. The author, who teaches a course on the topic, describes a personal cross-country journey where faith in the experience was nearly lost amidst ecological despair and a cynical view of meeting fellow Americans. However, a stop at a small motel in Shamrock, Texas, run by a warm South Asian family, restored a sense of connection and hope, reminding him that the road's true value lies in the unexpected, shared human moments that transcend political division.</p>

Independent analyses from the Congressional Budget Office and other experts contradict White House claims, projecting the bill will add over $3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade, not reduce it. The article also confirms that the bill proposes significant cuts to future Medicaid spending, which could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance. Finally, it addresses Trump's claim that taxes would rise dramatically without the bill, a statement tied to the pending expiration of his first-term tax cuts.</p>

Despite fears of inflation, the economy has remained resilient, but retailers have warned of potential price hikes.

          <p>New research using continuous glucose monitors on people without diabetes has identified a common pattern called a "dip," where blood sugar plummets below baseline levels a few hours after eating carbs. Scientists at King's College London found these dips are linked to increased hunger, fatigue, and lower alertness, potentially leading to overeating and making weight loss more difficult. To prevent these crashes, nutritionists recommend "dressing your carbs" by pairing them with protein, fat, and fiber. They also suggest eating protein and fiber first during a meal and spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day.</p>

The bill's cuts are achieved partly by imposing work requirements and other administrative hurdles in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, nineteen of which are led by Republicans. This silence provides political cover for GOP lawmakers supporting the cuts, which could create significant budget shortfalls in their states and lead to millions losing health coverage.</p>
