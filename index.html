          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that could significantly cut funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially impacting millions of Americans. A recent KFF poll reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA health plans identify as Republicans, with a large portion identifying as "MAGA" Republicans. The proposed legislation, already passed by the House, aims to cut approximately $900 billion from health programs like Medicaid and the ACA, and the Senate is now deliberating on the measure. If tax credits that lower monthly ACA premiums are not extended, an estimated 15 million people could lose their health insurance (not investment advice).</p>

Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on a flight to France after agreeing to be deported, while other activists are facing forced deportation proceedings. The boat, carrying baby formula, food, and medicine, aimed to raise awareness of starvation conditions in Gaza. Israel maintains that its blockade on Gaza is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas fighters.</p>

The revised plan emphasizes rigorous monitoring of progress and urges local governments in tsunami-risk areas to update their local measures.
