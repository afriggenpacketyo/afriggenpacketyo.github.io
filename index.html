          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 01:02:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sister of James Lee Williams, known as The Vivienne, disclosed that her family only learned about his ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK. Williams, who passed away in January due to cardiac arrest caused by ketamine, had kept his struggle a secret to protect his family. His sister, Chanel, is now campaigning to encourage open discussions about substance abuse and advocates for reclassifying ketamine as a Class A drug to raise awareness among young people about its dangers. She hopes that sharing James's story will help remove the stigma surrounding addiction and encourage others to seek help. </p>

          <p>The UK government will publish data on the nationalities of foreign criminals living in the country, revealing their crimes and deportation status. This decision comes after pressure from the Conservatives, who accused Labour of inaction on the issue. The data, ordered by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, aims to inform the public about the number of foreign criminals awaiting deportation, their origins, and the crimes they committed. While deportation rates have increased, challenges such as prison overcrowding and human rights appeals have slowed the process.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness and raises the risk of capital flight. Some central banks may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, but this carries the risk of retaliation from the U.S. and potential instability. For now, most central banks are avoiding aggressive devaluation, prioritizing stability in the global economy.</p>

          <p>China's private sector added nearly 2 million new firms in the first quarter, indicating resilience despite the ongoing US-China trade war. The number of newly established private companies grew by 7.1% year-on-year, exceeding the average growth rate of the past three years. However, private businesses are expected to be heavily impacted by increased tariffs, as they contribute to over half of China's exports. The State Administration for Market Regulation reported over 57 million registered private enterprises nationwide as of March.</p>

The map details connections between nerve cells in the macaque claustrum and the rest of the brain, potentially revealing how this region influences cognitive functions. The research also highlights differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, providing clues to the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is funding the project to reduce the cost of feeding astronauts, which can reach £20,000 per day. The experiment involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats, with the long-term goal of establishing food production facilities in orbit and on the Moon.
