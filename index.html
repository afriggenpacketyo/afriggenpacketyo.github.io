          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the recent escalation of conflict between India and Pakistan, highlighting the challenges India faces as it tries to balance its aspirations as a global power with the persistent threat of terrorism from its neighbor. Despite India's military advancements, a strategic victory against Pakistan remains elusive due to nuclear deterrence and the complex dynamics of religious nationalism. The article explores India's shift towards a tougher approach, including retaliatory strikes and covert operations, while acknowledging the limitations of military force in resolving the long-standing disputes. Ultimately, India must find a way to manage its relationship with Pakistan to move forward on the global stage.</p>

          <p>A UK government minister is actively pursuing a deal with the EU that would allow British passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues and improve travel efficiency. This push comes ahead of the first UK-EU summit since Brexit, where trade and security agreements are also on the agenda. However, some Conservative MPs express concerns about the UK becoming a 'rule taker' by aligning with EU standards, particularly regarding food and trade regulations. The minister also addressed ongoing negotiations regarding youth mobility and plans to reduce red tape to lower food prices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to resume wage garnishment for defaulted student loan borrowers after a half-decade pause, impacting millions of Americans. Special education teacher Jason Collier fears the pinch of up to 15% wage garnishment amidst already tight finances, while retiree Marceline Paul faces potential cuts to her Social Security benefits, jeopardizing her ability to visit her home country. This policy shift marks a stark contrast to the Biden administration's relief measures, with Secretary of Education Linda McMahon emphasizing borrowers should repay their debts. Collection activity begins amidst chaotic changes and disruptions to the lending system and reports of staff shortages at the Education Department, leaving borrowers struggling to get current on their loans.</p>

          <p>Portugal is holding its third parliamentary election in three years, triggered by the collapse of the previous government after Prime Minister Luis Montenegro lost a confidence vote. The election is dominated by issues such as housing and immigration, reflecting a decade of fragile governments and political instability. Opinion polls suggest Montenegro's Democratic Alliance is likely to win the most votes but may still struggle to secure a parliamentary majority. The far-right Chega party has gained ground, advocating for stricter immigration policies amid a surge in the number of legal and undocumented immigrants in the country.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of the 2,300-year-old Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, considered the oldest ancient classics found in China, have been repatriated to Beijing from the United States after 79 years abroad.

The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China, leveraging the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy.

          <p>Haas F1 team has requested a review of the FIA's decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, arguing that the lap was completed before the red flag was issued due to a crash. Despite television footage and live timing data appearing to support Haas's claim, the FIA upheld its original decision after a delay. Bearman expressed his belief that the decision was unfair, as the red light on his dash and the red flag at the start-finish line were not displayed until after he crossed the line.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay reflects on the career of Desi Arnaz and his impact on Hollywood, emphasizing his efforts to break racial barriers and promote diversity in the entertainment industry. Seventy-five years ago, Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, convinced CBS to cast him as Lucille Ball's husband in 'I Love Lucy,' challenging the network's belief that audiences wouldn't accept a Latino actor in the role. The show's success not only revolutionized television but also paved the way for greater representation of Latino stories and talent in popular culture.

          <p>Despite a decline in Southern California Edison's safety record, including a surge in fires sparked by its equipment and several employee deaths, executive bonuses rose last year. While the company's parent, Edison International, cut planned executive cash bonuses by 5%, some executives received higher cash bonuses due to performance in other areas. Consumer advocates argue that this highlights a flaw in the state law designed to hold utilities accountable for safety, as the incentive to prioritize safety is diminished if executives can make up for safety-related deductions elsewhere. The utility is seeking to raise customer electric rates by more than 10% this year.</p>

          <p>Loma Alta Park in Altadena has reopened to the public after being damaged in January's Eaton Fire, providing a much-needed space for the community to gather and heal. The park features new play structures, a conversation nook, a satellite library, and renovated sports facilities. While the reopening is a positive step, some residents express concerns about ongoing housing and public safety issues in the wake of the fire. Despite these challenges, the park's reopening is seen as a symbol of resilience and a place for residents to reconnect with their community.</p>

          <p>Efrat Sharony, the former ombudswoman for the state Office of Youth and Community Restoration, alleges she was fired after reporting deplorable conditions at an L.A. County juvenile hall, where a teen later died of a drug overdose. Sharony claims her superiors instructed her to cease investigating juvenile halls and was later replaced by an attorney with no prior experience in juvenile justice. Her allegations underscore broader concerns about the lack of progress in reforming L.A.'s troubled youth facilities. The state's attorney general is considering placing the halls in receivership, while a state senator criticizes Sharony's firing as a mistake.</p>

Concerns are growing over the logistics of rebuilding thousands of homes, with narrow streets and traffic congestion already posing challenges.

The article explores his transformation from advocating Black separatism to seeking alliances with all oppressed people, and his assassination in 1965.
