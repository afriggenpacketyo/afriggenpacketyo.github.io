          <p>A Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s deputy, Trevor Kirk, convicted of using excessive force, had his felony charge dismissed after a new U.S. Attorney, Bill Essayli, took office.

Critics argue that the move undermines the independence of the Justice Department and raises concerns about future cases involving law enforcement. The judge ultimately sentenced Kirk to four months in prison, despite the government's request for probation. </p>

          <p>The UK government is set to invest billions to enhance its war-fighting readiness in response to growing threats from Russia and China. The Strategic Defence Review includes building new nuclear-powered submarines, munitions factories, and embracing technologies like AI. The report warns that the UK's armed forces are currently ill-equipped to face modern adversaries, citing inadequate weapon stockpiles and poor recruitment. The defence secretary announced plans to make the British Army "10 times more lethal" and increase its size. </p>

          <p>This article argues that opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June could be a wise financial decision due to potential rate cuts in July, protection against market volatility, and the opportunity to earn substantial interest. With the Federal Reserve potentially issuing rate cuts soon, locking in a CD now can secure current rates. Long-term CDs offer fixed interest rates, protecting against market instability and ensuring predictable returns. Depending on the CD term and rate, savers can earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the Milky Way's collision with the Andromeda galaxy, previously predicted to occur in four billion years, is now less likely within that timeframe. Simulations based on data from NASA's Hubble and the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescopes show only a 2% probability of a collision in the next five billion years. While close encounters may occur, a full merger is projected to take place in eight to ten billion years, or the galaxies may bypass each other without incident. The inclusion of the Large Magellanic Cloud in the simulations significantly reduced the chance of a merger. </p>
