        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rapid attribution study from Imperial’s Grantham Institute has concluded that climate change made Super Typhoon Ragasa substantially more destructive. Researchers estimate that such an event is now 49% more likely than in pre-industrial times, attributing about 36% of the damage in southern China to the warming climate. The study found that climate change, driven by fossil fuel consumption, intensified the typhoon's winds by 7% and its rainfall by 12% upon landfall, highlighting the growing threat of more powerful tropical cyclones as global temperatures continue to rise.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan, a Utah church member initiated a fundraiser for the family of the deceased gunman. Citing his faith's teachings to "love your enemies," David Butler started the campaign after learning the attacker left behind a wife and children, including one with a chronic illness. The effort, which initially aimed for $10,000, has since raised over $300,000 from thousands of donors, demonstrating a surprising wave of compassion for the perpetrator's family, who are also seen as victims of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General and Secretary of State have issued a warning that ballots mailed on Election Day, November 4, might not be counted due to U.S. Postal Service processing delays. The issue primarily affects voters living 50 miles or more from six regional mail processing facilities, as mail is now often collected the following day, potentially missing the Election Day postmark deadline. This marks a significant shift for a state that has embraced mail-in voting, prompting officials to urge voters to mail their ballots early or use a drop-off box to ensure their vote is counted.</p>

          <p>Police have named Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British man, as the individual who killed two people and injured three others in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue. The incident, which occurred on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, involved the attacker driving a car into people before using a knife. Al-Shamie was shot and killed by police at the scene, and three other individuals have since been arrested in connection with the attack. UK officials have condemned the act, promising to increase police presence at synagogues nationwide amid concerns over rising antisemitism.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 20:48:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA Commissioner has praised the new TrumpRx program, a direct-to-consumer government purchasing platform created in partnership with Pfizer to lower prescription drug costs. The initiative aims to offer significant discounts on medications, with Pfizer committing to align its prices with the lowest paid in European nations for all Americans and Medicaid recipients. While the administration touts savings of up to 85% on certain drugs, some health policy experts express skepticism, arguing the plan may only benefit a small number of people who pay with cash and won't significantly lower out-of-pocket costs for most insured Americans.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has commented on Philadelphia Eagles receiver A.J. Brown's social media posts, which seemed to express frustration over his limited role in the offense. Speaking on the "New Heights" podcast, Kelce noted that it's difficult to be upset when the team is undefeated at 4-0, suggesting Brown should handle his frustrations internally rather than online. While Brown later clarified his post wasn't directed at anyone in the organization and took accountability for his emotions, the exchange highlights the tension between individual performance and team success in professional sports.</p>

          <p>A new report from the human rights group Global Witness alleges that TikTok's algorithm recommends pornography and highly sexualized content to accounts registered as belonging to children. Researchers created fake accounts for 13-year-olds and enabled safety settings but still received explicit search suggestions leading to inappropriate material, including videos of penetrative sex embedded within other content. Despite TikTok's claims of having robust safety features, the investigation found the issue persisted even after the platform was previously notified, raising serious concerns about its content moderation and child safety protocols.</p>

COVID-19 shares symptoms with the flu but can also uniquely feature a loss of taste or smell, a "razor-sharp" sore throat, or diarrhea.

Unlike in 2019, the White House has immediately targeted Democratic districts by freezing over $25 billion in federal projects and has threatened mass firings of federal workers, framing the funding lapse as an "opportunity" to gut agencies. This aggressive approach, spearheaded by OMB Director Russell Vought, reflects a second-term campaign to expand presidential power and has created a new, more volatile dynamic in Washington's partisan battles over government funding.</p>

By classifying cartels as "non-state armed groups," the administration claims the authority to use wartime powers against them.

However, this dissatisfaction has not translated into significant gains for the Democratic party.

          <p>Balin Miller, a 23-year-old accomplished mountaineer from Anchorage, died after falling from Yosemite's El Capitan on Wednesday in an accident that was reportedly broadcast on a social media livestream. According to witnesses, Miller had already reached the summit but was rappelling back down to retrieve a stuck gear bag when he rappelled off the end of his rope. Miller was a rising star in the climbing community, known for a recent solo ascent of a highly technical route on Denali. His death has shocked the community and serves as a tragic reminder of the inherent dangers of the sport.</p>

          <p>The death of Paloma Shemirani, who rejected chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in favor of alternative treatments, has raised questions about protecting children from the influence of conspiracy-minded parents. A coroner found that Paloma was "highly influenced" by her mother, Kate Shemirani, a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, and that this influence contributed to her death. The case has sparked a broader debate on the line between parental freedom and child welfare, especially as medical misinformation becomes more prevalent online, potentially leading to life-threatening decisions for both children and adults under a parent's sway.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that American pessimism about the national economy is persistent and growing, with most respondents citing rising prices as their primary concern. Views on the U.S. job market have also turned more negative, as a majority now rate it as bad and believe finding a desirable job would be difficult. Furthermore, the survey reveals significant public skepticism about the future impact of artificial intelligence, with most Americans believing AI will have a net-negative effect on job availability in their fields over the next decade, contributing to broader economic anxieties.</p>

          <p>A recent profile of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth portrays his leadership at the Pentagon as chaotic and driven by impulse and image rather than deep policy experience. The article suggests Hegseth, a former Fox News co-host, was chosen by President Trump primarily for his appearance and has since fixated on branding and social media. His tenure has been marked by personnel issues, leak investigations, and a reliance on a small circle of personal associates rather than experienced staff. This leadership style has reportedly led to a paranoid and less creative department focused on implementing executive orders.</p>

A 3-2 Europa League defeat to Midtjylland left Forest winless in Postecoglou's first six games, a historically poor start for the club. During the match, fans chanted "You're getting sacked in the morning" and praised his predecessor, Nuno Espirito Santo. Despite the pressure and the team's struggles, Postecoglou remained defiant, stating that he believes in his process and is confident he can turn the team's performance around and win games for the club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Goldman Sachs study reveals that a growing number of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, making it increasingly difficult to save for retirement. The report found that 42% of younger workers across Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X have no money left after covering basic living expenses, a figure that has risen from 31% in 1997. This financial precarity is driven by the rising costs of essentials like housing and healthcare, which consume an ever-larger share of income. The study concludes that simply advising workers to "save more" ignores the economic realities that make long-term savings an impossible goal for many.</p>

Democrats view the threats as a political bluff and an illegal abuse of power designed to intimidate them into ending the shutdown. Meanwhile, federal employee unions have filed a lawsuit, challenging the administration's authority to conduct mass firings.</p>

However, Celtic also made critical errors, including a goalkeeping mistake by Kasper Schmeichel that led to Braga's first goal and a general lack of attacking potency.

However, as a college education became a mass-consumer good by the 1980s, the rankings emerged as a vital, if contentious, map for navigating the American meritocracy, shaping public perception and institutional behavior in ways their creators never anticipated.</p>
