          <p>Honda projects a 70% drop in net profit for fiscal year 2025, primarily attributed to challenges arising from tariffs imposed by the United States. The company cites increased costs and reduced competitiveness in the American market as key factors affecting its financial outlook. This forecast underscores the broader economic impact of trade tensions on multinational corporations and their global operations, as Honda navigates these challenges by exploring alternative markets and cost-cutting measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the tariffs. Honda will have to make some decisions soon to ensure they are able to keep costs down. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's job market is showing signs of weakening, with a decrease in the number of workers on payrolls during the first quarter of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

While wage growth has slowed, pay is still increasing at a rate faster than inflation, offering some relief to workers amidst the rising cost of living. These trends suggest a potential shift in the UK's economic landscape, requiring careful monitoring and policy adjustments to support employment and economic stability.</p>

A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers was delivered to Congress, warning of dire consequences if programs battling the drug overdose epidemic are defunded. The letter highlights the significant reduction in overdose deaths in 2024, attributing it to sustained financial investment, and argues that now is not the time to reduce these investments. The experts are concerned that rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods could be particularly hard hit, and that research efforts tracking new synthetic street drugs could also be defunded.</p>

          <p>A government survey reveals that approximately half of Japanese respondents believed false information on social media, highlighting the need for improved media literacy. The survey, conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, examined belief in false claims, such as mass beaching of sardines signaling earthquakes. Around 25% of those who encountered misinformation shared it further. The government aims to accelerate efforts to improve media literacy, as people are often prone to believe unsourced information presented online.</p>

          <p>China's economy is defined by two distinct narratives: one of technological and manufacturing prowess, and another of sluggish consumer spending and a housing crisis. Despite advances in technology, many believe these advances won't be enough to pull the country out of its economic slump. While Chinese tech entrepreneurs and investors express optimism, they acknowledge the challenges of unemployment, weak consumption, and reliance on exports.

          <p>With the U.S. and China agreeing to lower tariff rates, the triple-digit duties imposed since April have been significantly reduced. For the next 90 days, Chinese goods shipped to the US will be subject to at least 30 per cent in tariffs, and American exports will receive a minimum 10 per cent in duties. However, these rates do not include previous tariffs, held over from the first iteration of the trade war, nor do they factor in other duties on specific goods. The baseline rate is about 50 per cent, according to estimates, with the around 20 per cent in tariffs imposed during Trumpâ€™s first term, plus the 30 per cent in new duties still in force.</p>

Falling rates may expose vulnerabilities in some fintechs, while others with broader income strategies may prove more adaptable. Some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams to reduce reliance on card fees and interest, such as Revolut's addition of crypto and share trading, and Bunq's focus on subscription and card-based fees.</p>
