        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A missile fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen landed near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, causing temporary flight suspensions and prompting a response from Israeli authorities. The missile evaded interception by Israeli air defenses, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the country's protection systems. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed a strong retaliation, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened meetings to discuss the situation. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, warning airlines to avoid the airport. The event underscores the ongoing tensions and security challenges in the region, stemming from the conflict in Gaza and Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president before his second term signaled a shift from a coalition government approach to a royal court dynamic. Unlike potential picks like Marco Rubio and Doug Burgum, Vance was a staunch member of the MAGA movement, prioritizing loyalty and accelerationism. Klein posits that this choice demonstrated Trump's preference for advisors who would not challenge him, a stark contrast to his first term where he faced some resistance. The article suggests that Trump's second term is characterized by a lack of skepticism and an embrace of recklessness, with the selection of Vance serving as a key indicator of this new structure.</p>

          <p>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a landslide re-election victory, partly fueled by anti-Trump sentiment among voters. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global instability caused by Trump's policies resonated in the Australian election. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's adoption of Trump-like messaging backfired, contributing to his defeat. Voters expressed concerns about the cost-of-living crisis and the impact of Trump's tariffs on their retirement accounts. The article suggests that Australians rejected Dutton's policies because they were seen as echoing the erratic and poorly considered approach associated with Trump.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, is facing a difficult situation as it considers whether to hold interest rates steady or cut them. While officials are inclined to maintain rates due to inflation concerns, President Trump is pressuring the Fed to cut rates to stimulate the economy. Recent economic data, including a healthy increase in April payrolls, supports the Fed's ability to stand pat. However, uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential tariffs adds complexity to the decision-making process. The article suggests that Powell will likely prioritize price stability amidst these conflicting pressures.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, after gaining seats in local elections, is exploring legal challenges to prevent migrants from being housed in hotels in areas where it now controls local councils. Party chairman Zia Yusuf stated that Reform will use "every instrument of power available," including judicial reviews and injunctions, to resist housing asylum seekers. The party plans to scrutinize whether these hotels meet regulations for hostels and will soon release a plan to deport all illegal immigrants during their first term in government.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party has made significant gains in local elections, posing a serious challenge to the traditional two-party system in Britain. The Conservatives suffered losses, and Labour was punished by voters, creating an opening for smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. The rise of Reform U.K., fueled by Farage's campaigning, reflects public disenchantment with the main parties and a fragmentation of traditional class loyalties. The article discusses the implications of these results for the future of British politics, noting that the two main parties must now compete with opponents on both the left and right.</p>

          <p>African traders are increasingly bypassing the US dollar in favor of China's yuan for international transactions, particularly in commercial hubs like Nairobi and Lagos. This shift involves logistics companies facilitating Kenyan Shilling-yuan conversions for Chinese imports, enabling traders to pay in local currency. The companies manage yuan payments to Chinese sellers and handle the flow of goods, streamlining the trade process. This trend reflects growing economic ties between Africa and China and a move away from traditional reliance on the US dollar.</p>
