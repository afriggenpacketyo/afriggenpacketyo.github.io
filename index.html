          <p>DoorDash reported strong first-quarter revenue, driven by an increase in total orders and grocery delivery demand, despite concerns about the U.S. economy. The company is set to acquire Britain's Deliveroo to expand its presence in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Additionally, DoorDash is purchasing SevenRooms, a hospitality management software company, to enhance its offerings to merchants and improve customer relations. Despite rising revenue, the article notes that DoorDash shares fell after the report, indicating investor hesitation, even as the company expands into new markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The Houthis have vowed to respond to the attacks, which come amid ongoing conflict in the region.

This opposition from a key Republican senator jeopardizes Martin's chances of confirmation, as it could lead to a tie vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, preventing the nomination from moving forward.</p>

          <p>Financial experts recommend limiting credit card spending, especially with high interest rates and compounding debt, suggesting that consumers only spend what they can comfortably pay back each month. For a credit limit of $1,000, experts advise keeping spending below $300 to maintain a healthy credit utilization ratio. By keeping credit usage low, borrowers can improve their credit scores and access lower interest rates on future loans. The article emphasizes the importance of responsible credit card use to avoid accumulating unmanageable debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Diamondback Energy warns that U.S. onshore oil production has likely peaked and will decline due to a significant drop in crude prices. The price decline is driven by recession fears and increased output from OPEC+, which could jeopardize U.S. energy security. The company plans to reduce spending on oil drilling and focus more on natural gas. This shift reflects the challenges faced by U.S. oil producers in the current economic climate, but could potentially benefit natural gas production in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>
