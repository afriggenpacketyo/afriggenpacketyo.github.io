          <p>Authorities in Washington state are searching for Travis Decker after his three daughters, Paityn, Evelyn, and Olivia, were found dead after he failed to return them from a planned visit. The girls' mother, Whitney Decker, reported them missing, and police located Decker's unoccupied truck near a campground before discovering the children's bodies. Decker, a former Army soldier with "extensive training," is wanted on three counts of murder and kidnapping, with a reward of up to $20,000 offered for information leading to his arrest. Court filings indicate that Decker had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but never sought mental health treatment or anger management counseling as stipulated in the parenting plan. Optimism is understandably low given the tragic circumstances. </p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that it is "extremely hard" to make a deal with China's President Xi Jinping, amidst ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent noted that trade talks were "a bit stalled," suggesting that the leaders would need to intervene. Trump's statement on Truth Social comes as both countries blame each other for violating a trade agreement reached in Switzerland on May 12, which included a suspension of tariffs. China has been criticized for not easing restrictions on rare earth exports, while the U.S. faces criticism for limiting China's access to advanced technology. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities arrested Garon Nathaniel Killian on an attempted murder charge and executed search warrants as part of the investigation. At least 80 shots were fired at the party, which was promoted on social media and focused on a pool in the home's backyard. People ran and ducked for cover as they scrambled to their cars for safety, and the crime scene spanned several properties along a neighborhood road.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a partial U-turn on winter fuel payments, ensuring that more people will receive the allowance this winter. The payment, worth up to £300, helps cover energy costs during the coldest months. Last winter, the payment was limited to those on pension credit, a policy that was widely criticized. While details are pending the autumn Budget, the government aims to increase eligibility without reverting to the previous system of paying all pensioners, as the pensions minister Torsten Bell stated that millionaires should not be receiving the payment. </p>

          <p>Deutsche Welle (DW) examines the credibility of Russia's new "Global Fact-Checking Network" (GFCN), which claims to combat fake news but is criticized as propaganda. The GFCN was co-founded by TASS, Russia's state-run news agency, and ANPO "Dialog Regions," both with close ties to the Kremlin. DW's review of GFCN articles revealed issues with sourcing and methodology, such as false claims about Romanian support for EU policies on Ukraine and misleading allegations about the Soros family's involvement in protests. Experts view the GFCN as an attempt to mimic legitimate institutions and blur the line between journalism and propaganda. </p>

Sherrock, nicknamed the 'Queen of the Palace,' said she is determined to keep fighting and will continue to play for the time being, despite the impact of her health issues. She is scaling back playing commitments because her energy levels are lower, and she wants to sort herself out and get well before returning to the sport. Sherrock hopes that in a couple of years, she will be alright and back to winning. </p>

Decorated with an erotic image of a nun and three clergymen, the condom includes the phrase "This is my choice" in French, referencing the Renoir painting "The Judgment of Paris."

The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. This finding suggests that the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics, may have a more complex structure than previously thought. </p>

          <p>Taiwan's hospitals are integrating artificial intelligence and robotics to support nursing staff and maintain high standards of patient care, addressing a projected global shortage of 4.5 million nurses by 2030. Nurabot, a collaborative nursing robot, handles physically demanding and repetitive tasks like delivering medications, transporting samples, and guiding visitors. Foxconn has developed digital tools, including AI models that monitor patient vitals and digital twins that simulate hospital environments. Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH) uses digital twins to train Nurabot before deploying it in real-world scenarios, augmenting the capabilities of healthcare staff and enabling them to deliver more focused care to patients. </p>

          <p>Insilico Medicine reported positive results from clinical trials of its new drug for lung disease, rentosertib, which was designed using artificial intelligence (AI). The drug showed promise in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic lung disease, with improvements in lung function observed in patients who received a higher dose. Insilico founder and CEO Alex Zhavoronkov believes AI makes it easier for emerging countries to take part in drug discovery. The company is pursuing a public listing in Hong Kong and has a significant presence in mainland China and Hong Kong. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a record in quantum-based secure direct communications, trebling the distance of a multi-user network to around 300km. The researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University said the optical fibre network was theoretically scalable, showing the viability of this kind of quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to help hide the signals. This achievement represents a significant step towards realizing long-distance, large-scale quantum communication networks. </p>

          <p>A congressional watchdog claims that Marjorie Taylor Greene has assembled a “rogues’ gallery of extremists, conspiracy theorists and C-team political operatives” to promote Donald Trump’s crackdown on non-government organisations (NGOs). The House subcommittee, chaired by Greene, is holding a hearing to “expose” the use of federal funds by NGOs to advance “radical” agendas. The Congressional Integrity Project (CIP) condemns the hearing as “political theater” and an exercise in hypocrisy, given the substantial federal funding received by Republican allies and rightwing groups. The CIP notes that the Center for Immigration Studies, one of the witnesses, has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. </p>

Barber, a social activist and founding director of Yale Divinity School’s center for public theology, led a rally outside the US supreme court attended by an estimated 2,000 protesters. The protests, adapted from similar demonstrations Barber started in North Carolina in 2013, are likely to expand to encompass a broader pro-democracy agenda.

          <p>Researchers have discovered that over 90% of popular freshwater fish in Southern California are carrying human-infecting parasites, posing a significant risk to those who consume freshly caught fish. The parasites, called trematodes, can cause gastrointestinal problems, weight loss, and lethargy, and in rare cases, strokes or heart attacks. The parasites were likely introduced to the U.S. by the red-rimmed melania snail, and researchers found them in fish from various lakes and reservoirs in San Diego County. Thorough cooking or freezing of freshwater fish can prevent illness, but a survey of YouTube videos revealed that many do not mention proper food preparation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in Science suggests that emotions generalize through a signal that lingers in the brain after positive or negative experiences. Researchers found that profound experiences create a sustained signal, like a musical note held with the sustain pedal, allowing it to merge with other experiences. The study involved exposing mice and humans to air puffs, observing brain activity, and using ketamine to disconnect sensory experiences from emotional responses.

          <p>The BBC has rejected criticism from the White House regarding its coverage of events in Gaza, stating that claims of retracted or removed stories are "completely wrong". Press secretary Karoline Leavitt had accused the BBC of relying on Hamas's account of casualties near an aid distribution site. The BBC clarified that its casualty figures were attributed to various sources, and the story was updated with new information as it became available. The corporation emphasized its commitment to bringing the truth about what is happening in Gaza and called for immediate access for international journalists. </p>
