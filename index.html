          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is "continuing and permanent," rejecting the White House's attempt to downplay his influence in a lawsuit brought by 14 states. The states argue that Musk lacks the legal authority to make sweeping changes to the federal government because he is not a Senate-confirmed officer, and DOGE was never authorized by Congress. The judge, Tanya Chutkan, found that Musk's reach extends throughout the executive branch, giving the states a credible argument to move forward with their case. The lawsuit alleges that DOGE gained "unauthorized access" to "private and proprietary information," leading to the decision to allow the case to proceed, while Trump was dismissed as a defendant.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Super Heavy booster and Starship rocket exploded during a test flight, marking the third consecutive setback for Elon Musk's company. This un-crewed mission, the ninth test flight, followed prior explosions in January and March. The Starship system is being developed to transport people and equipment around Earth and to the Moon, with Musk also aiming to use it for colonizing Mars. During the livestream of the test flight, the first-stage booster exploded, and the second-stage Starship spacecraft experienced a major fuel leak, spun out of control, and exploded during reentry. Despite the setback, Musk noted it was a "big improvement" over the last flight, with no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), twenty-five years after introducing hybrid vehicles to the American market with the Prius. Unlike traditional hybrids, PHEVs can function as all-electric vehicles for a certain number of miles before needing a gas-powered engine and require charging with a plug. Toyota plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030, though this could change based on regulations, customer acceptance, and affordability. This expansion comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, with the company continuing to invest billions in both technologies.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that a team from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) can now access a sensitive Treasury Department system that controls trillions of dollars in federal payments. Judge Jeannette Vargas granted permission for four DOGE employees to access the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which serves as the checkbook for the federal government. This ruling marks a win for the Trump administration and DOGE, which faced legal challenges in February when it initially sought access to the Treasury Department’s payment systems. The attorneys general did not object to allowing DOGE’s access if the employees were properly trained.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined £122.7 million, the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, for breaching rules regarding sewage spills and shareholder payouts. The regulator found that Thames Water had failed to protect the environment and let down its customers, with about three-quarters of the company's storm overflows spilling routinely rather than in exceptional circumstances. The fine includes £104.5 million for breaches related to sewage operations and an additional £18.2 million for improper shareholder payouts. The fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, and come as Thames Water faces heavy criticism over its performance and struggles with a £20 billion debt pile.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential implications of the U.S. government demanding “golden shares” in foreign acquisitions of strategic American companies, such as the proposed Nippon Steel acquisition of U.S. Steel. A golden share would grant the U.S. government veto power over certain corporate functions and board appointments, which is extraordinary for such a transaction and goes beyond typical national security reviews. The article explores whether this could become a new blueprint for foreign direct investment in the U.S., particularly in strategic sectors, and raises concerns about potential retaliatory measures from other countries. It also considers the risk of future administrations using golden shares for politically driven mandates.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has criticized the Republican spending bill, stating that it undermines the work he's been doing to reduce wasteful government spending as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk expressed disappointment, saying the bill increases the budget deficit rather than decreasing it, thereby undermining DOGE's efforts to save taxpayer money. DOGE claims to have saved $170 billion since January by targeting government waste and redundancy, including staff reductions and agency streamlining. Musk has pulled back from his DOGE work to focus on his companies, noting that the federal bureaucracy is "much worse than I realized."</p>

This move is seen as an effort by Hanoi to curry favor with the Trump administration amid ongoing trade negotiations, especially considering Vietnam's substantial trade surplus with the United States.

The 46-year-old was found unresponsive at his home in Bristol, with a coroner determining that none of the drugs were found in high levels, but their combined effect resulted in fatal respiratory depression. Danan, known for his role in Hollyoaks and appearances on Celebrity Big Brother, had a long history of drug misuse and struggles with his mental health.

          <p>Starling Bank, a British online lender backed by Goldman Sachs, reported a 26% drop in annual profit, citing Covid-era business loan fraud and a regulatory fine over financial crime failings. The bank's profit before tax for the year ending March 31, 2025, was £223.4 million ($301.9 million), down from the previous year. Revenue totaled £714 million, a 5% increase, but a slowdown from the previous year's 50% growth. Profits were impacted by a £29 million fine from the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority and issues with the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) related to fraud.</p>

          <p>The world is likely to experience several years of record-breaking heat, leading to more deadly and extreme weather events, according to forecasts from top weather agencies. There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, with a high probability of exceeding the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago. The projections also suggest a chance that the world's annual temperature will surpass the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius of heating before the end of the decade. Scientists warn of increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, droughts, floods, fires, and human-reinforced hurricanes.</p>

He argued that Pickett was not a failure, but the Steelers were, due to their lack of an effective offensive line and weapons.

          <p>This article addresses the financial strain of "Maycember," a term for the high costs associated with end-of-school-year activities. Experts recommend reviewing spending, reassessing financial plans, and addressing credit card debt. Automating savings and scaling back on discretionary spending are also advised.
