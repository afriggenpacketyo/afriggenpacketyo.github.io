          <p>England's Red Roses secured a 47-7 victory over Australia, advancing to the World Cup's last eight where they will face Scotland. Despite the convincing scoreline, the team's performance was initially unsettled by Australia's intensity, with early struggles in their set-piece and maul, which is typically a major strength. Coach John Mitchell acknowledged the untidy attack but praised the team's outstanding defense, which kept the Wallaroos scoreless in the second half. The match highlighted both England's resilience and areas for improvement as they enter the knockout stage of the tournament.</p>

The primary threats include damaging wind gusts, with a possibility of isolated large hail and brief tornadoes, particularly in northern New England. Forecasters also warn of potential localized flash flooding due to slow-moving storms bringing torrential rain, especially in urban and poor-drainage areas. The storm system is expected to continue into the overnight hours before cooler, fall-like air moves into the region for the remainder of the weekend.</p>

          <p>Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning led his team to a 38-7 victory over the San Jose State Spartans, accounting for five total touchdowns. Manning threw for 295 yards and four touchdowns while also running for another score, a significant rebound from a difficult season opener against Ohio State. Despite the dominant performance, he expressed dissatisfaction with his play, describing it as "not very good" and lamenting the team's "sloppy" execution, which included two turnovers. This self-critical perspective highlights his high standards as he continues his highly anticipated collegiate career.</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that actor Jamie Borthwick, who played Jay Brown on the soap opera EastEnders for 19 years, will not be returning to the show. His dismissal follows a suspension earlier in the year for using an unacceptable slur against people with disabilities on the set of Strictly Come Dancing. Borthwick had been one of the longest-serving cast members on the popular British drama, having joined in 2006. While he had apologized for the incident at the time, the decision was made not to renew his contract for filming.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the US Open have reportedly asked broadcasters to refrain from airing any negative crowd reactions, such as booing, towards Donald Trump during his expected attendance at the men's final. An email to broadcasters indicated that while the former president will be shown on screen during the national anthem, any subsequent disruptions should not be televised. Trump, who has not attended the tournament since being booed in 2015, is expected to watch the match between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Player Carlos Alcaraz commented that having a president attend is a privilege for the sport.</p>

          <p>The recent regular-season game between the Chargers and the Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, is a key part of the NFL's long-term global strategy. The league aims to build a year-round presence in international markets rather than hosting one-off events, with seven international games scheduled this season across various countries. Despite American football's niche status in soccer-dominated Brazil, the game drew nearly 50,000 fans, demonstrating growing interest. The NFL is investing in media deals and fan engagement to establish itself as a global sport, with plans for a game in Australia next season.</p>

          <p>Director Oliver Laxe's new film, "Sirât," is gaining critical acclaim for its unique portrayal of an apocalyptic desert rave. The movie, which Laxe describes as something to be felt sensorially rather than intellectually solved, has become a festival favorite since its debut at Cannes. Laxe, who spent 12 years living in Morocco away from the mainstream film industry, developed the film from images that stuck with him rather than a traditional script. The article explores his unconventional process and spiritual approach to filmmaking, which he says is about "celebrating crisis" to connect with one's essence.</p>

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the performance under manager Thomas Tuchel has drawn criticism for lacking inspiration and momentum. The victory, secured by an own goal and a header from Declan Rice, keeps England in a strong position in their group, but the team has been described as having "arguably regressed" since Tuchel took over. Despite maintaining a clean sheet in all qualifiers, the squad's inability to create dynamic attacking plays against a low-ranked opponent led many fans to leave the stadium early, raising concerns ahead of a tougher match against Serbia.</p>

This practice by the Trump administration of deporting migrants to third countries has been criticized by rights groups as a violation of international law.

          <p>A preliminary report from Portugal's national transport safety office has identified a snapped cable as the cause of the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon. The investigation found that the cable connecting the two carriages gave way, causing the upper car to derail and crash into a building at approximately 60 km/h. The brakeman's attempts to apply emergency brakes were unsuccessful in preventing the accident, which killed 16 people and injured about 20 others. The report notes that while the cable failed, the rest of the mechanism appeared to be functioning correctly, with further investigation pending.</p>

Verstappen noted that while the 2020 Mercedes car might still be quicker overall, the specific conditions at Monza allowed for the new record.

          <p>International postal traffic into the United States has fallen by more than 80% since the Trump administration ended a tariff exemption for low-value imports, according to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The new rules, which took effect on August 29, require customs duties to be collected on parcels valued at $800 or less, a task previously waived. This change has caused major operational disruptions, as many foreign postal operators and carriers are not equipped to handle the new duty collection process. Consequently, 88 postal operators have suspended some or all services to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire governor of Illinois, is increasingly taking on a prominent role within the Democratic Party as a vocal opponent of Donald Trump. As a wealthy scion of the Hyatt Hotels family, Pritzker has used his personal fortune to support his political career and bring events like the Democratic National Convention to his home state. The article positions him as a key figure in the party's strategic battle against Trump's presidency. It notes the irony that recent gains in cryptocurrency have reportedly made Trump wealthier than Pritzker, who once called himself "a real billionaire" in contrast to the president.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order authorizing the U.S. State Department to impose sanctions and other penalties on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order creates a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, modeled after the state sponsor of terrorism classification, which could trigger economic sanctions, visa restrictions, and other consequences. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will "pay the price." The move aims to provide the administration with more tools to secure the release of dozens of Americans currently detained abroad.</p>

The changes, prompted by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's resignation, include bringing Sarah Jones, Alex Norris, and Mike Tapp into the Home Office to work under new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. The appointments, particularly of Tapp, a critic of Nigel Farage, signal a renewed focus on tackling illegal immigration.

          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced volatility as investors reacted to conflicting economic signals. A weaker-than-expected August jobs report, which showed only a 22,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, initially fueled optimism for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. However, this "bad news is good news" sentiment was quickly tempered by concerns that the slowing labor market could indicate a broader economic downturn. Major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fluctuated before closing the day nearly flat, reflecting Wall Street's uncertainty about the economy's direction and the Fed's next move.
