          <h2>Negative Equity in Car Trade-Ins Reaches Four-Year Peak</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 19:45:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report reveals that 26.6% of car trade-ins in the second quarter of 2025 involved negative equity, marking a four-year high for drivers owing more than their vehicle's value. This situation, where the average amount owed on upside-down loans was $6,754, complicates new car purchases as consumers must either pay the difference or roll it into a new loan. Experts suggest that factors such as extended loan terms, like the increasingly common 84-month options, and minimal down payments contribute significantly to this negative equity. To mitigate these challenges, consumers are advised to understand their credit score, seek pre-approved loans from various lenders, and consider guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance.

This win showcased a renewed offensive strategy, emphasizing fundamentals like shortening swings and capitalizing on situational opportunities, rather than solely relying on home runs. The team amassed 18 hits, primarily singles and doubles, and drew six walks, demonstrating a patient and effective approach at the plate. Pitcher Tyler Glasnow also settled into a strong performance after an initial struggle, further contributing to the team's promising form for the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested $58 million from Congress to bolster security for the executive and judicial branches, following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. These funds are primarily earmarked for the U.S. Marshals Service, with a specific focus on enhancing protection for Supreme Court justices. The administration also expressed support for increased security for congressional lawmakers, though it deferred to the legislative branch on specific measures. This request comes ahead of a Sept. 30 government funding deadline, amidst rising concerns about political violence and threats against public officials.</p>

          <p>Following the swift firing of head football coach DeShaun Foster after just five wins in 15 games, UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond faces intense scrutiny over his leadership of the program. Critics argue that Jarmond has mishandled the football team's direction, including the earlier decision to retain Chip Kelly and the subsequent hurried, seemingly unqualified hiring of Foster. Despite successes in other sports, the article emphasizes that football is the primary revenue driver and national presence for a Power Five school. The chancellor, Julio Frenk, is now urged to consider alternatives to allow Jarmond to make the next crucial coaching hire, given his past missteps.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a popular two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at the age of 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Edgar, who served from 1990 to 1998, is remembered for bringing greater financial stability to the state during the 1990s by cutting the budget and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent to fund public schools. A moderate Republican, he later became a vocal critic of Donald Trump, even supporting Kamala Harris's presidential bid.

This site, known for hosting graphic violence and white supremacist content, has also been frequented by several other school shooters in the past year. Officials previously stated Holly was "radicalized by an extremist network," and the ADL report underscores the role of online platforms in glorifying violent individuals and facilitating radicalization.

          <p>China's recent Victory Day parade, featuring President Xi Jinping alongside Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, was strategically designed to send a message beyond Washington, primarily targeting middle powers in the Global South. The parade projected an image of China as a strong alternative to Western-dominated frameworks, offering diplomatic lifelines to isolated regimes without requiring reform. This trilateral display aimed to reassure domestic audiences of China's strength, signal to Washington the limits of its sanctions, and demonstrate to developing nations that partnerships outside the Western sphere are viable for military and economic development. The optics conveyed an "axis of the excluded," rejecting Western terms of engagement.</p>

Business Secretary Peter Kyle admitted that Mandelson's appointment would have been "highly unlikely" if the full extent of his relationship with Epstein had been known at the time.

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox revealed that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is not cooperating with authorities but had an ideology "very different" from his conservative family. Investigators are gathering information from his friends and family, indicating Robinson was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology" found in "deep, dark internet culture." Cox also mentioned Robinson was in a relationship with a person transitioning from male to female, though its relevance to the motive is still unclear. The governor emphasized the destructive role of the internet and social media in driving extremism and hatred, calling for leaders to condemn political violence.</p>

          <p>Utah's recently enacted HB 128, which permits open carrying of firearms on college campuses by concealed-carry permit holders, is under renewed scrutiny following the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The law, passed in August, adds to Utah's already gun-friendly legislative landscape, which lacks red-flag laws and allows permitless concealed carry. University staff had previously voiced safety concerns about the law. While the legality of the suspect's weapon on campus is unclear, the incident highlights the debate over "school hardening" versus gun control, and the challenges of securing public spaces like campuses in states with broad gun access.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, son of US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly chosen to attend NYU's Washington, D.C. program, opting to stay close to his parents. This decision has sparked buzz about his potential future involvement in politics, especially given the program's focus on government, public policy, and journalism. While Barron was previously known to be attending NYU Stern School of Business, it remains unclear if he has changed his major to align with the D.C. program's political emphasis. His past assistance with his father's campaign further fuels speculation about his trajectory into public life.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight, DL1300, en route from Miami International Airport to Boston Logan International Airport, made a safe emergency landing back in Miami shortly after takeoff on Saturday. The diversion was prompted by a reported bird strike that affected one of the aircraft's two engines. Fortunately, all passengers and crew were unharmed in the incident. After the necessary checks, the plane eventually departed again, arriving in Boston approximately two hours later than its original scheduled time. Delta Air Lines apologized for any inconvenience caused to the passengers.</p>

          <p>The small Idaho town of Stanley and its Redfish Lake Lodge narrowly escaped destruction from two major wildfires in 2024, thanks to heroic firefighting efforts and fortunate weather shifts. This near-miss highlights the increasing threat of larger, hotter, and faster fires driven by the climate crisis, a trend observed across the US West and globally. Despite surviving, the community suffered significant economic impact due to closures and depleted firefighting resources during the "unprecedented" fire season. Local leaders and residents reflect on the experience, emphasizing the need for new strategies to thrive in a fire-prone climate, as the risk is not expected to diminish.</p>
