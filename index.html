          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to address critical issues such as trade disputes, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and NATO defense spending. Merz aims to establish a collaborative relationship with the U.S. while ensuring Germany is not perceived as a laggard in defense contributions, especially since Trump has frequently criticized Germany's trade practices and defense spending. Merz will likely emphasize Germany's support for Ukraine and the need for European involvement in peace negotiations, along with advocating for a zero-for-zero tariff deal between the U.S. and the EU. He will also seek to negotiate sector-specific tariffs that significantly impact the German economy. The meeting follows phone calls between the leaders, aiming to build on their rapport.</p>

          <p>The English government announced that from September 2026, any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals, regardless of their income, potentially saving parents £500 a year. This change is projected to make an additional 500,000 pupils eligible and lift 100,000 children out of poverty, costing the Department of Education £1 billion up to 2029. While largely welcomed, some critics argue that other measures, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective at reducing child poverty, and that the actual number of children lifted out of poverty may be less than claimed. The government also pledged £13m to food charities and will review school meal standards to ensure they are healthy, although there are no plans to introduce automatic enrolment for eligible children.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce lawyers report that filings typically peak in late summer and early spring, with slower periods around the winter holidays and summer vacations. A University of Washington study supports this, citing a "domestic ritual" calendar influencing couples to delay separation until after these symbolically charged times. While some experts believe sentimental reasons drive this pattern, others suggest it relates to tax filings or the end of summer family vacations. However, overall divorce rates in the U.S. have been declining, with a notable increase in divorces among people over 50, often driven by women seeking financial independence.</p>

          <p>During a New York City mayoral debate, Democratic candidates sparred over defunding the police and combating President Trump's immigration policies. Candidates like Andrew Cuomo faced accusations of previously supporting defunding the police, while others proposed increasing mental health outreach workers instead. Discussions also addressed rising crime and shoplifting, with some suggesting a guaranteed median income as a solution. Regarding immigration, candidates largely defended New York City's sanctuary status and vowed to limit police cooperation with ICE, with some promising to warn migrants about federal immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could severely impact asthma programs nationwide. These cuts threaten initiatives that provide education and management resources, potentially leading to increased emergency room visits and deaths, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. Experts worry about the loss of data collection and recommendations crucial for forming educated treatment plans, as well as the rollback of environmental protections. The Trump administration cites cost savings and efficiency as reasons for the cuts, but advocates argue that they will disproportionately harm at-risk populations.</p>

          <p>A recent EU drug report indicates a growing trend of synthetic substance use in Europe, with increasing amounts now being produced locally rather than trafficked from Asia or the Middle East. The rise in synthetic drug use, particularly cathinones, presents a public health concern due to their high potency and unknown long-term effects. While cocaine remains the most popular illicit stimulant, more Europeans are using multiple drugs simultaneously, contributing to drug-related deaths.

Lawmakers have declined to advance legislation that would prohibit minors from being held in adult jails, although the Governor's Office of Crime Prevention and Policy is seeking multi-agency solutions to reduce violations.</p>

          <p>Germany must recruit an additional 50,000 to 60,000 service personnel to meet NATO's updated defense requirements amid growing tensions with Russia, according to Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Germany is adapting its military posture in response to NATO's plans for collective defense, which involve bolstering the alliance's eastern flank. Pistorius has promoted a model that relies on voluntary service but also allows for compulsory conscription if needed. Germany had conscription in place for young men until 2011, when it was scrapped.</p>

However, some argue that prioritizing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist and congruent with consumer capitalism. Older generations tend to prioritize biological sex due to accumulated life experiences, including childbirth, menopause, and awareness of sex-based health differences.</p>
