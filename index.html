          <p>China has nominated Zou Jiayi, a former vice-minister of finance, as its candidate for the next president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).  Zou is expected to succeed Jin Liqun in January 2026.  Given China's significant voting share in the AIIB, Zou is the frontrunner for the position.

          <p>The Trump administration mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man with protected legal status, to El Salvador.
