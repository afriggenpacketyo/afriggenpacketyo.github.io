            <p>A new Museum of BBQ has debuted in Kansas City, Missouri, celebrating the diverse styles and flavors of American barbecue. A recent Southern Living survey revealed the best barbecue spots in each Southern state, with input from Southern chefs and barbecue experts. The article highlights top choices like Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q in Alabama, known for its white sauce, and Southern Soul Barbecue in Georgia, famous for its Brunswick stew. The guide also includes notable mentions such as Arthur Bryant's Barbecue in Missouri, tracing its roots back to the 'father of Kansas City barbecue,' Henry Perry.</p>

            <p>The US and China have been engaged in a rapid escalation of retaliatory tariffs, but some observers believe the trade war could end quickly once talks begin, given both sides' openness to dialogue. President Trump initially raised levies on Chinese goods significantly before pausing fresh tariffs for most trading partners, except China. Beijing countered with new levies on US goods, bringing the cumulative total to nearly 148%. The situation remains fluid, but the potential for a swift resolution hinges on successful negotiations.</p>

            <p>Israel has announced it will expand its offensive across most of Gaza, following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire. The military issued evacuation orders for Khan Younis and surrounding areas, preparing for strikes in response to projectile launches from Gaza. The IDF has completed the takeover of a security zone separating Rafah and Khan Younis, effectively cutting off the southern city. Areas in northern Gaza are also being evacuated to expand the security zone, with Israeli officials aiming to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages.</p>

            <p>Iran and the United States will hold further negotiations regarding Tehran's nuclear program, following a round of talks in Oman, marking the first interaction between the two nations since President Trump returned to the White House.

While the U.S. aims for the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program, Iran seeks to maintain some enrichment capabilities.

            <p>President Trump's escalating trade war with China is significantly impacting toy stores, as 77% of toys sold in the U.S. are manufactured in China. Amy Rutherford, owner of Pippin Toy Co., states that the price of a stuffed panda will rise from $32 to $80 due to the 145% tariff on Chinese products. Rutherford expresses concern that consumers will be unwilling to pay the increased prices and fears potential layoffs due to budget constraints. The lack of American-made toys to fill the store further compounds the problem.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs in the ongoing trade dispute. This decision aims to prevent price increases on these consumer goods, which are predominantly manufactured outside the US. Machines used in the production of semiconductors and flat-panel monitors are also included in the exemption. The US and China have been escalating tariffs, but this move signals an attempt to mitigate the impact on consumers.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs, including the 125% levies imposed on Chinese imports. This decision comes after concerns from US tech companies about potential price spikes, as many gadgets are made in China. Other electronic devices and components, such as semiconductors and memory cards, are also excluded. Some estimates suggested that iPhone prices could have tripled if the tariff costs were passed on to consumers, with Apple looking to diversify its supply chains to India and Vietnam.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's recent tariff actions have created a level of economic instability that will be difficult to reverse, eroding the credibility of the United States in international trade. Unlike previous administrations, Trump's policies are far-reaching and have triggered investor uncertainty, causing them to lose faith in the U.S. government. While other countries can recover from the loss of U.S. trade, the damage to America's reliability and alliances will be lasting. The president's actions are seen as a power grab from Congress, which has the constitutional right to levy taxes.</p>

            <p>Alex Garland's film 'Warfare,' co-directed with Ray Mendoza, presents a realistic and often horrifying depiction of a military operation during the Iraq War. The film strips away typical military drama tropes, focusing on the waiting and tension inherent in battle. Based on Mendoza's experiences in the 2006 Battle of Ramadi, 'Warfare' emphasizes the tedium and anxiety of war, diverging from traditional action storytelling. The film features a cast of rising stars and provides a neutral perspective on the conflict.</p>

            <p>The number of UK residents visiting the US has declined by 14.3% in March compared to the same month in 2024, potentially influenced by Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Analysts suggest claims of other countries “cheating” Americans and reports of deportations may deter tourists. The strong dollar and updated travel advisories from the UK and German governments warning of risks may also contribute to the decline. Concerns are rising that the trend could impact the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>

            <p>In Ukraine, DIY drone makers are helping fighters on the front lines, with operations like a secret drone-making workshop in Kyiv producing about 100 attack drones monthly. Volunteers, like Andrii Yukhno, are training others to make first-person view (FPV) drones equipped with high-explosive payloads. Despite Ukraine's innovation in drone technology, it lags behind Russia in production, leading to a reliance on both factory assembly lines and mom-and-pop operations. The uncertainty surrounding US support for Ukraine has also impacted morale.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of flights have been cancelled and trains suspended in Beijing and northern China due to strong winds, with gusts reaching up to 93mph. Millions were urged to stay indoors, and some state media outlets warned that people weighing less than 50kg may be "easily blown away". The strong winds are from a cold vortex system over Mongolia and are expected to last through the weekend. The city issued its first orange alert for strong winds in a decade.</p>

            <p>Iran and the United States have begun talks in Oman over Tehran's nuclear programme, marking the highest-level meeting between the two nations since 2018. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated his country wants a "fair agreement", with his spokesperson saying he did not expect talks to last long. The goal is to reach an agreement to limit, but not dismantle, its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. The talks also seek to de-escalate regional tensions and secure prisoner exchanges.</p>

            <p>Tennessee lawmakers, known for their strong stance on abortion, are now facing criticism for their policies affecting children after birth. A bill approved by the state senate allows public schools to check the citizenship or legal immigration status of every student, potentially denying education to undocumented children. This move is seen as unconstitutional and fiscally irresponsible, as it undermines the education of a vulnerable population. The bill has faced significant opposition, highlighting the divide over extremist policies in the US.</p>

            <p>Despite Donald Trump's tariffs sparking a trade war and financial market chaos, much of right-wing US media has remained supportive of the president. While economists and others warn of recession and inflation, conservative news sources like Fox News and Newsmax either applaud Trump's policies or downplay the negative impacts. Some exceptions exist, such as The Wall Street Journal, which has criticized Trump's actions. This unwavering support underscores the deep loyalty of right-wing media to Trump and his Maga movement.</p>

            <p>Credit card debt does not disappear when you die; instead, the responsibility falls to your estate, potentially affecting inheritances. Creditors can pursue assets transferred through transfer-on-death designations, making estate planning essential to protect beneficiaries. Consider consulting an estate planning attorney to explore alternatives to transfer-on-death designations. Also, be mindful of temporary 0% interest rates on credit cards, as rates can significantly increase once the promotional period ends. (not investment advice)</p>

China's countermeasures against the US are a necessary response to safeguard its own interests, and it is ready to work with the UK to support the multilateral trading system.</p>

            <p>President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles are expected to have massive global implications for the automotive industry, including a drop in vehicle sales, higher prices, and increased costs. Analysts predict a decrease of millions in vehicle sales, with the Center for Automotive Research estimating that costs for automakers in the U.S. alone will increase by $107.7 billion. The tariffs will likely be passed on to consumers, leading to lower sales and significant economic ripple effects.</p>
