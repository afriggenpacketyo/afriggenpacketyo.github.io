          <p>A massive outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) that disrupted thousands of global online platforms has been resolved. The day-long disruption affected a wide range of services, including social media, gaming, banking, and travel, highlighting modern society's dependence on a few major cloud providers. Amazon attributed the problem to issues with its domain name system (DNS) in its eastern U.S. region, which prevented users from connecting to numerous websites and applications. The incident caused significant operational issues for companies like Southwest Airlines, Amtrak, and many others relying on AWS infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread internet outage on Monday was caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error within Amazon Web Services' oldest and largest data center in northern Virginia. DNS acts as the internet's address book, and the failure meant AWS could not direct traffic to the websites and apps it hosts. This event underscores the risks of the internet's heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud computing giants, with AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform controlling a significant majority of the market. Experts note that while such errors are common, the scale of this outage was a stark reminder of the internet's concentrated infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following a new coalition deal that shifts her governing bloc further to the right. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the pacifist constitution. Her leadership comes amid public frustration over rising prices and internal party struggles, and her government's stability may be tested due to a slim majority. Despite her historic position, Takaichi has previously opposed measures promoting gender equality, such as same-sex marriage.</p>

The transfer occurred after meetings between U.S. envoys and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu aimed at keeping the peace process on track following recent violence. The return of all hostages, both living and deceased, remains a central component of the ongoing agreement.</p>

          <p>In his upcoming memoir, "You Thought You Knew," Kevin Federline makes several allegations about his ex-wife Britney Spears, depicting her as having engaged in erratic behavior as a wife and mother. The book claims she had substance abuse issues and exhibited frightening behavior towards their sons, prompting Federline's continued concern for her well-being. Spears has publicly refuted the claims, describing them as hurtful and an attempt to profit from her name, especially now that child support payments have ended. The memoir revisits their tumultuous relationship and the controversial conservatorship that controlled Spears's life for years.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exporters Report Increased Use of Yuan for International Trade Settlements</h2>

          <p>Exporters at China's Canton Fair are observing a growing trend of international clients opting to use the Chinese yuan for trade settlements instead of the U.S. dollar. Businesses report that customers from Southeast Asia and Central Asia are increasingly requesting yuan-based transactions, with some companies seeing such orders rise to as much as 20% of their total exports. This shift is partly driven by infrastructure projects in developing nations led by Chinese suppliers, which encourages the use of their native currency. The trend reflects a gradual but noticeable increase in the yuan's role in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool is facing a crisis of form, having lost four consecutive games and slipping to fourth in the Premier League table despite significant summer spending. Manager Arne Slot is under pressure as expensive new signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak struggle to make an impact, and the team appears vulnerable defensively and ineffective in attack. Key issues include Mohamed Salah's goal drought, an unsettled defense still adjusting to the loss of Trent Alexander-Arnold, and a lack of creativity in the midfield. The article analyzes the pressing questions Slot must answer to reverse the team's fortunes.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces are using drones to target stranded Russian troops attempting to escape from islands in the Dnipro delta, an area described as a "death zone." Hundreds of Russian soldiers are reportedly marooned on the marshy islands with dwindling supplies of food and water, forcing them to make desperate escape attempts in small boats. Footage shows these boats being destroyed by Ukrainian suicide drones. The river has become a perilous front line since Kherson's liberation, with constant surveillance and artillery fire making resupply and rotation exceptionally difficult for Russian forces.</p>

          <p>A new project named "Reefline" is underway to create a seven-mile-long artificial reef and underwater art park off the coast of Miami Beach. The installation will feature a series of large-scale sculptures made from marine-grade concrete, which will serve as habitats for transplanted, resilient local corals. The project aims to restore the area's marine ecosystem, which lost its natural reef decades ago, while also creating a unique ecotourism attraction accessible to snorkelers. Funded by the city and private donations, the first phase includes an underwater "traffic jam" of 22 concrete cars designed by artist Leandro Ehrlich.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have formally requested that the U.S. Supreme Court uphold a lower court's order blocking the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard into Chicago. In their brief, lawyers argued that the administration has mischaracterized the situation and that state and local law enforcement are capable of handling protest activities. They contend that federalizing the Guard for deployment within the city would upset the constitutional balance of power between federal and state governments. The current temporary restraining order is set to expire shortly, adding urgency to the legal battle.</p>

          <h2>'Winology' Theory Gains Traction Online, Positing Unfair Western Views of China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A theory known as "winology," developed by Chinese academics, is gaining popularity on social media, arguing that the West unfairly dismisses China's achievements due to hierarchical thinking. The concept suggests that Western perspectives often place nations in a pecking order, which prevents them from acknowledging China as a legitimate global leader in various fields. This viewpoint has sparked intellectual discussions, including a recent seminar at Wuhan University, as it offers a framework for understanding perceived biases in how China's economic and technological rise is portrayed internationally.</p>

          <p>Construction has started on a new ballroom at the White House, with crews demolishing parts of the East Wing's covered entryway. The project, championed by President Donald Trump and said to be privately funded, involves a "fully modernized" addition that will be near, but not touching, the main historic structure. The plan has raised concerns among some historians, who worry that the process is being rushed without the typical rigorous public review process for such a significant national building. The new structure is designed to host hundreds of guests and will feature a lavish interior.</p>

          <p>Brazil's government has approved a license for the state-run oil company Petrobras to begin drilling for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups. The decision comes just ahead of the COP30 UN climate talks, which will be hosted in Brazil, and activists have labeled it a "sabotage" of climate goals. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's administration has defended the plan, arguing the revenue is needed to fund the country's green transition. Critics warn of the potential environmental risks to the world's largest tropical rainforest and its Indigenous communities.</p>
