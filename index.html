          <p>Australia has granted asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist from Hong Kong who fled the city in 2020. Hui faced criminal charges related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was among several activists targeted by police with million-dollar bounties. In a social media post, Hui confirmed his asylum status and expressed gratitude to the Australian government, while also urging them to do more to help other activists who remain jailed in Hong Kong. He lamented his exile, stating that while immigrants can return home, political refugees cannot.</p>

          <p>The British horseracing industry has announced an unprecedented strike, canceling all races scheduled for September 10th to protest a proposed government tax increase on betting. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) is campaigning against a plan to raise the remote gambling tax, which they argue would be catastrophic for the sport. The BHA's economic analysis predicts a potential £330 million loss in revenue and the loss of over 2,700 jobs in the first year alone. This action marks the first time the sport has voluntarily stopped racing in protest of government policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Increased government scrutiny on Chinese businesses evading social insurance payments is expected to make hiring retirees more attractive, sparking concerns among young job seekers. Companies like McDonald's have already been hiring older workers, as they are not required to pay social insurance contributions for them, leading to online debate about shrinking opportunities for recent graduates. A new judicial interpretation from the Supreme People's Court, effective next month, will invalidate agreements to forgo these contributions, potentially reinforcing the trend of hiring retirees. This policy is also seen as a crucial step in addressing China's growing pension crisis.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, stating it is more than a typical protest group. Cooper cited incidents of alleged violent disorder and aggravated burglary for which the group claimed responsibility, noting the Crown Prosecution Service assessed these charges as having a "terrorism connection." Her comments follow a Metropolitan Police announcement that 60 more individuals will be prosecuted for supporting the group, bringing the total arrests to over 700 since the ban. The group has primarily targeted arms companies with ties to Israel.</p>

          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel, 76, is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and auctioning his personal collection due to a recent health diagnosis. In May, Joel revealed he is battling normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his balance, vision, and hearing, which has also led to the cancellation of his tour dates through mid-2026. The shop, opened in 2010, served as a showcase for his collection of over 75 vintage bikes and a way to support the local Oyster Bay community. A date for the auction has not yet been announced.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, secured a 41-24 victory over Argentina in their Rugby Championship opener, a win that propelled them back to the number one spot in world rankings for the first time in four years. The All Blacks established a strong lead in the first half, but Argentina mounted a spirited comeback in the second, narrowing the deficit to just seven points at one stage. However, two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho sealed the win for New Zealand. The victory also extends Argentina's winless streak against the All Blacks on home soil.</p>

          <p>West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. at the request of the Trump administration. This move escalates a federal intervention aimed at overhauling policing and addressing crime and homelessness in the capital, following an executive order that federalized local police forces. The deployment has been met with protests from residents and city officials who argue the intervention is an overreach of federal power, particularly as local data shows violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term. The additional troops will bolster an existing presence of federal law enforcement and D.C. National Guard members.</p>

This year, around 28,000 people have arrived via small boats, with concerns growing about the use of larger, more dangerous "mega dinghies" by people smugglers.

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on how their appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to a profound connection forged through life experiences. Initially dismissing masterpieces like Piero della Francesca's "Madonna del Parto" as unrelatable, the author found new meaning in art after personal trauma and the journey into motherhood. The essay contrasts this with the work of contemporary artist Jenny Saville, whose motherhood paintings are heavily influenced by Renaissance masters. Ultimately, the author concludes that life's significant events unlock the emotional depth of historical art, making it resonate in ways it couldn't for a younger, more cynical self.</p>

At least 40 people were reported killed across Gaza on Saturday, as Israel prepares for a plan to forcibly displace one million people from the city to camps in the south. In Israel, a general strike is planned to protest the government's occupation plan, which critics say endangers the lives of hostages held by Hamas. The conflict, which began with Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, has led to over 61,000 Palestinian deaths and a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

The rule suggests that a road's speed limit should be set at the speed at which 85% of drivers travel, effectively letting the fastest drivers determine the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists.

          <p>Health officials are raising awareness about tick prevention as doctors across the U.S. report a significant increase in emergency room visits for tick bites this summer. Data from the CDC shows that May had the highest rate of tick-related ER visits since 2019, a trend potentially linked to warmer, more humid conditions expanding tick habitats and seasons. While increased public awareness may be leading to earlier detection and treatment, the rise is concerning due to the risk of tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease. Experts advise using insect repellent and performing thorough checks after being outdoors to mitigate risk.</p>

          <p>In the trial of Bryan Patrick Miller, the "Zombie Hunter" convicted of the Phoenix canal murders, his defense team presented a unique argument: he was not guilty by reason of insanity due to severe childhood abuse. Attorneys claimed Miller's mother, a detention officer, subjected him to physical and psychological torture, causing him to develop dissociative amnesia and a violent alternate personality. While admitting Miller committed the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, the defense argued he had no memory of the events. The judge acknowledged the evidence of childhood abuse but ultimately found Miller guilty and sentenced him to death.</p>
