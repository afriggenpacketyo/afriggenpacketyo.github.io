        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Democrats have introduced new legislation aiming to define specific legal thresholds for advanced microchips that would require congressional approval before export to China. This initiative is driven by national security concerns, as lawmakers believe the Chinese Communist Party has leveraged US cutting-edge technology for military modernization, surveillance, and influence campaigns. The proposed bill outlines detailed performance benchmarks for chips, and if these are met, the US government would need to prove that the export serves American national security interests, with Congress ultimately deciding on approval. This move seeks to establish clearer limits in the ongoing debate over controlling technology flow.</p>

          <p>A tour bus returning from Niagara Falls tragically overturned on Interstate 90 in Upstate New York, leading to at least four deaths, including one child, and injuring dozens of the 52 people on board. The bus, carrying passengers predominantly of Indian, Chinese, or Filipino descent, lost control for unknown reasons, veering into a median before over-correcting and ending in a ditch. Emergency crews and multiple medical helicopters responded, with many patients transported to local hospitals for head injuries and fractures. New York Governor Kathy Hochul acknowledged the tragic incident, which caused extensive road closures and delays.</p>

          <p>Post-tropical cyclone Erin, previously the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is moving away from the northeastern U.S. coast but continues to generate dangerous surf and rip currents along much of the Eastern Seaboard. Although no longer a hurricane, it remains a powerful low-pressure system, with hurricane-force winds extending far from its center. Coastal areas from the mid-Atlantic to New England, including North Carolina's Outer Banks, New York City, and the Jersey Shore, are experiencing rough ocean conditions, prompting swimming prohibitions and dozens of rescues. The National Hurricane Center has issued its final advisory, but the threat to swimmers persists through the weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% equity stake in Intel, a major Silicon Valley chipmaker, a deal confirmed by Intel and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This historic agreement, valued at approximately $11 billion, is funded by converting remaining CHIPS and Science Act grants and additional Secure Enclave program awards, with the government purchasing non-voting shares. Trump emphasized the deal's role in boosting domestic chip production and strengthening America's technological edge against China, a key focus of his trade policies. This move, while rare, mirrors past government interventions in struggling industries like General Motors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Hong Kong can establish a vital role in the Greater Bay Area by focusing on climate resilience, presenting it as both an environmental necessity and a shrewd economic strategy. With the region's high economic activity and shared exposure to extreme weather, a coordinated approach is crucial for protecting trade, attracting investment, and ensuring sustainable growth. The article advocates for a cross-border early warning system and unified infrastructure standards, highlighting that every dollar invested in resilient infrastructure can generate up to four dollars in benefits.

          <p>Ether, the cryptocurrency underpinning the Ethereum blockchain, reached a new record high for the first time since 2021, surging significantly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential interest rate cuts. Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole prompted a "panicked repositioning" among traders, leading to substantial short liquidations for ETH and further propelling its price. This rally signifies renewed market momentum for monetary easing, which appears to align with the administration's policy direction. The article highlights Ether's recent outperformance of Bitcoin, largely due to regulatory tailwinds and growing institutional interest in stablecoins, many of which utilize the Ethereum network.

The announcement caused shares of prominent furniture and home goods companies like Wayfair and RH to drop, while La-Z-Boy, which primarily manufactures domestically, saw its stock increase.

          <p>San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies have arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro, the parents of 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, on suspicion of murder after the baby was reported kidnapped last week. Rebecca Haro initially claimed the infant was abducted from a store parking lot after she was punched, but investigators found "inconsistencies" in her story and could not rule out foul play. Despite the arrests, the search for Emmanuel continues, with detectives reviewing security footage and having previously removed another child from the home. Jake Haro, who has a prior conviction for child cruelty, had his ex-wife file for a restraining order amid these developments.</p>

          <p>Meta is preparing to launch its first consumer-ready smart glasses with a digital display, codenamed Hypernova, alongside a companion wristband at its Connect conference next month. The Hypernova glasses, expected to cost around $800 and sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, will feature a small color display in the right lens for simple information like text messages. The wristband, developed by Meta's CTRL Labs, will allow control via hand gestures, utilizing sEMG sensor technology to interpret electrical signals from arm movements. While Meta is setting low sales expectations due to the device's increased complexity, it aims to gather data to improve future full AR glasses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix's animated sensation, "KPop Demon Hunters," is anticipated to lead the box office this weekend with special sing-along theatrical screenings across more than 1,750 North American screens. Despite its prior success as a streaming hit, industry projections suggest the film could gross $16 million to $22 million, potentially surpassing the official No. 1 movie, "Weapons." However, Netflix continues its policy of not disclosing box office figures, a stance that frustrates industry experts and underscores the streaming giant's often-contentious relationship with traditional cinemas. This theatrical release is primarily viewed as a marketing strategy to leverage the film's viral popularity and boost subscriber engagement.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of actively trying to prevent a peace meeting with Vladimir Putin, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to broker such a summit. Trump, who recently met with Putin, described the two leaders as "oil and vinegar," noting the difficulty in bringing them together. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, however, blamed Ukraine for hindering progress, stating the agenda for a summit is "not ready at all." Zelensky, who seeks robust security guarantees reflecting NATO's Article 5 from Western allies, believes recent diplomatic efforts in Washington were a success, despite Russia launching heavy attacks on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares, Google's parent company, saw an increase of over 3% after reports emerged that Apple is in preliminary talks to potentially use Google's Gemini AI models for an enhanced version of its Siri assistant. Apple reportedly sought Google's expertise in developing a custom AI model for a new Siri, possibly launching next year, amidst its own challenges in defining an AI strategy. This development coincides with Google facing regulatory scrutiny over its search monopoly, including its lucrative agreements with Apple. Google's Gemini models are recognized for their advanced AI capabilities, such as summarizing videos and processing diverse inputs beyond Siri's current functions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued an order authorizing National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to carry weapons, escalating the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. President Trump had previously deployed approximately 2,000 troops and assumed control of the city's police force, initially without weapons, to address what he described as "out of control" crime. This decision to arm the Guard, though praised by the administration for enhancing "total safety," is largely unpopular among D.C. residents. Trump is also contemplating declaring a national emergency to extend the deployment beyond its initial 30-day period and potentially expand it to other cities like Chicago.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains credit card forbearance as a temporary arrangement offered by issuers, allowing borrowers to pause or reduce payments during financial hardship, distinguishing it from debt forgiveness. With credit card balances hitting new highs and delinquencies rising, particularly among younger borrowers, forbearance can provide crucial breathing room. Eligibility typically requires proof of job loss, unexpected expenses, or a history of on-time payments, and proactive outreach to the issuer is essential. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfers, or even bankruptcy are suggested to regain control of escalating debt.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lyle Menendez appeared before California's parole board for a hearing, following his brother Erik's denial of release, as both seek freedom after decades imprisoned for the 1989 murders of their parents. Their sentences were recently reduced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under youth offender laws. The brothers contend they acted in self-defense due to alleged parental abuse, a claim Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman disputes, citing inconsistencies and lack of full responsibility. Erik's parole denial was partly attributed to "behavior in prison," including policy violations. Lyle's hearing continues this high-profile legal saga, with prosecutors arguing against their release.</p>
