Financial experts advise that storing emergency funds in a high-yield account is a safe way to make money grow faster due to much higher compounding interest. To secure the best rates, consumers are encouraged to explore options at online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and to compare various accounts based on interest rates and potential fees.

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for becoming more influential and likable at work. This technique involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said, which showcases competence and builds trust. Research indicates that this practice correlates with positive performance reviews and career success, as it demonstrates empathy and a willingness to learn, making it a crucial skill for professional and personal relationships.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is reportedly examining allegations of mortgage fraud against Senator Adam Schiff, stemming from a referral by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The claims suggest Schiff falsified documents by listing homes in both Maryland and California as his primary residence to obtain more favorable loan terms over many years. A Cornell law professor suggests the DOJ is likely gathering extensive documentation to build an airtight case before proceeding, especially given the high-profile political nature of the investigation and Schiff's long-standing adversarial relationship with former President Trump.</p>

          <p>While meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, President Donald Trump expressed his disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine. Trump announced he is reducing the 50-day deadline he previously set for Russia to agree to a peace deal or face severe secondary tariffs on its trade partners. He criticized Putin for launching rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities shortly after suggesting an openness to ending hostilities, but did not specify the new, shorter timeline for the ultimatum.</p>

She describes the constant humiliation and danger of living in homes not designed for her needs, from being trapped during a fire alarm to being unable to reach her crying child. The article connects these modern struggles to a history of exclusion, such as "ugly laws," and argues that creating accessible homes is essential for full community participation and would benefit everyone as they age.</p>

          <p>Virtual private network (VPN) apps have surged to the top of Apple's App Store charts in the UK after new age verification requirements under the Online Safety Act took effect. Major platforms like PornHub and Reddit must now check users' ages, prompting many to use VPNs to disguise their location and bypass the checks. One VPN provider reported an 1,800% increase in UK sign-ups over the weekend. Cybersecurity experts warn that many free VPN services carry significant privacy and security risks, potentially exposing user data.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining population, China has launched its first nationwide childcare subsidy program. The government will provide an annual payment of 3,600 yuan for every child born on or after January 1, 2025, until they reach the age of three. This policy marks a significant step towards direct financial support for families, aiming to ease the economic burden of raising children. However, some economists caution that the subsidy amount is likely too small to significantly impact the birth rate or household consumption in the near term.</p>

          <p>This article explores why some individuals are more emotionally sensitive, reacting intensely to minor slights or comments. It explains that heightened sensitivity can be influenced by both genetic temperament and life experiences, such as past trauma or rejection. While being attuned to emotions isn't inherently negative, constant hurt feelings can disrupt relationships. The article offers coping strategies, such as questioning worst-case assumptions, evaluating the long-term significance of a perceived slight, and learning to communicate feelings constructively rather than reacting impulsively.</p>

          <p>Horst Mahler, a controversial figure in German history, has died at the age of 89. Mahler was a founding member of the violent far-left Red Army Faction in the 1970s and was imprisoned for bank robberies. After his release, he switched to the political far-right, eventually gaining notoriety and further prison sentences for Holocaust denial and antisemitic incitement. His life represents a rare and extreme political trajectory, from radical left-wing militant to neo-Nazi extremist, leaving a complex and dark legacy in post-war Germany.</p>
