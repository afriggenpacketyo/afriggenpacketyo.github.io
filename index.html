          <p>The UK Transport Secretary has approved plans for a £2.2 billion expansion at London Gatwick Airport, involving moving the Northern Runway to bring it into regular use. This project aims to create thousands of jobs and billions in investment, increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hails it as a boost for economic growth and tourism, environmental groups and the Green Party criticize it as a "disaster" that ignores climate science. The decision follows previous concerns over traffic and noise, addressed by stricter controls and public transport targets.</p>

          <p>A recent call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been characterized as "pragmatic, positive, and constructive," indicating a shift towards accommodation rather than escalation in US-China relations. This emerging reality reflects a pragmatic acceptance of mutual dependence despite strategic competition, establishing a framework for global stability. The article suggests that while Trump's previous administration pursued economic pressure, the current interdependence between the two powers in hi-tech and supply chain sectors necessitates cautious competition. This dynamic aims to prevent mutually devastating all-out conflict.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing for an intense diplomatic week at the United Nations General Assembly, seeking "robust action" against Russia as concerns grow that the conflict could extend to NATO territory. Recent alleged Russian drone and fighter jet incursions into Polish and Estonian airspace have heightened these fears, prompting condemnation from NATO allies. Despite President Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire, Russia shows no signs of concession, continuing daily strikes on Ukraine. Zelenskyy plans to push for further sanctions, particularly on Russian energy, and will meet with Trump during his visit.</p>

          <p>Ryan Easley, an animal handler at Growler Pines Tiger Preserve in Oklahoma, was tragically killed by a tiger under his care. The preserve described the incident as an "accident," acknowledging the inherent risks but emphasizing Easley's deep love and respect for the animals. All tours at the private facility, known for its tiger viewings and training demonstrations, have been canceled indefinitely. PETA noted that Easley had acquired his tigers from figures featured in the Netflix series "Tiger King," highlighting connections to controversial big cat owners. A GoFundMe for Easley's family has raised over $18,000.</p>

          <p>Tavia Hunt, wife of Kansas City Chiefs CEO Clark Hunt, publicly criticized those celebrating the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, who was killed nearly two weeks prior. Hunt emphasized the tragedy of a man's life ending for his beliefs, leaving a family bereaved, and stated that such celebrations reflect poorly on the critics themselves. Her comments followed a memorial service where Kirk's widow, Erika, expressed forgiveness for the alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, advocating love over hate.

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has unveiled plans to abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for migrants, replacing it with five-year visas requiring reapplication and stricter criteria, including higher salary thresholds and English proficiency. The party argues this policy, which would affect hundreds of thousands of migrants, aims to curb welfare dependency and save the UK an estimated £234 billion over migrants' lifetimes. While the government is already considering extending ILR wait times, Reform's proposal faces criticism from Labour and Liberal Democrats, who question its economic figures and potential disruption to businesses.</p>

The article also dismisses ongoing speculation about a shift away from the U.S. dollar for Saudi oil trade, affirming the dollar's foundational role in crude exports.

While acknowledging that not all self-help is a scam and some academic-backed approaches exist, the article suggests an unhealthy obsession with betterment and productivity. It argues that focusing solely on individual self-help can diminish community engagement and the strengthening of interpersonal relationships, which are crucial for well-being.</p>

Cruz, who chairs the Senate's commerce committee, argues that the current age of 65 forces "thousands of highly qualified and experienced pilots into early retirement." This initiative, supported by an airline trade group, will be discussed at an upcoming United Nations aviation meeting. However, Congress rejected a similar proposal in 2024, with the FAA calling for a scientific and safety analysis before any changes.</p>

          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the long-held belief that promoting two-parent families is the primary solution to racial inequality, particularly for Black children. Her research reveals that Black children in two-parent homes still face significant disadvantages compared to white children in similar family structures, often performing only as well as white children from single-parent homes. The article highlights that despite representing half of all Black children, two-parent Black families are largely ignored in research. Cross argues that the singular focus on family structure diverts resources from more effective interventions like direct cash assistance or childcare subsidies, and overlooks the pervasive impact of structural racism and resource disparities.</p>

          <p>An inquest has revealed that former England rugby international Tom Voyce was nearly three times over the drink-drive limit when his vehicle was swept into a river during a storm. The 43-year-old had been at a shoot and then a pub before his disappearance. Pathologist Clive Bloxham stated that while Voyce's blood alcohol levels would have impaired his judgment, it was not the direct cause of death. The rugby player, who won nine caps for England, was reported missing by his wife and later found deceased. The inquest continues to determine the full circumstances of this tragic event.</p>

However, optimism for direct private-equity investments has slightly dimmed from the previous year, and there's a notable retreat from startup and early-stage investing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, while both offering diversified investment baskets, have key differences that impact investors. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, providing real-time pricing, whereas mutual fund transactions are processed at day-end prices. A significant advantage of ETFs is their tax efficiency, particularly in taxable brokerage accounts, due to "in-kind" transactions that often avoid capital gains distributions common in mutual funds. Additionally, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios, making them cheaper to own. However, mutual funds offer a larger universe of options and are more commonly available in 401(k) plans.

While some strategists and elected officials advocate for broadening the party's appeal, few have taken controversial stances that might attract working-class voters. The article highlights California Governor Gavin Newsom as a rare exception, who has publicly expressed moderate views on issues like trans athletes. However, fear of primary backlash often silences other Democrats who privately agree with more mainstream cultural sentiments, leading to a focus on rhetorical adjustments rather than substantive policy changes, which may hinder their ability to win back crucial states.</p>

          <p>A potential Supreme Court ruling allowing President Trump to remove a Federal Reserve governor could pave the way for him to fill the central bank with loyalists, granting unprecedented power. Beyond setting interest rates, the Fed controls the money supply, access to the financial system, and has vast emergency lending authority with few legal limits. This article warns that such control could allow the president to use the Fed as a "bottomless slush fund" to reward allies, fund favored industries, or even punish political enemies through "debanking."

The article explains that omega-3s may reduce inflammation and protect neurons, while antioxidants counteract oxidative stress linked to aging. Additionally, walnuts support cardiovascular health, which is closely tied to brain function.
