          <p>Following immigration raids in Los Angeles, lawyers report that immigrant families, including those with young children, have been held in cramped conditions with insufficient food and water. One family of five, including a three-year-old, was given minimal rations over 48 hours, and agents initially provided only one bottle of water for the entire family. The situation unfolds as marines are set to join the National Guard in Los Angeles to manage protests against the raids, a move ordered by President Trump despite objections from California's governor.

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, driven by a slide in food prices, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. This is the lowest level since February 2019, with food inflation at 0.99% and vegetable inflation dipping by 13.7%. The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%. India is also in trade talks with the U.S. to secure a deal before a potential 26% tariff is imposed on its goods. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and Republicans in Congress have ended California's ability to dictate national emissions standards for new vehicles, overturning a Biden-era EPA waiver that allowed California to set stricter regulations, including mandating nearly all vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035. Republicans argue the Clean Air Act was not intended to give one state such power over the automotive industry. The move aims to protect American jobs and ensure the shift to electric vehicles is driven by innovation and consumer choice, rather than government mandates. The action also prevents California's Advanced Clean Trucks regulations from requiring new heavy-duty vehicles to be zero-emission.</p>

Pop Mart's overseas revenue has risen significantly, and its success is likened to other acclaimed Chinese products like the video game Black Myth: Wukong and the animated film Ne Zha 2.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Melanie Stansbury are urging President Trump to reverse course on the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut government spending. In a letter, they propose alternative policy recommendations that they claim would save the U.S. more than $2 trillion over 10 years. Warren's suggestions include cracking down on prescription drug middlemen, eliminating waste in federal charter school programs, and reforming the estate tax exemption.

          <p>Consumer advocates are expressing concern over the rapid growth of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services, which they fear are contributing to a growing debt burden for consumers. While BNPL companies claim their services offer a healthier alternative to credit cards, critics argue they encourage overspending and make purchases seem more affordable than they are. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has recently rolled back regulations for BNPL companies, and data shows that many users have multiple BNPL loans and higher balances on other forms of credit. Some users rely on BNPL for necessities like groceries, indicating potential financial strain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans suggests that the collective rituals surrounding a match, such as the arrival of the team bus and collective chanting, can be more emotionally intense than the game itself. The author argues that football is a collective ritual and a public theatre of identity, where the game is just one element. While neurophysiological studies can provide some insights, understanding the emotional weight of these moments requires asking fans about their interpretations within a broader historical and cultural context. Despite globalization and commercialization, football's collectivities remain valuable in an increasingly individualized world.</p>

They argue that Harvard's claims about campus antisemitism misrepresent Jewish diversity and violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by subjecting Jews to harmful stereotypes.

While hard-line Israelis prefer the total dismantlement of Iran's centrifuges, a negotiated settlement could allow Israel to build on its advantage by pursuing closer ties with Arab states. A more regionally integrated Iran, with a stake in regional peace and stability, could lead to a less belligerent foreign policy. A diplomatic deal, though flawed, could put Iran on a path defined by its economic and pragmatic interests.</p>

Non-essential staff and their families are being removed, and U.S. officials have restricted staff movements within Israel.

The U.S. State Department says it is constantly assessing the appropriate personnel posture at all embassies, and the decision was made based on the latest analysis.</p>

          <p>Japan's Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by a doctor convicted of aiding the suicide of a woman with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2019, finalizing his 18-year prison sentence. The court rejected arguments that the conviction violated the constitutional right to self-determination, as euthanasia is not legally recognized in Japan. The doctor, Yoshikazu Okubo, was found guilty of administering a lethal dose of a sedative to Yuri Hayashi, with the court deeming his actions "not socially acceptable." Okubo was also convicted of killing another individual in a separate incident.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, aimed at deterring immigration, has led to a radical escalation in enforcement tactics, according to a Wall Street Journal report. While Trump has been successful in deterring both legal and illegal migration, the slowdown in border crossings has made it more difficult to exceed previous deportation numbers. The administration has resorted to more aggressive tactics, leading to protests and clashes between civilians and agents of the state. The decline in new arrivals is also hurting the US economy, exacerbating labor shortages and potentially reversing economic gains.</p>

          <p>Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has erupted for the 25th time since December, spewing lava fountains reaching heights of over 330 feet.

This ongoing eruption, which began almost six months ago, has been pausing and resuming, with most eruptive episodes lasting about a day or less. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) warns of high levels of volcanic gas, which can cause respiratory problems, and the hazard of Pele's hair and other volcanic fragments falling near the eruptive vents.</p>

The Polish firm Pepco owned Poundland since 2016, but had to auction the brand off after sales slumped over the past year. The chain, which has 825 UK stores and 16,000 staff, has struggled to compete with other discount retailers. A proposed restructure will be put to the High Court in England following the sale, and Pepco will retain a minority investment interest in Poundland.</p>
