          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady, amidst expectations of higher inflation and reduced economic growth, keeping the key borrowing rate between 4.25%-4.5%. Despite this decision, the committee's "dot plot" still indicates the possibility of two rate cuts by the end of 2025, though future cuts for 2026 and 2027 were reduced. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank is positioned to wait for more economic clarity before making any policy adjustments.

Israel claims its strikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities and military infrastructure, while Iran retaliated with missile launches at Israel.

Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow, but her defense argued that fellow law enforcement officers were responsible. The first trial ended in a mistrial, while the second trial included dramatic moments and conflicting narratives from both sides.

          <p>The Federal Reserve opted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining a cautious approach amid potential effects of President Trump's tariff policies. The central bank's forecast indicates some concern about a possible resurgence of inflation, with the personal consumption expenditures index expected to rise. Despite this, the Fed projects two quarter-point interest-rate cuts over the remainder of 2025, defying Trump's calls for lower rates. Powell noted that tariffs would likely push up prices and weigh on economic activity, but the effects would depend on the ultimate level of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study in Nature indicates that climate change will significantly reduce the yields of key staple crops by the end of the century, even with adaptation efforts. The largest declines are expected in major food-producing regions, such as the US Midwest, leading to higher food prices globally. For every degree Celsius of warming, global food production is likely to decline by 120 calories per person per day. While some cooler countries like Russia and Canada may see larger harvests, the overall decrease in food production poses a significant threat to global food security.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, maintaining its "wait-and-see" approach while assessing the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. The central bank expects inflation to worsen in the coming months but still foresees two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, mirroring its projections from March. The Fed cited solid labor market conditions and an economy growing at a "solid pace," but also signaled caution regarding the economic outlook. Economists anticipate a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

Military experts suggest that multiple bombing rounds may be needed, and ground personnel may need to be deployed.

          <p>According to an annual report released by the Social Security Board of Trustees on Wednesday, the trust fund Social Security relies on to pay retirement benefits may be depleted in 2033. At that time, 77% of those benefits will be payable. Social Security's combined trust funds will have enough revenue to pay scheduled benefits and administrative costs until 2034, one year earlier than projected last year. (not investment advice)</p>
