          <p>The International Monetary Fund has significantly lowered its U.S. growth forecast for 2025 to 1.8% from 2.7%, citing the negative impact of President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs and subsequent countermeasures from trading partners. This has shaken stocks and prompted the IMF to increase its estimate of a U.S. recession to 40%. The IMF also reduced its global growth forecast to 2.8%. The revised forecast includes data available as of April 4, incorporating the tariffs but excluding later developments like the 90-day pause on higher rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has rebounded above $90,000, reaching its highest level since March, as investors seek refuge from stock market turbulence and a declining U.S. dollar. This surge coincides with President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and renewed speculation about his potential removal. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin saw significant inflows, suggesting a decoupling of bitcoin from traditional risk assets. Analysts note that while bitcoin is showing resilience, sustained gains above $93,000 may require a catalyst like Fed easing or tariff agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Margaret Sullivan argues that President Trump's targeting of NPR and PBS is a predictable move in his anti-media playbook, aimed at controlling the political narrative. She notes that Trump's administration is drafting a memo to eliminate federal funding for public media, labeling them as "radical left 'monsters'." Sullivan contends that while NPR and PBS are not perfect, they are a crucial part of the fact-based news ecosystem necessary for democratic self-governance, especially as corporate ownership of media increases.</p>
