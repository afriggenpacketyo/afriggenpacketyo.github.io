          <p>Major broadcast group Nexstar Media is continuing to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations while it evaluates the show's content. This decision follows Kimmel's temporary suspension by Disney after he made comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement. Kimmel addressed the preemption, noting that his show is currently not airing in about 20% of the country, including Washington, D.C. Nexstar stated it is in discussions with Disney to ensure the program respects the communities it serves.</p>

          <p>An attack on a Dallas ICE facility resulted in the deaths of two detainees and one injury after a gunman opened fire from a nearby rooftop. The suspect, identified as Joshua Jahn, was later found deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI indicated an ideological motive, citing an engraved shell casing with the phrase "ANTI ICE," which prompted condemnation from Trump administration officials who linked the violence to anti-ICE rhetoric. The incident is being investigated as the latest in a series of violent acts targeting ICE facilities in Texas.</p>

It references comments from figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who have used terms like "authoritarian" and "Gestapo" to describe the agency's actions. The piece frames this rhetoric as resurfacing in the wake of a fatal sniper attack on a Dallas ICE facility, connecting the political discourse to a reported increase in assaults on federal immigration officers.</p>

Acknowledging concerns about a potential market bubble, Altman stated that such large-scale infrastructure is necessary to advance AI capabilities and that cycles of overinvestment and underinvestment are typical of technological revolutions.

          <p>An unusually aggressive squirrel is responsible for attacking at least five people in a San Rafael, California neighborhood, with two victims requiring emergency room visits. Residents described the squirrel launching unprovoked attacks, clawing and biting them, leading to bloody injuries. A local wildlife rescue organization speculates the animal's behavior may stem from being hand-fed by humans as a baby, which can cause wild animals to lose their natural fear. Officials have posted warning flyers, and experts remind the public not to feed wildlife.</p>

          <p>The UK government has once again delayed its announcement on the Northern Powerhouse Rail project, a high-speed line intended to connect northern English cities like Liverpool and Manchester. The delay is reportedly due to concerns over the long-term costs and a desire to avoid the planning mistakes that plagued the troubled HS2 project. Originally championed by former Chancellor George Osborne in 2014, the project aims to boost the regional economy, but its revival has been pushed back multiple times. The government insists it remains committed and will outline plans in the coming weeks.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores How Charlie Kirk's Death is Being Framed as a 'George Floyd Moment' by the Right</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the conservative reaction to the death of activist Charlie Kirk, arguing that many on the right view it as a systemic failure of the left rather than the act of a lone individual. An interview with conservative author Tanner Greer explains that Kirk was seen as an "indispensable" organizer who represented competing in democratic politics, not rejecting it. His killing is therefore interpreted by some as proof that the left is intolerant of even moderate conservative engagement, fueling a desire for a cultural reckoning akin to the "George Floyd moment" of 2020.</p>

          <p>A bronze-painted statue depicting President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands, titled "Best Friends Forever," was installed and then swiftly removed from the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The activist group The Secret Handshake claimed responsibility for the satirical piece, which was permitted to remain for several days. However, U.S. Park Police removed it overnight, with the Department of the Interior stating it was not compliant with the permit, a claim the artists dispute. The installation aimed to highlight the controversial relationship between the two men.</p>

          <p>Doctors and public health experts are expressing concern over President Trump's announcement linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) to an increased risk of autism in children. Obstetricians report that anxious pregnant patients are questioning their past use of the medication, which remains one of the few pain relievers considered safe during pregnancy. Medical professionals stress that there is no conclusive scientific evidence to support Trump's claim and warn that his advice for pregnant women to "tough it out" could be dangerous, as untreated fevers pose significant health risks to both mother and fetus.</p>

          <p>A family has shared the story of their son, Mason, who was diagnosed with nonverbal autism and began speaking just days after starting treatment with leucovorin. The drug, a derivative of folic acid typically used to ease chemotherapy side effects, is being studied for its potential to help some children with autism. Researchers theorize it can bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, which may contribute to neurological issues. While preliminary studies show promise for speech, the drug is not FDA-approved for autism, and researchers face funding challenges because it is an inexpensive generic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" have increased by 70% in the United States. The rise is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which is resistant to most antibiotics, leaving only two expensive, intravenous options for treatment. The rate of NDM cases specifically surged by 460% between 2019 and 2023, a trend some researchers believe may be linked to the overuse of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials warn this could lead to routine infections becoming much harder to treat.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old man in Epping, UK, has been fined after refusing a police order to remove his balaclava during a protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers. When asked to remove the face covering, Joshua Meadows reportedly told police he did not understand why he had to comply when others are permitted to wear burqas. He was part of a group of four males dressed in black with face coverings at the demonstration. Meadows pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the order and was also charged with possession of cannabis.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates near a three-year low after a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, this article advises potential homebuyers to ask critical questions before entering the market. Buyers should first determine the actual interest rate they qualify for based on their credit score, as the advertised average may not apply to them. They should also explore alternatives like buying mortgage points or considering an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to secure an even lower initial rate. Finally, the article cautions that waiting for rates to drop further is risky. (not investment advice)</p>

He also claimed the UK has abandoned its "powerful edge" in North Sea oil due to high taxes, despite regulators projecting that 90% of future production will come from existing fields. The windfall tax he criticized was implemented in response to soaring company profits.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has launched an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments after a BBC investigation revealed the practice. The report found that some asylum seekers were being taken on long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment that cost £600. While asylum seekers are given bus passes for one weekly trip, taxis are automatically booked for other necessary travel, such as medical visits.
