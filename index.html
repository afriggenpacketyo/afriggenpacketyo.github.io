          <p>Newly released records reveal details about Joshua Jahn, the 29-year-old gunman who opened fire on a Dallas ICE facility in September. His parents told police he developed beliefs of "radiation sickness" and an "allergy to plastic" after moving from Washington state. Jahn, described as a loner obsessed with AI, killed two detainees and wounded one before taking his own life. The records offer no clear motive for the attack, but photos showed his car with a map depicting radioactive fallout.</p>

          <p>China has announced the mass production of the world's first ultra-low noise, four-channel single-photon detector, dubbed the "photon catcher." Developed by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre, this device can detect a single photon, making it crucial for quantum communication and quantum radar systems. This technology has significant implications for national defense, including the potential to detect and track stealth aircraft like the F-22.</p>

          <p>Amazon has fired Ahmed Shahrour, a Palestinian software engineer, following his suspension last month for protesting the company's $1.2 billion Project Nimbus contract with the Israeli government. Amazon cited violations of company conduct and acceptable use policies, alleging misuse of resources for non-work-related messages. Shahrour, who advocated for the contract's termination, stated his firing is retaliation to silence Palestinian voices and scrutiny of Amazon's alleged collaboration in the Gaza conflict.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading on Tuesday, diverging from Wall Street's gains, as new retaliatory port fees between China and the U.S. were set to take effect. Despite President Trump's softened stance on China, the fees mark an escalation in trade tensions. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined, while South Korea's Kospi rose, boosted by Samsung Electronics' strong profit projection. Singapore's economy also reported faster-than-expected growth in the third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

This article highlights the unpredictable nature of domestic politics, noting that the SNP's renewed strength stems from internal stability and fragmented opposition.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law simplifying insurance claims for fire victims who suffer total losses, allowing them to receive up to $350,000 for personal property without an itemized list.

          <p>Millions of Americans, including families like Shana Verstegen's, face significant spikes in healthcare costs if Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) premium tax credits expire at year-end. These federal subsidies, expanded during the pandemic, are now a key point of contention in the government shutdown debate, with Democrats demanding their renewal. Experts warn that without an extension, many could lose insurance due to unaffordable prices, disproportionately affecting working-class individuals in states that haven't expanded Medicaid.

News outlets argue the public has a right to know how the military operates, while Pentagon officials defend the policy as necessary for national security.</p>

Security Minister Jarvis dismissed claims of deliberate government collapse, blaming outdated laws and emphasizing that the deputy national security adviser provided evidence without interference.
