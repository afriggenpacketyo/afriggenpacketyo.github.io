          <p>The U.S. labor market showed resilience in April, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 177,000, surpassing economists' expectations. While slightly below March's revised figures, the job growth indicates a stable labor market despite concerns over President Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, and sectors like healthcare and transportation saw significant gains. Economists suggest the full impact of tariffs may not be immediately apparent, but this report sets a benchmark for future evaluations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold is currently at $3,249.68 per ounce as of May 2, 2025, and is influenced by several factors including supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, and interest rates. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty and a hedge against inflation. Geopolitical instability, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies also play significant roles in determining gold prices. Investors should monitor these factors to make informed decisions about their gold investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, despite a decline from the previous year due to falling crude oil prices. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, combined with cost-cutting measures, offset the impact of weak oil prices. CEO Darren Woods described the market as "choppy" due to uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs. The company's global production business saw increased earnings due to growth in the Permian and Guyana, while its refining business experienced lower profits due to reduced refining margins.</p>

          <p>The U.S. job market experienced a slight slowdown in April, with employers adding 177,000 jobs, as President Trump's trade war began to affect the broader economy. While the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, job gains for February and March were revised down. The manufacturing sector was particularly hard hit, cutting 1000 jobs. The president's tariffs have rattled consumers, leading to decreased confidence in the economic outlook. The health of the job market is crucial in determining whether the economy continues to shrink or rebounds.</p>

The use of a modified Signal app by TeleMessage, which retains copies of messages, raised concerns over the handling of sensitive information.

          <p>This article follows the life of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an immigrant from El Salvador who has become a focal point in President Trump's immigration crackdown. Fleeing gang violence as a teenager, Abrego Garcia built a life in Maryland, working in construction and raising a family. However, he was deported to El Salvador based on the assertion that he was an MS-13 gang member, despite having no criminal record. The article explores the complexities of his case, including allegations of domestic violence and the challenges faced by undocumented immigrants in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Hiring in the US slowed in April, with the workforce adding 177,000 jobs as Donald Trump‚Äôs aggressive trade strategy clouded the economic outlook. While still above economists' expectations, the April reading is down from March's revised figures. The report comes days after data revealed a contraction in US GDP, fueling recession fears. Economists are concerned about the impact of tariffs and federal workforce cuts on the job market. The healthcare sector is expected to remain a source of job gains, while construction and manufacturing may see declines.</p>
