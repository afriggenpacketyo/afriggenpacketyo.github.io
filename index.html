        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oregon State Police have identified a 1980 murder victim as 30-year-old Larry Eugene Parks, linking his death to the infamous serial killer Randy Kraft, known as the "Scorecard Killer." The identification was made possible after nearly 45 years through the use of forensic investigative genetic genealogy, which matched a blood sample from the remains to Parks' family members. Kraft, who is suspected of killing over 60 men between 1971 and 1983, is currently on death row in California for 16 other murders. This breakthrough highlights how modern forensic technology is helping to resolve decades-old cold cases.</p>

          <p>The new film 'Relay,' directed by David Mackenzie, is a modern paranoid thriller centered on a secretive, off-the-grid fixer named Ash, played by Riz Ahmed. Ash specializes in helping whistleblowers disappear or negotiate settlements with powerful entities, using a traceless text-telephone relay service for communication. The plot intensifies when he takes on the case of a biotech scientist, Sarah (Lily James), who is on the run with incriminating documents. The article praises the film's tense, cat-and-mouse narrative and Ahmed's performance, which captures the character's competence and underlying loneliness as he navigates a high-stakes world of corporate espionage.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia is at the forefront of efforts to save endangered species through dedicated research and breeding programs. The facility studies the genetics, reproduction, and ecology of over 20 at-risk species, including the black-footed ferret and Przewalski's horse, with the goal of reintroducing them into their natural habitats. Conservation biologists at the institute express concern over the accelerated rate of extinction, which is estimated to be 10 to 1,000 times the normal background rate. Their work underscores the critical role each species plays in maintaining ecological balance and the cascading negative effects that occur when one is lost.</p>

          <p>Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine appears to be diminishing its geopolitical influence across the former Soviet Union, creating a power vacuum that other nations are beginning to fill. A recent U.S.-brokered peace talk between Azerbaijan and Armenia highlights this shift, as Washington steps into a mediation role traditionally held by Moscow. Tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan have also risen following several diplomatic incidents. This changing dynamic provides a "window of opportunity" for countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia to forge new alliances with powers like Turkey, China, and the U.S., signaling a significant realignment of regional politics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has announced it will not defend a federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), stating it believes the program is unconstitutional. The decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, which argues that the eligibility requirement of having at least 25% Hispanic undergraduate enrollment is discriminatory. Citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, the DOJ contends the program constitutes "outright racial balancing." A national association of HSI universities has filed to intervene and defend the program, arguing it helps address historical funding disparities.</p>

          <p>The UK is expected to experience a surge in temperature, reaching up to 30°C (86°F) on the upcoming bank holiday Monday, contributing to what may be one of the hottest summers on record. This warm spell, driven by the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air towards the country, will provide sunny conditions for major events like the Notting Hill Carnival. However, the heat will be short-lived, with cooler and more unsettled weather predicted to arrive by Tuesday. The hot and dry summer has already led to hosepipe bans and concerns about a poor harvest, highlighting the broader effects of climate change.</p>

The firing comes weeks after the White House strongly criticized a leaked DIA report which assessed that U.S. strikes had only temporarily set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months. President Trump publicly declared the assessment "flat out wrong," and the move is seen by some as part of a pattern of removing officials whose analyses conflict with the administration's public statements.

          <p>A massive landslide in Alaska's Tracy Arm fjord triggered a tsunami with a wave that reached an estimated 1,400 feet up the opposite wall, narrowly avoiding catastrophic consequences for tourists and boaters. Scientists believe the event, which occurred in a popular but fortunately empty area, serves as a stark warning about the increasing risk of such disasters as glaciers retreat due to climate change. The melting of glacial ice can destabilize mountain walls, a phenomenon known as "de-buttressing," while thawing permafrost can also weaken steep slopes. This close call underscores the urgent need to monitor and understand these evolving geological hazards.</p>

          <p>A significant increase in retail investor spending on speculative exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as single-stock and leveraged products, is raising concerns among some market experts. Billions of dollars are flowing into these volatile, high-risk funds, a trend reminiscent of the market peak in 2020-2021. Experts warn that this exuberance, largely absent of institutional investors, could be a contrarian indicator suggesting the broader market is overheating. The focus on yield-heavy products like covered call ETFs is particularly noted as a potential risk if underlying assets falter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has expanded a previous order, now blocking the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. The ruling, issued by Judge William Orrick, protects major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The judge had previously deemed the administration's attempts to freeze funding unconstitutional. This decision marks a significant setback for the administration's efforts to compel local jurisdictions to comply with its immigration agenda, a conflict that has escalated with recent threats from the Attorney General.</p>

          <p>In response to increasing legal and regulatory pressure from the Trump administration, several major U.S. hospital systems are ending or pausing gender-affirming care services for minors. This trend follows a presidential executive order aimed at restricting such procedures and a recent HHS report questioning the evidence base for these interventions. Medical experts and advocates express concern that discontinuing this care, which is supported by major medical associations, could negatively impact the mental health and well-being of transgender youth.

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that the approximately 2,000 National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. will now carry their service-issued weapons. This move reverses a previous decision and is part of the Trump administration's ongoing crackdown on what it describes as "out of control" crime in the capital. While the administration has praised the mission's success, the deployment remains highly unpopular with local residents and officials. The decision to arm the troops raises questions about a potential change in their mission, which has so far been limited to providing a presence near landmarks.</p>

Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, is currently seeking a presidential pardon.

A recent full-range test, the first of its kind since 1980, demonstrated China's second-strike capability by successfully launching a dummy warhead across the Pacific Ocean. The DF-31AG variant, which is road-mobile, provides the PLA Rocket Force with a flexible and survivable nuclear counterstrike force capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. This capability sends a strong geopolitical signal and underscores the strategic importance of this missile system in China's defense posture.</p>

The frequent and spectacular displays of molten rock have drawn a significant number of visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

The legislation, which aims to redraw the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, was approved after a heated debate. The bill had previously caused a weeks-long standoff when Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. This unusual mid-decade redistricting effort, encouraged by former President Trump, is intended to bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, but Democrats have vowed to challenge it in court.</p>

This issue is part of a broader problem for Roblox, which is facing numerous lawsuits over inappropriate content and child safety concerns.

This shift is fundamentally changing the experience of college sports, raising questions about the future of non-revenue-generating programs like squash and water polo.
