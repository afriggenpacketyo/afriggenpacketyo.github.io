          <p>Two elementary school teachers in Japan were arrested for taking and sharing voyeuristic photos of female students in a private social media group with other educators. The case has sparked significant public concern about child safety in schools and the trustworthiness of teachers, prompting calls for stronger preventative measures. This incident came to light during a separate investigation into another teacher in the same chat group, highlighting a disturbing trend and leading to discussions about implementing a system to check educators' sexual offense records.</p>

          <p>As electric vehicle adoption surges, particularly in China, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness. Research indicates that the unique characteristics of EVs, such as their rapid acceleration and regenerative braking systems, are the primary cause. These systems create low-frequency movements that can induce queasiness and discomfort, a side effect of the technology designed to improve energy efficiency. The article explores the science behind this phenomenon and its impact on the passenger experience in modern vehicles.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, citing a desire to leave the "political theatre and partisan gridlock" of Washington. His decision came shortly after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him due to Tillis's opposition to a major spending and tax bill. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in modern politics, suggesting such qualities are becoming an "endangered species."</p>

          <p>Representative Greg Steube of Florida has publicly criticized the Senate Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, for her role in striking provisions from a key Republican legislative bill. Steube argued that an unelected official should not have the power to override the will of elected lawmakers, a sentiment echoed by former President Trump. The controversy centers on the parliamentarian's rulings that certain Medicaid reforms did not comply with Senate rules, sparking frustration among conservatives who called for her to be replaced.</p>

          <p>A female prosecutor in Osaka, identified by the pseudonym Hikari, is facing significant backlash after accusing her former boss, a chief prosecutor, of sexual assault in 2018. Her pursuit of justice has been met with what she describes as a campaign to silence her, including alleged slander from a colleague and pressure from the prosecutor's office. The case, one of Japan's high-profile #MeToo moments, highlights the immense challenges victims face within powerful, hierarchical institutions and the personal and professional toll of speaking out against them.</p>

FBI data reveals that assaults at churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon stated that these attacks are meant to terrorize communities and that the DOJ is prioritizing these cases to ensure people of faith do not feel like soft targets.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski delivered a standout performance, pitching six scoreless innings to lead his team to a 5-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals. The 24-year-old left-hander, who entered the game in the second inning, allowed just three hits and one walk while striking out six, showcasing a significant improvement in his sophomore season. Wrobleski's recent surge, credited to mechanical adjustments and increased fastball velocity, is providing a surprising and valuable boost to the Dodgers' pitching depth as he continues to earn more opportunities.</p>
