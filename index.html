          <p>Savannah Chrisley shared her emotional reaction to the news that her parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, were pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud. In an Instagram video, she recounted receiving a personal call from the president informing her of the pardon, expressing immense gratitude and disbelief. Chrisley emphasized that this pardon grants her parents a fresh start, highlighting that it was a full and unconditional pardon. The Chrisleys, known for their reality show "Chrisley Knows Best," were sentenced in November 2022 and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution, stemming from charges dating back to 2007. The call from Trump was unexpected and filled her with renewed hope after feeling discouraged. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome for the Chrisley family after a difficult legal battle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Vanguard suggests that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is a stronger predictor of financial well-being than high income or asset levels. The study, which surveyed over 12,000 Vanguard investors, found that individuals with emergency savings experience less financial stress and spend less time worrying about their finances each week. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa emphasizes that the initial $2,000 provides confidence in handling unexpected expenses, which have a median cost of around $2,000. While saving this amount may be challenging for some, starting small and automating savings can help build an emergency fund over time (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted on Sunday night, shooting lava fountains over 1,000 feet into the air during a six-hour event, marking the 23rd episode in a series of eruptions since December 2024. The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) reported that the eruption produced large lava flows, covering approximately half of the Halema'uma'u crater floor, with the volcanic plume reaching heights of more than 14,000 feet. While the eruption poses no immediate danger to nearby communities, officials warn of potential hazards such as sulfur dioxide emissions creating volcanic smog, strands of volcanic glass called "Pele's hair," and high levels of volcanic gases. Scientists at HVO anticipate another eruption soon, following a pattern of weekly eruptions with magma buildup in between.</p>

          <h2>Vox Article Debunks Myths About Protein Intake for Muscle Growth</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Vox article challenges the notion that excessive protein consumption is necessary for building muscle, arguing that many online fitness influencers promote unrealistic protein intake recommendations. The author, a deputy editor for Vox's Future Perfect, shares personal experiences of building muscle without tracking protein intake, consuming protein powder, or eating animal protein. Experts like Stuart Phillips, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University, dismiss the idea that one gram of protein per pound of body weight is a golden rule. The article suggests that aiming for 0.54 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight is sufficient for weightlifters, while also emphasizing the importance of plant-based protein sources and cautioning against over-reliance on animal products.</p>

          <p>A Vox advice column addresses the question of how to encourage wealthy family and friends to donate more to charity without being accusatory or making them defensive. The advice emphasizes understanding others' perspectives, avoiding moral judgment, and highlighting the personal satisfaction derived from giving. Drawing on Carl Rogers's psychology, the column suggests fostering unconditional positive regard and empathy to create an environment where loved ones feel safer and more understood. The piece also references Benoit Monin's research on "do-gooder derogation," cautioning against appearing morally superior. Ultimately, the column advocates for leading by example, emphasizing joy, and creating rituals that encourage reflection and gratitude.</p>

          <p>ASML, a critical chip firm, has seen over $130 billion in value erased in less than a year due to export restrictions to China and uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. Shares of ASML hit a record high in July of the previous year but have since fallen due to volatility in the semiconductor market. According to Stephane Houri, head of equity research at ODDO BHF, the decline is attributed to fears surrounding U.S. restrictions to China, tariff discussions, and concerns about over-investment in artificial intelligence. ASML designs extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines essential for manufacturing advanced chips, and the company has recently begun shipping the next generation of these machines (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino, the coach of the United States Men's National Team (USMNT), is turning to Major League Soccer (MLS) to find players with the right attitude and winning mentality for the team. With key European-based players absent from the Gold Cup camp roster, Pochettino has called up a mix of MLS mainstays and fresh blood. This approach marks a shift from recent USMNT roster-building strategies that heavily favored European-based players. Pochettino's decision reflects a desire to find players who know how to win and will do anything to achieve a result, regardless of their fame or club affiliation. The coach is seeking an old identity for the USMNT, one characterized by grit and determination.</p>

          <p>A research note published by Oxford Economics projects that spending from foreign visitors to the U.S. is poised to fall by $8.5 billion this year. The decline is attributed to negative perceptions tied to trade and immigration policies, causing overseas tourists to choose other destinations. International arrivals to the U.S. are expected to fall by approximately 9% this year, with businesses and regions reliant on foreign tourism potentially facing significant hardship. The World Travel & Tourism Council estimates that the U.S. economy could lose $12.5 billion in spending from international visitors in 2025.</p>

          <p>A recent global study reveals that young people, particularly those in the United States, are experiencing declining levels of happiness and well-being. The Global Flourishing Study, which surveyed over 200,000 adults in 23 countries, found that flourishing increases with age in many geographically and culturally diverse countries, contrasting with established research that showed happiness levels peaking in youth. Factors contributing to this decline may include a lack of engagement in group activities, an emphasis on individualism, and the negative impacts of social media. Researchers suggest that religious service attendance and a focus on others can improve well-being.</p>

In 2020, Target pledged to increase racial diversity and spend billions with Black-owned suppliers, but in January 2025, it ended its DEI goals and withdrew from diversity-focused surveys. Consumers reacted negatively to the reversals, contributing to a decline in Target's sales. The author contrasts Target's experience with that of Costco, which has maintained its commitment to DEI and faced little pushback from shareholders, suggesting that abandoning principle isn't a sure path to material success.</p>

          <p>Ron and Russell Mael of Sparks, Los Angeles natives and creators of eclectic music since 1971, discuss their newfound mainstream recognition. The brothers credit this momentum to cinema, particularly the documentary “The Sparks Brothers” and the film “Annette.” Their music remains inventive and witty, often inspired by sunny moments and wistful memories. The new album, "MAD!," reflects their unique perspective, blending nostalgia with a forward-thinking approach. The Maels shared their fondness for supermarkets and the ever-changing landscape of Los Angeles, noting the impact of natural disasters and gentrification on their hometown.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is trying to find residents who lost their homes in the Palisades or Eaton fires and are owed property tax refunds. Many residents should have received a refund because their properties were reassessed due to wildfire damage, but the checks were undeliverable. County officials have sent approximately 9,700 checks totaling $26 million to residents whose properties were reassessed, but about 330 checks remain unclaimed. Residents who were displaced by the fires can update their mailing addresses at the county assessor’s website to receive their refunds.</p>

They also express concern about the impact of funding cuts on early-career researchers and the potential for a loss of talent in the biomedical sector.
