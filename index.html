          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is causing both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide, as many currencies appreciate against the greenback. A weaker dollar can alleviate debt burdens and reduce inflation, potentially allowing central banks to cut rates and stimulate growth. However, currency devaluation risks stoking inflation and inviting retaliation from the U.S. in the form of trade measures, so central banks are treading carefully to avoid currency wars and maintain economic stability.

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration over a $2.2 billion funding freeze, alleging ideological bias and antisemitism related to campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza. The administration had demanded changes to Harvard's policies, including screening international students and ending diversity programs. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserts that the administration is attempting to control academic decision-making. The White House maintains that taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.</p>
