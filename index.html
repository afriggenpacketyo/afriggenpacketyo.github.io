          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel announced the arrest of Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, whom they were attempting to arrest in her courthouse. While Flores Ruiz was later apprehended, Patel stated that Dugan's actions created an increased danger to the public, highlighting the ongoing tension between local and federal authorities regarding immigration enforcement within state courthouses.

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos is facing sentencing on Long Island after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges.

Santos acknowledges the cost of his actions, including losing his congressional seat and reputation, but claims the prosecution's demands are excessive. The case has drawn significant attention due to the extent of Santos's fabrications and the implications for the integrity of the election system.</p>

          <p>Former New York Congressman George Santos is facing a prison sentence of up to 87 months in connection with his federal fraud and identity theft case. Santos pleaded guilty to deceiving donors and stealing identities to fund his campaign and agreed to pay nearly $600,000 in penalties.

The discovery highlights the rare and unusual adaptations found in Hawaiian caterpillars, with this species being the first to use ant heads and fly wings in its protective case.

          <p>A senior Russian military commander, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, was killed in a car explosion in a Moscow suburb, prompting a criminal inquiry by Russian authorities. The incident follows a series of apparent assassinations targeting opponents of the Ukraine war within Russia. The explosion occurred on the same day that Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy, met with President Vladimir V. Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, amidst increasing Russian airstrikes on civilian targets and calls for a cease-fire.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to an unsecured commercial internet line, known as a "dirty line." This setup bypassed the Defense Department's firewall protections, potentially exposing sensitive information. Hegseth has faced scrutiny for sharing information about U.S. airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen via Signal, raising questions about the security and handling of classified information. A DOD spokesperson has stated that Hegseth has never used Signal on his government computer, while others claim this is fake news.</p>

A federal judge rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies, upholding the FDA's determination that shortages of the active ingredient, semaglutide, are resolved. The decision allows the FDA to pursue pharmacies making compounded versions, prioritizing patient safety amid concerns over unapproved drugs.

          <p>A judge ruled that prosecutors can pursue the death penalty against Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, despite his autism diagnosis. The defense argued that Kohberger's autism spectrum disorder reduces his culpability and makes the death penalty a cruel and unusual punishment. However, the judge agreed with prosecutors that autism is not equivalent to an intellectual disability, which would preclude the death penalty under Supreme Court precedent. The judge also made rulings on the admissibility of evidence, including the 911 call and text messages.</p>
