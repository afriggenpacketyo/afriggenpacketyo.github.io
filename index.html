          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, also a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested by ICE agents while observing immigration court proceedings at 26 Federal Plaza. Lander, who has been escorting individuals out of court to prevent ICE arrests, was accused of assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. Charges against Lander were later dropped, with Governor Kathy Hochul condemning the arrest. Lander stated that the arrest was politically motivated and highlighted the plight of undocumented immigrants facing deportation. The ACLU of New York condemned the arrest as an abuse of power and a threat to democracy, noting that it sends an authoritarian message.</p>

          <p>UCLA's baseball season concluded with a 7-3 loss to Arkansas in the College World Series, marking their first appearance in Omaha in 12 years. The Bruins fell behind early after a shaky start by pitcher Cody Delvecchio and struggled to capitalize on opportunities with runners in scoring position. Despite a late rally in the ninth inning, UCLA's offensive struggles proved too much to overcome, as they hit just .167 as a team in the game. Arkansas' Wehiwa Aloy's early home run set the tone, and Logan Maxwell's two-RBI double in the seventh extended the Razorbacks' lead.</p>

          <p>Inter Milan's participation in the expanded FIFA Club World Cup highlights the increasing strain on players due to packed schedules. The team, recently under new management after parting ways with Simone Inzaghi, faced a 1-1 draw with Monterrey amidst a demanding calendar. Manager Giuseppe Marotta has called for a serious dialogue between FIFA, UEFA, leagues, clubs, and players to redesign the international calendar and protect player health, noting that the expanded Club World Cup and new Champions League format have significantly increased the workload on teams and players. The tournament itself has expanded to a 32-team, month-long competition, offering a lucrative $1 billion prize purse.</p>

Congressman Thomas Massie joined Democrats in introducing a bill to block Trump from engaging U.S. forces in unauthorized hostilities with Iran without congressional approval.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities, including the subterranean uranium enrichment site at Fordo. Fordo, buried deep beneath a mountain and heavily defended, is believed to be a key location for Iran's potential nuclear weapons program. While there is no full agreement among Trump's advisors, the issue was discussed in a meeting with his national security team. The U.S. has publicly stated it is not involved in Israel's offensive, though it has assisted in intercepting missiles fired by Iran in retaliation.</p>

          <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan asserted that President Trump's policies have resulted in the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasted this with the Biden administration, which allegedly released the vast majority of encountered illegal immigrants into the U.S., while zero were released under Trump in May. Homan called for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to further secure the border and implement a large-scale deportation operation. He highlighted the administration's success in significantly reducing illegal immigrant releases compared to the Biden years.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments regarding California's challenge to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in response to immigration enforcement protests in Los Angeles. The judges on the panel indicated they might have limited authority to rule against the president's power to deploy troops. California argued the federalization of the National Guard was an unlawful executive action that diverted troops from critical work. The Trump administration argued the president acted within his discretion, citing violent riots in Los Angeles as a rebellion against the authority of the United States.</p>

However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis aims to guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as habitats shift.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers clarified that singer Nezza is welcome back at Dodger Stadium after she performed a Spanish version of the national anthem. Despite an initial request to sing the anthem in English, Nezza proceeded with the Spanish version, leading to conflicting reports about her status with the team. Nezza said she felt like she was banned after receiving a call following her performance, but the Dodgers reaffirmed that there were "no hard feelings." Nezza's performance took place on the same day as protests against President Trump and ICE raids in Los Angeles.</p>
