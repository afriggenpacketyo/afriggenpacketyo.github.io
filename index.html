          <p>Following President Trump's threat of imposing 50% tariffs on EU goods, the European Union's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, emphasized the bloc's commitment to a trade deal based on mutual respect rather than threats. Several European leaders, including Ireland's Taoiseach and France's Foreign Minister, voiced concerns over the potential damage from higher tariffs and advocated for continued negotiations. The EU remains dedicated to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, highlighting the importance of the EU-US trade relationship which involves over $600 billion in goods sent from the EU to the US annually.</p>

          <p>Many women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are hesitant to get pregnant because they rely on contraception to manage severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts. PMDD affects up to 8% of women, with an average diagnosis wait time of 12 years. Treatment options are limited, and the prospect of discontinuing medication during pregnancy is daunting. The Welsh government has acknowledged the need for improved diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of PMDD, allocating £3m towards addressing women's health conditions, including PMDD.</p>

          <h2>Germany Grapples with Selective Remembrance of Nazi Past</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany faces criticism for selectively acknowledging its Nazi past, embracing it when it enhances the country's self-image but ignoring it when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. The Herbert Quandt Media Prize, named after an early SS supporter, highlights this contradiction. While Germany condemns the past and engages in remembrance, it often fails to address enduring injustices or atrocities committed by allies. This selective approach raises questions about the sincerity and depth of Germany's commitment to its "never again" promise.</p>
