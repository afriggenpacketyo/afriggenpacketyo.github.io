          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated his 100th day in office with a campaign-style speech in Michigan, highlighting his administration's accomplishments and attacking political rivals. He boasted about the decrease in illegal border crossings and promised new auto manufacturing plants in the state. However, Trump dismissed polls showing his popularity declining and criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Democratic National Committee countered by calling Trump's first 100 days a "colossal failure," citing rising costs and economic vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation remained steady at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations. This stability comes after inflation peaked in December 2022, leading the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates to 4.1%.

          <p>In an exclusive ABC News interview marking his 100th day in office, President Donald Trump discussed the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Trump acknowledged the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Garcia's return but questioned his character, suggesting Garcia might be affiliated with the MS-13 gang. Despite the legal directive, Trump hesitated to commit to bringing Garcia back, citing concerns about following the law and his broader immigration agenda. He also took a jab at President Joe Biden regarding immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to pay $202 million to settle claims that it provided kickbacks to doctors to incentivize prescriptions of its HIV drugs. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan stated that Gilead gave doctors honoraria, meals, and travel expenses for speaking at HIV Speaker Program events between 2011 and 2017. This arrangement violated the Anti-Kickback Statute, resulting in false claims to federal healthcare programs.

          <p>China's manufacturing activity fell to a near two-year low in April, with the purchasing managers' index dropping to 49.0, indicating contraction. This decline is attributed to the escalating trade war with the U.S., which has disrupted trade flows between the two countries. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed cumulative new tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods. The number of cargo ships departing from China to the U.S. has fallen sharply, signaling a significant impact on trade.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that rolled back some tariffs for carmakers, addressing concerns that the levies would raise production costs and squeeze profits. The changes modify tariffs so carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Carmakers will also qualify for tariff relief for a portion of imported components, phased out over two years. Despite these concessions, a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts remains in place, potentially increasing car prices.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed support for legislation that seeks to increase the punishment to a felony for soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex. This stance breaks with some progressives, as Democrats in the state Assembly watered down the bill. Newsom stated that the law should treat all sex predators who solicit minors the same, regardless of the intended victim’s age. Currently, it is a felony in California to pay for sex with a minor under the age of 16, and stronger felony penalties exist for sex trafficking a minor under age 18.</p>

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply due to President Trump's steep tariffs, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages.

Retailers have likely stockpiled sufficient inventory to last a couple of months, but consumers could face product shortages and price hikes this summer.</p>
