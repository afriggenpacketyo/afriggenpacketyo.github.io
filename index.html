          <p>The U.S. economy is expected to show modest but sturdy growth in the second quarter, defying fears of a downturn caused by President Trump's recent tariffs. Economists anticipate a 2.3% annualized GDP increase, rebounding from the previous quarter's contraction, suggesting continued economic resilience despite trade policy shifts. However, the GDP figures may be skewed by import fluctuations as businesses adjusted inventories to avoid tariffs, complicating the true economic picture ahead of a key Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

          <p>New research suggests that Elon Musk's rightward political shift and alignment with Donald Trump have negatively impacted not only Tesla's appeal among U.S. liberals but also their interest in purchasing any electric vehicle. A study published in Nature found that while liberals' intent to buy an EV was positive in August 2023, it dropped into negative territory by March, mirroring a sharp decline in their opinion of Tesla. This indicates Musk has become so synonymous with EVs that his personal brand is affecting the entire product category, though it has not correspondingly increased interest among conservatives.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has accused U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of judicial misconduct, escalating a conflict between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary. The complaint alleges that Judge Boasberg, an Obama appointee, attempted to improperly influence Chief Justice John Roberts and other judges by warning of a "constitutional crisis" stemming from the administration's policies. This action follows Boasberg's rulings that blocked some of President Trump's key immigration orders, making him a prominent target of the administration's criticism against what it calls "activist" judges.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has substantially increased its 2025 GDP growth forecast for China, citing stronger-than-expected economic activity in the first half of the year. The upward revision, the largest for any economy in the report, is attributed to a significant reduction in U.S.-China tariffs and robust export growth to new markets beyond the United States. China's ability to diversify its trade partners, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa, has helped maintain strong overall trade performance despite a decline in shipments to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ground search is in progress for German Olympic biathlon champion Laura Dahlmeier, who went missing after being caught in a rockslide in the mountains of northern Pakistan. The 31-year-old was ascending Laila Peak when she was swept away at a high altitude; her climbing partner was rescued, but Dahlmeier remains injured and inaccessible. Rescue efforts have been hampered by severe weather, and a helicopter fly-over was unable to detect any signs of life, prompting grave concern for the celebrated athlete.</p>

          <p>German sportswear company Adidas has announced it will raise prices for its American customers to offset the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, which are expected to cost the company an additional €200 million. CEO Bjorn Gulden confirmed the price hikes will be necessary as new trade deals impose tariffs on goods from key manufacturing countries like Vietnam and Indonesia. The move highlights the direct effect of U.S. trade policy on consumer prices and corporate costs, a challenge also faced by major European carmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's public criticism and direct pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates have intensified concerns about the central bank's political independence. While past presidents have privately disagreed with Fed policy, Trump's aggressive tactics are considered unprecedented and challenge the institutional checks and balances designed to ensure stable, long-term economic policy. Experts warn that compromising the Fed's independence could lead to poor economic outcomes, such as the high inflation seen in the 1970s after political pressure influenced monetary decisions.

          <p>Many common prescription drugs, including those for high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression, can increase a person's susceptibility to heat-related illnesses. Medications like beta blockers and diuretics can interfere with the body's natural cooling mechanisms, such as sweating and regulating blood flow, while others can impair the ability to sense thirst or overheating. Health experts stress that patients should continue taking their prescribed medications but must be extra vigilant about staying cool and hydrated during heatwaves to avoid serious health consequences.</p>

          <p>The "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, championed by HHS Secretary Robert F.

Top Trump administration health officials have linked issues like autism, diabetes, and obesity to lifestyle choices, toxic foods, and vaccine skepticism, frustrating patients and advocates who say this oversimplifies complex diseases. Critics argue this victim-blaming attitude shapes policies that cut health programs and erode trust in modern medicine by ignoring systemic factors affecting health.</p>

          <p>Despite persistent claims from former President Trump and other Republicans, new research confirms that voting by non-U.S. citizens is exceedingly rare and not a significant threat to election integrity. A comprehensive review by the Center for Election Innovation & Research found that even in states that invested heavily in finding ineligible voters, the numbers discovered were minuscule. The report concludes that most allegations arise from misunderstandings of complex data or outright fabrications, as the risks of deportation far outweigh any incentive for noncitizens to vote illegally.</p>

          <p>The word "dude" has a surprisingly long and complex history, originating in the 1880s as a term for foppish, over-dressed young men in New York City who emulated a European "dandy" style. The term later evolved to describe East Coast city dwellers visiting western "dude ranches" in elaborate cowboy attire. In the mid-20th century, it was adopted by African American and Mexican American communities as a term of solidarity before being popularized by California surfer and skater culture, eventually becoming the ubiquitous, gender-neutral greeting it is today.</p>

          <p>New research on a European songbird, the Great Tit, reveals that some avian pairs effectively "divorce" at the end of a breeding season. Using radio tags, scientists at the University of Oxford tracked the birds and found that while some couples remained together through the winter, others began to drift apart. These "divorcing" birds associated with each other less and less, suggesting they were severing ties to form new relationships for the next breeding season, highlighting the complex social dynamics in the animal kingdom.</p>
