          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is urging the European Union to prepare countermeasures against a potential 30% tariff on EU imports threatened by Donald Trump. This call for a firm stance contrasts with leaders from Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, who are advocating for pragmatic negotiations to avoid a trade war. The threat has sent shockwaves through European industries, particularly Germany's automotive sector, which is already facing significant US tariffs. EU ambassadors are meeting to strategize, highlighting deep divisions on how to handle the aggressive US trade posture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has successfully produced the first barrel of uranium from a new demonstration project in Inner Mongolia's Ordos basin. The project is being touted as a "green, safe, intelligent and efficient" mining method that avoids tunnels and toxic waste. This development marks a shift in China's uranium sourcing, moving towards sandstone-type deposits in the north. The new approach could significantly enhance China's competitiveness in the global natural uranium market and support its nuclear energy ambitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 2023 settlement that mandated Alabama to address a decades-old raw sewage crisis in Lowndes County has been terminated by the Trump administration. The administration cited its executive order against Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs as the reason for ending the agreement, which was intended to help the majority-Black, high-poverty community. This decision removes the federal requirement for the state to provide functional sanitation systems, potentially re-exposing residents to fines and jail time for non-compliance. The move is part of a broader administrative effort to dismantle programs aimed at tackling systemic inequality.</p>

          <p>A significant presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Los Angeles has instilled fear throughout immigrant communities, particularly in neighborhoods like MacArthur Park. The intensified raids have led to a sharp decline in business for local establishments as residents stay home to avoid potential arrest. A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the sweeps, barring agents from stopping people based solely on race or location. The enforcement actions have resulted in nearly 2,800 arrests in the region, with advocates claiming many targets had no criminal convictions.</p>

          <p>Following deadly flash floods in the Hill Country, this article examines Texas's political culture of prioritizing disaster recovery over preventative measures. It highlights a recurring pattern of inaction, citing the failure to upgrade the power grid after the 2021 winter storm and the stalled "Ike Dike" project after Hurricane Ike in 2008. Experts attribute this reluctance to a combination of small-government ideology and the political influence of the fossil fuel industry. As the most disaster-prone state facing increasing climate risks, this approach leaves its growing population vulnerable to future catastrophes.</p>

          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, a death confirmed amid a regional surge in the highly contagious virus. The hospital has seen a significant increase in seriously ill children admitted with measles, treating seventeen since June. Health officials attribute the spike in cases to falling uptake of the MMR vaccine, with vaccination rates in Liverpool well below the 95% recommended by the World Health Organization. This tragedy underscores the severe, and sometimes fatal, risks of the disease, particularly for young infants and those with weakened immune systems.</p>

          <p>The one-year anniversary of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, brings focus to the significant security lapses that allowed the attack to occur. Multiple investigations by the Secret Service, FBI, and Congress have highlighted failures in intelligence sharing and event coordination. In response, the Secret Service has outlined 37 reform measures, though many require congressional action and funding that has been slow to materialize. Experts trace some of the agency's structural issues back to its post-9/11 absorption into the Department of Homeland Security, which expanded its mission without a proportional increase in resources.</p>

          <p>This analysis of the third fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano argues that its significance lay not in chaotic drama but in its tactical maturity. Unlike their previous brawls, this match was a controlled, strategic affair, which the author posits is a form of progress for women's boxing, granting female fighters the right to "win ugly" like their male counterparts. The article reflects on the contradictions within the sport, where women fight for the choice to risk their bodies for glory in an environment still marked by objectification. Ultimately, the trilogy is framed as a historic achievement that has advanced the sport.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. This rare specimen represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed conflict with the Turkish government and has begun a disarmament process. This move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and has been cautiously welcomed by Ankara. The PKK's demands include Ocalan's release and amnesty for fighters, while the Turkish government is waiting for the group to fully dismantle its structures. A successful peace process could significantly improve Turkey's relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria, potentially boosting its geopolitical standing.</p>

While celebrated as a watershed moment for global activism and rock 'n' roll's political power, its legacy is also viewed critically. The event has been criticized for its lack of African performers and for reinforcing a "white savior" narrative and a patronizing image of Africa. Despite these flaws, organizers like Bob Geldof maintain that it successfully put the issue on the global agenda and led to tangible political actions, like debt cancellation.</p>

He was also accused of giving children saline shots at their parents' request.

          <p>A campaign in the UK, supported by MP Becky Gittins, is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English instead of Latin to protect allergy sufferers. Current regulations require ingredients to be listed using the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a system based on Latin and scientific names. Campaigners argue this system is confusing and potentially dangerous for consumers with severe allergies who may not recognize allergens like "Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis" as sweet almond oil. The industry's trade association defends the Latin-based system, citing the need for global harmonization.</p>
