          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 13:01:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An internal Department of Justice memo from September reportedly contains evidence that undercuts the mortgage fraud indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to sources, prosecutors found her personal financial benefit was minimal, around $800, and expressed doubts about proving intentional fraud due to vague federal mortgage guidelines. The memo was presented to the previous U.S. attorney, who was later ousted by the President, and its author, a career prosecutor, was subsequently fired by the new interim U.S. Attorney tasked with bringing charges. These revelations raise questions about the potential political motivations behind the prosecution.</p>

          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, sending it to the President to be signed into law. This legislation aims to make the "math error" notices sent by the IRS for simple tax return mistakes clearer and more understandable for taxpayers. Currently, filers have 60 days to respond to these often confusing notices before the IRS's proposed changes become final. Proponents like Senator Elizabeth Warren argue the bill will help ordinary people correct honest mistakes without needing expensive legal help, improving transparency and communication from the tax agency.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested over 30 people, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, in a major probe into illegal gambling and sports rigging tied to organized crime. The investigation uncovered two interconnected schemes: one involving rigged high-stakes poker games using cheating technology, and another concerning an insider sports-betting conspiracy. The NBA has placed both Billups and Rozier on immediate leave, stating it takes the allegations with the utmost seriousness. FBI officials described the operation as a sprawling criminal enterprise that funneled millions to La Cosa Nostra.</p>

          <p>A Commerce Department official has refuted a report claiming the Trump administration was negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing firms like IonQ and Rigetti Computing. The denial follows a Wall Street Journal story suggesting the government was considering exchanging federal funding for ownership, similar to recent deals in the semiconductor and rare earth industries. Quantum computing is considered a sector vital to national security due to its potential military applications, such as breaking encryption. While the industry attracts significant investment, it has yet to generate substantial revenue, with the technology still in a research-heavy phase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several prominent rabbis in New York City are publicly warning voters about the potential risks posed by socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, citing his positions on Israel. Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch stated that Mamdani's advocacy for dismantling the Jewish state is unprecedented for a major NYC candidate and could exacerbate antisemitism. In response to criticism, Mamdani has affirmed his commitment to protecting Jewish New Yorkers and suggested his Muslim faith is a factor in the attacks against him. Over 650 rabbis have signed a "call to action," expressing deep concern over rhetoric they believe fuels discrimination against Jewish people.</p>

          <p>A group of Republican lawmakers is calling on President Trump to confront Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding Americans they claim are unjustly detained or subject to exit bans in China. In a letter, the legislators described Beijing as the "world’s largest hostage-taker," accusing it of using detentions and exit bans as leverage in dealings with the U.S. The letter highlights specific cases of imprisoned Americans and Chinese citizens with U.S.-based relatives involved in human rights advocacy. The appeal comes ahead of an expected summit between the two leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea.</p>

Boyd was sentenced to death for a 1995 murder based on eyewitness testimony without forensic evidence, and has always maintained his innocence. Despite appeals arguing the method violates the Eighth Amendment, a federal judge ruled that the Constitution does not guarantee a painless death, allowing the execution to proceed at Holman prison.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive is set to lay off more than 600 employees, which constitutes roughly 4% of its workforce, as it navigates a challenging market for electric vehicles. The company is contending with shifting regulations under the Trump administration, including the end of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases, which has contributed to slower-than-expected demand. Having lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter, Rivian has also narrowed its 2025 delivery forecast and anticipates a larger adjusted core loss for the year. The layoffs reflect growing pressure on EV makers amid economic headwinds and increased competition. (not investment advice)</p>

This penalty follows the Environment Agency giving the industry its worst-ever collective score for environmental performance in 2024, citing a spike in serious pollution incidents. The refunds are issued when companies fail to meet targets on issues like pollution and leaks. Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, faces the largest penalty of £75.2 million.

In response, the Mamdani campaign characterized the move as an alignment of "two men who share an affinity for corruption."

          <p>Leading House Democrats are demanding that the Trump administration release all records related to President Trump's administrative claims seeking approximately $230 million from the Department of Justice. The claims are for damages related to the Russia investigation and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago. In a letter, Representatives Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as officials who previously served as Trump's defense attorneys could be involved in approving the taxpayer-funded payout. The Democrats also argued that such a payment would violate the Constitution's Domestic Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a president from receiving federal funds beyond their salary.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the French luxury group, closed up nearly 9% after it reported a narrower sales decline and better-than-expected quarterly earnings, signaling a potential turnaround. While sales at its flagship brand, Gucci, fell 14% year-on-year, this marked a significant sequential improvement from the 25% plunge seen in the previous quarter. The performance has boosted investor confidence in the new CEO's strategy to revitalize the company. Kering is focusing on its core fashion businesses, recently agreeing to sell its beauty unit to L'Oreal, as it works to navigate weakening demand in the high-end goods sector.

          <p>New research suggests that a significant number of urinary tract infections (UTIs) may be caused by E. coli bacteria from contaminated meat sold in grocery stores, challenging the long-held belief that they are primarily due to poor hygiene. A study comparing E. coli from UTI patients in Southern California with samples from local retail meat found that approximately one in five infections could be linked to food-borne exposure. The study found the highest contamination rates in chicken and turkey. Researchers concluded that UTIs should be considered not just a personal health issue but also a food safety problem.</p>

Because the failed test occurred after her record-setting 2024 Chicago marathon run, she will be allowed to keep her world record. The AIU is continuing to investigate suspicious material found on her phone, including information about testosterone and messages related to potential doping programs, which could lead to further violations.</p>

          <p>Government watchdog groups are warning that a top federal prosecutor's use of an auto-deleting messaging app could be illegal. Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, used Signal with an eight-hour auto-delete setting to discuss the criminal case against New York's attorney general with a journalist. Groups like American Oversight argue this practice raises serious concerns about violations of the Federal Records Act and DOJ policy, which require government communications to be preserved. The conduct is particularly alarming to critics given Halligan's role in pursuing high-profile cases against the president's perceived political adversaries.</p>

Vance called the move "a very stupid political stunt" and said he took personal insult to it, reaffirming that the Trump administration's policy is that the West Bank will not be annexed. The bill, which passed narrowly, was also condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office as a provocation by the opposition designed to cause discord during the Vice President's visit.
