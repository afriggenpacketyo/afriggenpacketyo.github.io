          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for top investors in his $TRUMP memecoin, drawing criticism and protests over potential conflicts of interest and corruption. Guests, including foreign investors, attended with the explicit intent of influencing Mr. Trump and U.S. financial regulations, while protesters condemned the event as a historic corruption of the presidency. Mr. Trump promised to change everything for crypto, claiming there is a lot of common sense in crypto. The dinner was organized by Trump's business partners to promote sales of his $TRUMP token, a memecoin launched just days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, prompting scrutiny over the ethics and implications of the event.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass' public safety initiatives to mitigate potential layoffs of city workers amidst a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall. The budget cuts funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in the lowest officer count since 1995, and reduces the number of new hires for the Los Angeles Fire Department. Council members voiced concerns over public safety reductions, while others defended the budget plan as a step towards a more just and equitable Los Angeles. The decisions aim to minimize layoffs by tapping into the city's budget stabilization fund and increasing revenue through measures like higher parking ticket costs.</p>

He stated that troops remain the focus of every major Pentagon decision, prioritizing readiness, rejecting identity politics, and reasserting American deterrence.

          <p>Justin Halstenberg, a 35-year-old man from Norco, has been convicted of deliberately starting the Line fire that burned approximately 44,000 acres in the San Bernardino Mountains and injured six firefighters. Halstenberg was found guilty of aggravated arson of forest land and property, as well as possession of flammable materials, and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Prosecutors accused him of starting three fires within an hour, with the third becoming the Line fire, which forced the evacuation of over 11,000 residents and damaged multiple properties. The conviction was praised by San Bernardino County Supervisor Dawn Rowe for sending a message that arsonists will be held accountable.</p>

          <p>International students at Harvard are facing deep uncertainty after the Trump administration revoked the university's permission to enroll them, prompting fears of visa invalidation and potential deportation. The move would transform a university where more than a quarter of the student body comes from other countries, with graduate programs being hit especially hard. Students expressed fear and confusion, with many considering transferring to other universities, while professors worried about the impact on the university's mission and identity. This action is the latest in a series of aggressions against Harvard since its president resisted demands to change hiring, admissions, and curriculum practices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is using its power over the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students. The Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's certification to access SEVIS, a database essential for managing and tracking international student enrollment. This action places the status of Harvard's 6,800 international students in limbo, potentially making them deportable unless they transfer or a court intervenes. Experts suggest Harvard is likely to challenge the SEVIS termination in court, arguing that it is retaliatory and violates the law by dismantling the university's international program.</p>

Preliminary data suggest the variant is more transmissible but not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise.

Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his stance on intending to raise rates given price trends, while also citing the need to monitor closely the effects of U.S. tariffs.
