          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed the $83.3 million jury verdict against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court dismissed Trump's claims of presidential immunity, stating he acted with reckless disregard for the truth when he denied sexually assaulting Carroll in the 1990s. The ruling also found the compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury to be fair and reasonable, citing the extensive harassment Carroll faced after Trump's public statements. This decision marks another significant legal setback for the former president in this long-running case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has urgently requested that the Supreme Court permit a freeze on billions of dollars in foreign aid funding previously allocated by Congress. This move escalates a constitutional conflict over executive power versus the congressional power of the purse. The administration argues that a lower court's order forcing them to spend the money infringes on the president's authority in foreign affairs. This legal battle is part of a broader effort by the administration to rescind funds for programs it deems misaligned with its policy objectives.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court has postponed the pretrial hearing for former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces charges of crimes against humanity. The delay was granted to assess the 80-year-old's fitness to stand trial, following his lawyers' claims that he is in poor health. Duterte is accused of orchestrating a deadly anti-drug campaign that resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings during his presidency. The postponement has been met with disappointment from the families of the victims, who fear justice will be delayed.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee is finalizing an investigation into President Joe Biden's use of an autopen to grant thousands of pardons during his administration. The probe was spurred by a report revealing that senior Justice Department officials had raised concerns about the process, questioning whether the president was fully aware of the backgrounds of those receiving clemency. House Oversight Chair James Comer has described the situation as a "historic scandal," while former White House staff defended the process as legitimate and thorough.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that Chagas disease, a potentially life-threatening illness transmitted by "kissing bugs," may be becoming endemic in the U.S. While traditionally associated with Latin America, locally acquired human cases have now been reported in eight states, including Texas and California. The parasite-carrying insect has been found in 32 states, raising public health concerns. The CDC notes that low awareness and underreporting have previously obscured the domestic presence of the disease.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been discovered on an exterior wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester on the ground with a gavel. Banksy confirmed the piece as authentic by posting a photo of it on his Instagram account. The mural, which carries a strong political message, appeared shortly after mass arrests at a protest in the city and was quickly covered by authorities, though not before attracting significant public attention.</p>

          <h2>Communication Expert Shares Key Habits of Highly Likable People</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a communication expert, the core trait of highly likable individuals is their ability to make others feel seen and valued, rather than being artificially nice. This is achieved through consistent, small habits that demonstrate genuine interest and respect. These habits include remembering small personal details about others, freely giving credit for ideas and contributions, and responding to everyone regardless of their status. Admitting mistakes and making time for casual, humanizing conversations are also identified as crucial practices for building strong, positive relationships.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team is facing a critical selection decision for its World Cup quarter-final match against Scotland. Star full-back Ellie Kildunne, recently voted the world's best player, will miss the game due to concussion symptoms. Head coach John Mitchell must now choose her replacement, with the primary candidates being the less experienced but talented kicker Emma Sing and the versatile, more seasoned Helena Rowland. The decision is pivotal as the team enters the high-stakes knockout stage of the tournament, with Rowland's recent performance making her a strong contender.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, its overall impact on the labor market has been relatively small so far, according to a senior economist at Indeed. The analysis suggests that current job market weakness is more attributable to broader economic uncertainty than to the widespread adoption of AI. Most AI-related job effects have been concentrated within the tech sector and among early-career workers. The article notes that rather than replacing workers, many employers are focused on retraining their existing workforce to incorporate new AI skills. (not investment advice)</p>

This opinion article argues that the appearance was less about a love for tennis and more about projecting a strongman image and creating a spectacle to energize his base. The author suggests that being booed by a multicultural, urban crowd serves as a form of political currency for Trump.

          <p>A comparison of monthly running costs reveals that charging a Tesla at home is more economical than purchasing gasoline for a Honda CR-V Hybrid. Based on the average number of miles driven by Americans and current national energy prices, charging a Tesla costs approximately $51 per month, while fueling the CR-V Hybrid costs about $81. The cost advantage for the electric vehicle stems from the greater efficiency of electric motors compared to internal combustion engines. However, charging costs can vary significantly based on location and the use of public fast-charging stations. (not investment advice)</p>
