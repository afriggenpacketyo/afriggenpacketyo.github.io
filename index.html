          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine can win back all of its territory from Russia, marking a significant shift in his position on the war. He attributed this change to understanding the military and economic situation, noting Russia's economic troubles. Trump suggested Ukraine could even go further, supported by the EU and NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the shift and indicated the U.S. might offer security guarantees after the war. Trump also suggested NATO should shoot down Russian planes violating their airspace, praising the alliance for increasing defense spending. This represents a change from Trump's previous stance, where he implied Ukraine might need to cede territory.</p>

          <p>A GE Appliances factory in Louisville laid off nearly 150 workers, mostly Cuban immigrants, after the Trump administration revoked their legal immigration status under the CHNV parole program. The program, which temporarily protected Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Venezuelans from deportation, was terminated following a Supreme Court decision. The factory is now facing labor shortages and increased overtime for remaining workers. Remaining immigrant employees fear their Temporary Protected Status could also be revoked, creating uncertainty and pressure on the workforce, with some statuses expiring soon. The factory employees emphasize that the laid-off immigrants were vital to American manufacturing. Optimism is mixed due to the uncertainty surrounding immigration policy and its impact on the workforce.</p>

This decision mirrors a similar move by Sinclair Broadcast Group, another major owner of ABC affiliates, following comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Nexstar stated it would monitor the show's content and stands by its decision pending assurance of respectful dialogue. The corporation emphasized its commitment to local news and programming, noting the show is available on Disney-owned streaming services.

          <p>Scientists and health experts are criticizing President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for distorting facts about autism, Tylenol, and vaccines during a recent White House announcement. Trump suggested pregnant women should avoid Tylenol and claimed some groups don't get vaccines and have no autism, lacking evidence for these claims. Experts are concerned these statements could lead people to avoid necessary medications and vaccines. Autism experts at the CDC were not consulted for the announcement, which is unusual. Researchers emphasize that genetics is the most significant risk factor for autism, not vaccines or Tylenol.</p>

          <p>Health experts worldwide are refuting the Trump administration's claims linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children. The European Medicines Agency stated there is no new evidence to change current EU recommendations for acetaminophen use. Agencies in the UK and Australia also affirmed that taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe. International studies, including one following nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office has denounced President Trump's remarks about London adopting sharia law as "bigoted." Trump claimed London has "changed" under Khan's leadership and now wants to implement sharia law, echoing far-right conspiracy theories. Khan's spokesperson dismissed the comments, asserting London is the greatest city in the world and safer than major U.S. cities. British politicians have defended Khan, emphasizing his focus on improving London's infrastructure and safety. The remarks revive a long-standing feud between Trump and Khan, dating back to 2015 when Khan criticized Trump's proposed Muslim ban.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh was convicted by a Florida jury for attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself, was found guilty on all five charges, including attempted assassination and assaulting a federal officer. The incident occurred at Trump's golf course, where Routh aimed his rifle at a Secret Service agent before fleeing. After the verdict, Routh attempted to harm himself in the courtroom. This was the second assassination attempt against Trump in 2024. The Attorney General emphasized the Justice Department's commitment to punishing political violence, and Routh faces a life sentence.</p>

The suspension followed statements from the FCC Chair suggesting ABC could face license risks.

          <p>President Trump addressed the United Nations, emphasizing national sovereignty and a transactional approach to international relations. He touted his role as a global peacemaker, criticized climate change efforts, and warned about immigration. Trump highlighted his "America First" policy, reducing foreign aid and withdrawing from UN agencies. He shifted his stance on the Ukraine conflict, suggesting Kyiv could recapture territory from Russia with EU and NATO support. Allies are rethinking their reliance on the U.S., seeking new partners on climate change and other priorities.

She sought help in 2013 after confiding in her family, leading to a six-week rehab stay and commitment to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu hid her drinking problem for years, even during her participation in "Strictly Come Dancing." She attributes her alcoholism to a difficult childhood with an alcoholic and abusive father, and the pressure to maintain a "squeaky clean" image.

          <p>A growing number of young people are finding it impossible to move out of their parents' homes due to rising living costs, particularly utility bills, council tax, and rent. Research indicates that most young adults would face costs consuming nearly half their income if they moved out. This financial strain affects not only young people but also their parents, who may be unable to downsize. Experts suggest building more social homes and homes in areas with job opportunities.

Medical groups also reacted to claims that vaccines may cause autism, reiterating that studies have found no such link. The Coalition of Autism Scientists cautioned against recommending leucovorin as a treatment, stating there is little evidence to support it.</p>

          <p>President Trump had a chaotic day at the United Nations, delivering a speech attacking other countries and the UN itself. He later met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reversed course on the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump stated NATO countries should shoot down Russian jets violating their airspace and that Ukraine should reclaim its territory from Russia. This marks a shift from his previous stance and could be the most aggressive position of his presidency toward Russia. However, Trump's pronouncements are often subject to change, making it difficult to determine if this constitutes a meaningful policy shift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump appears to be reversing his foreign policy on Ukraine, now suggesting Ukraine can win the war against Russia. This shift comes after a U.N. speech where Trump criticized Putin and met with Ukrainian President Zelensky. Trump's new stance includes suggesting NATO should shoot down Russian aircraft violating borders. However, Trump's support for Ukraine includes no action items for increasing aid or weapons. He seems to be signaling a desire to disengage from the conflict, potentially normalizing relations with Russia. The shift could be driven by Trump's desire for a Nobel Peace Prize or frustration with Putin's lack of concessions.</p>

          <p>California is considering a bill to lower the volume of commercials on streaming services, driven by complaints about excessively loud ads. The bill, authored by Sen. Tom Umberg, aims to prevent streaming services from playing commercials louder than the shows they accompany. The legislation awaits the governor's signature. The CALM Act already regulates advertising volume on broadcast, satellite, and cable TV, but not streaming services. The streaming industry initially opposed the bill, citing difficulties controlling volume on all devices, but has since become neutral after amendments were made to the bill that won't allow private parties to sue streaming services for violating the law.</p>

          <p>Chinese local governments are facing urgent financial needs, prompting a wider clampdown by authorities on individuals with undeclared overseas income. Hubei province forced a local resident to pay 1.41 million yuan in back taxes and late fees on foreign earnings, with similar cases emerging in other local tax departments. This is happening as China drafts its 15th five-year plan, which will inform and reflect high-level policy priorities.

          <p>Hundreds of federal employees laid off due to cost-cutting measures are being asked to return to work. The General Services Administration (GSA) is reinstating employees who managed government workspaces, following a period of high costs and understaffing. The rehiring reflects how the administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce went too far, too fast. Agencies such as the IRS, Labor Department, and National Park Service have also brought back some employees. Democrats have criticized the administration's approach to slashing costs and jobs. The Government Accountability Office is examining the GSA's management of its workforce and lease terminations.</p>

The report highlights the death of Abdullah, a 19-year-old shot while waiting for food, and the challenges of reporting from Gaza due to Israeli restrictions.

          <p>China has endorsed Brazil’s $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), a fund that rewards nations for preserving tropical forests. The endorsement lends weight to the initiative, which is set to debut at COP30 in Belem this November. The TFFF will invest in low-risk assets and channel returns to tropical countries for forest preservation. Payments will depend on keeping annual deforestation below 0.5%, with at least one-fifth of resources going to Indigenous peoples. Brazil has committed $1 billion to the fund, urging other governments to make ambitious pledges.</p>

Internal polling suggests more people are open to voting Lib Dem than any other party. The party hopes to gain protest votes from those put off by both Conservatives and Labour, but faces a new and noisy rival in Reform.</p>

The Philippines has protested, describing it as an encroachment on its exclusive economic zone. The US has voiced support for Manila, condemning China's plans. The move is seen by some as evidence of Beijing's environmental responsibility, while others speculate it could lead to increased patrols around the shoal.

Tether has been furthering its plans to return to the U.S., given President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance.
