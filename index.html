        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the recent U.S.-China trade truce reached in Geneva, cautioning against excessive optimism as it may only be a temporary respite in a larger trade conflict. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the prior escalation as an embargo, signaling the need for sustained dialogue. The agreement includes a rollback of tariffs to 30%, a temporary lifting of China's rare earth export curbs, and a pledge for continued talks, but the underlying trade relationship remains fragile. The author emphasizes that businesses should use this window to fortify supply lines and diversify strategies to reduce dependence on China, as the back half of the trade storm could be severe.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's plan to restructure in a way that maintains non-profit control has received the endorsement of SoftBank, a major investor, contingent on the restructure being completed by the end of the year. This endorsement is crucial as SoftBank's $30 billion investment hinged on this structural change, however, Microsoft, another significant investor, has yet to approve the plan. The proposed restructuring involves the non-profit arm retaining control while the limited liability company transitions into a public benefit corporation, allowing for profit generation alongside social good.

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Prime Minister Keir Starmer's use of the phrase "island of strangers" in a speech about immigration, arguing that he was highlighting the impact of rising migration and supporting integration. The phrase drew criticism from some Labour MPs who compared it to Enoch Powell's divisive rhetoric, but Cooper rejected these comparisons. London Mayor Sadiq Khan acknowledged the context of the government's migration measures but stated he would not have used the same language. The debate arose following local elections where Reform UK gained ground by campaigning on immigration issues, prompting discussions on the government's approach to migration.</p>

          <p>New research from Dutch scientists indicates that the universe may end much faster than previously estimated, revising the timeline from 10 to the power of 1,100 years to 10 to the power of 78 years. The scientists calculated the evaporation time of white dwarf stars based on Stephen Hawking's theory of radiation, extending it to other celestial bodies. This research also aligns with recent findings suggesting that dark energy, which drives the universe's expansion, may be weakening, potentially leading to a "Big Crunch." Despite these revelations, the end of the universe remains far in the future, with more immediate threats to human existence.</p>

          <p>Hamas has released Edan Alexander, the last living U.S. citizen it held in Gaza, in a unilateral move that Donald Trump hailed as a "good faith step" toward ending the war and securing the release of remaining hostages.

This development occurs as UN-backed experts warn of severe food insecurity affecting half a million Palestinians in Gaza due to ongoing restrictions.

          <p>Many Americans are grappling with higher food costs, leading to increased credit card debt and visits to food pantries, with about a quarter of adults using credit cards to buy groceries and incurring debt. Experts recommend planning meals, stacking discounts and coupons, considering store brands, and reevaluating where to shop to save on grocery costs. Some consumers are turning to buy now, pay later loans for groceries, but are also falling behind on those payments.

          <p>Many American women are scoffing at the Trump administration's proposal to offer $5,000 "baby bonuses" to encourage childbirth, citing economic hardships and the high cost of raising children. With concerns over job security, student loans, and food affordability, women argue that $5,000 is insufficient to cover childcare costs or address broader economic challenges. The article highlights the growing influence of the pronatalist movement within US politics and the debate over pro-family policies, including childcare costs, housing affordability, and healthcare access.
