          <p>Three Little Pitties, a dog rescue in Houston, Texas, provides a safe haven for pregnant stray dogs to give birth and find forever homes. The organization, founded by Alayna Matranga Goodson, addresses Houston's severe stray animal problem by offering a secure environment where mother dogs can care for their newborns without the dangers of the streets or overcrowded shelters. After giving birth, the mother dogs are spayed to control the pet population, and once the pups are ready, Three Little Pitties helps them find adoptive families. Since opening six months ago, the rescue has successfully adopted out 150 dogs, offering a new lease on life for both mothers and their puppies.</p>

          <p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have launched an investigation following accusations that fans made "racially charged" comments towards Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green during an NBA playoff game. According to a team statement, one fan was ejected from the Target Center, while another left before security could identify him; the team is working to identify him. Green stated that there is an "agenda" to paint him as an angry Black man, which he disputes.

          <p>An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.1 struck near Greenback, Tennessee, and was felt as far away as Atlanta, Georgia. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the tremor occurred on Saturday morning within the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, an area known for minor annual earthquakes but not major tremors. The New York Times article notes that seismologists may revise the reported magnitude as they review the available data. The last time a strong earthquake was felt in the region was 2018, when a 4.4 magnitude tremor rattled houses but caused little damage.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party is set to announce comprehensive immigration plans aimed at tightening control over the UK's immigration system and addressing public concerns. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's White Paper, titled "Restoring Control Over the Immigration System," will propose strictly time-limited work visas for jobs not requiring graduate-level skills and potentially restrict foreign students' ability to stay in the UK after graduation. The article mentions that the proposals will emphasize linking immigration to the labor market, encouraging employers to recruit UK-based staff and review how judges apply Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. The government hopes these measures will reduce reliance on overseas workers and address voters' worries about legal and illegal migration.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, which failed to launch to Venus in 1972, reentered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in orbit. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, and the European Space Agency's space debris office also indicated its demise. Experts had anticipated that some parts of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venusian conditions, might survive the fiery descent. Launched as part of the Soviet Union's Venus exploration program, Kosmos 482 became stranded due to a rocket malfunction, with most of its components falling back to Earth within a decade of the failed launch.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, citing that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. Judge Susan Illston sided with unions, non-profits, and local governments, preventing mass layoffs known as "reductions in force" for 14 days. The ruling challenges the work of the "department of government efficiency" (Doge), which has been tasked with identifying targets for mass layoffs. The plaintiffs argued that the reorganization disrupts critical services, and the judge scheduled a hearing to consider a longer-lasting injunction.</p>

Despite Trump's insistence that inflation has been slayed, the CNBC article suggests that economists believe Powell is in a no-win situation given the volatile policy mix, including Trump's tariffs threatening both growth and inflation. The Fed's reluctance to cut rates pre-emptively is seen by some as a potential mistake, with concerns that waiting for labor market confirmation will be too late to prevent an economic downturn. Powell's actions are further complicated by his own history of being late to respond to rising inflation in 2021.</p>

          <p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, described the conclave to choose the new Pope as "immensely peaceful". According to the BBC, Nichols, one of 133 cardinals sealed off in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, said there was no "rancour" or "politicking" among the cardinals. He found the process to be a "rather wonderful experience", noting the calmness and solemnity of the proceedings. Being cut off from the outside world allowed him more time for prayer and reflection.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating a Tang dynasty tomb in China discovered a mural featuring a figure with blond hair and a beard, a rare find among the Han ethnicity figures typically depicted in such tombs. Yahoo News reports that the tomb, belonging to a man who died in 736 AD, features scenes of daily life. Experts believe the "Westerner" figure likely represents someone from Central Asia, possibly a Sogdian, who were active along Silk Road trading routes. The discovery provides new insights into daily life during the Tang dynasty and highlights the cultural exchange along the Silk Road.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration officials, in a joint operation with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, have taken over 100 people into custody, sparking uncertainty and worry in Nashville's immigrant community. According to Yahoo News, the operation is a reminder of the role local and state law enforcement play in President Donald Trump's mass deportation plans. Immigrant rights supporters claim the patrols have focused on areas with a high population of people of color, leading to accusations of racial profiling. Concerns are also being raised about detainees agreeing to deportation due to fear of prolonged detention without adequate legal representation.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic discusses how part-time jobs in America have become a trap for low-wage workers due to irregular hours and lack of benefits. Employers are increasingly hiring multiple part-time staff instead of full-time workers to circumvent labor laws and save on costs. The rise of just-in-time scheduling allows employers to schedule the bare minimum number of worker hours, leaving employees with fluctuating paychecks and difficulty accessing social safety net programs. The article calls for policy changes to address the problem of underwork and ensure stable, predictable work for low-wage workers.</p>
