        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has ended a period of intense hostilities, experts believe it won't easily translate to lasting peace due to deep-seated distrust. Diplomats from both countries acknowledge the US played a crucial role in de-escalation, leveraging IMF conditions to encourage Pakistan's agreement. Analysts suggest both nations used the military escalation to test each other's resolve, realizing the catastrophic potential of full-scale war. Though the ceasefire is expected to hold in the short term due to international pressure, challenges like terrorism and water security continue to strain relations. Optimism remains cautious, with medium-term stabilization seen as possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is introducing stricter migration rules, including English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad. This move is seen as a response to pressure from Reform UK and an attempt to seize the narrative on immigration. The new regulations also prioritize residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to hold direct negotiations with Vladimir Putin, and research suggests weight-loss jabs may reduce cancer risk.</p>

          <p>The US and China have reported making substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of the trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted they were "in-depth" and "candid". A joint statement detailing the agreements is expected soon. The talks are the first face-to-face meetings since the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The announcement has boosted financial markets, with stocks in China and Hong Kong rising, and the establishment of an economic and trade consultation mechanism between the two nations has been agreed upon.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, currently facing International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity, remains popular in the Philippines. His arrest and extradition to The Hague have sharply divided the nation, with some viewing him as a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte, has seen her approval ratings rise, positioning her as a potential presidential candidate. The upcoming midterm elections, where half the Senate seats are at stake, could significantly impact her future, especially given her impeachment on various charges. In Davao, Duterte's family continues to thrive politically, with his son expected to win the vice-mayoral race.</p>

The government aims to ensure that defense investments create domestic jobs and generate local prosperity. The initiative includes funding for infrastructure, healthcare, and education to attract and retain workers.

Albert's work in expanding rural housing in Ivory Coast earned him high honors, and his commitment to helping people overseas resonated deeply with his family.

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad believes that President Donald Trump's tariffs will hurt Americans more than targeted countries, increasing the U.S. cost of living. He argues that American products cannot compete with cheaper alternatives, causing the American economy to suffer. Mahathir suggests ASEAN can weather the impact through intergroup trade and business with other countries. He advocates for peace and dialogue over retaliation in response to the U.S. tariffs.</p>
