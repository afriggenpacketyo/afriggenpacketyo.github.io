            <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on a Chinese refinery, Shandong Shenxing Chemical Co Ltd, and several shipping companies for allegedly facilitating Iranian oil exports, furthering the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran's energy sector. Shandong Shenxing is accused of purchasing over $1 billion worth of Iranian crude, using ship-to-ship transfers to obscure the origin of the petroleum. China Oil and Petroleum Company Limited, allegedly controlled by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force, is also implicated, having received over $800 million from the refiner between 2020 and 2023. These sanctions aim to curtail Iran's oil revenue streams.</p>

            <h2>Fed Chair Powell Warns Tariffs Could Cause Inflation and Slow Economic Growth</h2>

          </div>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a "challenging scenario" for the central bank, managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy. Powell reiterated that the tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and will likely result in higher inflation and slower growth, as tariffs are taxes paid by importers, who then pass the costs to consumers. While the Fed is prepared to remain patient and assess the impact of these policies, some committee members are more focused on fighting inflation, while others would support rate cuts if the economy slows sharply. Recent reports indicate a solid economy, but declining consumer and business confidence raise concerns about future spending and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Technology stocks experienced a downturn, with Nvidia and AMD shares falling significantly after both companies warned of potential financial impacts from President Trump's tariff plans and export controls to China. Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion charge related to exporting its H20 graphics processing units to China, while AMD expects an $800 million hit from curbs on its MI308 products. These restrictions on chip exports to China have created volatility in the technology sector, raising concerns about global trade and potential recession. Investors had initially hoped for a period of strength for tech stocks under President Trump's administration, but tariff uncertainty has led to market cap losses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Massachusetts family is demanding answers from ICE after agents allegedly smashed a car window and detained a Guatemalan man who had applied for asylum. The family's lawyer claims ICE agents were not initially looking for Juan Francisco Mendez and used excessive force during his arrest. The incident, recorded on video, shows ICE agents using a hammer to break the car window and forcibly removing Mendez and his wife. The family and their lawyer are seeking his release, emphasizing that he has no criminal record and is in the process of seeking asylum.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for ignoring an order barring the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a notorious El Salvador prison. Judge James Boasberg stated that the government's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the court's order. He gave the administration one week to explain its plan to "purge" the contempt finding or identify the individuals who decided not to halt the transfer. The White House plans to seek immediate appellate relief, asserting its commitment to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to investigate the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland migrant, by the Trump administration. He aims to meet with Abrego Garcia and seek his release from the CECOT prison, despite court orders requesting his return to the United States. Van Hollen stated that the goal is to let the Trump administration and the government of El Salvador know that he will continue fighting to bring Abrego Garcia home. He was unable to meet with the president but did speak with the vice president, who claimed that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador to keep Abrego Garcia at CECOT.</p>

Indiana University’s Bloomington faculty council followed Rutgers University in passing a resolution to establish a pact with all 18 universities under the Big 10 academic alliance to defend academic freedoms. The resolution comes as a result of recent politically motivated actions by governmental bodies that pose a significant threat to the principles of higher education. This move comes after the FBI and Department of Homeland Security agents raided the home of a cybersecurity professor at Indiana University, leading to his firing.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs have triggered a period of volatility in the stock market, leaving Wall Street analysts uncertain about the future outlook. Tariffs are now the primary driver of stock prices, making it difficult for investors to anticipate market movements. Analysts warn of a potential economic downturn but advise investors to hold onto shares if possible, as markets typically rise over the long term. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expects the tariffs to increase inflation and slow economic growth, further contributing to market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Boasberg said that he had given the defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions, but none of their responses had been satisfactory.

            <p>In Sweden, parents are granted paid time off, known as 'inskolning,' to help their children settle into new daycare or preschool environments. This practice, unique to Nordic countries, involves parents attending school alongside their child to ease the transition and build relationships with staff and other children. The author, an American living in Sweden, contrasts this with the US system, where parents often lack such support. The author suggests that implementing a version of 'inskolning' in the US could foster a stronger sense of community and support for families.</p>
