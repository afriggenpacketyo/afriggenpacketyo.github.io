          <p>During a contentious Senate Finance Committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reiterated false claims about vaccines and defended controversial appointments to a key government advisory panel. He clashed with Democratic senators over his administration's changes to COVID-19 vaccine policy, which critics argue limit public access to the shots. The testimony highlighted the ongoing politicization of public health and the administration's skepticism toward established scientific consensus on immunizations, raising concerns among public health advocates.</p>

          <p>A British vascular surgeon, Neil Hopper, has been jailed for insurance fraud and possessing extreme pornography after he deliberately self-inflicted injuries that led to the amputation of his own legs. A court found that he used ice to freeze his limbs, then falsely claimed the damage was from sepsis to fraudulently collect over £466,000 from insurers. The case revealed his long-standing body dysphoria and sexual interest in amputation, which has caused significant concern among his former patients.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed lawsuits against Southern California Edison, seeking to recover more than $77 million for damages caused by the Eaton and Fairview fires. The government alleges that both deadly fires were ignited by the utility's faulty power infrastructure and a pattern of negligence.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping country-based tariffs. This decision could potentially entitle American businesses to tens of billions of dollars in refunds for levies they have already paid on foreign goods. However, the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, creating significant uncertainty for companies that are struggling with the economic impact of these trade policies.</p>

          <p>Michael Schill has announced his resignation as president of Northwestern University, concluding a turbulent three-year tenure. His leadership was defined by clashes over the university's response to pro-Palestinian campus protests and a punitive freeze of $790 million in federal research funding by the Trump administration. The significant financial blow led to widespread layoffs and a hiring freeze, creating immense pressure that ultimately contributed to his decision to step down.</p>

          <p>At a tense Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vehemently denied accusations from the recently fired CDC Director, Susan Monarez. Monarez had written an op-ed claiming Kennedy pressured her to preapprove recommendations from a newly overhauled vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy called her claim a lie, stating there were witnesses to all their meetings who could corroborate his account, adding another layer to the public controversy surrounding leadership and policy at the CDC.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has formally expressed that it is "very troubled" by the decision of Norway's massive $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund to divest from the American industrial company Caterpillar. The fund cited the "unacceptable risk" of the company contributing to human rights violations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as its reason for selling its stake. The U.S. State Department is now engaging directly with the Norwegian government over the move, which it characterized as based on "illegitimate claims."</p>

          <p>This editorial analyzes the powerful message conveyed by China's recent military parade, where leader Xi Jinping was prominently flanked by Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. The article interprets this as a clear statement of intent to challenge the current global order and forge a new axis of power. However, it cautions against viewing this alignment as a monolithic or permanent bloc, noting underlying frictions and the significant role U.S. policy will play in shaping future geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced a plan to house immigrant detainees at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, famously known as Angola, one of the nation's largest maximum-security prisons. This move is part of the Trump administration's strategy to use facilities with fearsome reputations to deter illegal immigration. Civil liberties advocates have raised serious concerns, arguing that placing civil detainees in a notoriously brutal punitive institution is unconstitutional and inhumane.</p>

          <p>As Florida plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine mandates, recent polling shows that a majority of Americans still support requiring vaccinations for children to attend school. However, this support has weakened over the last few decades, with a significant drop among Republicans, revealing a widening partisan gap on the issue. For the minority who oppose mandates, surveys suggest that concerns over parental choice and personal freedom are more influential than fears about vaccine safety.</p>

          <p>This article explores the critical decision of when to claim Social Security benefits, outlining the financial trade-offs involved. Claiming at the earliest age, 62, results in a permanently reduced monthly payment, whereas waiting until full retirement age (66-67) yields the standard benefit. Delaying until age 70 maximizes the monthly payout, and the article suggests strategies like using other retirement funds or annuities to create an income bridge that allows for this delay.
