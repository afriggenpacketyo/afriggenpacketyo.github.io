            <p>The Texas House passed a controversial school choice bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition. The bill allocates $10,000 per student annually for private school, $30,000 for disabled students, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Republican leaders hailed it as a historic victory for parental choice and increased public school funding, while Democrats criticized it as "welfare for the rich" that would harm public school districts. The bill now heads to the Texas Senate for consideration after a final vote in the House.</p>

            <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder delivered a resounding victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in Game 1 of their first-round series, winning 131-80.

            <p>Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of breaking a 30-hour "Easter truce" that was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Russian troops had violated the ceasefire "more than 2,000 times" since the start of Sunday. Russia's defense ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. Despite the accusations, US President Donald Trump expressed hope for a deal between the two countries this week.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders."

The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed, and another commanding officer will be reprimanded. This incident occurred amidst ongoing conflict and operations in the region.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee warns that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" level of economic activity followed by a summer slowdown. Businesses are currently stocking up on inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of the tariffs. This preemptive buying could inflate economic activity in the short term but lead to a decline in the coming months. Sectors like the auto industry are particularly vulnerable to these effects.</p>
