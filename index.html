Mamdani, a democratic socialist, emphasized his lived city experience and commitment to New Yorkers, while former Governor Cuomo questioned his opponent's qualifications. Republican Sliwa criticized both, often injecting humor. The debate highlighted stark differences in their approaches to governance and policy, with Mamdani currently leading in recent polls.</p>

The company's revenue also climbed by over 30% year-over-year, leading its CEO to raise future revenue growth forecasts and expand capacity investments. This financial success is attributed to the increasing adoption of AI models and strong orders for advanced processors. TSMC is also navigating potential U.S. tariff impacts, but its U.S. investments may offer some protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A surprise phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they agreed to meet in Hungary to discuss the war in Ukraine, has complicated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Washington. Zelensky was traveling to the US hoping to secure crucial military assistance, including long-range Tomahawk missiles, amidst intensified Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. The call, reportedly initiated by Russia, suggests a potential shift in US engagement, with Putin expressing concerns over missile deployment and discussing trade prospects. This development may undermine Ukraine's efforts to gain further American support.</p>

          <p>China has significantly tightened its control over rare earth exports, a critical move that amplifies its near-monopoly on these essential minerals vital for modern technology and military applications. This strategic decision has reignited trade tensions with the United States, prompting President Trump to threaten retaliatory tariffs. Experts suggest these new restrictions provide China with considerable leverage ahead of anticipated trade negotiations. Despite rare earths constituting a minor portion of China's economy, their immense strategic importance could reshape global supply chains and geopolitical dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two cases of a potentially more severe and easily transmissible Mpox strain, known as Clade I, have been confirmed in Los Angeles County, marking its initial detection in the US among individuals without international travel history to high-risk regions. Both patients required hospitalization but are now recovering, prompting health officials to heighten surveillance and vaccination efforts. Clade I is particularly concerning due to its potential for increased illness severity and broader transmission pathways, including non-sexual close personal contact. This article underscores the importance of public awareness regarding symptoms, prevention, and vaccine availability for at-risk populations.</p>

          <p>Uganda's Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit, is widely perceived as a "shadow army" instrumental in President Yoweri Museveni's prolonged grip on power and the expansion of his family dynasty. Critics accuse the SFC of abducting, torturing, and killing opposition activists, allegations the unit denies. The article highlights concerns that the SFC, once commanded by Museveni's son, now rivals the regular army, potentially leading to internal power struggles. Its specialized training, superior equipment, and alleged ethnic bias raise fears of political instability and an undemocratic succession in Uganda.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings anticipates a sustained decline in China's vast property market, projecting that nationwide primary property sales will decrease by 8% in 2025 and a further 6-7% in 2026. This pessimistic outlook is attributed to persistently soft overall demand, which continues to exert significant pressure on Chinese developers. Many developers are already facing immense challenges in completing housing projects while simultaneously managing their substantial debt obligations.

          <p>President Trump's unprecedented public acknowledgment of authorizing CIA covert operations in Venezuela grants the agency extensive latitude, potentially enabling actions ranging from lethal strikes to efforts aimed at destabilizing or overthrowing Nicolás Maduro's government. These presidential findings, typically classified, require congressional notification but not approval, historically leading to significant interventions abroad. Experts warn of the inherent lack of limitations on such CIA activities and the "slippery slope" of US involvement in Latin America. This article underscores widespread concerns about the potential scope and consequences of these undisclosed operations targeting alleged drug traffickers or the Venezuelan regime.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly confirmed authorizing CIA covert operations in Venezuela, an unprecedented disclosure, amidst a significant escalation of US military activities in the region. These actions include at least five strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats, resulting in 27 fatalities, and the deployment of B-52 bombers near Venezuela's coast. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, facing contested legitimacy, has responded by appealing for peace with the US and ordering military exercises, while condemning what he views as US aggression and "regime change" plots. UN human rights experts have labeled the US strikes as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>Indiana University has provoked widespread criticism, including accusations of unlawful censorship, after ordering its student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (IDS), to cease printing news editions and subsequently firing its director of student media. Students and press freedom advocates argue the university is directly interfering with editorial content, despite the administration's claims of shifting resources to digital media and addressing financial deficits. The former director, Jim Rodenbush, asserts his termination was a direct consequence of his resistance to censorship. The IDS responded by publishing a digital front page prominently labeled "CENSORED."</p>
