          <p>House Republicans are struggling to pass President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, which includes significant tax cuts and spending increases for border security and defense, offset by cuts to health care and nutrition programs. A crucial procedural vote was held open for hours as holdouts, including both moderates and conservatives, resisted the Senate's revised version. Despite Trump's public pressure, securing enough votes remains uncertain, jeopardizing the July 4th deadline for the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have confirmed the discovery of 3I/Atlas, only the third interstellar object ever detected passing through our Solar System. Classified as a comet, this visitor is likely the largest observed to date, estimated at 10-20 kilometers wide, and is not bound by the Sun's orbit. The object poses no threat to Earth and will continue to brighten as it approaches the Sun before exiting the Solar System. Scientists are racing to study its properties, offering a rare opportunity to analyze material from outside our star system.</p>

          <p>Armenia's top diplomat, Ararat Mirzoyan, expressed the nation's readiness to deepen relations with China, seeking to elevate bilateral ties to a strategic level. This move reflects Armenia's active foreign policy diversification following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and subsequent events, which strained its relationship with Russia. Armenia is withdrawing from a Moscow-led military alliance, signaling a shift in its geopolitical alignment and a desire for broader international partnerships.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking in his federal trial, but was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.

Combs reacted with apparent relief, expressing gratitude to the jury. He will remain in detention pending his sentencing, with bail denied due to the nature of the convictions.</p>
