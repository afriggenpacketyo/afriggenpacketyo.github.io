          <p>Formerly a tropical storm, Chantal was downgraded to a depression after making landfall in South Carolina, bringing heavy rainfall across North Carolina and Virginia that led to significant flooding and prompted numerous water rescues. The National Weather Service reported near-record river crests, and in Chatham County, North Carolina, over 100 roads were flooded and a highway segment collapsed. While no injuries were immediately reported, authorities conducted door-to-door notifications for residents in flood-prone areas as the system moved northeast along the coast.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood resulted in three fatalities and ten injuries early Monday morning. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel stated that officers responded to gunfire where a large crowd of about 40 people had gathered. The victims, including two injured juveniles who are expected to survive, were transported to several local hospitals. Authorities had been monitoring the area over the weekend due to previous disturbances and recovered dozens of shell casings, suggesting a possible exchange of gunfire.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump is meeting with the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal, prompting analysis of his strategic interests in the region. While the White House emphasizes commercial opportunities, experts suggest the focus may be on securing access to critical minerals and addressing security concerns like migration and drug trafficking routes. The selection of these specific nations is notable, as they are smaller economies but possess significant untapped natural resources. Critics point out that several of these leaders face domestic challenges regarding the rule of law, suggesting the meeting serves mutual political interests.</p>

          <p>A space capsule named "Nyx Mission Possible," developed by German startup The Exploration Company, was lost during its planned re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. The capsule was on a memorial flight, carrying the cremated remains of 166 individuals, which were intended to be returned to their families after orbiting the planet. Communication with the craft was lost at an altitude of 26 kilometers, just before its parachutes were scheduled to deploy over the Pacific Ocean.

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson of murdering three of her former relatives by serving them a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms. She was also found guilty of the attempted murder of a fourth guest who survived the poisonous beef Wellington served in July 2023. Prosecutors argued that Patterson intentionally poisoned her guests and then attempted to cover up her actions by lying to police and disposing of a food dehydrator. The defense claimed the poisoning was accidental, but the jury ultimately delivered four guilty verdicts after a highly publicized nine-week trial.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. The move, praised by campaigners, aims to formally recognize early-stage pregnancy loss as a bereavement and help reduce the stigma surrounding the topic.</p>

          <p>Tesla's shares experienced a significant drop in pre-market trading, with investors showing concern over CEO Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party, the 'America Party.' Analysts suggest that Musk's deeper dive into politics is viewed as a distraction during a critical period for the electric car manufacturer, potentially damaging the brand. The move has also intensified his public feud with former President Donald Trump, who called the plan "ridiculous." The market reaction reflects broader investor exhaustion with Musk's political entanglements and the potential for negative business repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and fitness experts suggest that exercising in the morning can be effective for weight loss, but only if it does not compromise sleep. Research indicates that individuals who consistently work out between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. tend to have lower BMIs and waist sizes. However, experts emphasize that getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep is crucial for muscle repair, growth, and overall health. If an early workout schedule leads to sleep deprivation, it can stall progress, making it more beneficial to prioritize rest over exercise in such cases.</p>

Citing concerns over the rising cost of living, which they fear contributed to electoral losses, state leaders have recently diluted environmental review laws, paused a cap on oil industry profits, and softened clean fuel mandates. This retrenchment has frustrated climate activists who see it as a capitulation to political and industry pressure.

          <p>The popular claim that seed oils like canola and soybean are toxic is being challenged by many nutrition and health researchers. Critics, including public figures, argue these oils drive obesity and inflammation, but scientists say these assertions are often based on misinterpretations. While seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can be converted to pro-inflammatory compounds, human studies have not shown that consuming them increases inflammation markers. Experts agree that the main issue is the overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, which happen to contain seed oils, rather than the oils themselves being inherently harmful.</p>

          <p>A new wave of youth-led protests in Kenya is drawing parallels to the historic "Saba Saba" (Seven Seven) demonstrations of the 1990s, which pushed the country toward multi-party democracy. Analysts note that both movements were driven by a demand for better leadership and an end to corruption and state abuse. While the current Gen Z-led protests are more technologically savvy and lack singular political leaders, they face similar challenges, including a forceful government response. The enduring legacy of Saba Saba is seen in the continued belief that ordinary Kenyans have the power to demand political accountability.</p>

          <p>As Denmark takes over the six-month presidency of the EU Council, it faces the challenge of championing green policies in a shifting political landscape. The focus in Europe has moved from the ambitious Green Deal to concerns about geopolitics, defense, and industrial competitiveness. To maintain momentum, Danish leaders are framing the green transition as essential for Europe's strategic autonomy and defense, arguing that reducing fossil fuel dependency strengthens security. However, they face skepticism from some member states who view ambitious climate targets as a threat to economic development.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced he would impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This threat came as the bloc of developing nations, including China and Russia, met in Brazil and issued a statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures. The administration also confirmed that new general tariff rates, delayed since April, would take effect on August 1 for countries without a trade deal. The move escalates global trade tensions and creates further uncertainty for U.S. trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a surprise move, Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Transport Minister Roman Starovoit after less than a year in the position. The dismissal comes as Russia's transport sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of aviation parts and financial strain on its railway system due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. No official reason was given for the dismissal, but sources suggest it may be linked to corruption scandals in the Kursk region, where Starovoit previously served as governor. Andrei Nikitin, a former regional governor, has been appointed as the acting transport minister.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The difference in taste between American and European chocolate stems from distinct production methods, regulations, and consumer preferences. U.S. chocolate, like Hershey's, often contains butyric acid for a longer shelf life, which imparts a tangy flavor that can be unfamiliar to European palates. In contrast, EU regulations mandate higher cocoa solid content and the use of cocoa butter, while traditional processes like conching create a smoother texture. These differences reflect a divergence in culinary history, with Europe prioritizing traditional, fine flavors and the U.S. favoring sweetness and durability.</p>
