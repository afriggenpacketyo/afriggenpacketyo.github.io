          <p>Nvidia's stock experienced volatility following reports that the Trump administration may revise chip trade restrictions, specifically the "AI diffusion" rule which limits exports of advanced AI chips to certain countries. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed these restrictions, with AMD's CEO Lisa Su advocating for a balance between national security and industry growth. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang previously expressed concerns that being excluded from the Chinese AI market would be detrimental to the company's growth. The potential policy change comes as the chip industry grapples with balancing national security concerns and maintaining access to key international markets.</p>

          <p>In a state trial, three former Memphis police officers were acquitted on all charges, including second-degree murder, related to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols during a traffic stop in January 2023. The verdict contrasts with the officers' federal convictions for witness tampering and civil rights violations. The jury deliberated for over eight hours, considering evidence from body camera footage and surveillance videos. The defense argued that the officers' actions were justified responses to a suspect resisting arrest, while prosecutors maintained that excessive force was used. Nichols' death sparked nationwide protests and calls for police reform.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, is accused of providing his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with surgical anesthetics that ultimately led to her death. Ryan and Harris became romantically involved after Harris had her wisdom teeth removed by Ryan. Prosecutors allege Ryan admitted to noticing Harris when she was only 14 and later provided her with habit-forming drugs, including propofol and ketamine. Text messages revealed Harris asking for drugs and Ryan administering them while she was asleep, according to authorities. Ryan was convicted of drug distribution and depraved heart murder and sentenced to 45 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Six individuals, including a county judge and city council members in Texas, have been indicted on charges of illegal vote harvesting and evidence tampering. The indictments stem from an investigation by Attorney General Ken Paxton's "election integrity unit" targeting Latino enclaves. Critics argue the investigation is a form of voter suppression aimed at Latino voters, while Paxton asserts that the officials engaged in backroom deals to rig elections. The indictments accuse officials of providing monetary compensation in exchange for vote harvesting services, which involves collecting and delivering absentee ballots.</p>

          <h2>Should you renew your maturing CD account if rate cuts look likely?</h2>

          <p>The article discusses whether it makes sense to renew a maturing certificate of deposit (CD) account in 2025, given the likelihood of interest rate cuts. It suggests that savers should still consider renewing their CD accounts, as the rate cut trajectory could change, and the rate cuts are likely to be small. Additionally, savers would lose the interest-earning opportunity in the interim if they moved their funds elsewhere. The article advises readers to weigh their economic needs and the opportunity to earn elevated interest before making a decision.</p>

          <p>Byron Scott, former Lakers player and head coach, is facing a lawsuit accusing him of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old student in 1987. The alleged victim claims Scott forced her into a closet and attempted to force her to perform oral sex. Scott's attorney denies the allegations, stating that Scott believed the plaintiff to be over 18 at the time and respects girls and women. The complaint also blames the school for failing to protect the plaintiff.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders and eight Democratic colleagues have urged Paramount Global not to settle with Donald Trump over a $20 billion lawsuit against 60 Minutes. The senators argue that settling would capitulate to Trump's attempts to intimidate the media and suppress free speech. They characterize Trump's lawsuit, which alleges election interference due to the network's editing of an interview with Kamala Harris, as a meritless attack on the First Amendment. The senators praise Paramount Global's initial decision to file motions to dismiss the case.</p>
