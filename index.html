        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists note that despite a strong overall market, job seekers may find it difficult to secure new employment due to a "low firing, low hiring" trend. This trend is characterized by companies hiring at their slowest pace since 2014 and a growing divide between employed and unemployed individuals. To stand out in this competitive environment, experts advise job seekers to leverage personal relationships through creative networking, explore internal opportunities within their current companies, and tailor their applications to highlight specific skills and achievements. Experts also suggest that those facing long-term unemployment should consider upskilling or reskilling to fill any gaps and demonstrate initiative to potential employers.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a plan to increase pressure on the United States in hopes of prompting serious trade negotiations. The European Commission has laid out 95 billion euros worth of goods that they could target with higher tariffs in retaliation to the duties that the United States has announced or imposed. The bloc would also start a World Trade Organization dispute against the United States on both across-the-board tariffs and on duties on cars and car parts. This plan is a clear threat that will hang over the Trump administration as European officials hope to negotiate to avoid lasting tariffs.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney has announced that he will not support a bill which would allow assisted dying in Scotland, citing his religious faith as a factor in his decision. The legislation, put forward by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, would allow terminally ill people to request medical assistance to end their lives if deemed mentally fit by two doctors. Swinney's opposition is expected to influence undecided MSPs, particularly within his own party, as the Scottish Parliament prepares to vote on the bill. He believes that changing the law would alter the relationship between doctor and patient, potentially pressuring vulnerable individuals to end their lives prematurely.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that deporting noncitizens to Libya without due process would violate his existing court order, following reports of the White House considering such plans. The ruling clarified that any removals to countries like Libya or Saudi Arabia would defy the preliminary injunction issued last month, which barred the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to countries other than their origin without due process. The judge's order came after lawyers representing migrants filed an emergency motion citing both press reports and firsthand accounts from migrants alleging they were actively being prepared for removal to Libya or Saudi Arabia on military aircraft.</p>

          <p>The EU is considering imposing tariffs on US aircraft and car exports in a fresh attempt to persuade Donald Trump to drop his current and proposed tariffs against the EU. The new list of potential tariff targets would hit Boeing but also include further categories of US exports including chemicals, electrical equipment including cameras, health-related products and some foods stuff such as sweet potato and nuts. At the same time Brussels has launched a consultation with member states on potential litigation against the US over the blanket 20% reciprocal tariffs the US president announced last month. The new categories of tariffs are designed to inject a fresh sense of jeopardy into EU-US talks, though officials stressed that they were not directly retaliatory but aimed a ‚Äúrebalancing‚Äù.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict that the spacecraft, intended to land on Venus but failing to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While most of the spacecraft disintegrated within a decade, the landing capsule, weighing over 1,000 pounds, is believed to have remained in orbit. Experts suggest that the risk of impact on humans is low, similar to that of a random meteorite fall, but they caution that the heat shield's integrity is uncertain after so many years in orbit.</p>

While acknowledging Trump's focus on trade, tax cuts, and deregulation, Griffin questioned whether these measures would collectively drive sufficient economic growth.

The company reported a 46% increase in year-over-year sales, along with record net income, adjusted EBITDA, and operating income. The increase in sales is partly attributed to consumers rushing to purchase vehicles amid concerns of price hikes due to auto tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that the U.S. may announce new trade agreements this week, facing pressure to finalize deals with economic partners before a 90-day pause on tariffs ends on July 9. Trump mentioned a potential "major trade deal" with a "big, highly respected country" and a "full and comprehensive" accord with the United Kingdom. Negotiations are ongoing with countries including Canada, Italy, India, and Japan. Experts believe negotiations will likely extend into June, though smaller countries may be motivated to act quickly.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced interest rates for the fourth time in the past year, lowering them to 4.25% from 4.5%. Bank governor Andrew Bailey cited the slowdown in inflation as the reason for the cut, but cautioned about the unpredictability of the global economy due to US tariffs. The Bank considered a larger cut to 4% due to concerns about the global trade war's impact on economic growth. Future rate cuts are expected to be gradual and careful, with the rate-setting committee divided on the decision.</p>

          <p>This article explores the work of Carl Hiaasen, a novelist and former journalist known for his satirical portrayals of Florida's eccentricities and environmental issues. Hiaasen's novels, often described as part crime thriller and part social commentary, draw inspiration from his decades of covering corruption and environmental destruction in South Florida. The article discusses Hiaasen's unique characters, his blend of humor and righteous anger, and the challenges he faces in writing satire in an era where reality often surpasses fiction. It also touches on the personal impact of his brother's murder in a mass shooting and his continued commitment to writing about Florida's complex and often absurd realities.</p>

          <p>Since President Trump announced plans for mass deportations and rescinded protections for hospitals and clinics, health care facilities have seen a jump in no-shows. Across the country, doctors, nurses and social workers are increasingly concerned that people with serious medical conditions, including injuries, chronic illnesses and high-risk pregnancies, are forgoing medical care out of fear of being apprehended by immigration officials. In a survey conducted by KFF, a health policy research organization, 31 percent of immigrants said that worries about immigration status ‚Äî their own or that of a family member ‚Äî was negatively affecting their health. Research has shown that immigration crackdowns are linked with poorer birth outcomes and mental health status, lapses in care, and fewer people accessing the types of public programs that reduce illness and poverty overall.</p>

Ever since the German Parliament building reopened in Berlin in 1999, its second-largest meeting room has been occupied by what had often been Germany‚Äôs second-largest party, the Social Democrats. Now, following their disastrous performance in February‚Äôs federal elections, the Social Democrats may lose the room to the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which came in second and insists that, by the rules of the Parliament, it should get the room instead.
