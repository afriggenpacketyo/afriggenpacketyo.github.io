          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery has successfully raised £3.8 million to acquire Dame Barbara Hepworth's sculpture, "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red." The 1943 wooden carving, which had been in private ownership, was at risk of being exported from the UK. A major public fundraising appeal, supported by over 2,800 donations and significant grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund, met the target ahead of the deadline. The gallery announced the important piece will now go on permanent public display in the artist's home city of Wakefield and will also be loaned to other UK institutions.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that China and India should act as partners, not adversaries, during a two-day visit to Delhi for talks with his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar. This meeting marks a significant step towards normalizing relations, which deteriorated after deadly border clashes in the Himalayas in 2020. Both sides acknowledged a recent positive trend, discussing issues from trade to border stability, with Yi noting that stability has been restored at the borders. The visit is seen as groundwork for a potential meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, signaling a thaw in diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>China's urban unemployment rate for individuals aged 16-24, excluding students, surged to 17.8% in July, its highest point in nearly a year. This increase follows four months of decline and is attributed to a record number of new graduates entering a challenging job market. In response, the Chinese government has initiated several programs to support jobless youth, including a campaign running until December that offers career guidance, job referrals, and training opportunities. The data underscores the economic pressures facing young people in the country as they navigate an increasingly competitive employment landscape.</p>

          <p>A critical drought in Turkey's Tekirdag province has completely depleted the main dams of potable water, leading to severe water shortages and emergency restrictions. A sharp drop in national precipitation, with rainfall in the Marmara region down 95% in July, has left some residents without water for months. Authorities are resorting to alternative measures, such as pumping irrigation water for domestic use and drilling new wells for groundwater. The crisis highlights the severe impact of climate change in the region, with residents facing immense hardship and being forced to fetch water or travel for basic needs like laundry.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a prison sentence for sexual assault marked a pivotal moment for the sport's pay-per-view model. His fight against Peter McNeeley, which lasted only 89 seconds, shattered viewership records despite its farcical nature, demonstrating that spectacle could triumph over competitive substance. The event, promoted as "He's Back," attracted a massive celebrity audience and generated a record $96 million in television revenue. This article reflects on how the fight established a blueprint for modern boxing spectacles, paving the way for celebrity matches and influencer bouts by proving Tyson's enduring, mystique-driven drawing power.</p>

          <p>A writer shares her personal journey of being diagnosed with very high cholesterol after years of unlearning an eating disorder. Having recovered from anorexia, she had embraced a diet without restriction, which ultimately led to health complications. The article explores the complex challenge of adopting a healthier diet for medical reasons without relapsing into disordered eating patterns, criticizing societal health messaging that conflates weight with health and often triggers those with a history of eating disorders. She reflects on the difficulty of navigating a world where health-conscious choices are often misinterpreted as a desire for weight loss, highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches to diet and well-being.</p>

          <p>Social media platforms are fundamentally altering the way people communicate, driven by engagement-focused algorithms that reward viral content and memes. In an interview, author Adam Aleksic explains that this phenomenon, which he terms "Algospeak," is creating a new lexicon and rewiring how language evolves, often at an accelerated pace. The discussion highlights how platforms like TikTok and Instagram incentivize certain types of speech and linguistic trends, leading to the rapid adoption of new words and phrases across a global user base. This digital evolution is transforming language in real-time, with implications for culture and communication.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom's office countered that Singh obtained a work permit under the Trump administration.

According to a Bloomberg report, the plan involves converting some or all of Intel's $10.9 billion in grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company equity. This move aligns with the administration's strategy of creating government-backed national champions in strategic industries to revitalize U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.

Despite the escalating violence, the Togolese government has remained largely silent, reportedly to avoid demoralizing troops and the public. The incursions, primarily from an Al-Qaeda-linked group, are spilling over from Burkina Faso and spreading south into Togo's poorest regions. Analysts suggest the government's military-focused response is insufficient without addressing the structural issues and lack of state services that make the area vulnerable to extremist influence.</p>

Further evidence included subjecting President Zelenskyy to an open-ended press conference, a format not extended to Putin, and interrupting the summit with European leaders to take a phone call from the Russian president, suggesting a prioritization of Moscow's perspective in the ongoing diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <h2>Travel Trend 'Coolcations' Grows as Tourists Avoid Extreme Summer Heat in Southern Europe</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 01:07:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of travelers are opting for "coolcations," choosing destinations with more temperate climates over traditional Mediterranean hotspots amid concerns about record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires. Tourists are increasingly booking trips to places like Scandinavia, the Scottish Highlands, and Slovenia, or shifting their travel to the cooler spring and autumn months. This trend, driven by the climate crisis, is causing a behavioral shift in European tourism. While this may alleviate overtourism in southern countries, it also poses economic challenges for nations like Greece and Spain that are heavily reliant on peak-season summer travel.</p>

          <p>Air Canada and the union representing its 10,000 striking flight attendants have returned to the bargaining table for the first time since the strike began over the weekend. The labor dispute, centered on demands for better pay and compensation for ground duties like boarding, has caused the cancellation of approximately 700 daily flights, affecting around 130,000 travelers each day. Despite the Canada Industrial Relations Board ruling the strike unlawful, the union has stated that its members will not return to work until their key demands are addressed. The Canadian government is urging a swift resolution to minimize further disruption.</p>

Recognizing this trend, some employers and organizations are offering structured, activity-based events like dumpling-making classes and pub quizzes to facilitate interaction in a low-pressure environment. Young workers report that these events help fill a social gap left by remote work and the decline of spontaneous social outings. This shift reflects a broader desire among the younger generation to resist a cluttered digital world and form more meaningful real-life connections.</p>

          <p>After nine months of largely peaceful demonstrations, protests across Serbia have intensified, leading to violent clashes between police and citizens. Protesters, angered by what they describe as the regime's violence and authoritarianism, have engaged in nightly confrontations involving batons, tear gas, and flares. The government, led by President Aleksandar Vucic, has been accused of using paramilitaries and excessive police force, with numerous reports of brutality and mass arrests. Vucic has promised a harsh state response to restore order, while activists fear for their safety but vow to continue their fight for political change.</p>

          <p>A former coach at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute, an Iowa academy known for training Olympic champions, has been arrested by the FBI on a federal child pornography charge. The coach, Sean Gardner, was suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022 following allegations of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts and secretly recording others in a bathroom at a previous job. Despite the suspension and police reports, his disciplinary case with SafeSport remains unresolved, and he was later able to secure a job in a hospital. The case highlights ongoing concerns about the slow and opaque process for handling abuse allegations in Olympic sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the United States experienced a significant collapse in its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has grown to a record 15 million colonies, solidifying its status as the world's top honey producer. According to Chinese researchers, the key difference lies in management techniques. The U.S. model often involves large, clustered apiaries with thousands of colonies and minimal intervention, making them more vulnerable to disease and environmental stress. In contrast, Chinese beekeeping typically involves smaller, more mobile operations where beekeepers actively manage their hives, leading to healthier and more resilient bee populations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the European Union's failure to take decisive action against Israel's actions in Gaza, such as suspending trade agreements, is rooted in structural racism and a colonial mentality. The author contrasts the EU's swift and severe sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine with its paralysis regarding the devastation in Gaza, suggesting Palestinian lives are treated as expendable. The piece contends that the dehumanizing logic applied to racialized Europeans and refugees is now evident in the EU's abandonment of Palestinians. A true moral reckoning, the author concludes, requires confronting these deep-seated biases that undermine the EU's credibility.</p>

          <p>Texas State Representative Nicole Collier is protesting a Republican-led redistricting effort by staying on the House floor, refusing to accept a mandatory law enforcement escort. After Democrats returned to the Capitol following a boycott to block the plan, the House Speaker mandated that they could only leave the floor with a police escort to ensure their presence for a future vote. Collier has rejected this condition, which she views as an intimidation tactic, and is being confined to the House chamber and her office. Two other Democratic representatives have joined her in solidarity, planning to stay with her overnight.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a preliminary injunction for two college football players, DJ Wingfield of USC and Kaedin Robinson of UCLA, effectively preventing them from playing in the upcoming season. Both athletes had sued the NCAA, arguing that its five-year eligibility rule violated antitrust laws by unfairly limiting their potential to earn NIL compensation. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility rule was not commercial in nature and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny. The decision is a significant blow to both teams, as Wingfield was expected to be a starting offensive lineman for USC and Robinson a top receiver for UCLA.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House appeared to be a strategic success, allowing him to navigate a tense diplomatic environment without major concessions. Unlike a confrontational meeting in February, this encounter was more composed, with Zelenskyy focusing on securing U.S. security guarantees and expressing readiness for a meeting with Vladimir Putin. While he remained quiet on the contentious issue of a ceasefire before peace talks, he effectively presented Ukraine's battlefield situation to President Trump. The key outcome of the trip was not a final resolution but the buying of more time for Ukraine amid ongoing international pressures.</p>
