            <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant deported to El Salvador amidst claims of MS-13 gang affiliation. Van Hollen met with Garcia to assess his situation, as Garcia's deportation was initially acknowledged as an administrative error, though Trump officials now assert it was justified. Trump labeled Van Hollen a "fool" for his actions, while Garcia's wife maintains his innocence and seeks his return to the U.S., despite domestic violence allegations against him. Both a federal district court and the Supreme Court have ordered the Trump administration to "facilitate" Garcia’s release and return to the U.S. for proper deportation proceedings.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>New tariffs on imported vehicles and car parts are predicted to drive up the cost of auto repairs and maintenance, consequently leading to higher auto insurance rates for consumers. While President Trump considered a temporary pause on tariffs, the existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and goods from Canada and Mexico continue to impact the price of car parts. As repair costs rise, insurance companies will likely increase premiums to offset these expenses, affecting all drivers regardless of their coverage level. Experts advise drivers to shop around for the best insurance rates and maintain a good driving record to mitigate the impact of rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. has reportedly presented potential peace plans to allies for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which involve a ceasefire and the rollback of some sanctions against Moscow. Under the proposal, the conflict would be considered frozen, with Russia maintaining control over occupied Ukrainian territories, and Ukraine would not join NATO. While some sanctions could be eased, the plan requires Russia to cease fighting and Ukraine to receive security guarantees, with further discussions needed with Ukraine. The proposal is not considered a final settlement, and European allies would not recognize Russia's control over Ukrainian territories.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly using claims of uncertainty to avoid complying with adverse court orders, particularly in immigration cases. This strategy involves twisting the interpretation of court orders and misrepresenting them publicly. The administration's actions have led to investigations by judges who suspect deliberate defiance of court decrees, testing the limits of the legal system. The administration's approach reflects a maximalist view of executive powers and a belief that the Supreme Court will ultimately support its positions.</p>

            <p>Casey DeSantis, Florida's First Lady, faces potential political setbacks due to controversy surrounding her welfare initiative, Hope Florida Foundation.

            <p>China has established the world's first satellite constellation in Earth-moon space, creating a communication and navigation network stretching from low Earth orbit to distant retrograde orbit (DRO). The constellation consists of three satellites operating in "cislunar" space and can track each other without relying on ground stations. This network is intended to support future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond, and has demonstrated a record-setting 1.17 million km space-to-space communication link.</p>

            <p>A red card issued to Hull FC's Cade Cust significantly impacted the outcome of the derby match against Hull KR. Cust's shoulder-barge to the head of Mourgue led to his dismissal, giving KR a significant advantage for most of the game. Hull KR capitalized on this advantage, securing a win despite a spirited comeback attempt by Hull FC in the second half. The match featured strong performances from both sides, but Cust's dismissal proved decisive.</p>

            <p>Kilmar Ábrego García is a Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported from Maryland to an El Salvador mega-prison by the Trump administration. Despite a court order protecting him from deportation, Ábrego García was sent to El Salvador amid allegations of gang ties, which his lawyers deny. The U.S. Supreme Court has partially backed an order requiring officials to "facilitate" his release, but the Trump administration continues to push back. Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Ábrego García in El Salvador, and El Salvador's President has stated he would not let Ábrego García return to the US.</p>

Lienemann, who had a long criminal history, was murdered in Detroit in 1985. The Indiana State Police said that if he were alive today, he would have been charged with Bailer's murder.</p>

            <p>Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' is described as a rare and exhilarating type of horror film, a switch-flip, where a straightforward drama transforms into a fright-fest.

The film is praised for its unique concept, stunning action sequences, and ability to invest audiences in the journeys of its characters, even the immortal ones.</p>

            <p>Eli Lilly has announced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial for orforglipron, a once-daily GLP-1 pill for diabetes and weight loss. The trial demonstrated that the pill effectively lowered A1C levels and resulted in weight loss in adults with Type 2 diabetes. The most common side effects were mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues. Eli Lilly plans to submit orforglipron to the FDA for approval as a Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026 and for weight management by the end of this year.</p>

            <p>Mondelēz International has confirmed that its 360g dark chocolate Toblerone bar will no longer be sold in the UK after nearly six decades. The company attributed the decision to changing consumer tastes and a focus on growing its business. The original Toblerone bar was first invented in 1908, with the dark chocolate version released in 1969. The decision comes as the UK heads into the Easter bank holiday weekend, when chocolate sales are expected to be elevated.</p>
