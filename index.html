          <p>This article details the groundbreaking work of French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine and Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, who have developed a "digital bridge" to help paralyzed individuals regain motor functions. The technology involves wirelessly transmitting signals from the brain to the spinal cord, bypassing the injury site. Early clinical trials have shown promise in restoring not only walking ability but also other critical functions like blood pressure regulation and bladder control. While the therapy is still in its early stages, the researchers hope to expand its accessibility and address a range of issues faced by individuals with spinal cord injuries, such as sexual function and normalizing body temperature.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to The New York Times, CVS Caremark will stop covering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy, despite research showing Zepbound leads to more weight loss. This decision is attributed to secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which prioritize lower drug prices for employers but restrict treatment options for patients. The move has sparked criticism from doctors and patients who prefer Zepbound, arguing it limits their ability to tailor obesity drug prescriptions. While Caremark claims the decision will lower drug costs, it raises concerns about patient choice and the influence of PBMs on healthcare decisions.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, rather than insist on a cease-fire first, as had been laid out in a plan announced by European leaders. President Zelenskyy responded cautiously to the Russian counteroffer of direct talks, insisting again on a halt in the fighting, saying he would personally attend negotiations. Mr. Putin, in suggesting direct talks, had not proposed a presidential meeting. The European leaders who visited Kyiv on Saturday were clear that only agreeing to an unconditional cease-fire would spare Moscow additional sanctions targeting oil exports and banking.</p>

Migrants will also have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the UK, instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years, under the plans. Labour's long-awaited migration rules, to be published on Monday, will "create a system that is controlled, selective and fair," the prime minister said.</p>

President Trump announced that the two sides had agreed to a cease-fire with the help of U.S. mediation. India made no reference to an American role, presumably in part because it hoped to avoid any domestic perception that it had stopped its fight against its neighbor and archenemy under outside pressure. In Pakistan, too, many cast the end of the confrontation as a victory for their country and military.</p>

This change follows Palantirâ€™s first-quarter 2025 earnings, which beat the Visible Alpha consensus by 2.5%.
