          <p>AMD reported strong first-quarter earnings, surpassing expectations with adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents and revenue of $7.44 billion. Despite these positive results, AMD anticipates a $700 million revenue hit in the current quarter due to U.S. export controls on AI chips to China, with a total expected loss of $1.5 billion through the third quarter. CEO Lisa Su highlighted that strong demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs in the data center segment is offsetting these regulatory headwinds, as AMD's chips are being utilized for AI training and deployment by major model developers. The company's Client and Gaming segment also saw growth, driven by laptop and PC chip sales, though gaming revenue declined due to lower console chip sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Super Micro released weaker-than-expected guidance, citing economic uncertainty and the potential impact of tariffs. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 31 cents on revenue of $4.60 billion, both below consensus estimates. CEO Charles Liang noted that customers are delaying commitments due to evaluating AI platforms, anticipating increased commitments in the coming quarters. Super Micro is refraining from providing fiscal year 2026 guidance due to uncertainties related to tariffs. The company's past year has been challenging, marked by a short seller report and auditor resignation, though an independent investigation found no substantial concerns about management integrity.</p>

          <p>Rivian beat first-quarter expectations but adjusted its 2025 delivery and capital spending targets due to the impact of tariffs. The electric vehicle manufacturer expects additional expenses of a couple thousand dollars per vehicle due to tariffs on imported auto parts. Rivian now forecasts deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 units and capital expenditures of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Despite these challenges, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year, benefiting from Volkswagen Group's investment following the formation of their joint venture.</p>

          <p>India announced that it conducted strikes on nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, following a militant attack that killed over two dozen civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Indian government stated that the strikes targeted no Pakistani military facilities and were "focused, measured and nonescalatory in nature." Pakistan responded that the strikes "will not go unanswered" and that it would retaliate at "a time and place of its own choosing," and officials said civilians had been killed in the Indian strikes. President Trump called the escalation between India and Pakistan ‚Äúa shame‚Äù and hoped it would end quickly, as tensions continue to rise between the two nuclear-armed countries.</p>

The article also notes the growing criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, as well as within the crypto industry, regarding Trump's crypto dealings and their potential impact on the industry's reputation and pending legislation.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to eliminate the Energy Star program, a popular energy efficiency certification for home appliances, as part of an agency reorganization. Divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency, including the Energy Star program, will be eliminated. This decision has faced backlash, as the program has saved households and businesses billions in energy costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue that eliminating Energy Star is counterintuitive to reducing household costs and addressing the growing energy crisis, while supporters emphasize the program's cost-effectiveness and its role in encouraging energy efficiency.</p>

          <p>With Mother's Day approaching, prices for flowers may be higher due to tariffs enacted by President Trump. While Mr. Trump paused hefty tariffs he announced in early April for 90 days, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. About 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers. Consumers may just need to be a little more flexible about what types of flowers they buy, but they can still get quality bouquets.</p>
