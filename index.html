        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform from Max back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior. The company aims to emphasize quality over quantity, focusing on distinct and great programming for adults and families, a strategy similar to Disney's approach. CEO David Zaslav stated the move is to bring back HBO, a brand representing the highest quality in media, to accelerate growth. The streaming business has improved its profitability significantly, adding around 22 million subscribers in the last year, with a goal of over 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>As President Vladimir Putin prepares for potential cease-fire negotiations in Turkey, Russia is sending a clear message that it believes it is winning the war in Ukraine and should, therefore, get what it wants. Russian officials are demanding Ukraine accept strict military limitations and cede full territory of annexed regions, claims that the Trump administration finds unrealistic given the costly, incremental gains Russia has made. The United States hopes to convince Putin that warmer ties with the U.S. are more beneficial than continued costly gains in battle, though Russia seems intent on a Ukrainian capitulation and believes U.S. support is waning, and that the talks will be a 'show'.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to weaken limits on certain PFAS "forever chemicals" in drinking water while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be reconsidered, and utilities will receive an extra two years to comply with PFOA and PFOS standards. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the agency aims to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS while providing flexibility for compliance. Health advocates criticized the move, while water utilities, who sued the EPA, praised the extension but may continue to challenge the limits on PFOA and PFOS.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence researcher Shen, now an associate professor at an elite university in eastern China, finds himself spending less time on research due to administrative duties. Young researchers are under pressure to produce immediate results, hindering their ability to pursue bold, exploratory projects. A competitive tenure and funding system, based on factors like awards, further discourages long-term investments in original ideas.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 27% in the past year, reaching the lowest levels since 2019, according to a CDC report. The report indicates a drop from 110,037 deaths in 2023 to 80,391 in 2024, with the largest decrease seen in fatalities linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Experts attribute this decline to the widespread use of naloxone, increased access to medications for opioid use disorder, and greater public awareness of the dangers of opioid use. Despite the positive trend, experts caution against complacency and emphasize the need for continued efforts to combat the overdose crisis.</p>

          <p>Israel attempted to assassinate Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza, in an airstrike, though his fate remains unknown. While his death would be a tactical success for Israel, analysts question its long-term impact, as Hamas has historically survived the loss of key leaders. Some suggest his death might not alter Hamas's strategic outlook or soften Israel's approach to cease-fire negotiations. Others believe Israel's broader aim of "total victory" and its own inflexibility may be bigger obstacles to peace, regardless of who leads Hamas.</p>

          <p>Roki Sasaki's shoulder issue has placed the Dodgers in a problematic situation, with manager Dave Roberts downplaying the severity of the injury. Sasaki, who experienced shoulder pain in recent weeks, has underperformed, raising concerns about a chronic problem. With other frontline pitchers also injured, the Dodgers' rotation is in disarray. Despite the setback, the team aims to get Sasaki healthy and strong, but the path to greatness has become more complicated.</p>

          <p>The FDA announced it will conduct a scientific review of ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for kids by October 31, with the aim of removing them from the market. The agency cites concerns that ingested fluoride can alter the gut microbiome and may be linked to thyroid disorders, weight gain, and decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. supports the move, while dental experts largely disagree, citing decades of data showing fluoride's safety and effectiveness in preventing cavities. For now, parents can still use fluoride toothpastes, mouthwashes, and dentist-applied varnishes.</p>

          <p>Family offices are growing rapidly, seeking personalized services to manage wealth, but face a struggle to find qualified money managers. The talent crunch is due to a lack of qualified candidates and selectivity by family offices, emphasizing trust over other criteria. Potential employees are reluctant to work at family offices due to a lack of clear corporate structure and the perception of it being a "retirement job." Wealthy families are increasing compensation packages to attract and retain talent. </p>

          <p>A new report indicates a growing gap between what Americans earn and the cost of achieving a basic standard of living. The analysis considers necessities like technology, education, and healthcare, finding that the bottom 60% of U.S. households cannot afford a "minimal quality of life." The cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2001, while median earnings for lower-income earners have fallen. The report suggests the gap will continue to widen due to inflating costs of essential goods and services.</p>
