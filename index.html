          <p>This article provides guidance on safely repurposing old computers that are no longer supported by Windows updates, addressing the security risks associated with outdated operating systems. It advises users to either use the old PC offline, remove sensitive data, disable outdated browsers, or install strong antivirus software that supports legacy systems. The article also suggests repurposing options such as installing Linux, turning the PC into a home server, or donating it after securely wiping the hard drive. Simple hardware upgrades like adding RAM or switching to an SSD can further extend the life of an older machine.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a new strain of bacteria, named niallia tiangongensis, aboard the Tiangong space station, marking a significant discovery in understanding microbial adaptation to extreme space environments. The new strain, a variant of a known terrestrial bacteria, exhibits enhanced abilities to combat oxidative stress and reverse radiation-induced damage. Researchers suggest that decoding the survival mechanisms of this microbe could have implications for space technology, agriculture, and medicine, particularly in designing targeted control strategies for microbes.</p>

          <p>Legal experts and former judges are warning that US judges are facing increasing abuse and threats due to rebuking the Trump administration's policies, particularly on immigration. The verbal attacks from Trump and his allies are creating a hostile climate that endangers the safety of judges and their families. Concerns have been raised about anonymous pizza deliveries to judges, echoing a past tragedy, and the unusual arrest of a Milwaukee judge. The situation is exacerbated by the administration's attacks on the judiciary and its attempts to smear judges who rule against them.</p>

By willingly taking the rhetorical chin, Jost has created a unique dynamic that endears him to audiences, signaling his self-awareness and making him a more sympathetic figure.</p>

The president's visit involved re-altering dynamics by recognizing Syria's new government, lifting sanctions, and moving closer to a deal with Iran. This strategy is a departure from his previous stance and has raised questions about the consistency and direction of American foreign policy under his administration.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack killed at least nine people in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, hitting a shuttle bus carrying civilians, hours after Ukrainian and Russian officials met face-to-face for the first time in more than three years. The two sides agreed on a deal to swap 1,000 prisoners each, but the talks did nothing to ease the daily carnage. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called the strike a “deliberate attack on civilians,” and called for strong sanctions against Russia.</p>
