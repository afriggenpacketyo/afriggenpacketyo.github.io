          <h2>Gap Reports Mixed Quarterly Results with Athleta Sales Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 16:47:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gap's fiscal second-quarter revenue came in lighter than expected, primarily driven by a 9% comparable sales decline at its Athleta brand, despite Banana Republic exceeding expectations. While earnings per share topped estimates, overall revenue missed Wall Street forecasts. CEO Richard Dickson described it as a "year of reset" for Athleta, acknowledging efforts to court new customers had led to insufficient offerings for its core demographic. Gap reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 net sales growth outlook, but revised tariff cost projections upward, necessitating adjustments in sourcing and targeted price increases to offset the impact. The company is actively working to sustain market share gains and reinforce its position as a pop culture brand through strategic marketing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings forecasts for its recent quarter, attributing a sales recovery to innovation and strong customer response to sales events like back-to-school. However, the retailer maintained its full-year guidance, citing ongoing uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business. CEO Corie Barry noted a "resilient, but deal-focused" customer base, with growth in computing and gaming, particularly with the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, partially offset by weaker appliance sales. The company is exploring new strategies, including a third-party marketplace and enhanced in-store experiences, to spur growth and navigate a challenging economic environment.

          <p>Ford is recalling approximately 500,000 Lincoln MKX (2016-2018) and Edge (2015-2018) SUVs because a hose in the rear brake system can rupture, potentially causing a brake fluid leak. This issue could lead to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances, thereby elevating the risk of a crash. Ford will notify affected owners in early September, but the remedy for the problem is still under development and is anticipated to be available in April of the following year. This recall adds to a series of safety notices from Ford, which the company states reflects an intensified strategy to quickly identify and fix hardware and software issues to protect customers. The real test will be how fast Ford fixes this and how much confidence they can rebuild with drivers. </p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, including BBC-funded local democracy reporters, from speaking to him or his councillors "with immediate effect." The ban reportedly stems from a disagreement over a story regarding local government reorganisation, which Barton claims consistently misrepresented the party's policies, actions, or intentions. Senior editor Natalie Fahy called the "unprecedented ban" a direct attack on press freedom and the ability to hold elected officials accountable, prompting Liberal Democrat leaders to urge intervention from Nigel Farage, describing the decision as "dangerous and chilling." The council will also stop sending press releases to the publication. </p>

The potential race highlights a growing divide within the Republican party and the unique dynamics of Alaska's ranked-choice voting system, with both candidates holding appeal across different voter demographics, including Native communities. Analysts anticipate a very close contest, given Murkowski's past success with write-in campaigns and Dunleavy's broad support outside conservative circles. </p>

          <p>The Minneapolis Police Chief, Brian O'Hara, revealed that the 23-year-old Annunciation Catholic School shooter, Robin Westman, harbored extensive hate towards a wide array of groups, including Black, Mexican, Christian, and Jewish people, and even President Donald Trump. Investigators also uncovered Westman's "deranged obsession" with previous mass shooters, indicating an intent to cause terror and trauma for personal notoriety. The tragic attack resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injured 18 others, including 15 children. Westman fired through narrow church windows from outside the building before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, as police continue to search for a specific trigger for targeting the church.

          <p>San Diego-based glucose-monitoring company Dexcom is laying off 350 employees, comprising 3% of its global workforce, with 196 positions cut in San Diego's operations and manufacturing sectors. This reduction follows a previous elimination of 536 San Diego roles last year as the company centralizes manufacturing in Arizona. Dexcom, a leading developer of continuous glucose monitors for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, is expanding its product range to include pre-diabetes and wellness monitoring, and recently announced a new 15-day wearable monitor. Despite the layoffs and two recent product recalls, the company reported increased net income and revenue for the second quarter, positioning itself for long-term success through strategic organizational changes.

          <p>While President Trump's political pressure on the Federal Reserve raises concerns about its independence, an article argues that the growing public debt and resulting "fiscal dominance" present a more significant, enduring danger. This occurs when a central bank becomes subordinate to the government's fiscal policy, as seen in the UK in 2022 when the Bank of England intervened due to unfunded tax cuts. With U.S. debt exceeding 100% of GDP and rising interest payments, the Fed may be compelled to suppress interest rates or tolerate higher inflation to manage the debt burden, regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. The article contends that without Congress addressing spending and budgetary reforms, the Fed's independence in a narrow political sense becomes irrelevant as debt arithmetic dictates outcomes.

The Cowboys have held firm that Parsons is under contract and should be on the field if he wants to address a long-term deal, reportedly valued at $40.5 million per season. The situation has escalated with Parsons removing Cowboys references from his social media accounts, suggesting a growing desire to leave.

Resigning officials, like Demetre Daskalakis, cited the "weaponizing of public health" and policies that do not reflect scientific reality.

          <p>As inflation and Social Security concerns weigh on seniors, many face financial challenges due to Medicare's coverage gaps, which can lead to significant out-of-pocket expenses. This article outlines three effective strategies to help older adults cover these additional healthcare costs. Options include Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as "Medigap," to easily cover balances from copays, deductibles, and other expenses, though premiums rise with age. Another option is reverse mortgages, available to homeowners 62 and older, allowing them to access accumulated home equity without required repayments. Lastly, annuities offer a way to exchange a lump sum for consistent, monthly payments, guaranteeing a future income source and reliable way to cover leftover Medicare expenses, offering peace of mind.

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have fallen to their lowest point in 2025, reaching 8.22%, making them a competitive borrowing option compared to HELOCs. This article explores why now might be a good time for homeowners to consider these loans, despite the inherent risk of using one's home as collateral. With home equity levels recently hitting a new record high of nearly $18 trillion, the average homeowner has substantial funds available to borrow from. Fixed rates offer protection against market uncertainty and future rate fluctuations, unlike variable-rate products. Additionally, eligible home repairs and renovations paid for with these loans may qualify for tax deductions, further enhancing their financial appeal for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police identified 23-year-old Robin Westman as the suspect in the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that killed two children and injured 18. Westman, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, had a "deranged obsession" with mass shooters and aimed for "personal notoriety," according to investigators. Driver's license information indicates Westman identified as female, having legally changed names from Robert in 2020. Investigators are reviewing YouTube videos and handwritten journals showing widespread hate, grievances, and overt references to other high-profile school shootings and shooters. Westman's mother previously worked at the church until 2021, and Westman attended the school, though no specific motive for targeting it has been identified. Westman legally purchased the three firearms used recently. </p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market is slowing down, with fewer Americans changing jobs compared to the "Great Resignation" period, according to a new analysis from the Bank of America Institute. The job change rate has declined by 26% since its 2022 peak, now just slightly above 2019 levels, as employers pull back on hiring and workers become more hesitant to switch. This shift is also reflected in lower pay raises for job changers, with the median increase falling to 7% in July from 20% in 2022. The report suggests that business uncertainty, including potential tariff impacts, is contributing to this downshift, leading to a more stagnant labor market and potentially dampening future consumer spending growth.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to discuss the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), Europe's most expensive defense project, amidst a persistent dispute between French and German manufacturers. The project, aiming to combine a new European fighter jet with drones for reduced U.S. dependence, faces disagreements primarily over the plane's manufacturing, with French manufacturer Dassault seeking greater decision-making power and Airbus Germany insisting on its production share. The leaders' unexpected attendance at the Franco-German Defense and Security Council meeting in Toulon aims to provide a clear political signal for continued collaboration. However, time is running out for a definitive solution for the next phase, which involves constructing the first prototype, as France and Germany grapple with financial and industrial priorities. </p>
