          <p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is joining the FBI as its second-ever co-deputy director, serving alongside Dan Bongino. This appointment is part of President Trump's new focus on federal law enforcement and comes amid internal tensions at the bureau, particularly concerning the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Bailey is known for his conservative legal actions, including opposing student debt forgiveness and DEI programs, and has received praise from Republican figures like Senator Josh Hawley. His arrival follows reports of significant frustration from Bongino regarding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng has announced plans for the global launch of its affordable Mona brand, starting with Europe in 2026. This move is set to intensify competition with both Chinese rivals like BYD and established Western automakers in the increasingly crowded EV market. CEO He Xiaopeng also indicated the company is now open to acquiring other carmakers to navigate the fierce price wars in China's domestic market. The Mona brand, which debuted in China with a model priced under $17,000, represents a strategic push into more accessible vehicle segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City Football Club has reached a settlement with the Premier League, ending its legal challenge against the league's Associated Party Transaction (APT) rules. The club has now accepted that these regulations, designed to ensure commercial deals with owner-linked companies are at fair market value, are valid and binding. This resolution follows a period of conflict where City had claimed the rules were "unlawful" after a majority of clubs voted to approve amendments to them in November 2024. Both parties have stated they will not comment further on the matter.</p>

          <p>The new UK Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has stated that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with migrant return agreements. This policy would be used to pressure nations into accepting the return of their citizens who have no legal right to remain in the UK. The announcement came during a meeting of the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, as the UK faces a significant increase in small boat crossings over the Channel. The government is exploring more coordinated actions with allies to enforce these return policies and secure national borders.</p>

The inquiry is examining the killer's history and any missed opportunities by authorities to prevent the attack. Mothers of surviving children also shared harrowing accounts of the lasting psychological trauma, with one stating her daughter is no longer the "little girl I had before" the horrific event.</p>

          <p>Gold is widely considered a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability, with its price influenced by a variety of factors. As of early September 2025, the price stood at $3,588.06 per ounce, but this figure is subject to constant change. Key drivers include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty, all of which can increase investor interest. Additionally, interest rates, currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks holding large gold reserves play a significant role in its valuation.

          <p>At least 19 people have been killed in Nepal during violent clashes between protesters and security forces in Kathmandu and other cities. The demonstrations were sparked by a government ban on major social media platforms like Facebook and X, but also reflect widespread public anger over government corruption and economic failures. Protesters, many from "Generation Z," defied restrictions to gather near the parliament building, leading to police using water cannons, batons, and rubber bullets. The government defends the ban as necessary to combat misinformation, while demonstrators argue it is an authoritarian attempt to silence dissent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated a separation of powers dispute to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to allow it to freeze over $4 billion in foreign aid funding. This legal battle stems from President Trump's attempt to use a "pocket rescission" to block funds that Congress has already allocated for foreign assistance programs. A federal district court previously ordered the administration to spend the money by the end of the fiscal year, a ruling upheld by an appeals court. The administration argues that being forced to spend the funds undermines the president's authority in foreign affairs.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million jury verdict awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The court dismissed Trump's argument that he was protected by presidential immunity when he made the defamatory statements in 2019, denying Carroll's claim that he had sexually assaulted her years earlier. The three-judge panel found the damages, which include $65 million in punitive damages, to be reasonable given the "extraordinary and egregious facts" of the case. This ruling follows a separate decision in June that upheld a $5 million verdict against Trump for sexual assault and related defamation.</p>

Key strategies include creating and adhering to a seasonal budget by reviewing past expenses, and using debit or cash for everyday purchases to create a stronger psychological connection to spending. Other effective methods involve removing saved credit card information from online shopping accounts to add friction to impulse buys, setting up transaction alerts, and avoiding "buy now, pay later" services that can obscure total debt.

The two primary candidates for the position are the less experienced specialist Emma Sing and the versatile veteran Helena Rowland. While Sing offers strong goal-kicking, Rowland's experience and impressive performance off the bench in the last game may give her the edge for the crucial knockout stage match, according to rugby analysts.</p>

Separately, Prince Harry, who has returned to the UK from California, privately laid a wreath at the late Queen's burial site in Windsor. His visit includes several charity engagements but has also prompted speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, for the first time since February 2024.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting attack at a busy bus stop in Jerusalem has left six people dead and eight others wounded. Israeli police reported that two attackers arrived by vehicle and opened fire on civilians before being "neutralized" by an off-duty soldier and an armed civilian at the scene. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, Hamas praised the attack, calling it a response to Israeli actions. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the event as part of an "intense war against terrorism," vowing to apprehend anyone involved and implement stronger security measures as forces cordoned off nearby Palestinian villages.</p>

          <p>A small group of devoted Scotland football fans traveled over 800 miles to Zalaegerszeg, Hungary, for a World Cup qualifier against Belarus, despite knowing the match would be played without spectators. Belarus is currently banned by UEFA from hosting games in its own country due to its government's support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with home matches required to be held at neutral venues behind closed doors. The fans, who journeyed from Copenhagen, humorously noted that since the 90 minutes of football is often the worst part of a trip, they simply had to come.</p>

Xi's remarks urged the Brics nations—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—to work together to share opportunities and achieve win-win outcomes through openness.

          <p>A proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of a Minnesota electric utility's parent company by a BlackRock private equity division is facing opposition from consumer and environmental advocates. Critics warn the deal could lead to significant rate increases for the utility's 150,000 customers and undermine the state's clean energy goals, prioritizing investor profits over public interest. Although the firms offered a one-year rate freeze to gain regulatory approval, opponents argue this is insufficient and that the deal would cede control of a vital public resource to a profit-driven asset manager. A state judge has already recommended that regulators reject the proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline project between Russia and China could cause a "structural shock" to the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market if completed, according to analysts. The pipeline would provide China with a cheaper and more secure overland energy supply, allowing it to bypass maritime chokepoints and insulate itself from global price volatility. This development poses a strategic challenge to the United States, the current top LNG exporter. While the project is crucial for Russia following Western sanctions, unresolved issues over pricing and routing mean negotiations could still be protracted.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," author Arundhati Roy reflects on her journey from celebrated novelist to outspoken political dissident. After the global success of her 1997 debut novel, "The God of Small Things," Roy pivoted to writing critical essays on Indian politics, Hindu nationalism, and globalization, a move that made her a hero to some and a "traitor" to others. The memoir details how this shift was a form of liberation, allowing her to engage directly with the country's social and political struggles. This path has recently led to the Indian government approving her prosecution under an anti-terrorism law.</p>

The win is a significant milestone for the show, which had received over 30 nominations during Colbert's tenure without a victory. The cancellation, effective May 2026, was controversial, coming after Colbert criticized a CBS legal settlement with Donald Trump, who later celebrated the show's demise.

Downstream nations Egypt and Sudan have vehemently opposed the project for years, fearing it will drastically reduce their water supplies, which are almost entirely dependent on the Nile.
