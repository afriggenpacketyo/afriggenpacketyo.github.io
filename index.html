        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has accused Columbia University of failing to meet accreditation standards, alleging violations of federal anti-discrimination laws due to the university's tolerance of harassment against Jewish students on campus. The department's Office for Civil Rights has notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, of the alleged violations. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference after the Hamas attack on Israel, emphasizing that accreditors must take action if a university fails to comply with federal regulations. The department's action underscores the administration's focus on combating antisemitism in educational institutions, potentially impacting Columbia's eligibility for federal student aid. The optimism score for this article is low due to the serious nature of the allegations and potential consequences for the university.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly opposed President Donald Trump's proposed tax-cut bill, claiming it would lead to "debt slavery" for America and urging lawmakers to reject it. Musk voiced his concerns on social media, criticizing the budget package for massively growing the deficit and increasing the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. This opposition comes shortly after Musk's departure from the Trump administration, where he led the Department of Government Efficiency. A White House official expressed disappointment with Musk's public criticism, noting that Trump stands by the bill and its passage, though Musk's stance is partly influenced by the bill's potential impact on Tesla due to cuts in EV tax credits.

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed tax bill is facing scrutiny in the Senate, with projections indicating it could increase the national debt by $3 trillion, or $5 trillion if made permanent. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add over $2.4 trillion to primary deficits before interest over 10 years. Some Republican senators, including Rand Paul, have voiced opposition, expressing concerns about the debt impact and the potential for increased inflation and weakened market confidence. The bill, which addresses tax policy, border security, defense, and energy production, has also drawn criticism from Democrats who claim it would negatively impact the federal healthcare system.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide due process to over 100 Venezuelan men deported to a supermax prison in El Salvador earlier this year. Judge James Boasberg found that the men were "plainly deprived" of their rights under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which the administration used to justify their removal. The judge's order requires the Justice Department to outline how it will allow the deportees to challenge their removal, treating their cases as if they had never been deported. Concerns have been raised about the government's claims that all the deportees are dangerous criminals, with evidence suggesting many have no connection to gangs, thus the legal battle continues over the fate of these individuals.</p>

McMahon stated that Harvard has taken steps to address the allegations, including clarifying its non-discrimination policies and enhancing training sessions, but the legal proceedings are hindering further negotiations.

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon faced scrutiny from lawmakers regarding the Trump administration's proposed budget for the Education Department, which includes a 15% funding cut. The proposed budget aims to largely preserve funding for Title I and IDEA grants while cutting other programs, including TRIO, which supports low-income and first-generation college students. Democrats questioned McMahon about cuts to mental health programs, while bipartisan support was voiced for TRIO, prompting discussions about accountability and the role of states in education funding. These hearings highlight the ongoing debate over the federal government's role in education and the allocation of resources to support students and schools.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon expressed uncertainty about whether teaching students about the Tulsa race massacre and Ruby Bridges' experiences would violate the Trump administration's anti-DEI policies. During a congressional hearing, McMahon stated that African American studies are not part of DEI if taught as part of a total history package, but struggled to provide clarity on what both sides of a Black history course would entail. She also appeared unfamiliar with specific historical events, such as the Tulsa race massacre, and was vague when asked about the permissibility of teaching that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. The exchange underscores concerns about the administration's approach to diversity and inclusion in education.</p>

Beijing's message centers on a shift towards a multipolar world, with China positioning itself as a defender of the "rules-based, UN-centered" international system. However, analysts caution that divergent world views and competing national interests could undermine China's vision, as countries seek to balance or benefit from US-China tensions.
