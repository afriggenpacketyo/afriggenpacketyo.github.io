          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that President Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Apple products manufactured outside the U.S. could inadvertently benefit Samsung. If Apple were forced to raise iPhone prices due to tariffs, Samsung could gain a competitive advantage in the smartphone market. Cramer views this potential tariff as a "Samsung subsidy," emphasizing the risk of a competitor gaining significant market share. Apple is already facing challenges, including antitrust concerns and underwhelming AI developments, making this tariff threat a significant new worry for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope that the tariff threat would encourage the EU to negotiate more seriously, but Trump stated he is not looking for a deal.</p>

          <p>A judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to revoke Harvard University's access to a database required for enrolling foreign students. The lawsuit filed by Harvard argued that the administration's decision was retaliatory and violated free speech rights. The Trump administration claimed Harvard had not done enough to combat antisemitism, leading to the revocation of access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). The ruling halts the move, which Harvard argued would erase a quarter of its student body and harm its mission.</p>

While many new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products, investors should be cautious about new, complex strategies.

The orders also call for overhauling the Nuclear Reactor Commission and encouraging uranium mining and enrichment. Officials hope to test and deploy new reactors before the end of Trump's term.</p>

          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt, typically occurring after 180 days of non-payment, carries significant financial consequences. While a credit score can be impacted with even one missed payment, default leads to charge-off and potential debt sale to collection agencies. Default can severely damage credit for up to seven years, impacting loan approvals and rental applications. It's possible to be sued for unpaid debt, leading to wage garnishment. Exploring options like hardship programs, credit counseling, debt settlement, or bankruptcy is advised to mitigate the impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and expedite the deployment of new nuclear power reactors. The orders aim to modernize the NRC, speed up reactor licensing decisions, and enable the construction of reactors on federal land. These actions are intended to support critical defense facilities and AI data centers. The orders also seek to boost domestic uranium mining and enrichment. The move comes amid growing investment in nuclear power, driven by the increasing electricity demands of the technology industry.</p>

This follows a volatile week for bonds, driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating.

Experts say manufacturing in the U.S. would be expensive and difficult, potentially doubling iPhone prices.
