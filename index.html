Republican lawmakers threatened to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools, while Democrats accused Republicans of using antisemitism as a political weapon. University leaders attempted to balance contrition with protecting academic freedom, as the Trump administration intensifies investigations into universities over accusations of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>An idle Southern California Edison transmission tower, suspected of igniting the Eaton Fire, was dismantled and removed for testing. The tower, known as Tower 208, had been out of use for over 50 years but became reenergized on the day the fire started, possibly through induction. The dismantled tower will undergo examination and testing to determine its role in the fire, with investigators looking for clues. Southern California Edison also reported unusual activity on its equipment around the time the fire started, including a momentary increase of electrical current on several lines.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-controlled legislatures banning the flying of pride flags on government property in Utah and Idaho, Salt Lake City and Boise have found a creative solution. Salt Lake City adopted three new city flags incorporating the pride flag, trans flag, and Juneteenth flag, while Boise retroactively declared the pride flag as an official city flag. These actions are seen as a direct response to the legislative restrictions and a continued affirmation of diversity, equity, and inclusion in both cities.</p>

This follows a previous incident where a Super Hornet was lost after crews lost control of it while towing it in the hangar bay. Officials have denied that the jet was struck by Houthi militants.</p>

The decision comes after concerns from chipmakers, including Nvidia and AMD, about the potential negative impacts of the restrictions on the American chip industry.</p>
