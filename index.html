          <p>Officials in Gaza reported dozens of Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, with conflicting casualty figures from various news agencies. The violence continues as the Israeli government examines its response to a US-backed ceasefire proposal that Hamas has reportedly reacted to positively. Israel's Security Cabinet is scheduled to convene to discuss the details of the plan. Meanwhile, the ongoing humanitarian crisis is highlighted by reports of casualties among civilians queuing for food aid, underscoring the severe conditions within the territory.</p>

          <p>Two American veterans working for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured after being targeted with grenades while distributing aid to Palestinians. The organization, which is backed by the U.S. and Israel, stated the veterans are in stable condition and that the attack affirms prior warnings of threats from Hamas. GHF officials reported the grenades were of Iranian origin and that the group has previously been targeted with bounties. The incident has drawn condemnation and highlighted the extreme dangers faced by aid workers operating in the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas stated they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that killed at least 27 people, as the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly admitted the county lacks a warning system on the river and that authorities had no reason to believe the flood would be so catastrophic. Although a Flood Watch was in effect, officials said the amount of rain far exceeded forecasts. The event has raised questions about emergency preparedness in a region known as "flash flood alley."</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix in a dramatic qualifying session, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just over a tenth of a second. Piastri's teammate, Lando Norris, secured third place, with Mercedes' George Russell finishing fourth, promising a competitive race. Verstappen noted the windy conditions made qualifying tricky and required full commitment in the high-speed corners at Silverstone. The result sets the stage for an exciting battle among the top drivers at the halfway point of the Formula 1 season.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most significant event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division, viewing the period as a civil war, and suggested that understanding this complexity makes the founders' achievements more inspiring. Burns argued that the U.S. is held together by the words of its founding documents, which require active, educated citizenship to sustain the republic amid modern-day turmoil and distrust.</p>

The legislation does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction for seniors, which phases out for higher earners.

While tipping norms for traditional services are well-established, consumers are now frequently prompted to tip at fast-food counters and self-service kiosks. Experts note that point-of-sale technology often defaults to suggesting tips of 15% or higher, which can increase the amount given but also irritate customers. This shift, accelerated during the pandemic, is driven by both businesses and tech companies that profit from transaction fees.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai Chinese typewriter, invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s and long thought to be lost, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. The machine is a landmark in computing history, as its innovative design for inputting complex Chinese characters laid the groundwork for modern East Asian computing. Instead of phonetics, the typewriter organizes characters by their shapes, a concept that underlies how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The discovery has generated excitement among scholars studying the intersection of language, politics, and technology.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's highest-ranking military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, has warned of a possible new Russian offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. After spending two days assessing the situation on the ground, Syrskyi stated that Russia appears to be preparing to press its advantage in troop numbers. This warning comes as Russian forces have been making slow but steady gains along the frontline this summer, including establishing a small foothold in the neighboring Sumy region. Ukraine is now focused on using tactical and technological solutions to counter the potential advance.</p>

Officials, including Mayor Anne Hidalgo, assured the public that the water now meets safety standards on most days.

Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team examines the stomach contents of sharks to assess their health, which serves as an indicator of the overall health of the ocean. By showcasing the vital role sharks play, the researchers hope to generate more support for their conservation. The work highlights how these apex predators are essential for maintaining a balanced marine environment.</p>

This follows a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill. A poll Musk posted asking if he should form the party received a majority of "yes" votes.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a large new luxury beach resort in the city of Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and pandemic delays. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features high-rise hotels and numerous amenities, reflecting Kim Jong Un's goal of boosting the economy through tourism. However, the country remains largely closed to foreign visitors, with the exception of small, controlled groups from Russia. Analysts say the resort's opening shows Pyongyang is pursuing economic development alongside its military ambitions, rather than choosing one over the other.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's unexpected decision to skip this week's BRICS summit in Brazil has fueled speculation about both internal politics in China and the unity of the economic bloc. While the official reason given was a "scheduling conflict," some analysts suggest it may signal internal political turbulence or reflect growing friction with other BRICS members like India. The absence is notable as BRICS, an alliance of major emerging economies, aims to act as a counterweight to Western dominance and has recently expanded its membership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor's findings, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a rush of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering feeling is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-running the thought. Gawdat advises allowing oneself this brief window to feel upset before making a conscious choice to shift focus and move forward.</p>

The author argues that hobbies are not a reward for achieving work-life balance, but rather the secret to creating it.
