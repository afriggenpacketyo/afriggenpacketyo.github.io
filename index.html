          <p>A video clip showing French First Lady Brigitte Macron playfully pushing her husband, President Emmanuel Macron, as they were about to disembark their plane in Hanoi, Vietnam, has gone viral, igniting a wave of commentary online. Macron downplayed the incident, stating that it was merely a lighthearted moment between him and his wife. His office also echoed this sentiment, describing it as a moment of complicity and playful teasing after a long trip, aimed at decompressing before the start of their tour in Southeast Asia. Macron argued that the reaction to the images offered a cautionary tale about disinformation in the social media age, adding that people need to calm down regarding the situation.</p>

          <p>A recent shooting in Washington, D.C., where two Israeli Embassy aides were murdered, is examined as a symptom of a broader problem of rising anti-Semitism in America. The author argues that the alleged killer was fueled by an ideology that is spreading through American institutions and that this ideology divides people into oppressors and oppressed, resents Jewish achievement, and embraces violence. The piece asserts that violence aimed at Jews or those seen as aligned with them undermines the civic norms that hold society together. The author urges a firm stance against political violence and a reaffirmation of the principles of democracy and tolerance in the face of rising extremism.</p>

          <p>A mobile prison project is visiting schools in the U.K. to educate children about the realities and consequences of crime. The project features replica prison cells built with items from local jails, aiming to provide an interactive and realistic experience of life behind bars. Students are scanned, photographed, and fingerprinted before entering the cells, and organizers say the experience opens the door to tough conversations about drugs, alcohol, violence, and other issues. The goal is to inform young people about their responsibilities and help them make informed choices, especially since children as young as 10 can be arrested in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Former New York Rep. Charles Rangel, a prominent figure in Congress for over four decades and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in the House from 1971 to 2017, during which he chaired the House Ways and Means Committee and achieved numerous milestones, including becoming the first Black chair of the Ways and Means Committee in 2007. Despite facing an ethics scandal and censure in 2010, Rangel remained a respected figure, known for his dedication to his Harlem district and his service in the Korean War, for which he received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star with Valor. Tributes have poured in from fellow politicians, highlighting his legacy as a transformational force and a champion for justice and equality.</p>

          <p>As violence escalates in Gaza, Spain has called for a European arms embargo on Israel, a move that highlights growing international condemnation of Israel's actions. While Spain's call has symbolic weight, the real pressure would require action from the United States and Germany, which are the primary suppliers of weapons to Israel. The United States is by far the biggest arms supplier to Israel, accounting for about two-thirds of Israel's imports from 2020-2024, while Germany accounts for about a third. Despite calls for an embargo, Germany has indicated it will continue to provide Israel with weapons, citing Israel's security as a core principle.</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, the former dean of New Yorkâ€™s congressional delegation and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel was a mainstay of Harlem's Democratic old guard, first elected to Congress in 1970, and served longer than any other New Yorker but one. He retired in 2016 after winning a 23rd term, making him the ninth-longest continuously serving member of the House in American history. He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to enter electoral politics by running for the Senate from New York, and despite an ethics violation that forced him to give up his chairmanship in 2010, Rangel remained a respected figure known for his gregariousness and political agility.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed its sporadic eruption on Sunday, shooting lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing large plumes of ash and volcanic material. Lava fountains from the mountain's north vent reached heights of more than 1,000 feet, while those from the south vent reached over 800 feet. The volcano also released an eruptive plume that reached at least 5,000 feet, containing ash, volcanic rock, and volcanic glass shards. While the lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera and did not affect residential areas, the observatory warned of potential hazards from volcanic fragments carried by the wind.</p>

          <p>England completed a dominant T20 series clean sweep against the West Indies with a 17-run victory in the third and final match, despite a stellar performance from West Indies' Hayley Matthews, who scored 71 runs. A rain delay disrupted West Indies' chase, leading to a collapse from 109-3 to 127-8, with Lauren Bell taking the crucial wicket of Matthews. Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 ensured England had enough runs on the board after Matthews had earlier claimed 3-32 in England's innings. England now prepares for a three-match one-day international series, pending Knight's fitness due to a hamstring injury.</p>

The King is scheduled to deliver a 'Speech from the Throne' to Canada's Parliament, asserting Canada's sovereignty and rejecting calls for a takeover by the U.S., echoing his mother Queen Elizabeth II's previous addresses.

The museum recently parted ways with its director and eliminated several positions, prompting Lucas to appoint himself head of 'content direction'. The museum's mission is to explore how narrative art influences societies, but some cultural leaders say that art that tells stories is ubiquitous and can take just about any form. The museum's collection will include items amassed by Lucas over the years, including Hollywood memorabilia, book and magazine illustrations, comic books, and Norman Rockwell paintings.</p>

          <p>Cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, have been detected in multiple locations across the United States, according to the CDC. The variant is associated with symptoms similar to earlier strains, such as cough, sore throat, fever, and fatigue, and appears to be more transmissible but not more severe. Despite the variant's transmissibility, the Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access, requiring major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. Experts warn that these restrictions could delay access to boosters for lower-risk groups and create confusion, potentially reducing vaccination rates.</p>

Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said that Ukraine's allies had removed all range limits on supplied arms, amid reports he would give Kyiv Taurus missiles.

The author highlights the film's lens on the rapid degeneration of the country and the terrifying power amassed by Silicon Valley big shots. While 'Succession' was about a media industry in decline, 'Mountainhead' is about men who feel they own the future, making them frightening at a moment when institutions are in free fall.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are expressing optimism for a quick resolution to the trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump delayed his threatened 50% tariffs on the bloc until July 9. The delay follows a 'very nice call' between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, where they agreed to fast-track trade negotiations. The EU trade commissioner is scheduled to speak with the U.S. commerce secretary, and the EU's offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table. Despite this progress, Trump's 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place, and the EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs that could kick in on July 14 if a deal is not reached.</p>

          <p>Rio de Janeiro is considering new regulations to limit live music and other activities on its famous beaches, sparking debate over preserving the city's vibrant beach culture versus maintaining urban order. Mayor Eduardo Paes issued a decree to outlaw food and drink sales, chair rentals, loudspeakers, and live music in kiosks without official permits, set to take effect on June 1. While some welcome the move to tackle chaotic activity, others fear it threatens the livelihoods of musicians and vendors who may struggle to obtain permits. A bill is under discussion to regulate coastline use, backing some aspects of the decree but opposing the permit requirement for live musicians.</p>

          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four U.S. airmen who died in the crash of the WWII bomber 'Heaven Can Wait' off New Guinea are finally being laid to rest. The plane was hit by enemy fire in 1944, killing all 11 men aboard, and their remains were initially deemed non-recoverable. A remarkable investigation by family members and a recovery mission by Navy divers led to the discovery of the wreckage and the recovery of remains. The ceremonies are happening 12 years after one of Kelly's relatives, Scott Althaus, set out to solve the mystery of where exactly the plane went down.</p>
