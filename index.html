Following the news, shares for both companies saw a significant jump in extended trading, a common reaction as index funds must purchase shares to reflect the updated composition. Both companies went public in 2021 and their inclusion marks a notable milestone, especially after previous exclusions from the large-cap U.S. index. The move further increases the technology sector's concentration within the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

The 22-year-old Alcaraz won in straight sets, leveraging his youth and energy as the 38-year-old Djokovic appeared to fade physically in the final set. This victory marks another significant achievement for the 2022 champion, who will now face either Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime in the upcoming final. Alcaraz acknowledged that while it wasn't his best performance, he maintained his composure to win.</p>

          <p>U.S. Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter has publicly questioned the lack of updates regarding a complaint against Snap's "My AI" chatbot, which the agency referred to the Department of Justice in January. The complaint alleges that the AI chatbot poses potential risks and harms to young users. Slaughter emphasized that the public deserves answers about the status of the investigation, highlighting the issue amid broader concerns about the safety of AI interactions with children. Her comments also come as President Trump continues his efforts to remove her from the FTC.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, far below forecasts and raising alarms among economists about the nation's economic health. The unemployment rate also rose to 4.3%, its highest level since 2021. Experts attribute the slowdown to economic uncertainty heightened by the Trump administration's tariffs and a potential impact from AI adoption on entry-level hiring. This weak report, coupled with downward revisions for previous months, has intensified concerns about stagflation and makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month highly probable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has voted to dismiss its appeal and vacate a rule that would have enacted a nationwide ban on noncompete agreements. This reverses a key policy from the Biden administration, which argued the ban would increase wages and spur new business creation. The new FTC chair, Andrew Ferguson, called the original rule an illegal overreach but stated the agency will instead use targeted enforcement actions against specific noncompete agreements that violate existing antitrust laws, a strategy critics argue will be insufficient to protect workers.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration is undermining decades of U.S. policy aimed at promoting free information globally by dismantling programs that counter censorship and support independent media. Actions under new U.S. Agency for Global Media adviser Kari Lake, such as cutting funding for broadcasters like Radio Free Europe, are seen as a "unilateral disarmament" in the information war. This retreat allows autocratic states like China and Russia to expand their propaganda efforts and fill the void left by the diminished American presence.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has agreed to pay a minimum of $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who claimed the company illegally used their copyrighted books to train its AI models. The landmark settlement requires Anthropic to pay roughly $3,000 per book and to destroy the datasets that contain the pirated material. If approved by the court, this would be the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history and could set a major precedent for how AI companies handle copyrighted training data.</p>

          <p>Following his death at 91, the fashion world is remembering Giorgio Armani not just as a designer but as a revolutionary business leader who built a multi-billion-dollar empire by maintaining creative and financial control.

By largely avoiding mergers and keeping his diverse product lines in-house, Armani ensured a consistent vision of sophisticated, accessible luxury that defined his legacy.</p>

          <p>An analysis of FBI crime data by BBC Verify provides context to President Trump's claims about crime in Chicago. While the city recorded the highest absolute number of homicides in 2024, its homicide rate per 100,000 people ranked tenth among U.S. cities with populations over 500,000. Furthermore, Chicago's overall violent crime rate has been declining and was lower in 2024 than in other major cities like New York and Los Angeles. The report highlights the complexity of comparing crime statistics and cautions against using rankings without context.</p>

          <p>Canada's government, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is pausing a mandate that would have required 20% of all new vehicles sold to be electric by 2026. The move comes as part of a response to a weakening economy and the impact of U.S. trade policies. Alongside the pause, the government is introducing a "Buy Canadian" policy to prioritize domestic goods in federal contracts. While long-term EV sales targets for 2030 and 2035 will remain in place, this short-term delay reflects growing economic pressures on the nation's auto industry.</p>

The poor economic data increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will implement a more substantial interest rate cut to stimulate the economy. This expectation could lead lenders to lower mortgage rates further in anticipation of the Fed's action. While a sign of economic trouble, a cooling labor market often precedes a period of lower borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>
