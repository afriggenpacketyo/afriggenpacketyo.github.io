          <p>The BBC has stated it regrets not cutting the live broadcast of the band Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set, during which the singer led the crowd in chants calling for the death of the Israeli Defense Forces. The UK's broadcast regulator, Ofcom, is investigating the incident, which has drawn widespread condemnation from political figures who labeled the remarks as hate speech. In response to the controversy, the BBC has affirmed its stance against incitement to violence and announced a review of its guidelines for live event coverage to prevent similar occurrences.</p>

          <p>Iranian officials have officially acknowledged that an Israeli airstrike on the notorious Evin prison in Tehran resulted in the deaths of at least 71 people, including prisoners, staff, and family members.

          <p>The UK government is set to release further details on concessions made to its proposed welfare reforms in an effort to prevent a rebellion from Labour MPs. After facing significant opposition, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's administration scaled back the planned cuts, reducing projected savings from Â£5 billion to Â£2 billion. The changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and reversing a freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit. Despite the concessions, some MPs remain opposed, citing concerns over the reforms' potential impact on poverty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have jointly condemned what they describe as threats from Iran directed at Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The European powers urged Iran to cease any actions that would halt cooperation with the IAEA and to immediately resume full compliance with its legal obligations.

The company plans to file for regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and the combination shot later this year, with potential approvals expected in 2025.

The article argues that these regions are now mirroring the housing crises of places like California, not because regulations were never the problem, but because anti-development sentiment, or NIMBYism, inevitably takes hold as areas become more affluent. Researchers find that the rate of new home construction in cities like Phoenix and Atlanta has fallen by more than half, despite surging demand, as residents use existing laws to block new development.

          <p>The National Hurricane Center is monitoring a weather disturbance expected to stall over Florida late this week, which could impact plans for the Fourth of July holiday weekend. The system currently has a low 20 percent chance of tropical or subtropical development over the next seven days. Forecasters suggest an area of low pressure could form from a weakening frontal boundary, potentially bringing heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and a higher rip current risk to Florida's coasts. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Barry, the second named storm of the season, has weakened after making landfall in Mexico.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened conflict between Iran, Israel, and the US, American security agencies have warned about the potential for attacks from Tehran-backed 'sleeper cells' within the United States. This analysis explores the credibility of this threat, noting that while Iran and its proxies like Hezbollah have a history of conducting clandestine operations abroad, a direct attack on US soil would be a significant escalation. Experts suggest that such cells are likely a contingency asset for Iran, to be used only in moments of existential desperation, and that Tehran's recent actions indicate a desire to de-escalate tensions with Washington.</p>

          <p>Chicken finger chain Raising Cane's has overtaken KFC in annual U.S. sales, now ranking as the nation's third-largest chicken restaurant behind Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's success is attributed to its simple, focused menu and a strategy of operating company-owned restaurants rather than franchising, which allows for greater control over operations. With sales doubling to $5.1 billion since 2021 and a rapid expansion to over 900 locations, founder Todd Graves aims to make the chain a top-10 restaurant brand. The growth capitalizes on the sustained high demand for chicken in the fast-food market.</p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that the global decline in fertility is happening much faster than official United Nations projections indicate, with the world's population expected to start shrinking decades earlier than the predicted 2084 date. Economist JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde found that the UN's models are overly optimistic, consistently underestimating the rapid fall in birth rates in middle-income countries like Colombia and Chile. The research indicates that the UN model assumes fertility rates will eventually rebound or stabilize, a trend not supported by current data, which could mean the global population is already below the replacement level needed to prevent shrinkage.</p>
