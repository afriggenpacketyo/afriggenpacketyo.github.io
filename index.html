        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe signed the "Missouri First" congressional redistricting map into law, a move highly endorsed by former President Trump, which is expected to secure an additional U.S. House seat for Republicans. This new map aims to shift Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district eastward, incorporating more rural, conservative voters, thereby likely flipping the seat to a 7-1 GOP advantage in the state's delegation. This legislative maneuver is part of a wider Republican strategy to expand their slim House majority before the 2026 midterms, a push also seen in Texas, while Democrats are counteracting with their own redistricting efforts in states like California. Rep. Cleaver has publicly committed to taking legal action against the newly enacted map.</p>

          <p>A horrific incident unfolded at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, where a gunman drove his truck into the building, opened fire on congregants, and then set the church ablaze. The attack tragically resulted in four fatalities, including a 12-year-old girl, and left eight others injured, with one person in critical condition. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, was subsequently killed in a shootout with responding police, and the FBI has taken the lead in investigating this "act of targeted violence." Authorities are working to determine the motive, including any potential connection to the recent death of the church's president.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially withdrawn from his reelection campaign, citing relentless media speculation about his political future and a decision by the Campaign Finance Board to withhold crucial funding. This departure reconfigures the mayoral race into a three-way contest among Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who took office in 2022, had faced significant scrutiny, including a federal corruption scandal and questions regarding his relationship with the Trump administration, but he maintained his innocence, asserting he was "wrongfully charged" for his dedication to the city. His opponents quickly reacted, with Mamdani linking Adams's actions to President Trump's influence, while Cuomo acknowledged Adams's leadership.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are poised to formally resign on Tuesday, marking an unprecedented mass exodus in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration initiative to drastically cut the federal workforce. Many employees have expressed that months of "fear and intimidation," coupled with perceived undermining of their mission and job insecurity, left them with no alternative but to depart. Furthermore, the White House has instructed federal agencies to develop plans for large-scale firings if a partisan budget dispute prevents Congress from authorizing new funding by the looming deadline, potentially triggering a government shutdown. This situation highlights significant unrest and instability within the federal government workforce.</p>

This challenge arises as the CM Hong Kong, touted as the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol, embarks on its inaugural voyage. Despite green methanol currently costing four times more than conventional fuel, its usage is projected to increase significantly from 2027, driven by Europe's new carbon emissions-based import tariff regime.</p>

          <p>Grave allegations of negligence and unsafe conditions have emerged from Schoen Clinic York's eating disorder unit, which recently closed, supported by both whistleblowers and former patients. Staff were reportedly photographed sleeping while on duty, and several seriously ill patients claimed they were ignored during episodes of self-harm, served unhygienic food, and subjected to "triggering language." Despite the Care Quality Commission previously rating the service as "good," all interviewed patients vehemently disagreed, stating their condition worsened during their stay. The clinic maintains that specific concerns were investigated without finding systemic issues, though a linked dementia unit in the same building also faced safety concerns, raising broader questions about patient care standards.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting an expedited Supreme Court review of an executive order that unilaterally redefines birthright citizenship, aiming for a decision by next summer. President Trump's order asserts that only children born to parents with permanent legal status are "subject to the jurisdiction" of the U.S. and thus eligible for citizenship, challenging over a century of legal precedent. This move comes after two federal courts universally blocked the order, which, if upheld, could affect hundreds of thousands of children born on U.S. soil annually. Legal experts like the ACLU deem the order illegal, while constitutional scholars note its potential to cause an "earthquake" in established law.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have confirmed that the shooter who attacked the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas acted alone and specifically targeted ICE agents, driven by an animus detailed in notes found at his residence. Joshua Jahn, identified as the gunman, used a legally purchased 8mm bolt-action rifle to fire rounds from a nearby rooftop, intending to cause harm or death to ICE personnel. The attack tragically resulted in the death of 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes and critical injuries to two other detainees, who were inside vans targeted by Jahn. Authorities, who found Jahn dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, also noted his use of apps designed to track ICE agents, underscoring the premeditated nature of the assault.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit to block President Trump's deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing his "war ravaged" characterization of the city is "pure fiction." Governor Tina Kotek stated there's no insurrection necessitating military intervention, with local law enforcement managing demonstrations outside an ICE facility. Oregon's Attorney General Dan Rayfield called Trump's action "unlawful," suggesting it's based on misleading social media reports rather than actual conditions. The lawsuit highlights concerns about an abuse of power and the potential to incite public outcry, drawing parallels to federal deployments during 2020 protests.</p>

The league's ascent was significantly aided by a reality television series, "The Ultimate Fighter," which broadened its appeal. The UFC was later sold for $4 billion, with White remaining at the helm, and its mainstream status was further solidified by Paramount's recent $7.7 billion offer for its U.S. media rights.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its historic windmills, is set to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local tourists starting next spring to manage severe overtourism. Last year, the village, with only 100 residents, attracted 2.6 million visitors, leading to significant privacy intrusions like tourists walking into private gardens and houses. The new fee will include admission to the village's museum and the interior of the windmills, which previously charged separately, with the generated revenue earmarked for essential maintenance and new infrastructure, including toilets. While some visitors question the cost, others believe it is a necessary step to preserve the village's unique charm and quality of life for its inhabitants.</p>

          <p>The increasing availability of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is inadvertently creating a two-tier healthcare system, exacerbating health inequalities and turning obesity into a wealth issue. Access to these drugs on the NHS is severely restricted, leading to a "postcode lottery," while an estimated nine out of ten UK users pay privately, incurring monthly costs of £100-£350. Concerns are mounting due to potential pharmaceutical price increases, with nutritionists and GPs warning that this disparity will widen existing health gaps, especially since more deprived areas already face higher obesity rates. Experts argue that good health should not become a luxury, urging a focus on broader societal issues like the "broken food system" rather than solely medicalizing obesity.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy successfully achieved his long-held ambition of winning an away Ryder Cup at Bethpage, a feat he had declared "one of the biggest accomplishments in golf." Despite Europe's dominant lead, Sunday's singles proved a challenging test, requiring immense emotional, mental, and physical effort from McIlroy, who also endured significant fan abuse. While his individual match against Scottie Scheffler was not his best, McIlroy's overall performance secured 3.5 points for Europe. This victory marks the culmination of a personal mission for McIlroy, who had been focused on this specific achievement since the previous Ryder Cup.</p>

          <p>The New York Mets' playoff aspirations definitively ended with a 4-0 loss to the Miami Marlins, marking the conclusion of a stunning and prolonged collapse that began months ago. Despite holding the best record in Major League Baseball in mid-June, the star-studded team, boasting the league's highest payroll, managed a dismal 38-55 record for the remainder of the season. This significant failure, partly attributed to pitching struggles following Kodai Senga's injury, allowed the Cincinnati Reds to clinch the final National League wildcard spot. For many Mets fans, this outcome represents a familiar and deeply frustrating disappointment, echoing similar late-season meltdowns experienced in 2007 and 2008, despite initial high expectations.</p>

Their starting pitching, particularly Hunter Greene, is a significant strength, along with a reliable closer in Emilio Pagán.

Owner Arte Moreno, who had previously considered selling the team, is facing scrutiny regarding his strategy to address persistent issues such as poor on-field fundamentals and a notably thin farm system. The team's payroll, while substantial, ranks only in the middle third of MLB, and significant past contracts have failed to yield success.

While broad agreement existed, some divisions emerged on criminal justice approaches, with varying stances on stricter penalties versus treatment and diversion programs.

This investment surge is driven by a desire to leverage USMCA tariff preferences, access the growing Mexican market, and diversify trading partners.
