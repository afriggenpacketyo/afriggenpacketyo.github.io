          <h2>Germany Considers Banning Far-Right AfD Party Amid Extremism Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 07:43:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has classified the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, opening the door to potential surveillance and a possible ban. The classification allows authorities to observe AfD meetings, tap telephones, and recruit informants, potentially impacting elected officials and state party funding. While many parliamentarians support a ban, citing the AfD's opposition to the democratic order and agitation against minorities, others urge caution, fearing it could backfire. The article explains the constitutional process for banning a party and highlights the differing views among political analysts on the likelihood of success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has been officially designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution. The intelligence agency stated that the AfD's views on ethnicity and ancestry are incompatible with the democratic order, noting the party's discrimination against citizens with a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries." While AfD leaders denounce the decision as politically motivated, the designation could impact the party's influence in parliament and its ability to chair committees. The article details the implications of this classification and the broader political context surrounding the AfD's rise.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by production growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures. However, profits declined 6% compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices, influenced by concerns that President Trump's tariffs will negatively impact global demand. The company's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, while U.S. production profits soared by over 70%.

          <p>As discussions intensify regarding President Trump's tax policy agenda, modifications to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could significantly impact higher earners. The $10,000 limit on the federal SALT deduction, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress takes action. Lawmakers are considering various options, including a complete repeal or an increase to the deduction limit, which could provide substantial tax relief for residents in high-tax states.

          <p>A suspected glitch on the Deliveroo app led to Co-op products being priced as low as zero, allowing some shoppers to purchase items for free. While it is not always clear whether a retailer has to honor purchases of products advertising lower prices in error, many customers were able to take advantage of the situation. Some individuals are donating their heavily discounted goods to local food banks, providing much-needed support to their communities. The article also notes that the Co-op was recently affected by a cyber attack, though there is no suggestion that the two incidents are related.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby, northwest England, defeating the Labour Party by just six votes, marking a significant moment for the right-wing populist movement in Britain. Sarah Pochin, Reformâ€™s candidate, won the seat previously held by Labour, who had a large margin in the last election, but was forced to resign. This win could signal a shift towards a more polarized, multiparty system, posing challenges for both Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Conservatives, who are already vulnerable after last summer's defeat.

          <p>A new analysis reveals that expected greenhouse gas emissions from US oil and gas projects have increased under President Trump, reversing a previous decline under Biden. Trump's efforts to promote fossil fuel extraction, coupled with the easing of environmental regulations, have spurred a surge in planet-heating emissions. While Trump's tariffs have created economic uncertainty, the US is still projected to reach record levels of oil production, exacerbating the climate crisis. The article contrasts this with the potential for renewable energy, which is facing challenges due to tariffs and reduced government support.</p>
