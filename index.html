          <p>Former President Trump announced a major trade agreement with Japan, which he described as the "largest Deal ever." The deal reportedly includes 15% reciprocal tariffs and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States. Additionally, the agreement is said to open Japan's market further to American goods, including cars, trucks, and agricultural products, with the goal of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. This development follows earlier threats by Trump to impose a higher 25% tariff on Japanese exports.</p>

          <p>Capital One's stock value increased following its second-quarter results, despite complex financial reporting due to its recent acquisition of Discover. While GAAP figures showed a net loss because of accounting treatments for the merger, adjusted earnings per share significantly beat estimates, rising 75% year-over-year. CEO Richard Fairbank highlighted the strategic value of owning a payments network, a rare position for a bank, which is expected to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. Investors appear optimistic about the company's future, seeing the integration as a transformative move despite anticipated higher integration costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Currently, homeowners can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in profit from a home sale from their taxable income. Proponents argue that removing the tax would unlock housing inventory by encouraging older homeowners to sell.

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Amazon founder and Blue Origin CEO Jeff Bezos at the White House last week for a conversation that lasted over an hour. While the specific topics of the meeting were not disclosed, it signals a warming relationship between the two powerful figures. Bezos has reportedly been seeking to improve ties with the Trump administration, partly to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts. This contrasts with Trump's first term, during which he frequently criticized Bezos, largely over his ownership of The Washington Post.</p>

          <p>John-Michael Hakeem Gibson, the Atlanta rapper known as Cash Out, has been sentenced to life in prison plus 70 years following his conviction on RICO and sex trafficking charges. The 34-year-old artist, known for his 2014 hit "Cashin' Out," was found guilty of forcing women into sex work as part of an operation that also involved his mother and cousin. Prosecutors presented evidence that the operation was not just pimping but trafficking, due to the use of force and coercion. Gibson's mother was sentenced to 30 years for her involvement.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey man, Navin Khanna, has pleaded guilty to leading a sophisticated, nationwide theft ring that trafficked in stolen catalytic converters, generating over $600 million in sales.

The massive operation was uncovered following a routine traffic stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during a national surge in such thefts.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded its investigation into the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., the husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola. The final report identified several contributing factors, including the pilot's decision to fly the plane above its maximum takeoff weight with a load of moose meat. Additionally, a set of moose antlers affixed to the wing strut created significant drag and a weight imbalance. The NTSB determined these issues, combined with turbulent conditions, likely resulted in the aircraft having insufficient power to navigate the terrain.</p>

This marks the second time the Trump administration has pulled out of UNESCO, having previously done so in 2018 over concerns of anti-Israel bias, only for the Biden administration to rejoin in 2023.

          <p>A new student loan repayment plan, called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), was established by recent legislation signed by President Trump. As an income-driven repayment option, RAP will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings with a $10 minimum. Available by July 2026, it will become one of only two options for new borrowers, alongside a standard plan. The plan offers forgiveness after 30 years and provides some benefits, like a small subsidy for those not paying down principal. (not investment advice)</p>
