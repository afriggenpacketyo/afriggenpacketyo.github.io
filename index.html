          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 03:48:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesco has introduced AI-powered cameras at some self-checkouts, sparking mixed reactions from shoppers. The technology aims to reduce shoplifting by identifying when items aren't scanned properly, showing a replay to the customer. While some customers mocked the "VAR-style" cameras, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance and vowed to avoid self-checkouts. This move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK, with retailers reporting millions of thefts costing billions of pounds annually, prompting supermarkets like Sainsbury's to adopt similar AI recognition systems to enhance security and checkout efficiency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to Â£1,000, and may have debts written off due to the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay over Â£70 million in response to a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. The scandal emerged during the cost of living crisis when firms switched struggling customers to prepayment, sometimes forcibly entering homes; a new code of practice now has stricter conditions for such installations. While Energy UK defended involuntary installations as a last resort, Citizens Advice emphasized the need for quick compensation for affected consumers.</p>

          <p>A large crowd caused extensive damage in downtown Los Angeles, vandalizing businesses, a Metro train, and a police vehicle. The incident occurred after hundreds attended an illegal party, with a subset causing destruction in the surrounding area.

Local business owners expressed frustration, noting that while vandalism is a daily occurrence, the scale of this event was unprecedented, leading to calls for accountability and preventative measures to be taken by the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Concerns are rising that Japan's bond market could trigger capital flight from the U.S. and a carry trade unwind as long-dated yields reach record highs. Higher yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) may incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially impacting global markets. Some analysts predict a financial market crisis if JGB yields continue to climb, particularly affecting U.S. tech stocks due to a stronger yen. However, other analysts believe the carry trade impact may be gradual, citing a reduced interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan and the structural nature of Japan's U.S. Treasury holdings (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7 million for violations relating to sewage operations and shareholder dividends, marking the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat. The regulator stated that the fines, resulting from its "biggest and most complex investigation," will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers. Thames Water faces heavy criticism for sewage discharges and leaks, along with a Â£20 billion debt, but recently secured an emergency Â£3 billion to avoid collapse. The fine includes Â£104.5 million for sewage breaches and an additional Â£18.2 million for "undeserved dividends," with the company currently under a "cash lock up" preventing further dividend payments without Ofwat's approval.</p>

Discussions between Zelensky and Merz are expected to center on continued military assistance, including the potential export of the Taurus missile system, which Germany developed with Sweden. Merz has emphasized his support for Ukraine and the use of sanctions to pressure Russia into a cease-fire, contrasting with the initially cooler relationship between Zelensky and the previous German chancellor.</p>

This move comes amid Trump's criticism of elite colleges, accusing them of enabling antisemitism and discriminatory admissions policies.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but failed to complete its return to Earth during its ninth test flight.

Although several planned tests were not conducted, the company fixed ascent issues from previous flights and flew a booster used in an earlier test flight. Elon Musk stated that the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, but acknowledged progress on Starship has been slower than promised, particularly for its role as the lunar lander for NASA's Artemis III mission.</p>

          <h2>Japan to Supply Stockpiled Rice to Rural Areas Amid Price Surge</h2>

          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to provide lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas amid surging retail rice prices. This decision follows a suspension of orders from major retailers to allocate the remaining rice to smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with the government covering transport costs. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that efforts will continue to ensure reserve rice reaches people in rural areas, with a purchase limit imposed on large retailers. The government aims to ease household frustrations as retail rice prices have doubled from the previous year, after earlier attempts to rein in prices through auctions failed.</p>

          <p>David McBride, an Australian whistleblower who leaked classified documents about alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, has lost his appeal to reduce his prison term. The Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal rejected McBride's appeal to reduce his five-year and eight-month sentence, which was imposed a year ago. McBride's legal team stated they will challenge the decision in the High Court, arguing that it should not be a crime to expose a crime and that he acted in the public interest. Rights groups have criticized the prosecution, noting that McBride is the only person imprisoned over the war crimes allegations.</p>

Getty is suing Stability AI in the U.K. and U.S., claiming the company copied 12 million images without permission, while Stability AI contests the legal action.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns about the government's proposals for early prisoner releases. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued the plans "could be of net detriment to public safety," citing potential costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail. The letter argued against early releases for high-risk offenders and those jailed under national security legislation. The government maintains the proposals address many of the concerns, with repeat offenders still facing short sentences, terrorists ineligible for earlier release, and increased probation funding.</p>

          <p>European companies operating in China are finding it increasingly difficult to do business due to weak economic demand and opaque government regulations. A recent survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China revealed that nearly three-quarters of businesses reported worsening operating conditions. Despite curbing investments in China, some European companies are buying more components from Chinese companies, increasing their supply chain dependence. While concerns about rising wages have decreased, the economic slowdown in China is now the biggest challenge, contributing to broadly low prices and potential deflation.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth test flight, although the vehicle successfully reached orbit. A propellant leak after entering its suborbital trajectory caused a loss of attitude control, resulting in the spacecraft spinning and re-entering Earth's atmosphere at an unfavorable angle. SpaceX said most of the craft likely burned up, with remaining pieces falling into the Indian Ocean, and the company will review data to improve Starship's reliability. This flight test marked the first launch of a flight-proven Super Heavy booster, although the booster also appears to have exploded during its return.</p>
