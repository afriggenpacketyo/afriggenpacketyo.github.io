          <h2>RTX and GE Aerospace Forecast Over $1 Billion Impact from Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>RTX and GE Aerospace anticipate a combined impact exceeding $1 billion due to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods and materials. RTX, a defense contractor and aerospace supplier, expects an $850 million hit this year from tariffs, including levies on goods from China and taxes on imported steel and aluminum. GE Aerospace, which manufactures engines for Boeing and Airbus planes, plans to mitigate costs by cutting expenses and raising prices, while CEO Larry Culp recently discussed the U.S. aerospace sector's trade surplus with Trump. The financial impact underscores the challenges faced by U.S. manufacturers relying on global supply chains.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a judge-led public inquiry into the Nottingham attacks that resulted in the deaths of Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar, and Ian Coates. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the inquiry will have the power to compel witnesses and thoroughly assess the facts surrounding the case. The victims' families, who met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February, expressed hope that the inquiry will provide answers to their questions regarding the handling of the case by authorities after Valdo Calocane, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, was sentenced to a hospital order for manslaughter. The inquiry aims to scrutinize the actions of multiple agencies involved in the case.</p>

          <p>A tour company owner faces sentencing after pleading guilty to manslaughter following the deaths of four paddleboarders in Pembrokeshire in 2021. Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley drowned on the River Cleddau during a tour led by Nerys Bethan Lloyd, who lacked the necessary qualifications. The court heard that the river was in flood conditions with a strong current, and participants raised concerns before the trip. Family members of the deceased delivered emotional statements in court, describing their grief and accusing Lloyd of negligence. CCTV footage showed the paddleboarders on the river the day they died.</p>

          <p>The R&A is considering bringing The Open back to Donald Trump's Turnberry course in Scotland, but logistical and commercial challenges need to be addressed first. Turnberry, which last hosted the Open in 2009, has undergone significant upgrades since Trump acquired the property in 2014. Concerns about infrastructure and accommodation near the course are being assessed, although the R&A acknowledges the golf course is excellent. A previous decision to avoid staging championships at Turnberry due to political concerns is seemingly being reconsidered, with logistical factors now taking precedence.</p>

By providing concrete examples of contributions, candidates can stand out and showcase their ability to help companies achieve their goals.</p>

The IMF also reduced its global growth forecast to 2.8% for the year. Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policy is driving the projection of a U.S. economic slowdown. The IMF warns that further escalation of the trade war could hinder both near- and long-term growth, increasing the likelihood of a recession.</p>

          <p>A new Israel-Gaza ceasefire plan has been proposed by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, according to a Hamas source. The plan envisions a five- to seven-year truce, the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Talks are scheduled to take place in Cairo with Hamas representatives. Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes continue across the Gaza Strip, resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties. Hamas has signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon at the national and regional level.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson stated that Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining woman as biological sex. This contrasts with Starmer's previous statement in 2022 affirming that trans women are women. The spokesperson emphasized that single-sex spaces are protected in law and a person born male but identifying as a woman does not have the right to use women-only spaces. Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson echoed this view, stating that access to single-sex provisions should be based on biological sex.</p>

The oil market anticipates reduced demand due to tariffs and OPEC+ increasing production faster than expected. Wirth noted that U.S. onshore oil production could pull back if prices fall to $60 per barrel, but offshore production is unlikely to be affected.</p>
