          <p>A significant explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Iran resulted in multiple fatalities and hundreds of injuries, causing widespread damage to nearby buildings and infrastructure. The blast, felt up to 50km away, triggered fires that spread through container storage areas. While Iranian officials attributed the explosion to a fire in a chemical storage depot, a maritime risk firm suggested it was due to the improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles. Investigations are ongoing to determine the exact cause of the incident, which prompted the closure of schools and offices in the region.</p>

It also addresses situations where trans men may be excluded from women's facilities, and provides guidance for schools and associations. A two-week consultation will be launched to gather feedback before the EHRC publishes an updated code of practice.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana has expressed concern over the deportation of a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras, questioning whether due process was followed. The judge's concern stems from the fact that the child was deported alongside her mother, despite the court's efforts to clarify her status. The case highlights the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement and the rights of U.S. citizens in deportation proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security defends its decision, stating that the parents made the decision to take the child with them.</p>

          <p>Charles Burnett's 'Killer of Sheep,' now in a 4K restoration, offers a gentle and tender depiction of Black working-class life in 1970s Watts. The film follows Stan, a slaughterhouse worker, as he navigates the challenges of poverty and family life. Burnett's radical strategy to depict ordinary Black life at a time when such images were hardly in abundance makes this movie a masterpiece. With a soulful soundtrack and understated performances, the film offers a critical portrait of inequality and the invisible rendered visible.</p>
