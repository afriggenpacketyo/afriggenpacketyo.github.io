          <p>Australia is reevaluating its approach to international students, considering caps on enrollment to address an ongoing housing crisis. Politicians are using this as a strategy to reduce rental demand and lower housing prices, marking a significant shift for a country that once heavily relied on international education as a major export. This change has sparked concerns about the potential loss of talent and revenue, with some arguing for improved selection criteria rather than blanket restrictions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for American commercial and military ships to have free transit through the Panama and Suez canals, directing his secretary of state to address the issue. Trump claimed the routes would "not exist" without the U.S., prompting a response from the Panamanian president emphasizing that toll fees are regulated by the Panama Canal Authority. The demand comes amid ongoing tensions in the Red Sea and concerns about U.S. influence over strategic waterways.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen Belsen, survivors and families will gather to commemorate the camp's horrors. British and Canadian troops liberated the camp in April 1945, discovering thousands of unburied corpses and emaciated survivors. Belsen became known for its chilling accounts from journalists and soldiers, and for the fact that the evidence of the atrocities remained intact.</p>

          <p>Despite not making splashy selections in the 2025 NFL draft, the Rams may have positioned themselves for future success by acquiring an extra first-round pick in 2026. General manager Les Snead's strategic moves give the Rams valuable draft capital to potentially replace veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford and continue building a Super Bowl-contending team. The team is looking for a good place to be in coming years.</p>
