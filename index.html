          <p>President Trump has suspended the entry of foreign students seeking to study at Harvard University for an initial six months, citing national security concerns. This action escalates an ongoing legal dispute between the White House and Harvard, which has refused to comply with demands related to antisemitism on campus and foreign ties. Harvard responded by amending an existing lawsuit, accusing the administration of retaliatory measures violating the university's First Amendment rights. The university is developing contingency plans for its international students, who comprise about a quarter of the student population, as the legal battle continues. The university president called the order an illegal retaliatory step by the administration.</p>

The agencies caution that the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict may motivate violent extremists to target Jewish and Israeli communities and their supporters.

The company believes its lunar lander, Resilience, impacted the Moon's surface after failing to decelerate sufficiently during its descent. Resilience, which carried a rover and equipment for experiments, launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 15, with the aim of reaching the Moon's northern hemisphere. Despite the setback, ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada expressed the company's determination to catch up with U.S. companies that have already accomplished this feat.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served while awaiting trial. This practice can extend the duration of confinement for young people, adding months to their incarceration. Experts argue that this denial of time credit is a negative impact of the juvenile legal system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. The investigation highlights disparities in how young people are treated compared to adults in the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Justice will investigate a fatal shooting by Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers, even though the LAPD claims the man was armed. The investigation is mandated by Assembly Bill 1506, which requires the state to investigate police shootings of unarmed individuals. The LAPD reported that officers responded to a shooting and fatally shot Ronald Gainer Jr., who was allegedly holding a handgun. The state's investigation will determine whether the person killed had control of a weapon at the time of the shooting.</p>
