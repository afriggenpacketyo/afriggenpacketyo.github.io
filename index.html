          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and expedite the deployment of new nuclear reactors. The orders mandate the NRC to decide on reactor licenses within 18 months and focus on small, advanced reactors while supporting large plants. Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez, present at the signing, highlighted regulatory delays as a major industry problem. The orders also establish a framework for the Energy and Defense departments to build reactors on federal land for defense facilities and AI data centers, and aim to boost uranium mining and reactor testing. Nuclear stocks saw a rally following these actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has given the green light to the merger between US Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing a previous block on national security grounds.

Former President Biden had blocked the acquisition, but Trump ordered a review in April. Following Trump's announcement, US Steel shares experienced a surge of over 20%.</p>

          <p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration after it moved to block international students from attending the university.

The lawsuit followed the revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification.

The study also anticipates substantial losses for lenders, potentially reaching $5.4 billion annually in 10 years, due to mortgage defaults.

          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt carries significant financial consequences, including long-term damage to credit scores. Default typically occurs after 180 days of non-payment, though credit scores can be affected much sooner. Options for managing debt include contacting the card issuer for hardship programs, working with a credit counseling agency, or pursuing debt settlement. Ignoring the problem can lead to lawsuits and wage garnishment, but bankruptcy can provide a reset for those unable to repay.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced its worst week since early April after President Trump threatened tariffs on EU goods and targeted Apple with taxes on foreign-made iPhones. Concerns about the deficit, fueled by the domestic policy bill, dominated the week and are expected to persist. Rising yields in the government bond market and falling stock prices are linked to worries about government spending and borrowing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hoped the tariff threat would prompt action from the EU.</p>
