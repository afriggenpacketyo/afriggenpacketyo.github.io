          <p>A shooting incident near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta resulted in a police officer being critically injured and the suspect's death from a possible self-inflicted gunshot. The suspect reportedly fired multiple rounds at the CDC building, but no civilians were harmed, including 92 children at a nearby daycare. The event prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order at Emory University and is now under investigation by the FBI and Georgia Bureau of Investigation.</p>

          <p>The political conflict over redistricting in Texas has intensified as Democratic state legislators fled to California to prevent a Republican-led vote on a new congressional map. In response, Texas Republicans are pursuing legal and financial penalties, including arrest warrants and withholding salaries, while Governor Gavin Newsom and other California Democrats have pledged to counteract the Texas GOP's move. The situation highlights a broader national battle over redistricting, with Texas's Republican leadership threatening to call continuous special sessions until the vote occurs.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, suggesting a deal could involve "some swapping of territories." The announcement follows a US ultimatum for Russia to agree to a ceasefire and comes amid reports of US and Russian officials working on a potential deal to freeze the conflict's front lines. The proposed summit has generated cautious optimism from some European leaders, though it raises concerns about Ukraine's exclusion from direct negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to seize control of patents developed through federally funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick initiated a review, demanding the university prove its compliance with the Bayh-Dole Act, which requires such inventions to benefit the American public. This action is the latest in a series of retaliatory measures, including freezing research funding, following Harvard's lawsuit against the government over what it calls illegal punishment for exercising its First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>The president of Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU), a partnership in Suzhou, China, states that geopolitics is the biggest challenge facing international academic collaboration. Xi Youmin argues that the current global division is stifling academic freedom and scientific research, permeating university campuses with political pressure. He suggests that easing visa restrictions for foreign students to study in China could help improve mutual understanding and counteract the negative effects of these geopolitical conflicts on education.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as the acting commissioner in the interim. The abrupt departure follows significant tax code changes and job cuts at the agency under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision-making suggests his actions, such as the plan to occupy Gaza City, are primarily driven by the need to appease his far-right coalition partners for his own political survival. This strategy is often at odds with the views of both the Israeli security establishment and the majority of the Israeli public, who oppose a full-scale reoccupation and favor ending the war with a hostage deal. President Trump's policies have inadvertently empowered the Israeli far-right's vision, creating a complex situation where Netanyahu's political needs dictate military strategy.</p>

This comes amid growing tensions, with the Trump administration labeling Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations and increasing pressure on Mexico to curb drug trafficking.</p>

This coordinated action is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow and further limit a key source of revenue funding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. The policy is part of a broader G7 scheme designed to curtail Russia's war-making capabilities while allowing its oil to reach global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The article explores what is left to learn, suggesting the new probe is an effort to push a narrative that the original investigation was a politically motivated "false narrative."</p>
