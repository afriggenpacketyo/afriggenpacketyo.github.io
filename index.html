          <p>Millions across India are celebrating Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, marked by lighting oil lamps, exchanging sweets, and gathering with family. The five-day festival, which signifies the victory of good over evil, is also observed by Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists. However, the tradition of bursting firecrackers remains a contentious issue due to severe air pollution in cities like Delhi, leading to court-imposed restrictions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the festivities by meeting with navy personnel.</p>

          <p>A new bill led by House Republicans aims to prevent the United States from being subjected to any tax imposed by the United Nations without explicit congressional approval. The legislation comes as the UN's International Maritime Organization considers a global tax on carbon emissions from international shipping, a vote on which was recently postponed. The bill would prohibit U.S. funding for any such tax and block voluntary contributions to the UN if a tax were levied. Proponents argue this protects American sovereignty against unelected international bodies.</p>

The article posits that a likely interest rate cut by the Fed could further increase gold prices, as lower rates often make non-interest-bearing assets like gold more attractive. It also highlights gold's role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, noting that prices could rise even before the meeting due to various market pressures.

The statement follows a reportedly "frank" and "volatile" meeting at the White House where Trump allegedly urged Zelensky to accept Russian terms to end the war. Zelensky described his own goal as a "just peace, not a quick peace," and expressed reservations about Hungary as a venue for the talks due to its government's pro-Kremlin stance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals enrolled in debt settlement programs, failing to complete the multi-year plan can have severe financial repercussions. Dropping out means any unsettled debts remain fully owed, with interest and late fees continuing to accumulate on potentially larger balances. While funds deposited into a settlement account are typically returned, company fees may be deducted, and the credit score damage incurred during the process will not be reversed. Furthermore, forgiven amounts from any partially completed settlements may still be considered taxable income, creating an unexpected tax liability for the individual.</p>

          <p>A former corrections officer, David Kingsley, has been found guilty of murder and manslaughter in the death of Robert Brooks, an inmate at Marcy Correctional Facility in upstate New York. Two other officers, Matthew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer, were acquitted of all charges. Brooks was beaten to death within an hour of his arrival at the facility last December, an incident captured on body-worn cameras. Kingsley faces a sentence of 25 years to life, while community organizers criticized the verdict as insufficient justice for a systemic problem.</p>

          <p>Pizza Hut is set to close 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations in the UK, resulting in 1,210 job losses, after its franchise operator, DC London Pie Limited, went into administration. However, Pizza Hut's global owner, Yum! Brands, has stepped in to acquire and save 64 other restaurant sites, preserving 1,276 jobs. This marks the second time in less than a year that the UK restaurant business has faced insolvency. Experts suggest the brand has struggled with increased competition, rising costs, and a failure to remain relevant in a more upmarket pizza landscape.</p>

Porter, known as the "whiteboard warrior," has built a reputation as a fighter for consumers. The author posits that in the current political climate, Democrats may value a combative style, and the recent attention has increased her name recognition.</p>

One study published in Nature Medicine found that a full-spectrum cannabis oil containing THC and CBD was more effective than a placebo. A second study showed the same cannabis tincture offered better pain relief over six months and had fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to opioids. While these findings are considered groundbreaking, the specific product, VER-01, is not yet approved in the U.S. and will require further trials.</p>

The conflict often involves clashes between mostly Christian farmers and predominantly Muslim Fulani herders.
