          <p>The Trump administration announced the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles following widespread protests sparked by ICE operations. President Trump cited the inability of California's Governor and Los Angeles' Mayor to manage the situation, prompting federal intervention. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that local authorities could handle the situation. The deployment involves 2,000 National Guard troops under Title 10 authority, bypassing the need for the Governor's approval, while protests continued throughout the city with clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. The events highlight the ongoing tensions between federal and local authorities regarding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Two sisters from Pontardawe, Wales, recount their trauma after their mother and grandfather were convicted of stealing their £50,000 inheritance left by their grandmother. Katherine Hill and her father, Gerald Hill, were found guilty of fraud by abuse of power, leading to prison sentences and an order for Katherine to repay the stolen funds. The sisters, Gemma and Jessica Thomas, describe how their mother went from being their best friend to betraying their trust, causing lasting anxiety and an inability to trust others. The stolen money, intended for them to access at age 25, was instead used to fund their mother's lifestyle, leaving the sisters feeling robbed of an opportunity and deeply hurt by the betrayal.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a national referendum on Sunday and Monday to decide whether to halve the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five. The referendum, initiated by a citizens' initiative, aims to align Italy with other European countries and integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the country's economy and society. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced she will boycott the vote, calling the current citizenship law already "excellent" and "very open." The outcome of the referendum could affect up to 1.4 million people, but its validity hinges on a 50% voter turnout.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that the UK's plans to modernize and expand its nuclear arsenal, as outlined in the 2025 strategic defense review, undermine international non-proliferation efforts and fuel a global nuclear arms race. He criticizes the government's decision to spend an additional £15bn on nuclear warheads, asserting that it perpetuates illusions about Britain's global power status. Tisdall warns that the reintroduction of air-launched nuclear weapons could bring the prospect of nuclear warfare closer. He calls for public education about the dangers of weapons proliferation and advocates for gradual disarmament as the only way to escape this nightmare.</p>

Rhodes compares Trump's actions to those of authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban, who have used their positions to consolidate power and enrich themselves and their allies. He contends that the fusion of political and personal interests erodes moral and ethical frameworks, weakens checks and balances, and transforms the political system into one that no longer serves the people. The trend risks turning the United States into another country with a corrupt strongman personalizing and profiting from power.</p>

Newsom accused the White House of "sowing chaos" as an excuse to escalate federal intervention.

The move reflects a widening gulf between California's political leaders and the federal government, with Trump asserting that he will step in if local authorities cannot manage the situation.

          <p>Researchers in China have used the rare mineral tellurium to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them the ability to see infrared light. This breakthrough offers significant promise for treating human blindness, according to scientists. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy. The study showed how researchers harnessed the mineral to create nanowire implants used in a biocompatible device that restored vision in genetically blind mice and a monkey, while giving them the ability to see “invisible” light.</p>

This announcement comes after the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The confusion likely stemmed from the gold stars on Costco cards resembling the star on REAL ID-compliant cards.

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles has raised legal concerns, with critics questioning his authority to do so without the governor's request. The deployment invokes Title 10, a provision allowing the federal government to take over the National Guard, but critics argue this move is an overreach of executive power and an attempt to suppress dissent. Legal experts point out that the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to federalize the National Guard in extreme circumstances, may also be invoked, leading to potential legal battles. The ACLU has condemned the deployment as misguided and dangerous, undermining democratic principles.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men’s participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, offering a fresh approach to addressing demographic challenges in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong (HKU), argued that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly ageing population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making the need for innovative solutions increasingly urgent. The findings highlight the importance of addressing traditional expectations that place the burden on women to perform most childcare duties.</p>

          <p>Nutritionists are warning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, may disguise disordered eating behaviors. While intermittent fasting is often touted for its benefits, it can lead to restrictive eating and body image issues, especially for individuals prone to disordered eating. Experts emphasize that dieting and restriction are significant predictors of eating disorder onset, particularly in adolescents and young adults. It's crucial to evaluate one's mindset and intentions before trying intermittent fasting, and to seek guidance from a medical provider to ensure it does not trigger harmful patterns.</p>
