The deal, which has been under negotiation for months, seeks to end decades of conflict and unlock economic opportunities in the South Caucasus region. The agreement is also seen as a precursor to potentially expanding the Abraham Accords, with U.S. officials viewing it as a way to open new energy and trade routes to the West that bypass Russia and Iran.</p>

The initiative provides on-site access to GPs, nurses, and specialists, focusing on preventative care and early diagnosis for a population that often struggles to access traditional services. This model aligns with the NHS's 10-year plan to shift focus from hospital treatment to community-based prevention, aiming to improve health outcomes in underserved coastal and rural areas.</p>

          <p>According to research from CLSA, major Chinese semiconductor firms like SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor are expected to face minimal direct impact from the Trump administration's proposed 100% tariffs on imported chips. The assessment suggests these companies could even benefit from potential countermeasures and have already been diversifying their exports to Southeast Asian markets. The proposed US tariffs would exempt companies manufacturing in the US or those who have pledged significant investments, a list that includes major global tech firms but not China's top foundries.

          <p>The cybersecurity stock sector experienced a significant downturn, largely triggered by Fortinet's earnings report, which suggested a key firewall upgrade cycle was further along than anticipated. This news caused Fortinet's stock to plummet and dragged down peers like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, even though their business models differ. According to the CNBC Investing Club, this broad sell-off is an overreaction driven by sector-based ETF trading, creating an attractive opportunity to purchase shares in fundamentally strong companies at a discount.

          <p>President Trump recently criticized late-night television hosts, predicting the eventual cancellation of shows hosted by Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel following the end of Stephen Colbert's program. This focus on media ratings comes as Trump's own job approval numbers have fallen to 37%, the lowest of his second term, according to a Gallup poll. The article contrasts the president's obsession with television ratings against polling data that shows significant public disapproval of his handling of various issues.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a crucial landing and take-off test of its Lanyue lunar lander, a significant step toward its goal of sending astronauts to the moon by 2030. The test, conducted at a site simulating lunar gravity and terrain, verified the complex coordination of the lander's systems, which are designed to carry two astronauts to the lunar surface. This milestone marks progress in China's ambitious space program as it aims to establish a long-term presence on the moon.</p>

          <p>The bookstore chain Waterstones has issued an apology after its annual BookFest event at its London flagship store was widely criticized for overcrowding and disorganization. Attendees described long queues, unbearable heat, and a lack of staff control, with some calling the event "hell on earth" and potentially unsafe. The bookseller acknowledged an "unexpectedly high turnout" led to the issues and promised to review its procedures to improve future events, though it maintained that the safety of attendees was never at risk.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps mid-decade could set a precedent for similar partisan battles across the country ahead of the 2026 elections. In response to the Texas move, Democratic-led states like California and New York are considering their own redistricting efforts to counter potential GOP gains, escalating a national gerrymandering fight. This comes as a key Supreme Court case concerning Louisiana's congressional map could further reshape the rules around the Voting Rights Act and the legality of creating race-based districts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Stephen Miran, the current chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, to the Federal Reserve's board of governors. The temporary appointment, which would run until January 2026, is Trump's first opportunity to directly influence the independent central bank, which he has frequently criticized. Miran's nomination is seen as a move to add a voice supportive of lower interest rates to the board, potentially heightening concerns about the politicization of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan for a full military occupation of Gaza is creating significant divisions, drawing warnings from his own army chief and opposition from hostage families. The army's leadership reportedly fears the move would be a "trap," endangering both soldiers and the remaining hostages, while international allies have expressed concern over the potential for a worsening humanitarian crisis. Netanyahu has suggested handing civilian governance to Arab forces post-war, but his immediate push for an expanded offensive is seen by many as a political move to maintain his coalition.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum requiring colleges and universities to provide expanded admissions data to the Department of Education. The move is designed to determine if schools are circumventing the 2023 Supreme Court ban on affirmative action by using proxies for race in their admissions decisions. The order will compel institutions to report applicant data disaggregated by race and sex, including academic metrics, in what the administration calls an effort to ensure meritocracy, but which critics label a "fishing expedition."</p>

This is the second arrest in a series of similar incidents at WNBA games across the country, which police say the suspect described as a "stupid prank that was trending on social media." The trend has prompted the league to reiterate its zero-tolerance policy for fan conduct that disrupts games or compromises safety, with offenders facing immediate ejection and a minimum one-year ban.</p>
