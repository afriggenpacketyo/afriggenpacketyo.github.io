          <p>Ben McDonald, a former MLB pitcher and the first overall pick in the 1989 draft, is recovering from serious injuries after a 25-foot fall from a deer stand. He posted on social media from his hospital bed, revealing he suffered a severe concussion and two cracked vertebrae but remembers nothing of the incident. McDonald, who is now a color commentator for the Baltimore Orioles, expressed gratitude for the support he has received and assured fans he would return to broadcasting soon.</p>

          <p>This poem by Jodie Hollander, titled "Your Horses" and written "After Ted Hughes," evokes a powerful, almost mystical vision of ten silent, statue-like horses on the moors. The speaker reflects on this profound moment of stillness and natural grandeur, contrasting it with a later life of public acclaim and scandal in London. The poem concludes by questioning whether that sense of peace was ever found again, or if the search continues through the barren landscape.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reports that federal immigration raids under the Trump administration have instilled widespread fear throughout the city, particularly in its large Latino community. She described how neighborhoods can feel like ghost towns as residents, including legal residents and citizens, are afraid to leave their homes. Bass criticized the tactics of federal agents, such as using unmarked cars and masks, which she argues creates terror and confusion, and stated that the continued military presence in the city is an unnecessary misuse of taxpayer funds.</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. While acknowledging President Trump's recent directive to unseal grand jury evidence as "a start," Burchett expressed skepticism that the full truth would ever be revealed, noting Washington's tendency to protect its secrets. He also cautioned that any release must protect the identities of victims and innocent individuals, and he offered a measured critique of Attorney General Pam Bondi's initial handling of the issue.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel group have signed a declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and peaceful negotiations. The agreement, which sets a timeline for a comprehensive peace deal by August, includes provisions for restoring state authority in rebel-held areas. However, experts and analysts remain skeptical, pointing to immediate disagreements over rebel withdrawal and a lack of enforcement mechanisms. The success of this latest effort hinges on the political will for implementation, which has been absent in previous agreements.</p>

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, a near-ghost town on the historic Route 66, is preparing for a potential comeback as the famous highway's 100th anniversary approaches in 2026. Local residents and business owners are hoping the centennial will bring a flood of tourists and are planning events and improvements to capitalize on the milestone. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s. Now, its "frozen in time" appeal is seen as a key asset for attracting a new generation of road-trippers.</p>

          <p>Fauja Singh, a 114-year-old marathon runner who gained international fame for completing nine full marathons after the age of 89, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in his home state of Punjab, India. Singh, known as the "Turbaned Tornado," had taken up running to cope with personal loss and became an inspiration for his remarkable endurance. His death has highlighted the severe dangers of India's roads, where over 150,000 people are killed annually. A suspect has been arrested, but experts point to systemic failures in road engineering and safety as the root cause of such frequent tragedies.</p>

          <p>The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza are voicing increasing frustration and mistrust towards Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Campaigners and relatives feel the government is not prioritizing a deal for the hostages' release, pointing to the deaths of captives who could have been freed in earlier agreements. Many now place more hope in US pressure to secure a deal than in their own leadership. They criticize far-right elements in the coalition for prioritizing land and ideology over human lives, a stance they feel betrays the core Israeli ethos of not leaving anyone behind.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for circumventing a 2021 law by restoring the names of Army bases that previously honored Confederate generals. To bypass the law, which mandated new names, Hegseth claims the bases are now named after different historical soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. This move has been rebuked by members of Congress, including some Republicans, who see it as a blatant defiance of legislation. The article details the problematic legacies of figures like Braxton Bragg, for whom the bases were originally named.</p>

          <p>This essay posits that Oklahoma serves as a microcosm of the American experience, with a history founded on the violent collision of ambition, land theft, and reinvention. The author recounts learning a sanitized version of the state's history, which celebrated "Sooners" who cheated to claim land seized from Indigenous nations. The piece argues that confronting this unvarnished past, including the dream of all-Black towns and the racial terror that shadowed it, is essential. Oklahoma's history of pitting marginalized groups against each other is presented as a foundational American story, not an outlier.</p>

Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its fight against Donald Trump.

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it is not focused on dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. Approval for the program has become largely confined to the Republican base, while overall approval for the president has also declined. The poll suggests Americans, including those outside the GOP, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices and inflation. The recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is initially viewed by most as primarily benefiting the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>
