          <p>Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles saw a 24% year-over-year increase in June, reaching 1.8 million units. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in China, which accounted for 60% of the total, and a 23% rise in Europe. In contrast, North American sales declined by 9%, positioning the US as a laggard in the electric transition for the first half of 2025. Market analysts expect Chinese subsidies to continue, sustaining this momentum despite some reports of funding depletion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, which is half the number deployed last month amid protests over immigration raids. The initial deployment was federalized by President Trump, bypassing California Governor Gavin Newsom, who subsequently sued the administration. Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment as political theater and a misuse of military personnel, calling for the remaining troops to be sent home immediately. The Pentagon stated the withdrawal is possible because "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding."</p>

          <p>The National League defeated the American League in the 2025 MLB All-Star Game after the contest ended in a 6-6 tie, triggering a historic home run derby-style swing-off to determine the winner. The NL built an early 6-0 lead, but the AL rallied to tie the game in the ninth inning. Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber was named MVP for his performance in the tiebreaker. The game also featured the debut of the Automated Ball-Strike System, which was successfully challenged by players from both leagues, marking a significant technological step for the sport.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw, attending his 11th All-Star Game as a special "Legend Pick," delivered a poignant pregame speech and had a memorable on-field moment during the National League's victory. Before the game, he reminded his fellow All-Stars of their responsibility to the sport, emphasizing the game's importance. During a brief, mic'd-up appearance in the second inning, he retired two batters and received a loud ovation from the Atlanta crowd. The appearance, potentially his last at a Midsummer Classic, was celebrated by fellow players and fans as a fitting tribute to his career.</p>

          <p>A study by the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles reveals that many citizens detained in recent U.S. immigration raids are deeply established in the country. Of 330 individuals interviewed, over half had lived in the U.S. for at least a decade, and more than a third for over 20 years. Nearly one-third of those detained have U.S.-born children. The findings challenge the notion that recent enforcement actions primarily target new arrivals, instead showing they affect long-term, integrated members of the Southern California economy and community.</p>

          <p>On the opening day of a major supply chain expo, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's commitment to globalization and free trade. In an article published in the Communist Party's main theoretical journal, Xi spoke out against unilateral sanctions, trade barriers, and rising protectionism. He vowed that China would promote trade and investment liberalization and uphold "genuine multilateralism." The statement positions China as a champion of free trade in contrast to the more protectionist policies being pursued by other global powers, including the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has called on China's local governments to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece argues that well-crafted local laws create a stable and open system, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. Since 2015, legislative authority has been expanded to hundreds of Chinese cities, enabling them to tailor laws to their specific needs in areas like urban development and environmental protection, shifting from top-down orders to a law-based governance model.

          <p>The UK government secretly relocated 4,500 Afghans to Britain after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked the personal data of nearly 19,000 applicants seeking resettlement. The breach, which occurred in 2022, was discovered in 2023, and its existence was concealed by a super-injunction until a High Court judge lifted it. Defence Secretary John Healey has apologized for the "serious departmental error," confirming that 600 Afghan soldiers on the list and their families remain in Afghanistan. The secret relocation scheme has cost £400 million to date.</p>

          <p>Leaders from UC Berkeley, Georgetown, and CUNY faced a contentious House committee hearing on campus antisemitism, where they condemned bias while defending free speech. Republicans focused on faculty hiring and union practices, questioning if universities were tolerating antisemitic behavior. Democrats criticized the hearing as "political theatre," arguing the Trump administration's own actions, like defunding civil rights offices, undermine efforts to protect students. University leaders affirmed their commitment to combating antisemitism but stated they do not use ideological tests when hiring faculty, leading to tense exchanges.</p>

The entry was written after Italian police, who were interrogating her for murder, falsely told her she had HIV and instructed her to list her partners. When a user recently shamed her for the number, Knox reminded them of the coercive context, stating the diary was confiscated and leaked to the media to vilify her. Knox was fully exonerated in 2015 after being wrongly convicted.</p>

The filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to violently overthrow the democratic order. This charge stems from evidence linking Bolsonaro to a potential military takeover and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters. If found guilty on all charges, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from domestic mines instead of on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to acquire the metal at a discount using local currency, which bolsters reserves without depleting foreign exchange holdings like the U.S. dollar. This trend supports local mining industries and helps formalize the small-scale mining sector, though it also carries risks related to refining standards and supply chain ethics.
