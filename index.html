          <p>Denmark has summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen following reports of American citizens conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. The alleged aim was to promote Greenland's secession from Denmark to the US, a move US President Trump has openly desired. Danish intelligence services have warned about foreign actors targeting Greenland, emphasizing the need to protect the kingdom's internal affairs. This incident highlights growing tensions between the long-standing allies over the autonomous territory's future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has implemented 50% tariffs on goods imported from India, doubling previous levies, in an effort to pressure New Delhi over its continued purchases of Russian fossil fuels. US President Trump's administration argues India is not adequately acknowledging its role in the conflict in Ukraine. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded by vowing tax cuts and renewing calls for India to become self-reliant, while the government deems the US action "unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable." This significant tariff increase affects a wide range of Indian exports, particularly labor-intensive sectors, and marks a notable strain in US-India trade relations.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has implemented extensive global tariffs, citing a need to boost American manufacturing and protect jobs, with higher rates targeting countries with political grievances. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of their value, which companies may pass on to consumers. Critics argue this policy creates global economic instability and increases prices for US consumers, with major organizations like the IMF and OECD downgrading global growth predictions. The article details various tariffs on specific goods and countries, highlighting ongoing trade negotiations and the complex economic consequences of Trump's protectionist approach.</p>

Authorities have warned residents to stay indoors, as Freeman is known to be a 'sovereign citizen' with documented anti-authority views, raising questions about how such extremist ideologies are handled by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the article explores the lasting trauma experienced by its youngest survivors, now adults. Many children, like Arnold Burks and E'jaaz Mason, faced displacement, loss, and mental health struggles, with limited access to support. The documentary "Katrina Babies" helped some process their experiences, revealing how the narrative of "resilience" may inadvertently shift responsibility from authorities to act on climate change. The city's upgraded levees offer some protection, but Louisiana's eroding coastline and federal funding cuts for disaster agencies leave future generations vulnerable to increasingly intense storms.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to discuss a new draft law on military service, initially focusing on voluntary recruitment to address a shortfall in the Bundeswehr, which needs 80,000 additional professional soldiers and 140,000 reservists. This comes as labor costs in Germany are significantly higher than the average in other industrialized nations, driven by a skilled worker shortage. An anti-war alliance has protested outside a forces careers center, highlighting societal divisions. While the government aims for voluntary service, the reintroduction of compulsory military service remains a possibility if recruitment goals are not met.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their annual energy bills rise by £35, reaching £1,755, under the latest price cap announced by regulator Ofgem, effective October. This 2% increase, slightly higher than anticipated, is attributed to rising wholesale energy costs and new consumer support measures. Campaigners warn of another challenging winter for families, many of whom are already struggling with £4bn in energy debt and rising food costs. Ofgem suggests exploring fixed-price deals, while government support like the £150 Warm Home Discount aims to alleviate some of the financial burden for vulnerable households.</p>

The Air Force investigation revealed that the jet's computer systems transitioned to an "automated ground-operation mode" while flying, rendering it uncontrollable and forcing the pilot to eject safely.

          <p>Britain's Jacob Fearnley secured his first US Open main-draw victory, overcoming nerves, a challenging service game, and a heckler to defeat Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut. The 24-year-old Scot struggled with double faults in high-tension moments but demonstrated resilience, particularly in the fourth set. Fearnley's rapid ascent in rankings, cracking the top 50 in June, highlights his inexperience at the highest level, often drawing top-seeded opponents. He now faces German third seed Alexander Zverev in the second round, aiming to build confidence in high-stakes environments despite ongoing issues with his serve.</p>

          <p>India's $434 billion merchandise exports engine faces substantial risks as US President Donald Trump's 50% tariffs, imposed over India's Russian oil purchases, officially take effect. Analysts warn these elevated tariffs could severely undermine India's appeal as a manufacturing hub and significantly impact its GDP growth, potentially reducing it from 7% to 6%. The article details the vulnerability of key Indian export sectors, including engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics, which heavily rely on the US market. While some sectors like pharmaceuticals currently have exemptions, Trump has threatened future duties, further complicating India's trade outlook.</p>

          <p>Several Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees have been placed on administrative leave after signing a public letter of dissent criticizing recent cuts to agency staff and programs. The letter, signed by over 180 current and former FEMA personnel, warned that the agency's capacity to respond to major disasters is dangerously diminished. The notice to employees stated the leave was not disciplinary, but FEMA has not directly linked it to the letter. This action follows similar dissent from staff at other federal agencies and highlights growing concerns about government policy impacting critical public services.</p>

The article explains that the Houthis, backed by Iran, began attacking Israel in late 2023 in solidarity with Palestinians, using the conflict to gain support and leverage in their own civil war.

          <p>Russia's struggling economy, marked by a widening budget deficit and slowing growth, could be a factor influencing President Vladimir Putin's approach to peace negotiations with Ukraine. Despite Moscow's continued military actions, the article suggests that declining oil export revenues and surging defense spending are straining the budget. The Central Bank of Russia forecasts meager growth for 2025, and experts warn of a potential prolonged recession if spending cuts are made or high inflation returns. These economic pressures may subtly push the Kremlin to reconsider its hardline stance, even as it maintains an advantage on the battlefield. (not investment advice)</p>
