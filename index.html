          <p>Ranchers in Sonora, Mexico, are confronting a severe economic crisis following the U.S. suspension of live cattle imports due to a New World Screwworm outbreak. This ban, the third in eight months, compounds the effects of a recent two-year drought, forcing many to diversify into other agricultural ventures at a significant loss. The flesh-eating parasite poses a major threat to livestock, prompting U.S. authorities to take protective measures, including plans to release sterile flies. Mexican ranchers are now seeking new domestic and international markets to survive the financial strain while urging for regional differentiation in U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>A cloudburst in India's northern state of Uttarakhand has triggered massive flash floods, leaving more than 100 people missing in Dharali village. The sudden, extreme downpour on Tuesday caused the Kheerganga river to swell, inundating roads and buildings and hampering rescue efforts. Army teams are on-site, but other disaster response forces are struggling to reach the affected area due to damaged infrastructure and persistent heavy rains. The incident has also left at least 10 soldiers missing from a nearby army base, highlighting the severe impact of the ongoing monsoon season in the Himalayan region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has decided to keep its policy interest rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision follows a significant 50-basis-point cut in the previous meeting, leading the RBI to adopt a "neutral" stance while monitoring economic data. The hold comes as India faces potential tariff increases from the U.S. over its trade relationships with Russia. Despite recent low inflation figures, the central bank is exercising caution, though analysts suggest a rate cut could be possible later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior UN official has expressed deep alarm over reports that Israel is considering a full reoccupation of the Gaza Strip, warning the UN Security Council of potentially "catastrophic consequences." Such an expansion of military operations would endanger the lives of millions of Palestinians and the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The warning comes amid a severe humanitarian crisis, with UN agencies reporting man-made mass starvation in the territory. The proposed plan has reportedly caused division within Israel's own security leadership, while families of hostages fear for their loved ones' safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country, creating a new obstacle for the nation's fragile post-war recovery. This move comes less than three months after the U.S. lifted many long-standing sanctions following the fall of the Assad regime. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts argue the high tariff sends a punishing symbolic message and could restrict foreign investment needed for rebuilding the devastated country. The policy is seen by some as a tool to maintain leverage over Syria's new transitional government as it navigates sectarian violence and economic collapse.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks extended their winning streak, defeating the Indiana Fever 100-91 in a hard-fought game. The Fever, who were on a five-game winning streak themselves, played without their injured star rookie Caitlin Clark. The Sparks capitalized on their recently healthy and complete roster, with strong performances from Rickea Jackson, Kelsey Plum, Dearica Hamby, and Azurá Stevens. Despite a late-game surge by Indiana that narrowed the score, Los Angeles held on for the victory, improving their record to 13-15 and strengthening their position in the playoff race as they continue their impressive run.</p>

          <p>Italy's cabinet has passed a draft law that would impose stricter controls on gender-affirming medical treatments for individuals under 18. The proposed legislation aims to regulate puberty blockers and hormones for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, requiring approval from a national ethics committee and establishing a national registry to monitor treatments. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government framed the measure as necessary to protect minors' health. However, the bill has been met with strong opposition from transgender rights advocates, who view it as another restrictive policy from a government that has already curtailed rights for LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

          <p>China is encountering a significant challenge in its ambition to build a satellite internet network comparable to SpaceX's Starlink due to a shortage of available rockets. The state-backed Guo Wang project, considered China's primary Starlink competitor, has recently accelerated its launches, consuming a large portion of the nation's Long March rocket capacity. This has left other aspiring satellite constellations, such as the Shanghai-led Qianfan project, to seek launch services from emerging private rocket companies.

Hiroshima's mayor warned against the global trend of military buildup and the growing acceptance of nuclear weapons, urging the world to learn from history's tragedies.

This legal action represents a significant escalation in the political standoff, moving beyond threats of arrest to an attempt to unseat an elected official.

After a difficult start to his MLB career, Sasaki has been progressing well in his throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and his command improving. He has also added a two-seam fastball to his arsenal, which the team hopes will make him more effective. While his role is uncertain, the Dodgers are hopeful that the Japanese phenom could become a valuable contributor, either as a starter or reliever, for their postseason push.</p>

          <p>The Gifford fire, now the largest in California this year, has scorched nearly 84,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest and continues to threaten over 800 structures. The blaze, which is only 9% contained, has forced evacuations in parts of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties and resulted in at least three injuries. Over 1,900 personnel are battling the fire, which originated from at least four smaller fires and spread rapidly through steep, inaccessible terrain. Officials are concerned that a forecast of hot and dry weather will intensify fire behavior in the coming days.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp's parent company, Meta, has announced the removal of 6.8 million accounts linked to fraudulent activities in the first half of this year. Many of these accounts were connected to organized crime centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor to carry out investment schemes and other scams. The takedowns are part of a broader crackdown on criminals who hijack accounts or add users to group chats to promote their schemes. In conjunction with the announcement, WhatsApp is rolling out new security features to better alert users to potential scams, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to create a comprehensive plan for disarming Hezbollah and ensuring that only state institutions possess weapons by the end of the year. This decision, following significant pressure from the United States, is a key step in implementing a ceasefire agreement aimed at ending hostilities with Israel. The plan is to be presented to the cabinet for approval by the end of August. However, Hezbollah, a powerful political and militant group, has stated it will not disarm while facing ongoing Israeli attacks, setting the stage for a potential domestic and regional confrontation.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker AMD reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. While quarterly revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, the company's earnings per share were slightly lower than predicted. CEO Lisa Su attributed a decline in AI business revenue to U.S. export restrictions on sales to China, which cost the company an estimated $800 million. Despite this, the company saw strong growth in its Client and Gaming segment and provided an optimistic sales forecast for the current quarter, expecting its newest AI chips to compete effectively with rivals.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from repurposing over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its congressionally allocated funds without authority. The judge stated that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the funding for projects like flood mitigation. The injunction halts the reallocation while the court considers the states' full legal challenge to the cuts.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has reportedly contacted Donald Trump to seek a presidential pardon following his conviction on prostitution-related offenses. The rapper, who was recently denied bail, faces a potential prison sentence of up to 20 years. In a recent interview, Trump acknowledged that he had been approached about the matter but expressed reluctance, noting that Combs was "very hostile" toward him when he ran for office and suggesting a pardon was unlikely. Combs, a former cultural and business mogul, was found guilty in July but was cleared of more severe racketeering and sex-trafficking charges.</p>

          <p>A state-owned Chinese company is making significant progress on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, with plans to begin extraction this year after a 17-year delay. The project, one of the world's largest untouched copper deposits, was stalled by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and landmines. The Taliban government has announced a switch to more costly underground mining to help preserve the historical relics at the site. This development signals a renewed push by China to advance its economic interests in Afghanistan, capitalizing on the country's vast mineral resources under the new regime.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the 2023 Titan submersible implosion has concluded that the fatal incident was "preventable" and resulted from multiple failures by its operator, OceanGate. The report heavily faults the late CEO Stockton Rush for negligence, ignoring safety warnings, and using an inadequate design, such as a carbon fiber hull instead of stronger materials. Investigators stated that Rush would likely have faced criminal charges had he survived the implosion that killed him and four passengers. The findings, which also cite a lack of proper certification, have led to safety recommendations for the submersible industry.</p>
