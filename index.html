        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist skeptical of the EU and against military support for Ukraine, won the first round of the Romanian presidential election rerun. Simion, who garnered significant support from the Romanian diaspora, particularly in Italy, Spain, and Germany, is an admirer of Donald Trump and advocates for an EU of sovereign nations. He faces a runoff on May 18, with his potential victory causing concern in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's role as a transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine. Simion has hinted at a less proactive approach to supporting Ukraine and calls for restoring Romania's old borders, having been banned from entering Moldova and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced his directive to the Bureau of Prisons, DOJ, FBI and Homeland Security to reopen an enlarged Alcatraz to house the most ruthless offenders. Citing the need to lock up dangerous criminals away from society, Trump's plan faces feasibility challenges due to the island's crumbling infrastructure and high operating costs. Alcatraz Island is currently a national park operated by the National Park Service, making the proposal a complex undertaking. The Bureau of Prisons stated it will comply with presidential orders, but did not address practicality concerns. </p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan are escalating following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, with India suggesting Pakistani involvement, a claim Pakistan denies. The conflict over Kashmir, a region claimed by both countries, dates back to the partition of India in 1947, leading to multiple wars and continued unrest. A timeline of the dispute highlights key events, including the first war in 1947, the establishment of a Line of Control in 1972, the rise of insurgency in the 1980s, and recent crackdowns by India in 2019. The latest attack, which killed 26 people, has heightened the risk of military confrontation.</p>

Analysts suggest that General Munir's hard-line stance reflects his need to project strength amidst political divisions and economic challenges in Pakistan.

The federal government has pledged to support the industry, which benefits from a 30% rebate for big-budget projects shot in Australia. The tariffs could make Australian incentives less attractive to productions targeting the US market, potentially impacting the $767 million spent on foreign film and television in Australia during 2023-24.

          <p>Labour minister Lucy Powell is facing calls to resign from sexual assault survivors after describing the grooming gangs scandal as a “dog whistle” issue. Powell's comments on BBC radio sparked widespread backlash, with victims accusing her of belittling their experiences. While Powell has apologized, stating she was challenging the political point scoring and not the issue itself, critics argue her remarks demonstrate a lack of seriousness towards the issue. Other politicians have weighed in on the controversy, with some calling for a full inquiry into the matter.</p>

          <p>Joy Air, a regional airline in western China, has suspended all flights due to labor disputes and a debt crisis, leaving some pilots to deliver food for a living. The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting second- and third-tier cities. The suspension is attributed to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed railways gradually replace internal routes within Shaanxi. This impedes Joy Air's cash flow, negatively impacting the company's operations.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) is estimated to rank fourth among OECD members in 2024, falling behind Britain. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. The OECD report also noted an overall decline in ODA by Development Assistance Committee members, primarily due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>
