          <p>Apple has refuted claims from X owner Elon Musk that its App Store unfairly disadvantages competitors, particularly in the AI app market. The tech giant stated its platform is designed to be fair and uses objective criteria for featuring apps. This conflict is the latest in an ongoing feud between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, stemming from Musk's belief that OpenAI has strayed from its non-profit mission. Despite Musk's complaints about his apps X and Grok not being promoted, data shows they perform well, though not as highly as he claims.</p>

          <p>Evacuation warnings are in effect for parts of Juneau, Alaska, as a glacial ice dam on the Mendenhall Glacier has released a massive volume of water. The National Weather Service predicts record-breaking flood levels for the Mendenhall River, surpassing previous destructive events in 2023 and 2024. This annual phenomenon, caused by climate change melting a smaller glacier and creating a water-filled basin, threatens hundreds of homes despite the installation of temporary flood barriers. The event highlights the growing and immediate dangers of a warming climate on local communities.</p>

          <p>Text messages and emails from the Upper Guadalupe River Authority reveal significant confusion during the deadly Fourth of July flood in Kerr County, Texas. Officials initially expressed misplaced optimism before realizing the severity of the disaster, which claimed over 130 lives, many at a summer camp. The communications show a struggle to obtain accurate information and a discussion about messaging and the need for a flood warning system, a project for which funding had previously been declined. The documents highlight a lack of preparedness and raise questions about the agency's response to the tragic event.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska must be narrowly focused on achieving an enforceable ceasefire in Ukraine, without any territorial concessions. The author suggests that a halt to the fighting is the immediate priority to stop the bloodshed and open humanitarian corridors, given the rising toll of the war. To be effective, any truce must be backed by strict monitoring, snap-back sanctions for violations, and a clear path toward long-term security for Ukraine. The piece contends this approach represents principled diplomacy, not weakness.</p>

          <p>A new organization of health professionals, Defend Public Health, has released a report criticizing the current administration's approach to public health and calling for the removal of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The group argues that the administration is distracting the public with non-evidence-based policies while ignoring fundamental issues like poverty, food insecurity, and healthcare access. They accuse Kennedy of being a major source of scientific misinformation and a "genuine threat" to public health. The report advocates for focusing on proven strategies like vaccination access and strengthening public health systems.</p>

At a recent MLB umpire camp in Milwaukee, candidates expressed that new technologies are tools for improvement, not deterrents. Instructors and MLB officials acknowledge that while technology has made umpiring more accurate than ever, it has also heightened expectations and mental stress. The ability to mentally recover from having calls overturned in real-time is now a key trait evaluated for umpires aiming for the major leagues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a crackdown on homelessness in Washington, D.C., deploying the National Guard and stating that individuals who refuse to move from encampments to shelters will face fines or jail time. The White House claims this is part of an effort to make the city "safe and beautiful," despite data showing a decrease in violent crime. Housing advocates and experts criticize the policy, warning that it will criminalize homelessness without addressing the root causes. They point to a lack of available shelter beds and the administration's cuts to housing assistance as evidence of a punitive approach.</p>

          <p>An analysis reveals a record number of U.S. Senators and House members are not seeking reelection for the 2026 midterms, with many opting to run for governor instead. This trend, the highest in at least 90 years, is attributed to partisan gridlock in Washington and the increased political profile of governors, especially post-COVID. Since the start of the Trump era in 2017, over half of the lawmakers from that Congress are no longer in office. This exodus reflects a growing sentiment that Washington is a less attractive place to serve, driven by internal party fights and political exhaustion.</p>

          <p>Recent polling suggests that support for the Republican party among Latino voters, which saw gains in the last election, may be weakening ahead of the 2026 midterms. The primary drivers of this dissatisfaction are economic issues, including high prices for essentials and a feeling that the GOP has not delivered on its promises to lower the cost of living. While this discontent has not yet translated into a firm shift toward Democrats, it has created a growing block of undecided swing voters. Both parties face the challenge of presenting a compelling economic vision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The word "dog," one of the most common in the English language, has a mysterious origin that linguists have yet to solve. For centuries, canines were more commonly called "hounds," with "dog" appearing as a derogatory term for people before evolving into the standard, affectionate term around the 1500s. Theories suggest it may derive from the Old English words "dox" (a color) or "dugan" (to be strong), but its true etymology remains unknown. The evolution of the word and its use in many idioms reflects the deep, long-standing emotional connection between humans and their canine companions.</p>

In response, grassroots organizations like Man Up to Cancer are being created to provide a space for male survivors to find fellowship, share their vulnerabilities, and combat cultural conditioning that discourages them from seeking help.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between the ancestors of tomatoes and a group of plants called Etuberosum. This hybridization, which occurred around 9 million years ago, gave the new plant lineage the unique ability to grow tubers. This evolutionary development happened at a crucial time when the Andes mountains were forming, allowing the resilient potato to thrive in the new high-elevation habitats. The research not only solves a long-standing genetic mystery but could also pave the way for creating more resilient potato varieties by breeding them with seeds.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly in advanced negotiations to sign midfielder Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa before the transfer deadline. The 24-year-old is expected to hold crucial talks with his current club within the next 24 hours to decide on his future. An agreement between the two clubs is said to be close, and if Ramsey decides to leave, Newcastle is believed to be his preferred destination over other interested clubs like West Ham. Ramsey has been a regular player for Aston Villa, scoring 17 goals in 167 appearances since his debut in 2019.</p>

          <h2>European Powers Warn of 'Snapback' Sanctions if Iran Fails to Resume Nuclear Talks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France, the U.K., and Germany have warned the United Nations that they are prepared to trigger "snapback" sanctions against Iran if it does not re-engage in diplomatic talks over its nuclear program. The warning comes two months after a conflict where the U.S. and Israel bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. The "snapback" mechanism, part of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear deal, allows for the automatic reimposition of U.N. sanctions. With Iran enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels, these European powers are increasing pressure on Tehran to return to a diplomatic solution. (not investment advice)</p>

The government states the technology will be used to locate suspects for serious crimes and cites its success in London, where it led to 580 arrests in a year. However, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have condemned the move as an "alarming" expansion of the surveillance state without a proper legal framework.

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, believes the company's plan to power artificial intelligence data centers with its small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) has the potential to make it the UK's most valuable firm. As AI's energy consumption soars, Rolls-Royce is positioning its nuclear technology as a key solution, having already signed deals with the UK and Czech governments. Despite the SMR technology being currently unproven on a commercial scale, the CEO is confident in its future, seeing a potential trillion-dollar market. This strategy is part of a dramatic company turnaround. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation found that over one in seven councils in the UK have reduced the temperature of their swimming pools in the last five years. The primary reason cited by 39 local authorities for this change is the significant rise in energy costs. The Local Government Association confirmed that council finances are in a "fragile position," forcing reductions in leisure services. While the temperature drops are within official guidelines, critics and swimmers with health conditions fear it could deter people from swimming, a vital form of exercise for many.</p>
