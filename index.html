          <p>Awdah Al Hathaleen, a 31-year-old Palestinian activist and documentary filmmaker, was shot and killed in his West Bank village of Umm al-Khair. The incident occurred during a confrontation with an Israeli settler, who was seen on video firing a handgun but was later released without charges. Hathaleen was known for his non-violent activism and his work on the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," which chronicles the villagers' struggle against settler encroachment. His death has drawn international condemnation and highlights the escalating violence and vulnerability faced by Palestinian communities under Israeli occupation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in job vacancies between May and July, reaching the lowest level since early 2021. The number of employees on payroll also saw a modest decline. Despite the slowdown, wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%, suggesting a gradual rather than sharp downturn. Economists note this cooling could influence the Bank of England's future decisions on interest rates as it seeks to manage inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UFC has secured a seven-year, $7.7 billion media deal with Paramount, shifting away from its traditional pay-per-view model to increase accessibility. This strategic change comes as UFC President Dana White's close alignment with Donald Trump is questioned for its potential to alienate a diverse and global fanbase. The article suggests that while the partnership may appeal to a specific demographic, it could be a liability given the UFC's international roster of champions and the shifting political views of younger audiences. The move to a broader streaming and network TV platform is seen as an effort to expand the UFC's audience amid concerns over recent viewership numbers.</p>

          <p>Swiss sportswear company On Holding reported a 32% sales increase in its second quarter, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue and margin guidance. The popular sneaker brand now anticipates sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs, demonstrating strong performance despite new U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam, where it sources 90% of its products. To offset the higher costs, On raised its prices in July but has not observed any negative impact on consumer demand. The company continues to gain market share, particularly in the running segment, and has seen robust growth in key markets like the Americas and China.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. Metro police and the use of the National Guard to address what he describes as a city overrun by criminals, gangs, and homeless individuals. His rhetoric targets not only criminal activity but also calls for the removal of unhoused and poor people from the nation's capital. This move has sparked significant concern among experts and residents, who warn that displacing vulnerable populations from their support networks could be devastating. Critics argue that using aggressive police tactics to solve complex social issues like homelessness and addiction is ineffective and could cause more harm.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced the discontinuation of its dial-up internet service, effective September 30th, marking the end of an era for the technology that defined internet access for many in the 1990s. Known for its distinctive beeping and static connection sounds, dial-up provided a crucial gateway to the online world by using existing telephone lines. While largely replaced by faster broadband technology, a very small percentage of American households, particularly in rural areas, still relied on the service. The move signifies the final chapter for a service that was once ubiquitous, famously distributed via millions of free trial CDs.</p>

          <p>A controversial federal dredging project in Mobile Bay, Alabama, has united an unusual coalition of commercial shrimpers, environmental groups, and Republican officials in opposition. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is deepening the ship channel to accommodate larger vessels, but critics argue the disposal of dredged material directly into the bay is harming the local ecosystem and devastating the seafood industry. While the Corps maintains the practice is environmentally sound and necessary, the coalition is lobbying Congress to ban the in-bay dumping. They advocate for using the material for coastal restoration or disposing of it in the Gulf of Mexico, as was done previously.</p>

This transfer marks the third major defensive sale for Bournemouth during this window, following the departures of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool. Despite the need to rebuild their defense, the sales are expected to generate a significant profit for the English club, which has already agreed to a deal for a replacement player.</p>

          <p>An Australian federal court has delivered a partial victory to 'Fortnite' developer Epic Games, ruling that the app stores operated by Apple and Google are uncompetitive. The court found that the tech giants' control over app distribution and in-app payment systems limits competition, although it also noted they had not intentionally breached the law. This ruling is a significant development in Epic Games' global legal battle against what it claims are excessive fees and restrictive practices. Following the judgment, Epic announced its intention to bring its own game store and 'Fortnite' to iOS devices in Australia.</p>

          <h2>Efforts to Advance Human Gene-Editing Technology Continue After Ethical Controversy</h2>

          <p>The technology behind gene-editing human embryos is seeing renewed interest and development, years after a Chinese scientist's secret creation of the first gene-edited babies in 2018 caused a global ethical uproar. That event, led by He Jiankui, was widely condemned as reckless because the CRISPR technology used was still new and its long-term effects were unknown. Despite the controversy, some companies are now pushing forward with research to refine and advance gene-editing techniques for human reproduction. This revival of research reopens complex ethical debates about the potential for "designer babies" and the future of human genetic modification.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to take immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top ranking, specifically citing his own Grok AI chatbot. This follows Musk's previous criticism of Apple's integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the operating system level, which he deemed an "unacceptable security violation." The threat adds to the legal pressures on Apple, which is already facing a landmark antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their current trade truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation of tariffs. President Trump signed an executive order to continue the pause until November 10, with Beijing confirming it would also hold its tariff rates. This extension keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%. The White House stated the extra time will be used for further negotiations aimed at remedying trade imbalances and addressing other economic and national security issues between the world's two largest economies.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level since April 2023, in response to slowing inflation and a weaker economic outlook. Concurrently, the RBA downgraded its annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker than expected public demand. The central bank noted that inflation has dropped substantially since its 2022 peak, bringing demand and supply into better balance. The decision comes amid a reshaped global trade environment but the RBA stated recent trade policy developments have had little discernible impact so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along the coast of Western Australia have experienced their most severe bleaching event on record, following the state's longest and most intense marine heatwave. The prolonged period of elevated ocean temperatures from last August to this May caused significant heat stress across 1,500 kilometers of reefs, including previously resilient areas like the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef. This event is part of a two-year global coral bleaching crisis driven by climate change. The damage underscores the urgent threat to marine ecosystems, as reefs have little time to recover between increasingly frequent and intense bleaching events.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of a missing cyclist in Scotland was solved thanks to the quick thinking of a woman who secretly marked his burial site with a Red Bull can. Dr. Caroline Muirhead's boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to her that he had killed cyclist Tony Parsons in a hit-and-run in 2017 and buried his body. After he showed her the remote location, she dropped the can as a marker and informed the police. This crucial clue led authorities to recover Parsons' body, bringing a long-awaited resolution to his family and the police investigation.</p>

          <p>While recent polls show a growing majority of Israelis, around 74%, support a deal with Hamas to free all remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza, there is little corresponding sympathy for Palestinian suffering. A survey by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 79% of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by reports of famine and suffering in Gaza. This disconnect highlights a complex public sentiment where the desire to bring hostages home and end the conflict for Israeli soldiers coexists with a hardening of attitudes towards Palestinians. Protests within Israel demanding a hostage deal have been growing in size and intensity.</p>

          <p>Thousands of North Korean laborers are being sent to Russia to address a labor shortage exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, where they face slave-like conditions, according to a BBC investigation. Interviews with escaped workers and intelligence officials reveal that these men work grueling 18-hour days on construction sites, with their earnings largely confiscated by the North Korean state. This practice, which violates UN sanctions, is reportedly expanding, with Russia using tactics like student visas to bypass the ban. The investigation highlights the deepening ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, with human lives being exploited for economic and political gain.</p>

          <p>Spain is charting a foreign policy path that is creating friction with the Trump administration by resisting pressure on defense spending and pursuing closer ties with China. The Spanish government recently rejected the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets and has not committed to NATO's new 5% defense spending target, drawing criticism from President Trump. Additionally, Madrid's decision to award a contract to Chinese tech giant Huawei has raised concerns in both the U.S. and the EU. Analysts suggest Spain's minority government may be using these foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues, gambling that its EU membership will shield it from direct U.S. retaliation.</p>

The implant's tibial component, which lacked a plastic layer from previous versions, was prone to slipping out of place, causing severe pain and requiring hundreds of patients to undergo corrective surgery. Surgeons and patients reported that the US manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, was slow to acknowledge the problem.

The administration justified the deployment under a law allowing presidential action during a "rebellion."
