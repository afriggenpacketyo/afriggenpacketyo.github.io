          <h2>TSMC Reports Record Profits Driven by Strong AI Chip Demand</h2>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is primarily attributed to the high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division constituted 60% of its revenue, underscoring the AI boom's impact. Despite this strong performance, TSMC acknowledges potential risks from U.S. tariff policies and export controls affecting its business with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's jobs market is showing signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate climbing to a four-year high of 4.7% and annual wage growth slowing to 5%. Official statistics also indicate a continuous decline in job vacancies, reaching a ten-year low outside of the pandemic period. Economists suggest these trends may prompt the Bank of England to consider interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. Some businesses attribute the slowdown in hiring to recent increases in employer national insurance contributions, forcing them to reduce headcounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A devastating fire engulfed a recently opened five-story shopping mall in Kut, Iraq, resulting in the deaths of at least 61 people, with most victims succumbing to suffocation. The blaze, which broke out late Wednesday, also led to numerous injuries, and rescue teams managed to save over 45 individuals trapped inside. Officials have declared three days of mourning and initiated an investigation, filing legal cases against the building and mall owners. This tragedy highlights ongoing concerns in Iraq regarding poor building standards and fire safety, which have contributed to similar fatal incidents in recent years.</p>

This decision comes amid a difficult period for the national team, which recently ended an 18-match losing streak.

          <p>The rise of AI-generated music, exemplified by the synthetic psychedelic rock "band" The Velvet Sundown attracting over a million monthly listeners on Spotify, is causing significant concern in the music industry. While AI tools have been part of music production for years, new platforms enable the easy creation of entire songs, raising complex questions about authorship and copyright. Major record labels have filed lawsuits against AI music platforms for alleged copyright infringement. Many human artists and industry professionals worry that the flood of synthetic content could devalue their work and make it even harder for emerging musicians to succeed.</p>

          <p>A weather system moving across the Florida Panhandle is showing an increasing chance of developing into a tropical depression as it heads toward the northern Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane Center has warned that regardless of its intensification, the system is expected to bring heavy rainfall and a significant flooding threat to southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. In New Orleans, officials are preparing for several inches of rain, with some coastal areas potentially seeing up to 10 inches. This threat follows a series of deadly floods across the U.S. this summer, prompting proactive measures like sandbag distribution.</p>

Speaking in Beijing, Huang argued that as technology progresses, it is sensible for the chips permissible for sale in China to also improve over time. Nvidia has been navigating complex U.S. export controls that have restricted its access to the significant Chinese market. The company recently resumed sales of its H20 chip, a less-advanced version designed to comply with American restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

The FAA is currently over 3,000 controllers short of its target, leading to mandatory overtime and fatigue. Many in the workforce feel that without addressing these quality-of-life and compensation concerns, the system will remain under immense stress, impacting both safety and efficiency.</p>

Some employees were laid off while on official travel, and entire offices, such as the one assisting families of employees who die overseas, were eliminated.
