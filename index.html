          <p>The U.S. government has brokered an unusual agreement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, requiring them to pay 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China. This revenue-sharing plan was a condition for granting the companies export licenses to the Chinese market. President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he negotiated the figure down from 20% with Nvidia's CEO. The arrangement, which is highly atypical for export agreements, comes after the administration restricted sales of advanced AI chips to China over national security concerns.

          <p>President Trump announced he expects to know within the first few minutes of his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin whether a peace deal for Ukraine is feasible. The summit, set to take place in Alaska, is being framed as a preliminary discussion, with Trump dismissing the immediate need for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's involvement. This approach has generated concern among European allies and in Ukraine, who fear a potential deal could favor Russian interests. Trump indicated that any agreement would likely involve land swaps and that he would brief Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows the president's controversial firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS, questioning its methodology and data accuracy. The appointment, which requires Senate confirmation, has raised concerns among some economists about the potential politicization of the independent agency responsible for crucial economic data.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl was injured after being attacked by a mountain lion outside her home in Malibu, California. The cougar bit the girl's arm, leg, and back before her mother's screams drew its attention, causing it to chase the mother and another sibling. A third family member scared the animal away using the sound of a stun gun. The girl was treated for minor injuries at a hospital. Wildlife officials later located and euthanized a mountain lion in the vicinity, with DNA tests pending to confirm if it was the same animal involved in the attack.</p>

The district superintendent stated that the 'safe zones' will be monitored by staff, community volunteers, and police to ensure students' safe passage. This initiative aims to reassure families that schools and their immediate surroundings remain secure amid ongoing immigration raids.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Mexico’s National Autonomous University are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to track the critically endangered axolotl salamander in the canals of Xochimilco, Mexico City. As physical sightings have become nearly impossible, scientists are filtering water to find genetic traces of the elusive creature. The population has plummeted from an estimated 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014. While eDNA has been found in protected refuge areas, its presence elsewhere is minimal, highlighting the urgent need for habitat restoration to save the species from extinction.</p>

          <p>Scientists have uncovered evidence of a massive, previously unknown flood in Greenland from 2014, where over 24 billion gallons of meltwater burst through a 300-foot-thick ice sheet. This discovery, detailed in a recent study, is the first known instance of meltwater breaking through the ice from below rather than flowing from the surface. The event challenges existing models of how Greenland's ice sheet behaves and interacts with subglacial water systems. This finding underscores how much remains unknown about the complex dynamics of the rapidly melting ice sheet, which is a major contributor to global sea-level rise.</p>

The operation was launched after intelligence indicated that a large group of over 400 militants, locally known as "bandits," were preparing to attack a village. These armed groups have been responsible for widespread terror, including kidnappings for ransom and imposing taxes on local communities. Despite repeated military efforts, the violence has persisted, exacerbating food insecurity by displacing farmers in the region.</p>

          <p>With the federal government's funding set to expire on September 30, Congress faces a difficult sprint to pass annual spending bills and avert a shutdown. The political dynamics are complex, as House Republicans have a razor-thin majority, and Senate Republicans will need Democratic support to overcome the 60-vote filibuster threshold. This situation gives Senate Democrats significant leverage, but progressives are pressuring leadership to demand major concessions. Some conservative Republicans are suggesting another temporary funding extension at current levels, which were set under a Democratic-led government, arguing it would effectively act as a spending cut.

A second blaze, the Elk fire, has scorched over 14,000 acres but is 30% contained.

          <p>President Trump's justification for federalizing Washington D.C.'s police force relies on misleading and outdated crime statistics, according to this analysis. While the president cited a 2023 homicide spike, he ignored more recent data showing that violent crime in the city fell to a 30-year low in 2024 and continues to decline in 2025. The article argues that this narrative mirrors a similar strategy used in Los Angeles, where largely peaceful protests were portrayed as a violent siege. Experts cited in the article suggest that community-led interventions, not punitive crackdowns, have been more effective at reducing youth violence in the capital.</p>

          <p>Residents of Paterson, New Jersey, are facing a fourth day of little to no water service after a 140-year-old water main broke last Friday. The break has left thousands of customers with extremely low water pressure and prompted a boil-water advisory for nearly 200,000 people in the area. Officials have set up portable showers and are distributing bottled water, but frustrated residents are growing weary of the inconvenience. Crews are working to complete repairs, which require custom-made pipes, with officials hoping to restore full service by Tuesday night.</p>

          <p>Sinclair, one of the largest TV station owners in the U.S., is conducting a strategic review of its broadcast business that could lead to a merger. The company has reportedly held discussions with potential partners amid expectations of media deregulation under the Trump administration, which could facilitate more industry consolidation. Concurrently, Sinclair is considering spinning off its ventures unit, which includes the Tennis Channel. The move comes as broadcast groups face declining revenue from traditional pay-TV subscriptions, increasing pressure to find new growth strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Washington D.C. are divided over President Trump's decision to federalize the city's police force and deploy the National Guard. While some, particularly in high-crime neighborhoods, welcome the intervention hoping it will enhance safety, others view it as a political stunt and an authoritarian overreach. Activist groups have protested the move, arguing it undermines the city's autonomy and is not based on current crime data, which shows a significant decrease in violence. The article highlights the contrast between residents weary of crime and those who fear the federal presence will only escalate tensions and silence dissent.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon has begun a 50-state tour to advocate for the Trump administration's goal of dismantling the Department of Education and returning its functions to the states. The tour starts in Louisiana, a state she highlights for its recent improvements in elementary literacy. The administration argues that states are better equipped to handle education policy and funding, while opponents warn that eliminating the department would disrupt federal student loan programs and grant distributions for low-income and special education students. Abolishing the department would ultimately require congressional approval, which remains unlikely.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared that gold will not be subject to tariffs, effectively reversing a recent ruling by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The customs agency had determined that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would face a 39% duty, a decision that caused gold futures to hit a record high. Following the president's announcement on social media, gold prices fell sharply. The Swiss Precious Metals Association had warned that the tariffs would have negatively impacted the international flow of physical gold, which is crucial for backing futures contracts.

His family had previously announced he had been battling cancer for over three years. Clarkson, who shares two children with Blackstock, had recently postponed several Las Vegas residency shows, citing the need to be present for her children during their father's illness.</p>
