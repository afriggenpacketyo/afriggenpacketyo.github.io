          <h2>Gary Cohn Discusses Economic Uncertainty and Tariff Impacts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 13:35:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, Gary Cohn, former director of the U.S. National Economic Council, addressed the current economic climate, noting a shift from euphoric excitement to realistic uncertainty. He highlighted consumer concerns about tariffs, leading to front-end buying of goods, and observed that while hard economic data appears solid, softer data like polling reveals weakness in consumer sentiment. Cohn pointed to major companies reporting earnings, indicating a potential slowdown in the second quarter, and emphasized the lag effect of tariffs on goods transportation, predicting noticeable impacts in late May. He also acknowledged the unsustainable trade relationship between the U.S. and China, noting the need for negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Qatar's prime minister announced that there has been a small amount of progress in brokering a new ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, though the central question of how to end the war remains unanswered. Hamas appears more open to a long-term solution involving the release of hostages and cessation of hostilities for at least five years, potentially including disarmament if Israel withdraws its forces. However, the Israeli government seems unwilling to withdraw its forces from Gaza, and imposed a complete blockade on Gaza in early March and resumed air and ground attacks later in the month. The U.S. has encouraged the idea of a reformed PA governing Gaza after the war.</p>

          <p>Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran executed a clean steal of home against the Cleveland Guardians, marking the first straight steal of home for a Red Sox player in 16 years. Duran attributed his decision to the third base coach overhearing that the pitcher would be working from the stretch, and he wanted to cause chaos and keep the offense going. Manager Alex Cora highlighted how the new rules benefit Duran's playing style, while the Guardians' manager acknowledged it was a heads-up play by Duran, taking advantage of the third baseman's positioning.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov defended Russia's military actions in Kyiv, stating that they only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military, contrary to President Trump's call to "STOP!".

Lavrov asserted that negotiations with the U.S. are ongoing and moving in the right direction, emphasizing the need to address the root causes of the conflict, including NATO expansion and the rights of national minorities in Ukraine, while denying any intention to release thousands of Ukrainian children at President Trump's request.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that President Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating in 80 years, with only 39% of respondents approving of his performance.

Despite these negative assessments, Trump still leads the Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems, and retains the support of the vast bulk of his voters.</p>

Trump suggested that President Putin may not want to stop the war and may need to be dealt with more firmly, potentially through new sanctions. This shift in tone has raised expectations that Trump may not force Ukraine into a lopsided peace agreement, which would have involved abandoning NATO aspirations and recognizing Crimea as Russian.</p>
