          <p>Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine, targeting numerous regions with missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and dozens of injuries. The overnight strikes mark the second large-scale assault in 48 hours, following a heavy assault on Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has condemned the attacks, calling for stronger international pressure on Russia, while rescuers are working in over 30 cities and villages. Ukraine's air force reported neutralizing a significant number of incoming missiles and UAVs, though many regions sustained damage, including residential buildings and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Texas House has given initial approval to a bill requiring sheriffs to collaborate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by serving federal immigration warrants at local jails. Senate Bill 8, amended to apply to all counties, aims to enhance border security, mandating sheriffs to seek partnerships with ICE through 287(g) agreements. These agreements authorize local law enforcement to question inmates about their immigration status and serve administrative warrants, while also potentially allowing officers to inquire about immigration status during routine police duties. The bill faces another House vote before potentially heading to Governor Abbott's desk for review.</p>

Speaking at a roundtable with young SDF members, Ishiba emphasized the government's responsibility to appropriately support those serving, particularly in light of recent scandals that have impacted public trust. This pledge follows the enactment of a revised law that includes new allowances for SDF members, as the government seeks to address a shortage of recruits.

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under Labour, with the initial nationalized service departing on time from Woking to Surbiton. The government has described this transition as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on service improvements and infrastructure investment, though immediate fare reductions are not guaranteed. The renationalized SWR will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval, and will be overseen by the Department for Transport in the interim. Unions have expressed concerns about outsourcing, while the opposition Conservatives are pressing Labour to fulfill its promises.</p>

          <p>The European Union is currently engaged in a trade dispute with China over electric vehicles, while simultaneously considering how to leverage Chinese investment in the sector. A debate is ongoing across the continent regarding whether China's expertise in the EV industry can create jobs or potentially harm existing European manufacturers. Windrose Technology, a Chinese company, recently announced plans to build a â‚¬175 million factory in France, signaling China's growing interest in European EV production. The company aims to produce 4,000 electric trucks annually in France starting in 2027, with ambitions for expansion into the American market.</p>

          <p>Sir Alan Bates, a former subpostmaster and advocate for victims of the Post Office scandal, has criticized the government's compensation offer, stating that it amounts to less than half of his claim.

Bates has called for the creation of an independent body to administer compensation schemes for public sector scandals, asserting that promises of a "non-legalistic" approach have proven worthless. The Department for Business and Trade maintains that they aim to give the benefit of the doubt to postmasters and that claimants can have their cases reviewed by experts.</p>

          <p>A virologist at the University of Nottingham has urged the public to remain calm following the detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, emphasizing that while the discovery warrants awareness, it is not cause for significant concern. The UK Health Security Agency found fragments of the virus in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, marking the first time it has been detected in the UK. Prof Jonathan Ball believes climate change will spread tropical diseases north. He noted that climate change is likely to increase the range of mosquito-borne diseases, leading to a greater risk of such viruses becoming established further north.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" report examines the case of Jason Corbett, who was murdered by his wife and her father, a former FBI agent, who claimed self-defense. Tom Martens told a 911 dispatcher that his son-in-law got into a fight with his daughter and he had to intervene, saying, "He's bleeding all over, and I, I may have killed him." Tracey Lynch, Jason Corbett's sister, disputes the claims that her brother was abusive and wanted to move home to Ireland. Molly Corbett and Tom Martens were arrested and charged with killing Jason Corbett and ultimately completed their sentences and were released from prison in June 2024.</p>
