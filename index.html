          <p>Monica Sementilli has been convicted for the 2017 murder of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, after a lengthy trial. Prosecutors successfully argued that she and her lover, Robert Baker, conspired to kill Fabio for financial motives, including a significant life insurance policy, and attempted to stage the crime as a "knock-knock" burglary. Evidence presented included extensive text communications, data showing Monica monitoring her home's security cameras from a Target store during the murder, and Baker's DNA at the scene. Despite her daughters' support and her defense's claim that Baker acted alone, the jury found her guilty, and she was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods have struck central Texas, resulting in at least 50 fatalities and an ongoing search for more than two dozen missing individuals. The majority of the missing are from Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp in Kerr County, which saw the Guadalupe River rise with unprecedented speed. Officials report that the dead include 28 adults and 15 children, with hundreds of people rescued, some from treetops, amid the deluge. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a federal disaster declaration to aid the extensive search and rescue operations, which involve over 160 air rescues, as the community grapples with the sudden and immense tragedy.</p>

          <h2>North Korean Man Crosses Heavily Fortified DMZ into South Korea</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 22:35:21 EDT</div>

          <p>An unarmed North Korean man successfully crossed the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), one of the world's most heavily guarded borders, and was taken into custody by South Korean troops. The man was tracked by soldiers who guided him through the mine-filled terrain before securing him. This rare and dangerous crossing comes as South Korea's liberal government, under President Lee Jae Myung, has been criticized for adopting a softer diplomatic stance toward Pyongyang. The incident highlights ongoing tensions and the desperate measures some North Koreans take to flee the regime, typically choosing routes through China rather than the perilous DMZ.</p>

          <p>Despite a dominant two-inning, three-strikeout performance from pitcher Shohei Ohtani on his 31st birthday, the Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Houston Astros 6-4. Ohtani's scoreless outing showed promise for the Dodgers' rotation, which anticipates the return of injured pitchers Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell. However, the bullpen struggled, with long reliever Justin Wrobleski giving up five runs, which proved decisive. The loss clinches a series defeat for the Dodgers, highlighting their current reliance on a tenuous pitching depth while they await the return of their key starters to form their envisioned star-studded rotation.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," delves into the writer's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the landscape that profoundly shaped his identity and work. Traveling incognito to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Samuel Clemens found the river and its towns both familiar and irrevocably changed, a poignant reflection of his own journey from a small-town boy to a world-renowned author. The experience of once again piloting a steamboat evoked a powerful sense of nostalgia and belonging, reinforcing how his youth remained the central touchstone of his life. Chernow's work examines the complexities of the man who defined a uniquely American voice in literature.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has introduced new regulations for its central commissions and leading groups, which could indicate that President Xi Jinping is delegating more power to his deputies. These new rules are designed to standardize the policy coordination and review process at the highest levels of government. According to state media, the Politburo emphasized that these top-level bodies should concentrate on major strategic matters, including planning and oversight. This shift in operational procedure has led some analysts to speculate that it might be part of a broader strategy, potentially even hinting at Xi's long-term succession plans.</p>

This new development follows the discovery of her remains in 2023 and a recent toxicology report that found a combination of tranquilizer drugs, known as BAM, in her bone marrow. Authorities state that Barry, an avid hunter, was the only private citizen in the area with access to this specific drug compound, which he had admitted to using on deer. The initial murder charges against him were dropped in 2022, but the new indictment presents compelling forensic evidence, leading to his rearrest and a $3 million cash bond.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country, known as Flash Flood Alley, is explained by the region's unique geography, which makes it one of the most dangerous places in the U.S. for such events. The area's steep hills, shallow soil, and rocky terrain cause rainwater to run off rapidly, quickly overwhelming creeks and rivers like the Guadalupe. This phenomenon, compounded by the Balcones Escarpment which can amplify downpours, leads to swift and massive surges of water. Experts note that Texas leads the nation in flood-related deaths, and they emphasize the need for better forecasting, public awareness, and infrastructure to mitigate the risks in this vulnerable region.</p>

Similar in concept to the Soviet-era Ekranoplans, this large, flying-boat-hulled aircraft is designed to fly efficiently just above the water's surface, making it fast, difficult to detect by radar, and immune to undersea threats. The craft, which appears to be undergoing testing, could be used for logistics, search and rescue, or even military applications in littoral zones like the South China Sea.

          <p>This article analyzes how President Donald Trump is employing the "Madman Theory" in foreign policy, using unpredictability as a strategic tool to coerce concessions from both allies and adversaries. This approach, characterized by contradictory statements and a highly centralized decision-making process, has successfully pressured NATO allies to significantly increase defense spending. However, critics question its long-term effectiveness, arguing it could undermine trust in the U.S. as a reliable partner and may not work against determined foes like Iran. The strategy appears to be reshaping global alliances, forcing nations like Germany to consider greater strategic independence from the United States.</p>

          <p>The article explores the divided opinions on Lifetime ISAs (LISAs), a UK savings product offering a 25% government bonus for first-time home buyers or retirement savings. While some users have successfully used the product to fund a home deposit, many others have faced significant penalties. Key criticisms center on the harsh 6.25% penalty on personal contributions if funds are withdrawn for unapproved reasons or if the home purchased exceeds the £450,000 price cap, a figure unchanged since 2017. Critics argue these rules are unjust and deter potential savers, calling for reforms to make the product fairer for young people in a challenging housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of runners participated in a 15-mile "Run Against ICE" through Los Angeles to protest federal immigration raids that have impacted communities across the city. The event was organized to show solidarity with immigrants and to call for an end to aggressive enforcement tactics by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The route wound through significant immigrant neighborhoods like Koreatown and Chinatown, past the detention center where detainees are held. Participants expressed outrage and defiance, highlighting the fear and disruption the raids have caused, particularly for the Latino community, and emphasizing a sense of duty to stand up for those affected.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the deadly Texas floods, chronicling the sequence of weather warnings and the rapid escalation of the disaster. The Texas Division of Emergency Management activated resources on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a flood watch on Thursday. However, the situation turned critical early Friday morning, with the NWS issuing increasingly urgent warnings, culminating in a rare "flash flood emergency" alert. Despite these alerts, local officials and residents were caught off guard by the Guadalupe River's surge, raising questions about the effectiveness of the warning systems and the predictability of such an extreme weather event.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to public health and scientific research funding by the Trump administration are impacting the fight against HIV in the United States. While the goal to eliminate HIV by 2030, set during Trump's first term, remains, experts like former CDC official Dr. John Brooks worry that the new focus is too narrow. He states that funding for crucial prevention research, including work on a vaccine and a cure, has been significantly reduced. This shift could jeopardize the great strides made in recent years, which saw a 12% decline in new infections, and may lead to a future increase in HIV cases if prevention efforts are not adequately supported.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has officially resigned from Congress, further shrinking the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives. With his departure, the GOP majority is now 219-212, which could create additional challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson in passing legislation. Green, who chaired the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on helping the U.S. compete against China. His resignation was expected but comes at a critical time, highlighting the precarious nature of the Republican hold on the House until his solidly red seat is filled.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order aimed at curbing the influence of Chinese drone manufacturers in the U.S. market, part of an ongoing effort to address national security concerns. However, analysts and industry insiders suggest that removing Chinese products from supply chains will be difficult and costly. Chinese firms, such as DJI, dominate the global drone market, and there are few non-Chinese alternatives available that can compete on price and technology. This move is seen by some as a negotiation tactic, but it creates uncertainty for businesses that rely on Chinese-made drones for commercial applications like inspections and surveying.</p>

          <p>An email from the Social Security Administration (SSA) claiming that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most seniors is being blasted as misleading and partisan. Critics and former SSA officials point out that the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher-income individuals. The communication from the typically apolitical agency has been called a "lie" and "unconscionable," with observers noting it sounds more like a political statement than an official government communication. The incident has raised concerns about the politicization of federal agencies under the Trump administration.</p>

The conflict, which began with a surprise Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, resulted in over 900 deaths in Iran.

          <p>A new study reveals that exposure to high heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy can negatively impact fetal growth, leading to smaller babies. Researchers found that exposure during the first trimester, and even the month before conception, was linked to infants being smaller in the womb. The effect was nearly doubled for women living in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods, which are often hotter and have less access to air conditioning or air filtration. Health experts are calling for greater awareness of these climate-related risks for pregnant people, advising simple precautions like staying cool, hydrated, and wearing a mask during smoke events.</p>

The announcement follows a public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump, primarily over Trump's recent major spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed.
