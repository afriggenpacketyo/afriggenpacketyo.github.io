          <p>A summary of UK newspaper headlines highlights several key stories, including the resignation of homelessness minister Rushanara Ali over allegations of rental 'hypocrisy'. The papers also cover the late-breaking news of Israel's plan to take over Gaza City, marking a major escalation in the conflict. In other news, new guidance is reportedly being prepared that would advise schools and hospitals to ban transgender women from single-sex spaces. Additionally, a new daily obesity pill, orforglipron, is featured prominently after trials showed significant weight loss, with potential availability on the NHS next year.</p>

          <p>The agency responsible for courts in England and Wales, HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS), is facing accusations of a cover-up regarding a significant IT bug. A leaked internal report revealed that for years, a software flaw caused evidence in civil, family, and tribunal cases to be lost, overwritten, or hidden. Sources claim judges made rulings based on incomplete information, but management chose not to inform them to avoid causing more harm. While HMCTS states no case outcomes were affected, a former senior judge called the situation a "shocking scandal," drawing comparisons to the Post Office Horizon crisis.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan for the military to occupy Gaza City, signaling a significant expansion of its operations nearly 23 months into the war. The decision comes amid widespread international condemnation over the severe humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. The stated goals include disarming Hamas, securing the release of all hostages, and establishing a new civil administration that is not the Palestinian Authority. This move has drawn criticism from hostage families who fear for their loved ones' safety and from Hamas, which accused Prime Minister Netanyahu of sabotaging ceasefire negotiations.</p>

Guard Julie Allemand was instrumental, recording a rare triple-double with 10 points, 11 assists, and 11 rebounds, becoming the 22nd player in WNBA history to achieve the feat.

          <p>China's foreign ministry has warned the Philippines to stop "playing with fire" following comments from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. about the nation's proximity to Taiwan. Marcos had stated that the Philippines could not stay out of a potential conflict over Taiwan due to its geographic location. Beijing responded by accusing the Philippines of reneging on its promises, undermining the one-China principle, and damaging regional peace and stability. China considers Taiwan an internal affair and firmly opposes any external interference, viewing the island as a renegade province to be reunified by force if necessary.</p>

          <p>Shares for Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high following a fiscal first-quarter profit report that significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company announced a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp reversal from the loss reported in the same period last year. This growth was largely driven by a $4.8 billion increase in the value of its Vision Funds, marking their largest gain since 2021. The positive performance was attributed to gains from investments in both private and publicly listed companies like Grab and Swiggy. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is part of the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force" established by an executive order in March.

This marks the fourth court decision to block the policy since a key Supreme Court ruling in June, which limited the scope of such nationwide injunctions but left open other legal avenues. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their claim that the order violates the 14th Amendment.

          <p>New research confirms that California's fire season is beginning earlier and lasting longer than it did in the 1990s, a shift primarily driven by human-caused climate change. The study, published in Science Advances, found that in some regions like the Cascade Range, the season now starts 46 days earlier. Researchers attribute this change to earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of flammable vegetation as average temperatures rise, rather than an increase in human-ignited fires. The findings quantify what many residents have anecdotally observed, linking the extended threat of wildfires directly to warming climate and meteorological conditions.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, which was later confirmed by experts. This sighting is part of the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe over the past two decades, a movement that has been linked to a warming climate. While its colonization of Northern Europe has occurred much faster than models predicted, it remains uncertain whether the species will establish a long-term breeding population in the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. This move revives a contentious issue from his first term, when his administration's attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court. The Constitution mandates an "actual enumeration" every ten years to determine the number of congressional seats for each state, a process that has historically counted all residents regardless of citizenship status. Changing this could have massive repercussions on political representation and federal funding distribution across the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, causing the technology company's stock to slide. In a social media post, Trump described the CEO as "highly conflicted" but did not provide specific details for his demand. The call follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton to Intel's chairman, expressing concern over Tan's reported investments in and ties to numerous Chinese companies, including some with alleged connections to the Chinese military. Tan, a veteran of the semiconductor industry, was appointed as Intel's CEO in March of this year.</p>

          <p>The man who killed four people in a New York City shooting last month had been placed on two emergency psychiatric holds in Las Vegas but was still able to legally purchase the AR-15-style rifle he used. Police records show Shane Tamura's mother had reported him as suicidal and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. However, under Nevada law, these temporary 72-hour holds are not automatically reported to the national background check system (NICS) unless they result in a court-ordered involuntary commitment. Experts note this gap in the law highlights inconsistencies in how states handle mental health crises and firearm prohibitions.</p>

The U.S. Justice Department maintains the yacht was owned by Suleiman Kerimov, who was sanctioned for his role in advancing Russia's malign activities. The sealed-bid auction requires a $10 million deposit and is part of a broader U.S. effort to pressure Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin in response to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that Americans get an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods, which are low in fiber and whole ingredients but high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats, are consumed at even higher rates by young people, at nearly 62% of their caloric intake. The report identified top sources as sandwiches, burgers, sweet bakery products, and sweetened beverages. This data comes as research continues to link high consumption of ultra-processed foods to numerous negative health outcomes, including heart disease, cancer, and obesity.</p>

Social media posts highlighted fears that the tool could be exploited by stalkers or abusers. Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded by stating the company was investigating, but initial checks suggested users were confused by seeing their own location on the map, not that it was being broadcast publicly.</p>

The most common side effects were gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting.
