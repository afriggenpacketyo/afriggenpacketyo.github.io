          <p>Microsoft has offered to unbundle its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites from its Teams workplace communication app in an effort to address competition concerns raised by European regulators. The European Commission is scrutinizing Microsoft's tying of Teams with its popular Office productivity suite, following a legal claim made by Slack in 2020. Microsoft has committed to making versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 available without Teams at a reduced price, as well as allowing customers to switch to the tools without Teams, even under existing contracts. Microsoft also committed to offer Teams' competitors increased interoperability with other Microsoft products and let customers move their data out of Teams to competing products.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike, resulting in a complete shutdown of NJ Transit rail service and Metro-North's west of Hudson service, impacting over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike stems from a dispute between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) over pay raises, with the union claiming workers haven't received a raise in five years. NJ Transit suggests commuters work from home if possible, and Governor Phil Murphy indicates all options are being considered, including a state of emergency. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan involving additional bus service on 19 routes, but this plan is expected to accommodate only about 20% of daily train riders.</p>

The talks follow a period of posturing and brinkmanship, with both sides presenting differing views on the seriousness and organization of the discussions.</p>

          <p>Arab Gulf states are pulling out all the stops to deepen ties with the U.S. and advance their economic agendas during President Trump's visit. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange," Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and the UAE committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework. Trump's motorcade in Qatar was escorted by Tesla cybertrucks, and he was welcomed with a parade of royal camels. The warm reception and large-scale deals highlight the Gulf states' desire to partner with the U.S. in business, military, and technology.</p>

          <p>China's military is raising concerns about the US Space Force's plan to deploy "orbital carriers," warning that it could escalate the arms race in space. A PLA expert pointed to a US$60 million contract awarded to develop an orbital transport craft, stating it would boost US war-fighting strength but also intensify military rivalry and threaten space security. The PLA Daily commentary cited design specifications suggesting the craft could carry up to 10,000kg of payload, enabling rapid offensive or defensive operations. The commentary also said because of this dual-use potential, “such ambiguity has triggered warnings that demand heightened vigilance from all spacefaring nations”.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 25% tariff on imported cars has raised concerns about General Motors' (GM) future in South Korea, where it produces budget SUVs almost exclusively for the U.S. market. Unlike Hyundai and Kia, which dominate the domestic market, GM is uniquely exposed to the tariffs, potentially leading to the company's departure from the country. Experts suggest the tariffs could add $10,000 to the sticker price of cars shipped to the U.S., making GM's operations in South Korea unsustainable.</p>

The shape of the bill creates a tiny tornado as it pulls out of the water. The swirling stirs up prey and traps it long enough for the bird to duck back in and scoop it up. The study finds that flamingos' webbed toes create a pair of vortices that push food towards their bills.</p>
