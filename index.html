          <p>Columbia University has begun disciplining dozens of students for their roles in pro-Palestinian campus protests this spring, which included the occupation of a library building. The punishments range from probation to multi-year suspensions and outright expulsions, following individual case reviews. The university stated that disruptions to its academic mission violate policies and will have consequences. These actions are part of a broader effort by Columbia to reform its policies, including adopting a new definition of antisemitism, in an attempt to restore federal funding that was cut amid pressure over its handling of the protests.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, experienced significant gains following reports that the U.S. would lower tariffs on imported vehicles from 25% to 15%. Toyota's stock jumped over 15%, while others like Nissan and Mazda also saw substantial increases, reflecting investor relief. This development is crucial for Japan's economy, as auto exports to the U.S. represent a major component of its trade. The move provides short-term assurance to an industry that had seen exports decline under the previous tariff structure and faces growing competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to the latest Henley Passport Index, Singapore once again holds the title for the world's most powerful passport, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 destinations. Japan and South Korea ranked second, while several European nations filled out the top spots. The index, which measures travel freedom based on data from the International Air Transport Association, highlights a continued decline for the United States and United Kingdom passports, which have slipped to 10th and 6th place, respectively. This marks a long-term downward trend for the two countries that once dominated the top of the rankings.</p>

          <p>For the first time, several of the UK's top security agencies, including MI5 and Counter Terrorism Policing, have issued a joint warning to parents about the risk of children being radicalized online during the summer holidays. The agencies report an increasing trend of young people being exposed to extreme content, including violence, self-harm, and terrorist material, leading to desensitization. Authorities are urging parents to discuss online safety with their children and utilize parental controls. The warning comes as statistics show a concerning rise in terrorism-related investigations and arrests involving minors in recent years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a major trade deal with Japan, establishing a "reciprocal" tariff rate of 15% on Japanese exports, a reduction from the previous 25% on automobiles. President Trump touted the agreement as potentially the "largest Deal ever made," claiming it includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and will open Japanese markets to more American goods. The deal provides a significant political boost for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose leadership has been under pressure. The announcement spurred a rally in Japanese markets, particularly for auto industry stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

In a rare move, the judges appointed her top assistant, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office. However, hours later, the Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, ousted Grace, accusing the judges of a politically motivated action that threatened presidential powers.

The case was marked by intense media scrutiny and online speculation that deeply affected the small college town of Moscow. Investigators ultimately pieced the case together using evidence such as cell phone data, surveillance footage of his car, and DNA found on a knife sheath at the crime scene.</p>

An economist from the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained in local supply chains, Chinese firms can establish legitimate origins for their products.

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a remarkable history. Researchers used a combination of tree-ring dating and archival records to determine the ship was originally HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in 1749. The ship served during the sieges of Quebec and the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as an Arctic whaling vessel. It ultimately wrecked in a storm in 1788, with all crew surviving, and its discovery has been a major community-driven archaeological project.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama's office issued a rare and forceful rebuttal to President Trump's accusation that he committed "treason" related to the 2016 Russia investigation. Trump claimed Obama led a "coup" to undermine his presidency, a charge Obama's spokesperson called "outrageous," "bizarre," and a "weak attempt at distraction." The statement affirmed that nothing in recently declassified documents undercuts the established intelligence community consensus that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Trump's allegations stem from a report by his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, which has been criticized for misrepresenting intelligence findings.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man has been charged with 37 counts of attempted murder after allegedly driving his car into a crowd outside an East Hollywood nightclub, injuring dozens. Authorities say the suspect, Fernando Ramirez, had been ejected from the Vermont Hollywood nightclub shortly before the incident. At least 36 people were injured, with eight suffering serious fractures, in what the District Attorney called a "miracle" that no one was killed. After the crash, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the vehicle and assaulted him; he was hospitalized in stable condition, and police are seeking the person who shot him during the altercation.</p>

The incident is reminiscent of similar freezing episodes experienced by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2023.

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is deliberately purging women from the U.S. military's senior leadership. The article points to the recent reassignments of multiple high-ranking female officers, including the first female heads of the Naval Academy, the Coast Guard, and the chief of naval operations. The author suggests this pattern aligns with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's previously stated views that a focus on gender equality is "social engineering" that undermines the military. The piece concludes that these actions send a "chilling message" that women are not welcome in top roles, despite their essential contributions.</p>
