            <p>The El Salvadorian government has rejected a request from four Democratic lawmakers to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant wrongly deported from the U.S. despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation. The lawmakers aimed to meet with Abrego Garcia after Senator Chris Van Hollen's visit. Abrego Garcia was deported in March and is being held at the Centro Industrial penitentiary facility in Santa Ana. U.S. State Department officials report he is in good health, while his family denies allegations of his MS-13 affiliation.</p>

            <p>A federal court in Denver heard arguments in a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. Immigrants' rights groups argue that the 24-hour notice given to those facing deportation is insufficient for them to fight their orders, violating their due process rights. The ACLU argues that even alleged Nazis were afforded more rights after World War II. The Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportations, prompting legal battles over migrants' rights to challenge the government's allegations before removal.</p>

            <p>Chinese universities are leading the world in research on chip design and fabrication, producing much of the basic research that could influence next-generation semiconductor technology.

The United States, the second-largest producer of research on chip design, did not have any institutions in the top 10 lists for total articles published or most-cited articles.</p>
