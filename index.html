          <p>Best Buy has lowered its sales and profit projections for fiscal year 2026, citing increased costs due to tariffs on consumer electronics. The company has already raised prices on some items in mid-May as a last resort to offset these expenses, though the specific items affected were not disclosed for competitive reasons. CEO Corie Barry emphasized the company's need to remain adaptable amidst evolving global trade policies, especially after a federal trade court struck down many of Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Experts are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) in June, considering factors such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies and market uncertainty. Short-term CDs currently offer more competitive annual percentage yields (APY) than longer-term options. While long-term CDs provide a fixed interest rate for an extended period, short-term CDs offer higher rates and earlier maturity dates, making them potentially more advantageous in the current economic climate. A CD ladder strategy, involving multiple CDs with varying maturity dates, can also be a useful approach in this environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a U.S. court blocked some of President Trump's tariffs, the administration is exploring various legal avenues to circumvent the ruling. Goldman Sachs economists suggest that Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930 could be utilized. Section 122 could quickly replace the blocked tariffs, while Section 301 investigations and Section 232 tariffs could be broadened to other sectors. Legal experts also suggest the possibility of the Supreme Court ultimately deciding the issue, given the lack of precedent on the statute in question.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article argues that the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision to strike down most of President Trump's tariffs is a vindication of the rule of law. The court's ruling emphasizes that neither the Constitution nor any statute authorizes Trump to impose the tariffs he ordered. Critics' claims of judicial overreach are weak due to the Constitution's delegation of tariff power to Congress, the involvement of states in the lawsuit, and the court's specific jurisdiction over trade disputes. The article suggests that the administration's criticism of the judiciary indicates contempt for any check on presidential power.</p>

          <p>As Harvard University students and their families gathered for commencement, a legal battle unfolded in a Boston federal courthouse over the Trump administration's attempt to strip Harvard of its ability to enroll international students. A federal judge set a hearing to decide whether to extend an order blocking the policy, which Harvard argues is retaliatory and violates its First Amendment rights. DHS officials claim the revocation was necessary because Harvard failed to provide requested information about international students. Trump has suggested capping international students at 15% of the school's total student body.</p>

The plan includes a new amphitheater, tiered gardens, and a pool, responding to desires expressed by local residents. By demolishing a stretch of the garage wall along Amsterdam Avenue, the project aims to integrate the park with the community.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. court's decision to block some of President Trump's tariffs, America's trade partners have reacted with caution rather than celebration. While the ruling may restrain Washington's assault on world markets, economists note that Trump could pursue other legal avenues to enact tariffs. The court's decision does not roll back sector-specific tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum, leaving the possibility of continued negotiations on these sectors. The fragility of the reprieve guarantees continued chaos, with countries planning for the worst while hoping for the best.</p>

          <p>Harvard and Trump administration lawyers are set to argue in court over the administration's attempt to ban the university from enrolling international students. Harvard's strategy will use President Trump's statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school, arguing that officials have unjustly singled out the university for punishment, violating its First Amendment rights. The ban would affect 7,000 students at Harvard, and the case could have implications beyond Harvard, further deterring international interest in studying in the United States.</p>
