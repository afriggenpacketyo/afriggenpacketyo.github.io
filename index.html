          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Muscat for the fourth round of indirect talks with the United States regarding Tehran's nuclear program. Araghchi expressed hope for a "decisive" outcome but emphasized that Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful and non-negotiable, particularly enrichment, for which he stated Iranian scientists sacrificed their lives. He also noted the constant changes in the American position as a challenge in the negotiations. The talks are resuming ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East, adding geopolitical significance to the discussions.</p>

          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have promised President Trump huge investments into the US, but at the same time, the price of oil is falling. Lower oil prices present a challenge to Middle Eastern nations who depend on oil for their national income. "There have been very impressive [Saudi] reforms in the last decade," said Tim Callen, a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington and expert on Gulf states' economies. "But oil is still the heartbeat of the economy so when oil goes lower, it creates an environment that is not as favorable as when they are higher.</p>

          <p>Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, there have been many attempts to implement a lasting end to the violence of its ongoing war in Ukraine. All have been unsuccessful. Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed a new round of ceasefire negotiations in Istanbul on May 15. No lasting ceasefire has been achieved since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 22, 2022, but the conflict has seen several short-term agreements put in place. Both nations have repeatedly accused each other of violating these agreements, as well as ceasefires declared by just one side.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing increasing polarization and debating how to handle the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) party, which has been classified as "confirmed right-wing extremist" by the German domestic intelligence service. A key question is whether to consider banning the AfD, with opponents fearing further social division and supporters arguing that enemies of democracy should not be in a position to destroy it. Experts suggest journalists should adapt their reporting to make it clearer that the AfD is not a normal party within the democratic spectrum.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Israel announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies back into Gaza after a ten-week Israeli ban, but top aid groups object to the idea. The proposed solution would only provide food and aid to around 60 percent of Gaza's civilians initially. Key details remain unresolved, like who would run it or pay for it. The main aid organizations working in Gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal, as presented by Israeli officials to the U.N. and its aid partners. Humanitarian groups say they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it, even belligerents.</p>

          <p>India's military strikes into Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan killed more than 100 militants, India's director general of military operations said. His comments came just one day after India and Pakistan reached a ceasefire agreement following U.S.-led mediation talks. The two countries agreed to a truce after talks with high-ranking U.S. officials to defuse the most serious military confrontation between them in decades. But the ceasefire was shaken just hours later by overnight fighting in disputed Kashmir, and both sides accused each other of repeatedly violating the deal.</p>

          <p>A fragile truce between India and Pakistan appeared to be largely holding on its first full day after some initial skirmishing, as both countries turned on Sunday to making the case that they had come out on top in the four-day conflict. President Trump announced on Saturday that the two sides had agreed to a cease-fire with the help of U.S. mediation. India made no reference to an American role, presumably in part because it hoped to avoid any domestic perception that it had stopped its fight against its neighbor and archenemy under outside pressure.</p>

The Ukrainian leader’s comments came hours after Mr. Putin effectively rejected a cease-fire and instead proposed that direct talks between representatives of the two countries take place on May 15 in Istanbul. President Trump questioned whether either side wanted to make a deal but urged both sides to meet this week in Turkey for talks.</p>

Harry’s emotional plea to be reconciled with his family — made in a recent interview with the BBC, in which he mused about how long his cancer-stricken father had left to live — resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed.</p>

On Sunday, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, ABC reported that the Trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, a jumbo jet from the Qatari royals that was estimated to be about $400m. Trump would then use the 13-year-old plane as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of his second Oval Office stint, at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 January 2029.</p>

What could have been a refreshingly expansive view of motherhood instead ended up feeling retrograde. The undeniable undercurrent was: Watch out for moms who think about sex—and be sure to shut them down.</p>

If Chelsea win the Conference League but do not qualify for the Champions League, Maresca must expect this season to be judged as failure, however harsh that judgement may seem. Nicolas Jackson's indiscipline will now mean he will miss those pivotal final games that could shape so many futures at Stamford Bridge.</p>
