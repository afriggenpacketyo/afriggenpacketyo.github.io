          <p>An independent investigation into the BBC's "MasterChef" program has upheld 45 allegations against presenter Gregg Wallace, including claims of inappropriate sexual language, unwelcome physical contact, and racist comments. The inquiry, initiated by production company Banijay after a BBC News report, reviewed 83 total allegations. In response, Wallace has been dismissed from the show, and the BBC has stated it has no plans for future work with him. The report also noted Wallace's recent autism diagnosis, a point he had previously linked to the claims.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a significant overnight attack on Ukraine, deploying 136 drones and four missiles, with Ukrainian air defenses neutralizing 108 of the drones. The assault occurred shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to provide Kyiv with additional Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to bolster its defenses. Trump emphasized that the sophisticated military equipment would be fully paid for by European allies. The development comes as U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg visits Kyiv to discuss defense and security cooperation.</p>

Political scientists note that while polarization is not new, the GOP has moved significantly rightward, redefining moderation as any deviation from Trump's agenda.

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing analyst expectations, largely due to strong shipments to regions like Southeast Asia and the European Union. While exports to the U.S. continued to decline, the rate of decrease slowed amid a temporary tariff truce. Imports also saw their first year-over-year increase of 2025, climbing 1.1%, though this was below forecasts. The data reflects a complex trade environment, with China successfully diversifying its export destinations while still facing uncertainty from its trade relationship with the United States.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, breaking the $120,000 mark, driven by strong institutional interest and significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally is also being fueled by anticipation of clearer regulatory frameworks in the United States, as lawmakers prepare for a "Crypto Week" to deliberate on several digital asset bills. Analysts suggest that growing institutional adoption is a key factor behind the sustained momentum, with some predicting further appreciation in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

The partnership has raised concerns in the West and South Korea, which estimates that North Korea has already supplied Russia with approximately 12 million artillery shells.

Environmental experts point to a warming atmosphere holding more moisture, leading to more frequent and intense downpours like the one that devastated the region. This article explores how the disaster's impact may have been exacerbated by the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies like the National Weather Service, potentially hindering forecasting and emergency coordination.

          <p>An undercover investigation by BBC Panorama has revealed dubious sales tactics at Connells and Purplebricks, two of the UK's largest estate agencies. At a Connells branch, an agent appeared to sideline a cash buyer in favor of one using the company's in-house mortgage service, a deal potentially worth more to the company. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged that staff were incentivized to secure price reductions on properties that may have been deliberately overvalued to win business.
