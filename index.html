          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy project of the 2024 Olympics. Three supervised swimming zones, complete with amenities, have been established following a €1.4 billion investment to improve water quality, which had been dangerously polluted since 1923. The initiative aims to enhance the quality of life for residents and adapt the city to climate change. Water quality will be continuously monitored to ensure safety for swimmers enjoying the river during the summer.</p>

          <p>Former Wolves captain Conor Coady shared a heartfelt tribute to Diogo Jota, who tragically died in a car accident, describing him as a "fantastic human being" and a "dream to work with." Coady reminisced about Jota's immediate impact at Wolves, his tenacity, and his crucial role in the team's success, including their promotion to the Premier League. He emphasized that Jota was not only a remarkable footballer but an even better teammate and friend whose loss has deeply affected everyone.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 02:20:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's rugby team started their New Zealand tour with a hard-fought 29-26 win against the Maori All Blacks in Whangarei. In a tightly contested match where both sides scored four tries, a first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately proved to be the deciding factor. Despite being out-possessed, Scotland's clinical attack and a massive defensive stand in the final moments allowed them to clinch the victory. The non-capped international served as a stern test for a predominantly second-string Scottish side, marking a successful start to their first tour in the country in 25 years.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation into Bangor Cathedral has uncovered allegations of a "binge drinking culture" and inappropriate behavior, including a "seven last shots of Christ" drinking game on Good Friday. Former choir members described an environment where excessive alcohol consumption was common and raised concerns about blurred sexual boundaries and inadequate safeguarding for children. These revelations follow the early retirement of the Archbishop of Wales, Andrew John, after critical reports highlighted governance failures. The Church in Wales acknowledged the issues and stated it is developing a new policy regarding alcohol use.</p>

          <p>A devastating flash flood in Texas has led to the deaths of at least 24 people, with a major search and rescue operation underway for many others, including up to 25 girls from a Christian summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in under an hour, catching communities by surprise over the holiday weekend. Officials have declared a state of emergency, noting that forecasts underestimated the rainfall and the area lacks a dedicated flood warning system. The tragedy has prompted a pledge of federal assistance from the White House.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's proposed "liberation day" tariffs is set to expire, raising concerns about a potential trade assault on dozens of countries and its impact on the U.S. economy. Despite claims that 90 deals would be struck during the pause, only a few narrow agreements have materialized, leaving businesses and investors uncertain. Economists warn that even existing tariffs are contributing to inflation, with analysis suggesting significant costs for mid-sized businesses. The administration's strategy continues to create market volatility, with the Federal Reserve noting that consumers will ultimately bear the cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite over a million people expected at Pride in London, the event and others across the UK are facing a precarious future due to falling corporate sponsorships and volunteer numbers. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that a majority of Pride organizations have seen reduced funding, leading some to cancel, scale back, or charge for previously free events. Organizers attribute the decline partly to a shift in corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies, particularly from US-based companies. Despite these challenges, community organizers remain resilient and committed to continuing the tradition of Pride.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. They achieved this by activating a "genetic switch" that controls the production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development and repair. The study, published in the journal Science, suggests this mechanism for regeneration might exist in other organs and was likely disabled during evolution. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings offer new hope and a promising direction for future research into organ regeneration.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece from The Guardian critiques the media's intense focus on controversies like the punk band Bob Vylan's "Death to the IDF" chant at Glastonbury. The author argues that this "Vylanising" of the discourse serves as a diversion from the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the death toll continues to rise. The article suggests that framing opposition to Israeli military actions as inherently antisemitic denies the observable reality for many who are horrified by the violence. It concludes that this strategy is increasingly ineffective as public opinion, especially among younger people, grows more sympathetic to Palestinians.</p>

Critics argue that the government honors the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory against Japan while simultaneously downplaying the ROC's historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This approach aligns with the ruling DPP's emphasis on a distinct Taiwanese identity, separate from mainland China.

          <p>Several beaches in Queens, New York City, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. The city's emergency management agency utilized drones to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure public safety, with officials confirming sightings near Far Rockaway. The closures were brief, and authorities reopened the beaches after confirming the area was safe. This incident comes as New York state officials have been increasing shark surveillance measures at Long Island beaches ahead of the busy holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>As the United States targets China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, rivals South Korea and Japan are stepping up efforts to support their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has described its industry as being in a "major crisis" and has outlined policies to support it. The new guidelines focus on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and personnel training. The move reflects a broader geopolitical and economic competition to lead the global shipbuilding market in an era of shifting trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a last-ditch legal effort to stop the deportation of eight men to South Sudan, a country currently embroiled in civil war. The men, who have criminal convictions in the U.S., were scheduled for removal by the Trump administration as part of a campaign to deter immigration. Lawyers for the men argued they would face "perilous conditions," as even the U.S. government advises against travel to the war-torn nation. The ruling is the latest development in a legal battle over the administration's aggressive deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A large protest in Mexico City against the impacts of mass tourism and gentrification escalated into violence, with some demonstrators vandalizing businesses and harassing tourists.

Protesters demanded stricter housing laws and regulations on platforms like Airbnb. The demonstration highlights growing local frustration over the rising cost of living and the displacement of longtime residents in Mexico's capital.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed a comprehensive tax and spending bill into law during a Fourth of July event at the White House. The legislation introduces significant tax cuts, increases defense spending, and provides more aggressive funding for immigration enforcement. While the president promoted the bill as a catalyst for economic growth, it has faced strong opposition from Democrats. Critics warn that the law will disproportionately benefit the wealthy while negatively impacting lower-income Americans, calling its passage a "dark day" for the nation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell towed vehicles after just 15 days, a practice critics label as predatory. Residents in working-class neighborhoods report being targeted by operators who tow cars for minor infractions like expired registrations, leaving owners with little time to pay hefty fees to retrieve their property. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of targeting specific apartment complexes to seize and sell vehicles. The law disproportionately affects lower-income individuals who may struggle to produce the required funds on short notice, leading to the loss of essential transportation.</p>
