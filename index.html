        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is developing a compensation plan for victims of mis-sold car finance, with initial payouts anticipated next year. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions are not inherently unlawful, excessively large ones can be deemed unfair. The proposed scheme, estimated to cost the industry between £9 and £18 billion, will likely offer affected motorists less than £950 per deal for agreements dating back to 2007. The FCA will consult on eligibility and compensation amounts starting in October. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are introducing a variety of new spicy menu items to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. This trend allows brands like Chipotle, Taco Bell, and Wendy's to create buzz and drive sales with relatively low-cost additions like sauces and seasonings. According to market research, 95% of restaurants now feature at least one spicy option, as it is an effective strategy to re-engage consumers amid slower spending. The trend is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where taste tests and challenges go viral.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and steadfast ally of Donald Trump, to the position of U.S. Attorney for Washington D.C. The confirmation passed with a 50-45 vote, strictly along party lines. Pirro, a former New York district attorney and judge, was a prominent media personality who supported claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Her appointment continues a trend of Trump loyalists with media backgrounds joining the administration, and it has drawn criticism from Democrats who question her impartiality and cite her "blind obedience" to the president.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has reported that an Israeli military strike on its headquarters in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed one of its workers and injured three others. The humanitarian group stated the attack was deliberate, as the building was clearly marked with the protective red emblem and its location was known to the Israeli military. The strike caused a significant fire and heavy damage to the facility. This incident has prompted renewed calls from the UN Human Rights office for the protection of all humanitarian workers and an independent investigation into their continued killings in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian-American man, Khamis Ayyad, has died from smoke inhalation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank village of Silwad. His death occurred after Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to homes and vehicles in the area, according to the Palestinian health ministry and U.S. officials who confirmed the death. This incident marks the second death of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank in three weeks amid a surge in settler violence. The U.S. State Department offered condolences and consular assistance, condemning "criminal violence by any party" and underscoring the escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore references to Donald Trump's two impeachments in its National Museum for American History exhibit in the coming weeks. The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard detailing the impeachments was removed, sparking fears of historical censorship. In a statement, the Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not the result of pressure from any administration. The updated presentation will be integrated into the existing section on the limits of presidential power, alongside materials on other impeached presidents.</p>

He also confirmed that tariffs are being used to address non-trade issues, such as Canada's stance on Palestinian statehood and what the administration calls "lawfare" in Brazil regarding the prosecution of former president Bolsonaro.

          <p>Germany's birth rate has fallen to a historic low of 1.35 children per woman, fueling debate about the country's economic future and societal values. Experts attribute the decline to multiple crises, including the pandemic, climate change, and inflation, which create uncertainty for young people. While some women are choosing to be child-free, research indicates a "fertility gap," where many people desire more children than they have, often due to a lack of support.

Psychologists note that Trump frequently digresses, confabulates stories, and has trouble completing thoughts, a stark deterioration from his articulation in past decades.

          <p>For couples facing marital instability without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies to protect personal finances. The first is to proactively gather comprehensive information about all shared assets, liabilities, and accounts while access is still readily available. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys suggest that clearly defining financial boundaries can provide security and prevent more significant conflicts in the future.

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific calming and validating phrases can effectively manage children's tantrums. Instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help a child feel safe and understood. This connection-based approach soothes the child's nervous system and teaches emotional regulation. The goal is to set compassionate boundaries, acknowledging the emotion while stopping harmful actions, which helps prevent future meltdowns by building trust and emotional security.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it is working "at pace" on a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical care in the UK. The initiative, expected to be operational within weeks, could allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the country for free treatment. This move follows a Foreign Affairs Committee report criticizing the government's previous refusal to support such evacuations. A British charity, Project Pure Hope, which has already privately funded treatment for three Gazan children, welcomed the plan and offered its expertise to help the government scheme succeed.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across the region on Saturday night, including in New York City and its suburbs. This is the second seismic event to strike the state in less than two weeks. While the quake was relatively weak and caused no immediate reports of damage, officials warned residents about the possibility of aftershocks. Geologists note that New Jersey's Ramapo Fault line produces several small quakes annually, though a stronger 4.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2024 was felt by millions and caused some minor damage.</p>

          <p>The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is gaining traction, encouraging people to achieve retirement decades ahead of schedule through aggressive saving and mindful spending. Proponents like Nik and Adinah Johnson, who retired in their forties, emphasize consuming less and investing wisely to build a nest egg large enough to live off its returns. The philosophy, popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and authors like Vicki Robin, focuses on defining what is "enough" for a happy life. It encourages individuals to view money as "life energy" and to buy their freedom with daily frugality.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that focusing on individual high-profile sexual abuse cases, such as those involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, obscures the reality of a systemic pandemic of violence against women. The author contends that these are not shocking aberrations but part of a pervasive pattern rooted in misogyny that serves to maintain inequality. The piece notes that a sexual assault occurs every 68 seconds in the US and that this constant threat broadly impacts all women's lives, suggesting the solution requires deep social change, not just prosecuting individual perpetrators.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, despite being one of the highest-paid athletes, revealed he does not know his exact net worth and prefers to focus on building a meaningful investment portfolio. Financial professionals view this approach positively, suggesting that fixating on a single number can be less productive than focusing on cash flow and values-aligned financial goals. Experts advise that understanding daily income and expenses is more powerful for creating an actionable financial plan. They encourage setting tangible goals that bring a sense of pride and accomplishment, rather than chasing an ever-increasing net worth figure.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died after a boat collided with it in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. The collision, which occurred Saturday afternoon, nearly capsized the vessel and sent a passenger overboard, though the person was recovered safely. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found resting on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions, crews will wait until Monday to tow the carcass to a nearby state park for a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death.
