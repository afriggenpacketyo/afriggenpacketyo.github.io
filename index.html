          <p>China's recent military parade prominently featured new stealth drones, prompting military observers to analyze their potential impact on future air combat. Experts speculate these advanced aircraft possess capabilities like hypersonic cruising, improved stealth, and elevated combat power, creating a new style of aerial warfare. State media highlighted these reconnaissance-strike integrated drones, unmanned wingplanes, and shipborne uncrewed helicopters as ushering in a new era of military technology. While specific models and their full abilities were not detailed, the GJ-11, a highly stealthy strike-focused platform, was among those identified, signaling China's ongoing advancements and strategic intent in military aviation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the reinstatement of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, whom lower courts ordered reinstated after his attempt to remove her. Trump's administration argues the president possesses the lawful authority to remove executive agency heads, citing recent Supreme Court rulings to support his position. Slaughter, confirmed unanimously by the Senate until 2029, has returned to work, asserting her removal was illegal as FTC commissioners can only be dismissed for cause like neglect or malfeasance, which Trump did not provide. This ongoing legal battle highlights broader concerns about executive power and the independence of federal regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with leading tech CEOs, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Bill Gates, to discuss innovation and business. Trump lauded the attendees as a "high-IQ group" driving a revolution in genius, with Gates notably discussing advancements in vaccine technology. Elon Musk, though invited, did not attend, sending a representative instead, following past public disagreements with the administration and his past criticisms of the government. This high-profile gathering underscores Trump's continued efforts to cultivate close ties with tech industry leaders and encourage investment and technological development within the United States, despite some underlying tensions.</p>

          <p>WNBA star Caitlin Clark will miss the remainder of the Indiana Fever's season due to a right groin injury, compounded by a bone bruise sustained in July. Expressing deep disappointment, Clark had diligently worked towards returning but was advised against it for her long-term health and well-being. This marks her first significant injury absence in her collegiate or professional career, following a season where she averaged 16.5 points, 8.8 assists, and 5.0 rebounds. Her absence is a considerable blow to the Fever, who are currently battling for a playoff spot, though her profound impact on the growth of women's basketball, evidenced by record league attendance, remains undeniable.</p>

          <p>The performance of "Lift Every Voice and Sing," widely recognized as the Black national anthem, before the NFL season opener between the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys, generated significant discussion on social media. The NFL has permitted the song's performance since the summer of 2020, in the wake of George Floyd's death, featuring it at season-opening matchups and Super Bowls. Laurin Talese, who sang the anthem, received a standing ovation from attendees inside Lincoln Financial Field. Despite its historical promotion by the NAACP since 1917, the song continues to be a source of both celebration and consternation among different segments of the fan base.</p>

Newsom, who had opposed the deployment and filed a lawsuit, criticized the move as "waste, fraud and abuse" and "political theater," highlighting the significant financial and societal costs, including adverse conditions for soldiers.

          <p>OpenAI is reportedly collaborating with U.S. semiconductor giant Broadcom to begin mass production of its first in-house artificial intelligence (AI) chip in 2026. This strategic move aims to significantly reduce OpenAI's reliance on external suppliers like Nvidia for its chip supply. The custom-designed chips are intended for internal use to power OpenAI's demanding AI workloads, reflecting a broader industry trend where tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta are developing their own AI silicon to meet surging demand for computing power. Broadcom's CEO recently hinted at securing over $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer, underscoring the scale of this partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

Adams and Sliwa have firmly stated they will not drop out, emphasizing that voters should decide the election.

Teachers at Lakeside High, the largest school in the district, report a significant improvement in student engagement and a noticeable decrease in disruptive behavior since the ban was introduced. This initiative precedes a statewide law in Georgia, effective 2026, banning cellphones in K-8 schools, though DeKalb County's policy extends to high schools.

This decision, backed by Trump-appointed judges, was hailed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Department of Homeland Security as a win for law enforcement.

          <p>Political analyst Sir John Curtice highlights Reform UK's unprecedented rise in popularity, now leading polls for five months, driven significantly by disillusioned Brexit voters. The party's consistent 30-31% support, primarily from former Conservative voters, could make it the largest party in a fragmented political landscape, potentially positioning Nigel Farage as the next UK prime minister. Reform's appeal stems from public dissatisfaction with the economy, NHS, and immigration, and its alignment with socially conservative, climate-skeptic views prevalent among Leave voters. The party's long-term success hinges on Farage's leadership and whether rival parties can consolidate their support.</p>
