          <p>The Seoul High Court has postponed the trial of Lee Jae-myung, the opposition Democratic Party's presidential candidate, until after the upcoming June 3 election, giving him a political advantage. Lee faces charges of violating election laws and other offenses. Critics argue this decision could undermine the conservative People Power Party (PPP) and secure Lee's victory. The postponement has sparked debate about the separation of powers and the judiciary's autonomy, while supporters see it as a turning point that clears Lee's path to the presidency.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio has transitioned from a presidential rival to a key figure in the Trump administration, now holding four high-profile positions including Secretary of State and acting National Security Advisor. This unprecedented arrangement has raised concerns about whether one person can effectively manage such a broad range of responsibilities. While some see it as a sign of Trump's trust in Rubio, others question the practicality of juggling multiple critical roles, particularly given the complex national security challenges facing the United States. The arrangement follows a broader shake-up inside the National Security Council.</p>

Israel, which has banned UNRWA, alleges the agency is infiltrated by Hamas, a claim UNRWA denies. The closures affected over 550 pupils and resulted in the detention of a staff member, creating a traumatic experience for the children.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining steady interest rates at the Fed's recent meeting, labeling him a "fool" for not cutting rates sooner. Trump inaccurately claimed that there is virtually no inflation, despite data showing inflation above the Fed's target. This criticism is part of Trump's ongoing pressure on the Fed to lower rates, which could undermine confidence in U.S. policymaking and the dollar. The Bank of England, in contrast, cut its main interest rate amid concerns about Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to begin negotiations over their trade war, but President Trump's negotiating position appears weaker than China's. China has remained consistent in its economic program and has worked to reduce its reliance on the American market. Trump's administration has sent mixed messages and has been forced to backtrack on some of its tariff policies. China has been working to draw other countries closer to itself.</p>

          <h2>Adjusting Gold Investment Allocations in Today's Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 10:11:42 EDT</div>

          <p>Financial advisors generally recommend allocating around 10% of a portfolio to gold investments, but the current economic climate may warrant adjustments. Experts suggest that investors should consider increasing their gold allocation if they expect ongoing global tensions, rising inflation, or a weaker U.S. dollar. However, maintaining traditional allocation levels is recommended for those playing the long game and those whose portfolios are already diversified.</p>
