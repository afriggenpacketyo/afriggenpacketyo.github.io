            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to open at 750 schools across England next week, providing half an hour of free morning childcare for thousands of parents. This trial program, running until July, aims to offer up to 95 additional hours of childcare and save parents £450 per year. However, teaching unions have raised concerns about the adequacy of government funding for the scheme, with some schools suggesting it may not be sufficient to cover the costs. The government has assured that funding will be carefully reviewed during the trial.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a non-nuclear hydrogen-based explosive device in a controlled field test, creating devastating chemical chain reactions without nuclear materials. The 2kg bomb, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation's 705 Research Institute, generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds, using a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material. This material, known as magnesium hydride, releases hydrogen gas that ignites into a sustained inferno when activated by conventional explosives.</p>
