        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland for prolonged negotiations regarding tariffs that threaten the global economy. President Trump stated that "great progress" was made and that a "total reset" was negotiated in a friendly manner, with the goal of opening China to American business. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated initial discussions focused on de-escalation, as the current tariff levels are unsustainable. Both sides hope to scale back tariffs, relieving financial markets and companies dependent on U.S.-China trade, though some analysts doubt any substantive results will emerge from the Geneva meeting.</p>

Pakistan denied these claims, asserting that India had committed violations in some areas. The ceasefire, mediated by the U.S., aimed to end weeks of clashes triggered by a gun massacre on tourists, but initial hopes for peace were quickly dashed.</p>

          <p>After Vice President JD Vance initially dismissed the India-Pakistan conflict, the Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear escalation. Evidence of serious dogfights and drone incursions prompted U.S. officials to intervene. The U.S. feared that strikes on the Noor Khan air base in Rawalpindi, near Pakistan's nuclear command authority, could be misinterpreted. Ultimately, U.S. officials, including Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, engaged directly with leaders from both countries, urging de-escalation and paving the way for a ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary partial text of the bill. Key issues include competing priorities and budget constraints, as Republicans aim to pass the package without Democratic support through reconciliation. The narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for fiscal responsibility could complicate the process.

          <p>President Donald Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency ventures is threatening his crypto agenda, with lawmakers rejecting the GENIUS Act due to conflicts of interest.

Critics argue that individuals can enrich the president by buying his cryptocurrencies, creating a corrupt scheme. This controversy has led to defections from stablecoin legislation and calls for investigations, potentially hindering advancements in the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid President Trump's "Too Late" label as he navigates economic uncertainties and conflicting pressures. Economists note the Fed's historical tendency to act slowly, often leading to delayed responses. Trump has been urging the Fed to cut rates, while Powell remains cautious amid volatile policy and tariff threats. Powell's decision to hold steady reflects a no-win situation, with potential mistakes on either side of the Fed's mandate.</p>
