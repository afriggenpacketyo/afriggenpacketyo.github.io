        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests against ICE operations, leading to the deployment of active-duty Marines and National Guard troops. President Trump's decision to mobilize federal forces has sparked legal challenges from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who argues it is an overreach of federal power. The protests have resulted in numerous arrests, property damage, and clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, prompting Mayor Karen Bass to impose a curfew in downtown Los Angeles. The situation remains tense as California officials seek to restrict the Trump administration's use of military personnel for law enforcement purposes. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing conflict between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to restore the original names of several Army bases that previously honored Confederate military figures. However, the bases will now be named after other service members who share similar names, effectively undoing a renaming process initiated by Congress and completed under President Biden. Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll is directed to implement the changes, which affect bases such as Fort Gordon, Fort A.P. Hill, and Fort Hood. This decision reverses efforts to remove Confederate symbols and is viewed as controversial by many.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, has faced a second night of unrest with fireworks and petrol bombs thrown at police. The violence, described by police as racially motivated, led to the use of baton rounds and water cannons to disperse protesters. Homes and businesses were attacked, with some properties displaying signs indicating the nationalities of residents. The unrest follows an earlier peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, and political figures have condemned the violence while also addressing underlying tensions related to immigration.</p>

Furthermore, PepsiCo's diversification into salty snacks and packaged foods provides additional growth opportunities and stability. As a Dividend King with 53 years of consecutive dividend increases, PepsiCo demonstrates resilience and long-term value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UN panel is calling on the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, asserting that the current agreement fails to guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The panel argues that the UK's retention of a military base on Diego Garcia hinders the Chagossians' ability to access their ancestral lands. The existing deal returns sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius but allows the UK to continue operating the military base. The UN experts are advocating for a new agreement that ensures the Chagossian people's right to return.</p>
