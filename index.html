          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies, particularly Ukraine's president, calling it "beneath America." Biden expressed grave concerns about the future of the Atlantic Alliance, emphasizing its importance for maintaining peace, freedom, and democracy. He argued that Trump's approach could send a dangerous message to Europe, suggesting it's time to appease Russia. Biden also reflected on his decision to withdraw from the presidential race, stating that he believes it was the right decision despite the limited time it left for his replacement to campaign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor, argues that Donald Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed diagnosis. While the dollar's reserve-currency status contributes to trade deficits, it's only one of many factors. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. He also points out that the strength of the American economy and increased automation in factories contribute to the current account deficit.</p>

Biden defended his own record on Ukraine, stating he provided them with everything needed for their independence and was prepared to respond more aggressively if Putin advanced further.

          <p>As Russia commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War Two, the event is receiving significant attention amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The anniversary is used to reinforce the national idea of Russia as both victor and victim, with the war in Ukraine portrayed as a continuation of WWII against Nazism and fascism. The official narrative creates a parallel reality where Russia is again fighting external aggression, despite having launched a large-scale invasion of its neighbor. This portrayal strengthens the official message that Europe cannot be trusted.</p>

          <p>Five Venezuelan opposition figures, who had been sheltering in the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas for over a year, have left the country and are now in the United States. This development comes as Venezuela seeks to appease the Trump administration, which has threatened to reimpose oil sanctions. The activists had been instrumental in organizing opposition efforts, including a voter-turnout drive and election monitoring. Their departure occurs ahead of regional elections, while numerous political prisoners remain detained in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' overworked bullpen played a significant role in their extra-innings loss to the Miami Marlins. Manager Dave Roberts had to rely on lower-leverage relievers due to the high usage of his key bullpen arms. The team's bullpen has pitched the most innings in the majors, a situation caused by injuries to the starting rotation and a lack of consistent length from starting pitchers. This workload management strategy resulted in critical sequences where less experienced pitchers faltered, ultimately costing the Dodgers the game.</p>
