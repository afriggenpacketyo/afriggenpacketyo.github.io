          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned through 12,000 acres and is 35% contained. No single-family homes were damaged, and no injuries or loss of life were reported, though one business was destroyed. Mandatory and voluntary evacuations for 5,000 residents were lifted, and major roads reopened. The fire service expects the acreage to grow as they continue burnout operations to fully contain the wildfire, which officials believe could be the largest in New Jersey in 20 years.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price is rising, heading towards $95,000 after a relief rally following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs. Exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin have seen increased inflows, reflecting growing interest in the cryptocurrency as a hedge against market turbulence and a diving dollar. The rally has forced short sellers to buy back Bitcoin, further pushing up the price, with over $300 million in short liquidations. Analysts suggest the next resistance level is around $95,000, with $100,000 as a key psychological level. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece introduces the concept of a "Waymo Democrat," advocating for a political approach that embraces technological innovation and advanced manufacturing. This perspective contrasts with Trump's focus on reviving outdated industries like coal and gasoline cars. The author admires the passion of progressive figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but believes their focus is too much on defending existing social programs rather than solving for the future. The Waymo Democrat seeks to reinvent American industry and promote progress for all.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for allegedly altering historical content on government websites, including removing references to transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument page and modifying language about the Little Rock Nine. Historians, like Yale professor David W. Blight, view these changes as an attempt to revise the past and promote a particular narrative. This incident has sparked a debate about the importance of accurately representing history and the potential dangers of revisionism. The changes are occurring amid the Trump administration’s push to end DEI and “restore truth and sanity” to American history.</p>
