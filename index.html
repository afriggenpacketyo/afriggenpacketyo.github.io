          <p>As artificial intelligence rapidly evolves, Hong Kong firms are encouraged to proactively adopt secure AI practices to mitigate potential security risks. The use of AI raises concerns about personal data privacy, including excessive data collection, unauthorized usage, and data breaches.

China's Global AI Governance Initiative promotes a people-centered approach to AI development.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider raising taxes before the Spring Statement. The memo proposed measures such as increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While these proposals were not implemented, they highlight ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions. Conservative Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticized the memo, suggesting it confirms Labour's inclination towards raising taxes, while Labour MP Neil Duncan-Jordan expressed concerns about welfare cuts announced at the Spring Statement. The article suggests internal disagreements within the Labour party regarding fiscal policy, specifically concerning tax increases and spending cuts.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its retention scheme, which would have paid out significant bonuses to senior executives, following criticism from the government and the public. The company had been accused of attempting to circumvent forthcoming rules to ban water companies from paying bonuses amidst concerns over its financial stability and environmental performance. The decision was made after Downing Street stated that it was unacceptable for bosses at the troubled firm to reward themselves for failure. Thames Water will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations and turnaround objectives, while facing scrutiny over sewage discharges and leaks. The company secured an emergency £3bn loan in March to avoid collapse and seeks to reduce its £20bn debt.</p>

          <h2>New Pope Leo XIV Faces Potential Clash with Maga Catholics</h2>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has sparked concerns among some Maga Catholics who view him as a continuity pontiff aligned with the Democratic party. Traditionalist Catholics, including figures like JD Vance and Steve Bannon, have historically opposed progressive causes. Pope Leo's choice of name signals a recognition of the challenge posed by right-wing populism, reminiscent of Leo XIII's confrontation with laissez-faire economics and early Marxist movements. The new pope aims to address contemporary issues such as wars, climate change, and inequality, potentially setting the stage for a clash with the Maga worldview.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has criticized the United States' export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China, deeming them a "failure." Huang stated that the restrictions have prompted Chinese companies to develop their own advanced technology. The US curbs have forced companies to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers like Huawei. He added that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market had plummeted to 50 percent from nearly 95 percent at the beginning of former president Joe Biden's administration. The article suggests that the export controls have inadvertently boosted China's domestic AI chip industry.</p>
