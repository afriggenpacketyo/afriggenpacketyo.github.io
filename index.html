          <p>Robert Jarvik, a key figure in the development of the first permanent artificial heart, has died at the age of 79. Jarvik collaborated with a team at the University of Utah to create a mechanical heart, which was later used as a bridge for patients awaiting organ transplants. His work marked a significant milestone in medical science, offering hope for individuals with severe heart conditions and paving the way for future advancements in cardiac technology. The artificial heart provided a temporary solution, sustaining patients until a suitable donor heart became available for transplantation.</p>

          <p>A federal court initially froze most of the tariffs imposed by President Trump, deeming them beyond his legal authority, which caused global markets to rally. The court stated that the tariffs, justified by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), were unconstitutional as they addressed trade imbalances rather than emergency situations. However, an appeals court temporarily halted this ruling, leading to uncertainty about the future of the tariffs. The White House defended the tariffs, citing national security concerns, while critics argued that they represent an overreach of presidential power (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership due to White House dissatisfaction with the number of immigration arrests and deportations.

The administration aims to increase arrests of unauthorized migrants, with Stephen Miller advocating for a minimum of 3,000 arrests daily.

          <p>The White House has strongly criticized federal judges who blocked President Trump from imposing global tariffs, labeling it "judicial overreach" and urging the Supreme Court to intervene. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that the judges are undermining the United States' credibility and obstructing Trump's mandate to secure domestic manufacturing. She defended the president's rationale for the tariffs as legally sound and grounded in common sense, emphasizing the need for secure supply chains and a robust defense industrial base. The administration is actively reviewing other methods to implement Trump's tariff agenda while complying with court orders (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested fourteen individuals linked to an Armenian fraud ring accused of stealing $30 million in COVID relief and Small Business loans. The suspects allegedly used phony documents to create shell companies and apply for $47 million in federal funds. Authorities seized cash, money-counting machines, cell phones, laptops, and firearms during the raids. The investigation revealed that some of the stolen funds were used for personal expenses and luxury goods, while other amounts were sent to Armenia, complicating efforts to trace the money.</p>

          <p>Josh Klinghoffer, former guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, has accepted a plea deal after being charged with vehicular manslaughter in the death of Israel Sanchez. Klinghoffer pleaded no contest to misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence and was sentenced to community labor and probation. Sanchez’s family sued Klinghoffer for wrongful death, alleging he was distracted by his phone at the time of the collision. The prosecutor warned Klinghoffer that further distracted driving resulting in death could lead to murder charges.</p>
