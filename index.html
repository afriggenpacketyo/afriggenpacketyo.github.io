          <p>As a government shutdown deadline approaches, Republican congressional leaders are insisting that the debate over extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits must wait until after government funding is secured. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune argued that while the subsidy issue needs resolution by year-end, it should not be tied to the immediate need to keep the government open. Democrats remain firm on including the ACA extension, creating a stalemate ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Trump and congressional leaders to avert the shutdown.</p>

          <p>A gunman killed one person and injured at least nine others after driving his vehicle into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, during a Sunday service. The 40-year-old suspect, who was later killed in a shootout with police, also deliberately set fire to the building, causing a partial collapse. Investigators are exploring the motive, including a possible connection to the recent death of the church's president, Russell M. Nelson. Federal and state officials are assisting in the investigation of the attack, which has been widely condemned by political leaders.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda has formed in the western Atlantic and is projected to intensify into a hurricane, threatening the Southeastern U.S. with heavy rainfall early this week. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for the Bahamas, which is already experiencing heavy rain, and a watch for Florida's East Coast. The storm is expected to bring up to 10 inches of rain to some coastal areas from Florida to the Carolinas, raising concerns about potential flash flooding and mudslides. Forecasters are also monitoring a rare possibility of it interacting with the more powerful Hurricane Humberto.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is evaluating a request from Ukraine to acquire long-range Tomahawk missiles to bolster its defense against Russia. The request, made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, proposes that the U.S. sell the missiles to European allies who would then transfer them to Ukraine. Vice President JD Vance stated that President Trump, who has previously denied such requests, will make the final decision amid growing frustration with Russia's refusal to negotiate peace. The consideration comes as Ukraine demonstrates improved capabilities in striking military targets deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has urged the Labour party to engage in an honest debate about its direction and strategy to effectively compete with Reform UK. Speaking at the party's conference, Burnham warned against underestimating the electoral threat Labour faces, particularly in upcoming local elections where polls show it trailing Reform. He criticized what he described as a "climate of fear" within the party that stifles open discussion and dissent. Burnham's comments highlight internal tensions over party leadership and strategy as Labour seeks to regain political ground.</p>

          <p>Moldovans voted in a critical parliamentary election that will decide the nation's geopolitical alignment between the European Union and Russia. The election is viewed as highly consequential, with the pro-EU government of President Maia Sandu facing a strong challenge from pro-Russian opposition parties. Sandu has accused Russia of "massive interference" in the election, while her rivals claim interference has come from the West. The outcome is uncertain, particularly as two pro-Russian parties were disqualified just before the vote amid allegations of illegal foreign financing.</p>

          <p>A former FBI special agent has revealed how serial killer Scott Kimball, acting as a confidential informant, manipulated the bureau for years while continuing his killing spree. Kimball, sentenced to 70 years in 2009 for four murders, allegedly confessed to dozens more, using his informant status to mislead agents and even plant clues about his own crimes in case files. The case highlights a significant failure in oversight, where Kimball played a "game" with the FBI, tricking them into believing he was a valuable asset while he preyed on multiple victims, including Jennifer Marcum, whose remains have never been found.</p>

The probe centers on whether the team funneled $21 million to star player Kawhi Leonard through an endorsement deal with Aspiration Partners, a sustainability firm in which Ballmer was an investor. At issue is whether the Clippers were involved in arranging the side deal beyond a simple introduction, which could violate league rules designed to ensure competitive parity.

          <p>The Palestinian death toll in the Gaza conflict has surpassed 66,000, according to the region's Health Ministry, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. The meeting will focus on a new U.S.-led 21-point proposal for an immediate ceasefire, which includes the release of all hostages and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the enclave. Amid ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza City and surging violence in the West Bank, international pressure on Israel continues to mount, with ceasefire talks having stalled since an Israeli strike in Qatar.</p>

          <p>Turkey is grappling with a severe public health crisis as its diabetes prevalence has nearly doubled over the past two decades, now affecting over 16% of its adult population—the highest rate in the European region. Public health experts attribute the dramatic increase to poor national food policies, lack of exercise, and high consumption of carbohydrates and starch-based sugars. Critics argue that the Turkish health system is failing in early diagnosis and management of the disease, with a large number of patients remaining undiagnosed or receiving inadequate care, which is compounded by the nation's high obesity rates.</p>

However, his government faces criticism domestically over upcoming elections that exclude some minorities and centralize power.

However, Kim reiterated that his country's nuclear arsenal is non-negotiable and that any talks are contingent on the U.S. abandoning its goal of denuclearization. The U.S. State Department has maintained its commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, leaving the prospects for a productive summit uncertain.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Nepal, largely driven by the country's youth (Gen Z), have resulted in significant political change, including the resignation of the prime minister. The demonstrations were fueled by widespread anger over decades of perceived corruption, inequality, and political stagnation, erupting into violence after the government shut down social media platforms. In the aftermath, which saw dozens of deaths, an interim government has been formed with elections scheduled for 2026. Young protest leaders are now discussing forming a new political party to challenge the old guard and build a different future for Nepal.</p>

          <p>The UK government is backing a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the automaker and its supply chain recover from a month-long production shutdown caused by a major cyber-attack. The shutdown has raised concerns about the potential collapse of smaller suppliers who depend on the company. A local MP warned that further government assistance might be necessary and called the incident a "wake-up call" for UK businesses to improve their cybersecurity defenses. The loan is intended to protect thousands of jobs and ensure cash flows through the supply chain as JLR works to resume production.</p>

The measure, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered devices within the city.

          <p>The European Union's steel industry is facing increased uncertainty as the U.S. considers expanding its list of "derivative" products subject to steep tariffs. The U.S. has already applied the 50% tariffs to a wide range of goods containing steel, from furniture to wind turbines, and a new consultation period suggests the list could grow further. European business leaders and politicians are concerned that this ad-hoc expansion creates a turbulent trade environment, harming industries that use even small amounts of steel in their products. The punitive tariffs were initially designed to counter Chinese imports but have significantly impacted European producers.</p>
