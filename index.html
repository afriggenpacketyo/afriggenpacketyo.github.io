          <p>China's military asserts it prevented a Philippine Navy ship from entering disputed waters near Scarborough Shoal, with the People's Liberation Army Southern Theatre Command stating the Philippine vessel attempted to intrude into Chinese territorial waters. Manila has responded by accusing China of harassment and dangerous maneuvers, stating the incident occurred within 12 nautical miles of the shoal. Senior Colonel Tian Junli warned the Philippines to cease provocative acts and distorting facts, while the Armed Forces of the Philippines condemned China's actions, raising tensions in the South China Sea, a region with overlapping territorial claims and strategic importance.

          <p>Slovakia and Hungary have strongly criticized the European Commission's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by 2027, with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico calling the proposal "economic suicide." These eastern European nations, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy supplies, warn that banning such supplies would lead to higher energy prices for consumers. The EU aims to ensure full energy independence from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, but reducing gas flows has proven difficult.

          <p>The Wikimedia Foundation is taking legal action against the UK's Online Safety Act regulations, arguing that they could threaten the safety of volunteer editors and their ability to manage harmful content on the site. The Foundation seeks a judicial review of rules that might subject Wikipedia to the toughest duties required of websites under the act. The concern is that the regulations could force the site to verify the identities of its volunteers, potentially exposing them to risks such as data breaches and imprisonment by authoritarian regimes. This article covers the first judicial review against the new online safety laws and the concerns around freedom of expression.</p>
