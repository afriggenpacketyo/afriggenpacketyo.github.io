          <p>Sportswear giant Nike has announced plans to significantly cut its reliance on Chinese manufacturing to mitigate the financial impact of U.S. tariffs. The company stated that President Trump's trade policies could add approximately $1 billion to its costs this year. In response, Nike's CFO confirmed the company will reduce the portion of its U.S.-bound footwear made in China from 16% to a high single-digit percentage by 2026. The announcement came as Nike's shares rallied after it projected better-than-expected revenue, despite the ongoing trade uncertainties affecting global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has disclosed significant details about its recent airstrike on Iran's nuclear facilities, revealing a mission that was fifteen years in the making. Officials described how B-2 bombers deployed a dozen specialized bunker-buster bombs into ventilation shafts at the Fordo facility to maximize internal destruction. This unusual release of classified information is part of a White House effort to counter early intelligence reports suggesting the strike only set Iran's program back by months. The administration aims to frame the operation as a decisive and highly successful military action that has effectively neutralized the threat.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reportedly agreed on a framework for a new trade deal, aiming to de-escalate recent tensions. President Trump announced a signed agreement, though officials later clarified it as a framework to implement a previous consensus reached in Geneva. The deal appears centered on China increasing its exports of rare earth minerals, which are crucial for U.S. high-tech and defense industries, in exchange for the U.S. easing certain restrictive measures. This development follows a period of escalating tariffs that have negatively impacted both of the world's largest economies, signaling a potential stabilization in their fraught trade relationship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have potentially identified the oldest rocks on Earth, located in Quebec's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt. While previous studies yielded conflicting ages, a new analysis using two different dating techniques on a new sample produced a consistent age of approximately 4.16 billion years. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and rocks from its earliest period are exceedingly rare due to geological recycling. Studying these ancient formations could provide invaluable insights into the planet's early conditions, such as the formation of tectonic plates and the origins of life, though access to the site is currently restricted by the local Inuit community to prevent damage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's recent U-turn on planned welfare reforms is now estimated to cost Â£2.5-3 billion, more than half of the originally intended Â£5 billion in savings. The most significant change involves sparing 370,000 current Personal Independence Payment (PIP) claimants from stricter eligibility criteria, which will now only apply to new applicants from November 2026. This policy reversal raises questions about the government's fiscal strategy and its ability to adhere to self-imposed borrowing rules. The final cost will be confirmed by the Office for Budget Responsibility, but it represents a substantial adjustment to the nation's budget plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats have voiced doubts about the Trump administration's assertion that U.S. airstrikes completely "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. Senators, including Chris Murphy and Mark Warner, stated that they believe significant capabilities and equipment remain, suggesting the program was set back by months, not years or decades as the President claimed. The lawmakers expressed concern that the administration may be deliberately misleading the public and providing a false sense of security. This highlights a growing partisan divide over the strategic assessment and outcome of the recent military action against Tehran.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing significant changes to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Universal Credit (UC) systems, primarily affecting future claimants. Starting in November 2026, new PIP applicants will face a stricter assessment for the daily living component, requiring a higher score in a single activity area to qualify. For Universal Credit, the health-related top-up for new claimants will be reduced and eventually frozen, though existing recipients will see their payments rise with inflation. The government states these reforms, coupled with a Â£1 billion investment in employment support, aim to help people with health conditions find work. (not investment advice)</p>

Many female social media users report that online harassment and stalking frequently escalate into real-world threats and violence. This issue is deeply rooted in patriarchal norms, where women's self-expression and visibility are often perceived as a threat to cultural and religious values, leading to social backlash. Despite the risks, many Pakistani women continue to use these platforms to build communities, raise awareness on social issues, and pursue economic independence, all while navigating a frustratingly slow and often ineffective content moderation system.</p>

          <p>An analysis reveals that clemency applications to the White House are increasingly being crafted to appeal personally to President Donald Trump, bypassing the traditional Justice Department review process. Prisoners and their attorneys are using language that mirrors Trump's own rhetoric, such as claims of being victims of "political persecution" or a "weaponized" justice system. This trend has emerged as Trump has granted over 1,600 pardons and commutations, often to political allies and supporters. This shift has created what some experts call a "free-for-all," where personal appeals and political connections may hold more weight than legal merit or evidence of rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>A contentious debate is underway regarding whether to remove the grizzly bear from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). After being pushed to the brink of extinction, grizzly populations, particularly in the Yellowstone ecosystem, have recovered successfully, meeting and exceeding biological benchmarks. Proponents of delisting argue it would prove the ESA's effectiveness and return management to states. However, opponents and some biologists fear that removing federal protections could expose the bears to new threats like hunting and habitat loss, arguing their recovery is still fragile.

          <p>Four individuals have been arrested on terror-related charges following a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, a major UK airbase in Oxfordshire. The arrests were made by counter-terrorism police after a pro-Palestinian group, Palestine Action, claimed responsibility and posted footage of activists spraying paint on military aircraft. The group alleged they had disabled two air-to-air refuelling tankers. In response to the security breach, the UK government has announced its intention to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, and the Defence Secretary has ordered a security review of all UK military bases.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a national parliamentary election in July, the Japanese government has formally requested that major social media operators help counter the spread of disinformation and defamation targeting candidates. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications asked nine platforms, including X and Line, to clarify and expedite their processes for removing harmful content. The move comes as Japan's political parties jointly recognize the threat that false information poses to fair elections. This reflects a growing global concern over the role of social media in politics, balancing the need for regulation with free speech protections.</p>

The concern is that Chinese authorities could gain extensive access to this personal data.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to implement a new rule that eliminates the 30-day warning period before levying fines on individuals in the U.S. illegally. According to a proposal from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, the government can now immediately begin issuing financial penalties. These fines can be up to $1,000 per day for failing to comply with a removal order and nearly $10,000 for ignoring a voluntary departure order.

According to a Coldwell Banker survey, over half of luxury agents have seen an increase in cash purchases in 2025, a trend driven by a desire to avoid high borrowing costs.
