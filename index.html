          <h2>Central Banks Navigate Weaker Dollar Amid Global Economic Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide, as uncertainty about U.S. policy drives shifts in currency values. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and potentially lower inflation for emerging markets, it also complicates export competitiveness, especially amid renewed U.S. tariffs. Some central banks may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, but they must carefully balance this against the risks of capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. administration. For now, most central banks are trying to avoid a currency war that could destabilize the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>
