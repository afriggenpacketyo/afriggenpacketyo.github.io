          <p>At least five individuals sustained injuries in a shooting at the Brass Mill Center mall in Waterbury, Connecticut, stemming from a conflict between two people that escalated when one opened fire. Shoppers sought cover inside stores, while police and emergency services responded to the scene, transporting the victims to a local hospital. Authorities do not believe this was a random act of violence, and are actively searching for the gunman, who may have had an accomplice, while reviewing surveillance footage with the assistance of the FBI and ATF. Connecticut's Governor Ned Lamont described the incident as a tragic mass shooting, expressing gratitude to law enforcement for their swift action.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, experienced an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere after a test flight. The upper-stage vehicle reached space but lost contact with mission control due to a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control. The spacecraft likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, and the company confirmed that Starship had suffered from "a rapid unscheduled disassembly." While the booster worked on the way up, it was lost as three engines lit up to simulate a landing over the Gulf of Mexico.

The victim, Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, was held captive for nearly three weeks in a Manhattan townhouse. Duplessie, along with John Woeltz and Beatrice Folchi, allegedly sought the password to Carturan's Bitcoin wallet, worth millions, and the case is part of a trend of attacks on crypto executives.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment, with their unemployment rate nearing 6%, exceeding the national average. The rise in unemployment among this group is attributed to a mismatch between the oversupply of graduates in fields with waning business demand, particularly in the tech sector. Economic uncertainty and potential replacement by automation are contributing factors, leading to businesses pausing growth and investment. This trend may result in underemployment for qualified workers who struggle to find jobs in their desired fields.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a major flaw in hyperloop technology, which could make journeys "extremely unpleasant" due to turbulence and vibrations. The study, published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, found that even minor imperfections in the track could cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. Researchers working at China's full-scale test line found a way to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more tolerable. This could potentially salvage vacuum-tube maglev technology and address challenges faced by Elon Musk's Hyperloop concept.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer advise routine COVID shots for healthy children or healthy pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision marks a significant departure from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone age 6 months and older. While the original course of vaccination offered significant protection against serious illness in children, the need for annual vaccines is more contentious, with some experts arguing that children's immune systems remember vaccinations for longer. Data shows that two or more doses of COVID vaccines were 40 percent effective at preventing emergency room visits and hospitalizations among children under the age of 5.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is directing federal agencies to review Harvard University's grants, potentially ending or redistributing an estimated $100 million in funding. The Government Services Administration (GSA) plans to circulate a letter asking agencies to identify Harvard contracts that could be "cancelled or redirected elsewhere." This move is part of the White House's escalating battle with Harvard, accusing the university of engaging in discrimination and antisemitism. The university says that its "cutting-edge medical, scientific, and technological research" has historically been "supported by the federal government" and other entities, and without federal funding, this work will come to a halt midstream.</p>

          <p>The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has warned that the government's anti-crime pledges will not be met without substantial extra funding for policing in the upcoming spending review. Rowley highlighted a decade of underinvestment and new pressures on police forces, emphasizing the importance of the forthcoming review. He stated that without significant investment, there will be no restoration of neighborhood policing and no halving of knife crime or violence against women and girls. The Home Office maintains it is backing the police to protect communities with increased funding.</p>

The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of financial fraud and tax evasion, with prosecutors arguing their wealth was based on lies and fraud schemes.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States from 2016 to 2023. The percentage of mothers rating their mental health as "excellent" decreased, while those reporting poor or fair mental health increased, particularly among single parents or those with children on Medicaid or uninsured. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as high housing and childcare costs, food prices, and the lack of national paid parental leave. Despite the challenges, experts suggest that the findings may also reflect mothers becoming more vocal about their mental health struggles.</p>
