          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit two solo home runs, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to an 8-5 victory against the New York Yankees in the opening game of their series. Ohtani's first homer answered Aaron Judge's early lead, while his second sparked a four-run sixth inning. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his rhythm and focus on each game after the birth of his child. The Dodgers' win, fueled by Ohtani's performance and Andy Pages' insurance runs, marked a successful start to the series against the Yankees, who were held scoreless after hitting four home runs in the first three innings. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has led to cheaper products hitting store shelves, attracting consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice at a lower price, leading to quick sell-outs and long lines. This initiative aims to alleviate the impact of soaring rice prices on households, with the government selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 directly to retailers in an effort to curb prices more effectively than previous auction-based methods. The move has been welcomed by consumers seeking relief from high rice costs.</p>

Germany intends to deport migrants back to Greece following a court ruling that migrants face no extreme hardships there.

          <p>Brazil's environmental movement is under threat as President Lula appears to be siding with the oil industry, evidenced by an attack on Environment Minister Marina Silva in a senate meeting and the passage of a bill stripping her ministry of environmental licensing powers. Lula's support for oil exploration in the Amazon and infrastructure projects that could harm the rainforest contradicts his pledge to achieve zero deforestation by 2030. The situation highlights the challenges faced by environmental advocates in Brazil amidst political and economic pressures.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax bill includes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent by non-US citizens, which is expected to significantly impact African economies. Remittances are a crucial source of income for many African families, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. Experts believe the tax will lead migrants to seek unofficial channels to send money, potentially harming lower-income groups reliant on these funds. This policy is viewed as part of the Trump administration's campaign against illegal migration, raising concerns about its effects on migrants and their families.</p>
