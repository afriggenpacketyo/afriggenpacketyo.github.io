          <h2>Stellantis Halts Financial Guidance Amid Trump Tariff Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 12:29:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Auto giant Stellantis has withdrawn its full-year financial guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. The multinational conglomerate, which owns brands like Jeep and Fiat, reported a 14% drop in first-quarter net revenues, attributing the decline to lower shipment volumes and adverse regional mix. While the company is actively engaging with policymakers on tariff policies, the unpredictable nature of these policies makes it difficult to provide accurate financial forecasts. Shares of Stellantis closed down 2% following the announcement, reflecting investor concerns about the impact of trade uncertainties on the automotive sector.</p>

          <p>Representative Elise Stefanik is back on Capitol Hill after her expected appointment as U.N. ambassador was withdrawn, largely due to Speaker Mike Johnson's reluctance to lose a vote in the House. This New York Times article details the strained relationship between Stefanik and Johnson, marked by broken promises and public disagreements. Stefanik, once a close ally of Johnson, now views him as dishonest, particularly after he misrepresented conversations about her potential run for governor. Despite the setback, Stefanik is receiving encouragement and financial support from top G.O.P. donors, who are urging her to consider entering the New York governor’s race in 2026, presenting a new path forward for the ambitious politician.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. ambassadors to countries that have transitioned to authoritarianism are warning that the United States is following a similar path, citing a "climate of fear" and attempts to intimidate the media. These former diplomats, who served in Russia, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Nicaragua, draw parallels between the current political landscape and the early stages of autocratic takeovers. They highlight attempts to pressure the media, criminalize political opponents, and normalize violence against public figures as alarming signs. The ambassadors urge vigilance and a strong defense of democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning Oklahoma's efforts to establish the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The case could potentially upend laws in 45 states and the District of Columbia that require charter schools to be nonsectarian. Attorney General Gentner Drummond argues that approving St. Isidore would create a "slippery slope," potentially leading to taxpayer-funded religious schools with tenets opposed to many Oklahomans' beliefs. The court's decision could have significant implications for the separation of church and state in public education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of the year, contracting by 0.3%, amid Donald Trump's return to the White House and his implementation of sweeping tariffs. This article from The Guardian notes that economists attribute the contraction largely to an unprecedented surge in imports as consumers and companies prepared for the tariffs. The drop in activity coincides with a significant fall in consumer sentiment, and Trump has blamed his predecessor for the economic downturn. Economists predict further slowdowns due to the ongoing trade war with China and the uncertainty created by Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has responded to the recent report of a contracting U.S. economy by blaming his predecessor, Joe Biden, and defending his sweeping tariff policies. According to ABC News, Trump claimed that the economic downturn was due to the "Biden Overhang" and insisted that his tariffs would soon lead to a boom. However, economists have attributed the economic contraction to the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of Trump's tariffs. The article also notes that Trump's attempts to take credit for positive economic developments are being undermined by the current economic data.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war is impacting even his preferred mode of transportation on the golf course, the golf cart, according to CNBC. While companies like Club Car and E-Z-Go assemble their golf carts in the U.S., they rely on components from various countries, including China, which are subject to tariffs. The article notes that the U.S. imported $709 million in fully assembled golf carts in 2024, with 99% coming from China. The tariffs will force the domestic golf cart industry to either pass along higher prices to consumers or sacrifice profit margins.</p>
