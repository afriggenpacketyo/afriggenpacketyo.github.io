          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are nearing all-time highs, showcasing a significant recovery after a sharp decline in April. This rebound is primarily fueled by diminished concerns over trade tariffs, robust performance within the technology sector, and widespread investor optimism regarding potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Despite ongoing risks such as geopolitical instability and future tariff policies, the market has demonstrated notable resilience, largely driven by confidence in major tech corporations and the broader economic forecast.

          <p>North Korea is set to inaugurate its largest coastal tourist destination, the Wonsan-Kalma zone, though it remains largely closed to foreign visitors. The new resort can accommodate nearly 20,000 guests and is part of leader Kim Jong Un's initiative to boost the nation's economy through tourism. Initially, the site will only be open to domestic tourists, with the first group of Russian visitors expected in July, reflecting strengthening ties between the two nations. However, broader international access, particularly for Chinese tourists who were previously the majority, remains uncertain amid ongoing pandemic-related restrictions.</p>

          <p>Following recent military strikes by the U.S. and Israel, the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program remains a subject of debate. While President Trump declared the program was "obliterated," assessments vary on the operational status of key sites like the heavily fortified Fordo facility and the primary enrichment site at Natanz. Experts believe the above-ground facilities at Isfahan were destroyed, but the fate of underground tunnels and stored nuclear material is less certain. The attacks have significantly impacted Iran's infrastructure, but the country may still possess undisclosed capabilities and materials.</p>

          <p>A coalition of environmental organizations, cities, and tribes has filed a novel class-action lawsuit against the EPA and its administrator, Lee Zeldin. The suit aims to restore approximately $3 billion in environmental and climate justice grants that were abruptly terminated by the Trump administration. The plaintiffs, including Air Alliance Houston, argue the cancellations were illegal and unconstitutional, as they were not based on noncompliance or misuse of funds. This legal strategy pools resources for smaller organizations to challenge the administration's broad regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts affecting communities nationwide.</p>

The expected compromise will protect existing recipients of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from cuts, which will now only apply to future claimants. This represents a major policy reversal for the government, which had faced a potential defeat on its flagship bill.

          <p>The White House has clarified that the U.S. and China have reached a "framework" for a trade deal, following President Trump's unexpected announcement that an agreement had been signed. During an event, Trump stated, "we just signed with China yesterday," without providing specifics. An administration official later explained that the two nations had agreed to an "additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement," which originated from talks last month. This clarification tones down the president's initial declaration of a finalized and signed deal.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct evidence of a planet outside our solar system, a significant milestone since its 2021 launch. The exoplanet candidate, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn and orbits the young star TWA 7. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare and detect the faint object. While a small possibility remains that it could be a background galaxy, the evidence strongly suggests it is a newly discovered planet.</p>

A new survey indicates that a cookout for ten people in the state will cost approximately $90.06, well above the national average of $70.92. Staples like ground beef, chicken, and even hamburger buns are considerably more expensive in California. Factors contributing to the price surge include Trump administration tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, reduced livestock availability, and potential agricultural workforce disruptions.

Senators including Chris Murphy and Mark Warner stated that they believe significant capabilities remain and that the president may have misled the public about the extent of the damage. They argue that the program has likely been set back by months, not years, as knowledge cannot be destroyed by bombing.

          <p>Two weeks after his passing, the cause of death for Beach Boys visionary Brian Wilson has been reported as respiratory arrest, according to his death certificate. The document also lists sepsis and cystitis as contributing factors, and notes he suffered from several chronic health issues, including a neurodegenerative disorder. Wilson, who was 82, had battled mental health and drug addiction issues for decades and was placed under a conservatorship in May 2024 due to declining cognitive health. His death prompted an outpouring of tributes from the music world and officials like California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
