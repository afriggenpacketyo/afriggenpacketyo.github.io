          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:55:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to maintain NHS services as resident doctors in England commence a twelfth walkout over pay and working conditions. Unlike previous strikes that prioritized only emergency care, NHS England has instructed hospitals to continue non-urgent services, with senior doctors covering for their striking colleagues. The British Medical Association warns this approach could stretch staff too thin and criticized the government for not preventing the strike. The ongoing dispute centers on the BMA's claim that pay has fallen by a fifth since 2008 when adjusted for inflation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's retail sales volumes saw a 0.9% increase in June, a rebound driven primarily by hot weather, according to the Office for National Statistics. The sunny conditions led to higher supermarket sales, particularly of drinks, and increased fuel purchases as more people traveled. This rise followed a significant 2.8% drop in May, and while positive, the rebound was smaller than some economists had anticipated. The data suggests that overall retail spending momentum has slowed, aligning with weaker consumer confidence and expectations of lackluster economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Euro 2025 final, this article analyzes the critical factors that could decide the championship match between England and Spain. It suggests England could exploit Spain's high defensive line, similar to Germany's strategy in the semi-final, by using their dynamic forwards and strong hold-up play from Alessia Russo. The analysis also highlights the need for England to disrupt Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to pivot player Patri Guijarro. The piece concludes by noting that while Spain will likely dominate possession, England is well-suited to be a significant threat in transition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts provides a key opportunity for the U.K. to resolve outstanding issues in its recent trade agreement with the U.S. While a deal with a 10% baseline tariff is in place, commitments to remove the 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum remain pending. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to meet with Trump to discuss these points, with potential for a trade-off involving the UK's digital services tax, which Washington opposes. Finalizing these details is seen as crucial for strengthening U.S.-UK economic relations. (not investment advice)</p>

With a new sterile-fly production plant to combat the pest not ready until next year, local ranchers are facing soaring medicine costs and resorting to home remedies.

          <p>The United States has cut short its participation in Gaza ceasefire negotiations in Qatar, with President Trump's special envoy stating that Hamas's latest response shows a lack of good faith. The U.S. negotiating team is returning home to consider "alternative options" for securing the release of hostages and stabilizing the region. The move is a significant setback in the 21-month effort to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas. In response, Hamas expressed surprise at the "negative remarks," affirming its commitment to reaching an agreement that ends the war and suffering in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A new emergency declaration by President Trump has expanded the U.S. military's role at the southern border, with troops now central to deterring migrant crossings. The mission, guided from a new command center in Arizona, involves 7,600 troops, armored vehicles, and drones working closely with Border Patrol. In newly designated militarized zones, troops are empowered to apprehend individuals accused of trespassing on military-controlled land. This shift in strategy aims to stop "got-aways" and increase pressure on smuggling cartels, even as apprehension rates have fallen to historic lows.</p>

The order directs federal agencies to enforce new provisions, including requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels for women's and Olympic sports. It also seeks to rein in name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals that are effectively "pay-for-play," while permitting those with fair market value. The move comes after a legal settlement opened the door for direct payments to athletes, raising concerns about the future of less profitable sports programs.</p>

Despite previously suggesting the project's cost overruns could be a fireable offense, Trump stated he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.
