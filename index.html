          <h2>Taiwan Concerned Over Potential PLA Attack Amid Ongoing Drills</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan is increasingly worried that China's ongoing military drills around the island could escalate into a real attack, leaving them with insufficient time to respond. A former Taiwanese air force commander warned that warplanes could reach Taipei within three minutes of crossing the median line, making a timely response nearly impossible. Since August 2022, the PLA has conducted six large-scale exercises featuring complex maneuvers and simulated strikes, raising concerns about China's intentions and Taiwan's ability to defend itself. The latest drills included simulated strikes from multiple directions, encirclement, and blockade exercises, further heightening tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist responds to a reader struggling with financial fairness in her upcoming marriage, where her fianc√© earns twice as much. The columnist delves into philosophical concepts of interdependence, drawing from Buddhist and Western thinkers to argue that complete independence is an illusion. She suggests that true love involves accepting vulnerability and recognizing the ways we are all interconnected. Instead of rigidly insisting on a 50/50 split, the reader should trust her partner's intentions and embrace the benefits of interdependence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Donald Trump's imposition of new tariffs, a UK Treasury minister has stated that the era of globalisation has ended, necessitating a shift towards building stronger relationships with allies and investing in the domestic economy. The Prime Minister has indicated state intervention to protect UK firms. While the UK government prefers a 'calm' approach focused on a UK-US trade deal and is continuing its policy of not responding with counter-tariffs, the Conservative leader disagreed that globalisation was over, insisting what was happening was only "fragmentation" and that "we still have a great trading relationship with many other countries". The Prime Minister has said the government "will do everything necessary to protect Britain's national interest" and is "ready to use industrial policy" to help shelter businesses, because "the world as we know it has gone".</p>

          <p>A recent Russian attack on Kyiv resulted in one death and several injuries, while the death toll from a previous missile strike on Kryvyi Rih has risen to 19, including many children.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed to have targeted a meeting of unit commanders and Western instructors, but Ukrainian officials refuted these claims. Overnight, Russian forces launched numerous missiles and drones across Ukraine, with Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepting a significant portion of them.</p>

          <p>President Trump has told Americans to "hang tough" as new tariffs take effect, describing them as an "economic revolution" aimed at bringing back jobs and businesses. The new tariffs include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and higher "reciprocal tariffs" on imports from about 90 nations. China has already announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products. The tariff announcement has sent global markets plummeting, with major stock indexes experiencing their worst week since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar weakened after President Trump's tariffs were announced, contrary to expectations that they would strengthen the currency. Concerns about a potential recession have outweighed any positive effects for the dollar, leading investors to seek safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index experienced a significant drop following the tariff announcement. While some remain hopeful for long-term gains, market confidence has been shaken by the aggressive trade policies.

          <p>The possibility of Donald Trump seeking a third term is being explored, despite constitutional limitations. Legal experts dismiss any credible basis for it, but Trump has been testing the waters with increasingly explicit suggestions. This follows a pattern of floating extreme ideas, which then become normalized within the Republican party. Some observers warn that Trump's comments are a strategy to maintain political relevance and influence, while others dismiss them as jokes.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Social Security Administration (SSA) report that cuts and policy changes by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge) are causing "complete, utter chaos." The agency is planning to eliminate thousands of jobs, leading to service cuts and office closures. The website has crashed several times, and there are concerns about data security. Critics claim the cuts are a concerted attack on the legitimacy of social security and are driven by false claims and conspiracies about the program.</p>
