          <p>A crew of four astronauts, including two from NASA, one from Japan, and one from Russia, successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean after completing a 146-day mission aboard the International Space Station. Their mission involved relieving two NASA astronauts who were stranded for nine months due to issues with their Boeing Starliner capsule. The return marked NASA's first Pacific splashdown in 50 years and was hailed as a great success by both NASA and SpaceX officials, who managed the recovery. The crew expressed relief to be home, highlighting the international cooperation that made the mission possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, once booming, is now experiencing a significant slowdown due to a combination of economic factors. Post-pandemic inflation, changing consumer habits among younger generations, and retaliatory trade tariffs from the EU and Canada have dampened sales. This has led to an oversupply, falling prices, and financial distress for some distilleries, resulting in bankruptcies and plant closures. Experts warn that the industry, which became a victim of its own success and speculative investment, may face further consolidation and economic hardship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable patents derived from federally-funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of breaching its legal obligations and initiated a "march-in" process that could allow the government to seize the patents. This move is seen by many as part of a broader White House pressure campaign against the university, which has also faced the freezing of federal research funds over its handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests.</p>

While brands advertise ingredients like Lion's Mane and L-theanine, experts question whether the small quantities in these drinks can produce their claimed effects, citing a lack of robust scientific evidence. An ad by a leading brand was recently banned for making unsubstantiated health claims. Psychologists suggest any calming effect may be a placebo, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Tammy Bruce, the current State Department spokesperson and a former Fox News commentator, to serve as the U.S. deputy representative to the United Nations. Bruce, who had no foreign policy experience before her appointment as spokesperson in January, is a former radio host and author known for her conservative views. Her nomination has drawn attention due to her past outspoken opposition to transgender rights. The president praised her as a "Great Patriot" who will represent the country "brilliantly" at the UN.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Why NASA's Mars Rovers Frequently Get Stuck in Alien Soil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 18:00:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a key reason why robotic rovers on the Moon and Mars often get stuck: previous simulations failed to account for how lower gravity affects the soil itself. A new study using physics-based simulations revealed that the granular soil, or regolith, on these worlds is fluffier and shifts more easily under low gravity, hindering wheel traction. This oversight has led to mobility issues, most notably the permanent immobilization of the Spirit rover on Mars. This discovery could lead to better rover designs and prevent future missions from getting trapped.</p>

          <p>The attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's annual atomic bomb commemorations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first time has tested the improving, yet delicate, relationship between Tokyo and Beijing. The move is part of Taiwan's broader effort to increase its international visibility and strengthen unofficial ties with Japan. While Beijing is expected to view the presence of the de facto ambassador unfavorably, observers believe both China and Japan will act cautiously to avoid undermining their recent diplomatic progress. The official's appearance follows a rare visit to Japan by Taiwan's foreign minister.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans to immediately deport foreign national criminals after they receive a custodial sentence, rather than after they serve a portion of it. Under the proposal, those with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away, with their destination country deciding if they serve any remaining time. The Ministry of Justice argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, though critics warn some countries may refuse to accept the deportees. The plan would not apply to those serving life sentences for crimes like terrorism.</p>

          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the pomegranate as a particularly beneficial fruit for supporting brain health and cognitive function in people over 50. Pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fruit can be costly and seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract can be an alternative, but advises consulting a doctor due to potential medication interactions.</p>

The government proscribed the group after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. The mass arrests, one of the largest on a single day in a decade, have been described as "deeply concerning" by Amnesty International.</p>
