          <p>An Emirates cargo plane, a Boeing 747-481 operated by Air ACT, veered off a runway at Hong Kong International Airport and plunged into the sea during its arrival from Dubai. The aircraft struck a ground vehicle, causing two airport staff to fall into the water. Despite rescue efforts, both individuals later died in hospital, as reported by local media citing police. The four crew members on board the plane survived and received medical attention. This highly unusual incident has led to the immediate closure of the affected runway, significantly impacting airport operations and resulting in the cancellation of at least 11 cargo flights. Authorities have launched a full investigation into the cause, with a press conference scheduled to provide further details.</p>

          <p>Thirteen individuals were arrested in West Hollywood's Rainbow District during a Friday night operation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The use of unmarked vehicles and recent immigration enforcement actions in the area initially sparked widespread public concern on social media about a possible ICE raid, with videos showing confrontations with law enforcement. However, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials later clarified that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents did not participate in the arrests. The operation was a local response to multiple reports of pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activities occurring within the district, potentially involving local establishments or unpermitted street vendors.</p>

          <p>Several individuals disguised as construction workers executed a brazen daytime heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing at least nine pieces of jewelry from the Napoleon collection. The thieves used a mobile freight elevator with a metal ladder to access a second-floor window, then smashed display cases to take crowns, necklaces, earrings, and brooches of "inestimable heritage and historical value." The meticulously planned robbery took less than seven minutes, with the perpetrators fleeing on motorcycles. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed that the stolen items will be recovered and the culprits brought to justice, as an investigation is actively underway into this audacious crime at one of the world's most secure museums.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 20:11:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher on Monday as investors anticipated the release of crucial economic data from China, including third-quarter GDP figures. Analysts polled by Reuters projected a slowdown in China's economy for the July-to-September period, forecasting gross domestic product growth at 4.8% year-on-year, easing from 5.2% in the previous quarter. Major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix, and South Korea's Kospi, recorded increases, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index futures also indicating a rise. This regional optimism follows a positive close for U.S. markets on Friday, influenced by a softening U.S. stance on trade talks with China and moving past recent credit concerns.

          <p>Quarterback Bo Nix orchestrated a stunning 19-point fourth-quarter comeback for the Denver Broncos, leading them to a dramatic 33-32 victory over the New York Giants. Nix accounted for four touchdowns, two passing and two rushing, as Denver scored 33 points in the final quarter. Despite trailing significantly for most of the game, the Broncos capitalized on a crucial interception and subsequent scoring drives, including a game-winning 39-yard field goal by Will Lutz. This improbable win, described as a "miracle at Mile High," improved Denver's record to 5-2, while the Giants fell to 2-5 after a demoralizing collapse, largely due to their inability to make defensive stops.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom had strongly objected to the "absurd show of force" over the busy Interstate 5, which was closed last-minute, causing severe traffic delays.

          <p>Analysts polled by Reuters anticipate a slowdown in China's economic growth for the third quarter, with official data expected to confirm weaker performance. Forecasts suggest gross domestic product grew by 4.8% in the July-to-September period year-on-year, a decrease from 5.2% in the previous quarter. Fixed-asset investment, including real estate, is projected to have expanded by a mere 0.1% in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales are also expected to have slowed to 3% year-on-year in September, while industrial production likely eased to 5%.

Curator Hamza Walker emphasized that the generals fought for slavery and white supremacy, rejecting revisionist history and the idea of lionizing such figures.

This substantial saving effectively offsets his new car payment, making the switch to an electric vehicle highly financially beneficial.

          <p>The Israeli Premier League derby between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv was canceled by police before kick-off due to "public disorder and violent riots." Police reported dozens of smoke grenades and pyrotechnic devices were thrown, resulting in 12 civilian and three officer injuries, with nine arrests and 16 detentions. This unrest comes just days after officials in the UK decided to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from an upcoming Europa League match at Aston Villa due to safety concerns, a ban the UK government is now actively working to overturn. Hapoel Tel Aviv criticized the cancellation, accusing police of "preparing for a war, not a sporting event."</p>

          <p>China's top leaders are convening to decide on the next Five Year Plan (2026-2030), a crucial blueprint that has historically reshaped the global economy. This article highlights three transformative periods: the 1981-84 "Reform and Opening Up" under Deng Xiaoping, which led to China becoming a manufacturing powerhouse and caused "the China shock" in Western economies. The 2011-15 plan focused on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, making China a world leader in EVs and renewables and controlling rare earth supply chains. More recently, the 2021-25 plan emphasizes "high quality development" to challenge American tech dominance, fostering domestic success stories like TikTok and Huawei.</p>

Following accusations of a Hamas attack, Israel conducted retaliatory airstrikes, killing 44 people in Gaza. However, Israel later announced a "renewed enforcement" of the ceasefire, and aid deliveries into Gaza, initially halted, are set to resume, though the Rafah Crossing remains closed. Key architects Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, along with Vice President JD Vance, are expected in the region to implement the next phase of the agreement, indicating ongoing diplomatic efforts to maintain stability and progress.</p>

Coach JJ Redick noted missed assist opportunities due to misfired lobs, highlighting the adjustment period for players adapting to Doncic's unique passing style. The bond between Hayes and Doncic has grown so strong that Hayes is pursuing Slovenian citizenship to potentially join the national team, aiming to play on the international stage.</p>

          <p>England plans to roll out new vocational "V-level" courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify the current "confusing landscape" of post-16 qualifications. These V-levels are intended to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, offering a practical, employment-focused route. The government also seeks to reduce GCSE maths and English resits by introducing an alternative qualification. While details on implementation and subjects are pending, ministers envision students mixing V-levels with A-levels or pursuing apprenticeships. This initiative, part of a post-16 education and skills white paper, aims to enhance vocational training and improve student pathways, though concerns exist about filling the gap left by BTecs.</p>

          <p>A $3 million XRP theft, which tragically drained a US retiree's life savings from an Ellipal wallet, has exposed the predatory practices of many crypto recovery firms. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT traced the 1.2 million XRP through over 120 cross-chain swaps before it vanished into OTC desks linked to the sanctioned network Huione, which is known for laundering billions from illicit activities. The victim's confusion between cold and hot wallets also reignited self-custody debates. ZachXBT warned that over 95% of recovery companies are predatory, charging exorbitant fees for superficial reports and false promises, effectively re-victimizing those already suffering significant financial loss from hacks.

Liu emphasizes the broader, unhealthy competition extending to technology and ideologies, which harms both nations and the world.

          <p>Amidst a US government shutdown and International Monetary Fund annual meetings, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Ambassador Jamieson Greer accused China of "economic coercion," blaming it for global trade disruptions. They specifically highlighted China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, critical for high-tech goods ranging from electric cars to military hardware and AI, calling it a "Chinese chokehold" on the world economy. This accusation comes as the Trump administration implements its own tough tariffs, which have caused surprisingly muted disruption so far, partly due to a booming AI tech sector. Concerns about an AI bubble and the weaponization of supply chains underscore the uneasy calm in the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump also reportedly dismissed Ukraine's battlefield maps, claiming he was "sick" of seeing them, and refused Zelensky's request for Tomahawk missiles, citing U.S. needs.

The author highlights two distinguishing factors from past hegemonic transitions. First, the proliferation of nuclear weapons renders total war irrational, shifting great power competition to proxy wars and economic confrontation. Second, technological interdependence creates unprecedented costs for systemic rupture, with global supply chains and financial ties incentivizing cooperation. The article suggests that powerful domestic constituencies in all major economies have a strong interest in avoiding systemic breakdown, advocating for patient statecraft over confrontation.</p>
