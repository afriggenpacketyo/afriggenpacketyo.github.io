          <p>The European Court of Justice has outlawed Malta's "golden passport" program, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a "mere commercial transaction." The article explains that the court ruled that granting citizenship based on investment undermines the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. Maltese Prime Minister Abela defended the program, which generated significant revenue, and pledged to rework it to comply with the court's decision. While passport sales are now prohibited, "golden visas," offering residence permits for investments, remain a point of concern for the EU.</p>
