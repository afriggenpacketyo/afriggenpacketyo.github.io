          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child psychologist who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. Instead of focusing on memorized phrases, these parents openly discuss emotions, demonstrate empathy in daily life, and foster authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. They also teach conflict resolution, validate feelings, and listen more than they lecture, creating an environment of emotional safety. These practices help children develop crucial life skills like emotional regulation and social awareness, which are foundational for building healthy, real-world relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers on Nantucket are developing a novel approach to combat Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population, which are the primary carriers of the bacteria. Led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" project uses CRISPR technology to create mice with a heritable immunity to Lyme, aiming to break the transmission cycle to ticks. This method avoids disrupting the ecosystem by not culling the mouse population, which is a key part of the local food chain. The project is proceeding with extensive community consultation to ensure public buy-in before any potential release of the engineered mice into the wild.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has officially launched, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing the principles of free inquiry and open debate. Founded by prominent figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university seeks to counter what they describe as a pervasive culture of self-censorship and ideological conformity on other campuses. With an inaugural class of 92 students and tuition currently free, UATX emphasizes intellectual diversity and civil discourse, using the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk as a backdrop for the urgent national conversation on free speech. The institution aims to foster critical thinking without a predetermined political bias.</p>

          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies undertakes an extraordinary 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. Unlike other monarchs that live for about a month, this generation can live up to nine times longer by suppressing their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the journey. Scientists are still studying the mystery of how these butterflies navigate to the same location year after year. However, their population has declined by 70% in 30 years due to threats like illegal logging and the eradication of milkweed, their primary food source, prompting conservation efforts to protect their habitat.</p>

The loss came after the bullpen gave up three runs in the eighth inning. The game marked a franchise milestone, as the team's home attendance surpassed four million for the first time.

          <p>Former UK Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg has described the British prime minister's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump as "cringey" and "embarrassing." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg criticized what he called "endless knee-bending" and urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to more assertively "speak up" for British values. Clegg argued that the UK government's attempts to cultivate a close relationship with the Trump administration stem from a miscalculation that Britain does not have to choose between the U.S. and the EU. He cautioned against becoming too dependent on the U.S., particularly in the face of its lukewarm attitude towards NATO.</p>

          <p>Despite being available for over two decades, several misconceptions about hybrid vehicles persist among consumers. This article clarifies that most hybrids do not need to be plugged in, as they recharge their batteries through regenerative braking, unlike plug-in hybrids or full EVs. It also addresses maintenance costs, noting that while battery replacement can be expensive, it is covered by long warranties, and routine expenses may be lower due to reduced wear on the engine and brakes. Furthermore, the article explains that hybrids improve fuel efficiency on highways as well as in cities and that performance-oriented hybrids, like those from Porsche and McLaren, demonstrate the technology can also be used to enhance power and driving excitement.</p>

While the airport claims the expansion will create jobs and boost the local economy, the decision has faced strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups. Critics argue the expansion will increase noise and air pollution and undermine the UK's climate commitments.</p>

          <p>In a significant foreign policy shift, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced that the United Kingdom now formally recognizes a Palestinian state. The decision, made in coordination with Australia, Canada, and Portugal, is intended to revive the possibility of a two-state solution amid the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Starmer stated the move is not a reward for Hamas, which he says can have no future role in governance, but a pledge for a better future for both Israelis and Palestinians. The Israeli government fiercely criticized the decision, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it a "huge reward to terrorism."</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mountain lion, known as F390, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in San Juan Capistrano, leaving her two 14-month-old cubs to fend for themselves. Researchers with the UC Davis California Carnivores Program, who were tracking the mother, expressed concern for the adolescent cubs who are now without guidance at a critical learning stage. The team successfully fitted one of the cubs with a GPS collar to monitor her survival. The incident highlights the severe threat that road traffic poses to Southern California's fragmented mountain lion populations, with an estimated 100 killed by vehicles annually.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government has rejected President Trump's call for the United States to retake control of Bagram Air Base, a sprawling military facility the U.S. vacated during its 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump had claimed discussions were underway and issued a veiled threat of "BAD THINGS" if the base was not returned. In response, a Taliban spokesman cited the Doha Agreement, in which the U.S. pledged not to threaten Afghanistan's territorial integrity, and urged Washington to adopt a policy of realism. The exchange underscores the tense and informal nature of relations between the U.S. and the Taliban regime.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the startling moment the school's principal, James Marsh, discovered a black bear inside a dumpster he was unlocking. The video shows Marsh recoiling in surprise as the bear's head appears, after which both the principal and the bear quickly retreat in opposite directions. The incident, in which no one was harmed, serves as a reminder of the increasing frequency of human-wildlife encounters as natural habitats shrink. Experts emphasize the importance of securing trash and food sources to prevent attracting animals like bears into populated areas.</p>

          <p>With a September 30 government funding deadline fast approaching, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has publicly called on President Donald Trump to engage in bipartisan negotiations to prevent a shutdown. The urgency has increased after the Senate recently rejected separate funding proposals from both parties, raising the likelihood of a lapse in federal services. Democrats are insisting that any agreement must include an extension of enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, which remains a major point of contention. Both parties are actively positioning themselves to assign blame to the other should the government ultimately shut down. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli allowed Arsenal to salvage a 1-1 draw against Manchester City in a crucial Premier League match. After an early goal from Erling Haaland, City manager Pep Guardiola employed an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half, ceding possession in an attempt to protect the lead. The tactic, which saw City record its lowest possession figure in a league game under Guardiola, nearly succeeded. However, Arsenal's late breakthrough ensured a sharing of the points, a result that ultimately benefits league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the table.</p>

In her book, Harris expressed that while Buttigieg would have been an "ideal partner," the political risk was too great. Buttigieg responded by saying he believes in giving "Americans more credit," suggesting that voters are more focused on results than identity. The revelation and his response have sparked widespread online discussion about political realism versus idealism in the current American landscape.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa has intensified to become the most powerful storm on the planet this year, reaching sustained winds of 270 km/h, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane. Currently located northeast of the Philippines, the typhoon exhibits a highly organized structure with a clear, symmetrical eye, indicating its extreme strength. The storm's power is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures near 30°C and minimal wind shear. Ragasa is expected to maintain its peak intensity for a short period before gradually weakening as it moves towards the South China Sea, brushing past the Philippines.</p>

          <p>Leading Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have issued stark warnings that President Trump's actions are putting the United States on a path toward authoritarianism. These concerns were amplified by Trump's public call for the Justice Department to prosecute political opponents like Senator Adam Schiff and New York AG Letitia James. The situation was further intensified by an FCC threat against ABC's broadcast licenses following criticism from host Jimmy Kimmel, leading the network to suspend his show. Critics argue these moves represent a dangerous use of federal power to silence dissent and punish political enemies, transforming the nation into a "banana republic."</p>

Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting to illegally remain in power after his 2022 election loss. The protests reflect a deep societal division and a significant public outcry against what many see as an attempt to shield politicians from accountability for anti-democratic actions.</p>

          <p>Sharifeh Mohammadi, a 46-year-old engineer and labor rights activist in Iran, is facing execution after the Supreme Court upheld a death sentence for the third time. Accused of "armed rebellion against the state," Mohammadi was arrested in 2023 for her union activities, which the government deems an "opposition group." Human rights organizations and international trade unions have condemned the verdict, citing serious procedural flaws and a lack of evidence connecting her to any armed actions.
