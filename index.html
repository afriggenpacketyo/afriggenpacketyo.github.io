          <p>Amid already heightened tensions, Israel and Iran have engaged in direct military action, with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders, while Iran retaliated by launching drones towards Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced "Operation Rising Lion," aimed at rolling back Iran's nuclear capabilities, while Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened a harsh response. The exchange has disrupted international air travel and prompted the U.S. to issue shelter-in-place orders for personnel in Israel and the Trump administration ordered non-emergency U.S. personnel to leave Iraq. The situation has raised fears of a broader regional conflict and further strained relations between the two countries. Optimism surrounding potential nuclear talks has decreased significantly due to the recent attacks.</p>

Iranian news outlets reported multiple fatalities in Tehran and Natanz, home to a key nuclear facility. The International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran's Isfahan nuclear site was not impacted and that no radiation leaks were detected at the Natanz site. In retaliation, Iran launched approximately 100 drones toward Israeli territory, which Israel is attempting to intercept.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has announced a 100 billion yen policy package aimed at attracting foreign researchers, particularly those who may have left the United States due to research funding cuts. The initiative seeks to establish an elite research environment in Japan, as global competition for talent intensifies in fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. The government also plans to utilize profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support universities in producing internationally competitive research. The policy package will fund existing programs, raise salaries for researchers, and reduce their administrative burden, with the goal of making Japan the most attractive country in the world for researchers.</p>

Oil prices experienced the most dramatic market reaction, with crude futures jumping significantly due to concerns about potential supply disruptions. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that the operation against Iran would continue until the threat is removed, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that the attack was unilateral and made without U.S. support.</p>

          <p>The newly elected Mark Carney government in Canada is facing criticism for tabling a border bill that critics argue aligns with the United States' anti-immigrant and surveillance policies. Bill C-2, or the Strong Borders Act, grants extensive powers to the immigration minister to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake in any immigration stream, potentially leading to mass deportation by administrative means. It also enhances law enforcement's access to citizens' data and electronic information, raising concerns about privacy rights. Critics argue that the bill infringes on due process and constructs a surveillance state, disproportionately affecting women, racialized claimants, and LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

The piece explores the factors that may have influenced Netanyahu's decision, including a perceived weakening of Iran's regional influence and the recent open sparring between Israel and Tehran. It also touches on the consternation of Netanyahu, who was blindsided during a visit to the White House in April, when President Donald Trump announced the United States and Iran were poised to begin direct nuclear talks.

          <h2>The Historical and Contemporary Enmity Between Iran and Israel</h2>

          <p>This article explores the historical roots of the conflict between Iran and Israel, tracing the shift from allies before the 1979 Islamic Revolution to sworn enemies in the decades since. It examines how Iran's animosity towards Israel grew after the revolution, driven by criticism of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and a desire to gain favor among regional Arab states. The piece also highlights the role of Iranian support for groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the current Iranian leadership's continued hostility towards Israel. It concludes by noting that while not all Iranians support the country's anti-Israel stance, staunch backers of the Islamic Republic remain committed to opposing Israel and the great powers.</p>

          <h2>Why Israel Chose to Strike Iran Now</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>

          <p>This article explores the reasons behind Israel's decision to launch a military attack on Iran's nuclear program now, after contemplating such action for two decades. Israel claims that Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble nuclear weapons, a claim that is difficult to verify but reflects a shift in Iran's political calculations. The article argues that Iran's deterrent power has been diminished by Israel's repeated attacks on Iranian soldiers and proxies, making a nuclear weapon the only way to recover lost deference. The attacks carry risks of Iranian retaliation, but these risks are considered less if Iran is at its weakest.</p>

          <h2>Letters of Credit Help Chinese Exporters Focus on Domestic Market Amid Trade War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the United States imposing reciprocal tariffs on imports from China, Beijing has taken measures to help Chinese exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. One of these measures is encouraging the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to ensure payment security and enhance credit for businesses. Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international L/Cs, guaranteeing payment to the seller, but can also be used in the trade of services, unlike international L/Cs which are limited to physical goods. This strategy aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions and support Chinese businesses.</p>

          <h2>German Machinery Makers Urge EU Action on China</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German machinery makers, represented by the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), are calling for the European Union to implement trade barriers to protect them from increasingly strong Chinese competitors. This marks a shift from their previous support of the Sino-German economic miracle. The VDMA is requesting that the EU impose countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, with a particular focus on China's aggressive export policy. The industry group argues that Chinese companies receive heavy government subsidies and sometimes disregard technical regulations, creating an uneven playing field.</p>

          <p>Japan is hoping to secure special treatment in its tariff negotiations with the United States, according to Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. This comes after U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at a further rise in import levies on cars. Akazawa stated that once bilateral negotiations are finalized, Japan expects to be treated differently from other countries. Trump has asserted that all manufacturing in the United States is surging due to the 25 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts imposed earlier this year, but another hike in U.S. tariffs on cars would further hurt Japan's automotive industry.</p>

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully relaunched its new 5,000-ton naval destroyer, less than a month after it capsized during the first attempted launch. The country's leader, Kim Jong Un, reportedly reacted furiously to the warship's failed launch in May and demanded it be quickly repaired. The ship is one of two brand new 5,000-ton naval destroyers North Korea has built over the past year, now the biggest ships in Pyongyang's fleet and capable of launching nuclear weapons. Experts question whether the repairs are truly complete given the speed of the relaunch, however Kim has made it a priority to develop a nuclear-armed navy, and plans to build two more of these destroyers in the coming year.</p>

          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth supplies in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports. Experts suggest that India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but it will require more public and private investment in the sector. Indian officials are evaluating how Indian Rare Earths (IREL), a government-owned company, can be leveraged to increase rare earth magnet production. This move comes after China's pause in exports of rare earth elements was called a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative.</p>
