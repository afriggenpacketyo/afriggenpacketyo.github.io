        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions have risen between Ghana and China over the significant issue of illegal gold mining, which has caused widespread environmental damage. Ghanaian authorities have pointed to the involvement of Chinese nationals, prompting a response from China's ambassador to Ghana. The ambassador argued that Chinese citizens are often brought in by local Ghanaians who facilitate the illegal operations, stating that the perception of Chinese nationals being solely to blame is unfair. This diplomatic friction highlights the complex challenges of regulating informal mining sectors.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively strengthening its security ties with Israel, as demonstrated by a recent visit from Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt. During the visit, Dobrindt offered unqualified support for Israel's actions regarding Iran's nuclear program and announced plans to establish a joint cyber-research center. This move to deepen intelligence and security collaboration comes as Germany looks to draw upon Israel's defense expertise to bolster its own capabilities in the face of growing global threats. The cooperation underscores the close alliance between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In response to growing security threats, prominent German politicians are calling for a significant enhancement of the nation's defense capabilities. Jens Spahn of the CDU has proposed German or European participation in the nuclear arsenals of France and the UK, arguing a European nuclear deterrent is necessary. Separately, CSU leader Markus SÃ¶der has advocated for a German "Iron Dome" style defense shield, including thousands of Patriot missiles and a large drone army. These proposals signal a major shift in Germany's defense posture.</p>

          <p>Germany's political landscape is currently marked by a contentious debate over the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

In contrast, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt of the conservative CSU has urged caution, advocating for the legal process to conclude before taking such a drastic step.

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large technology companies just one day before it was set to take effect. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was "terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada" in response to the tax, which would have retroactively affected U.S. firms like Google and Amazon. Ottawa stated the move was made "in anticipation" of resuming negotiations for a comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has taken effect, significantly benefiting the British car industry by reducing a 25% tariff down to 10%.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a notable side effect has emerged: they are more likely to induce motion sickness in passengers. Researchers have found that the unique characteristics of EVs, particularly their rapid acceleration and regenerative braking systems, are to blame. The low-frequency deceleration caused by regenerative braking, which recharges the battery, is a key factor in provoking feelings of queasiness. This has prompted studies into engineering solutions to create a more comfortable and less nauseating ride for EV passengers.</p>
