            <h2>Wisconsin State Agencies, University System Failed to Track DEI Spending, Audit Reveals</h2>

            <p>The University of Wisconsin system and several state agencies failed to specifically track spending on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, Wisconsin's Legislative Audit Bureau (WLAB) recently revealed. The audits covered FY 2023-2024. As a result of this lack of tracking, WLAB, a state government agency, was forced to estimate what the institutions spent on these programs. WLAB stated in its audit of University of Wisconsin institutions that it estimates the system spent $12.5 million on salaries for employees with job titles relating to DEI. Additionally, WLAB estimated the university spent $40.2 million "on offices with duties pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion." However, WLAB clarified that not all of those funds were specifically dedicated to DEI.</p>

            <p>A recent audit by Wisconsin's Legislative Audit Bureau (WLAB) revealed that the University of Wisconsin system and several state agencies failed to specifically track spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives during FY 2023-2024. WLAB estimated the university system spent $12.5 million on DEI-related salaries and $40.2 million on DEI-related offices, while state agencies spent about $2.2 million on salaries for DEI positions. The audits, ordered by state Republicans, highlight challenges in calculating exact DEI spending due to overlapping costs and inconsistent reporting to the Department of Administration.</p>

            <p>Economists are debating the impact of President Trump's tariff policies, weighing the potential preservation of American jobs against the increased costs for US consumers. A Pennsylvania State University economist suggests that while tariffs could protect manufacturing jobs by discouraging imports, consumers would likely face higher prices for goods. This debate highlights the complex trade-offs involved in Trump's approach to trade and its potential effects on different segments of the American population.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for arresting and detaining pro-Palestinian protesters, allegedly labeling them as "Hamas supporters" based on Project Esther, a plan from the Heritage Foundation. This plan advocates for deporting student visa and green-card holders critical of Israel and using anti-racketeering laws against pro-Palestinian groups. Critics argue this conflates support for Palestinian rights with support for Hamas and undermines constitutional protections, potentially stoking antisemitism and harming academic freedom. The Diaspora Alliance argues that such tactics will not combat antisemitism and may actually increase it.</p>

            <p>Beijing and northern China experienced severe gales, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and suspension of train lines. Wind gusts reached up to 93mph, the strongest in the capital in over half a century, prompting authorities to urge residents to stay indoors.

            <p>Tourism in Los Angeles is suffering due to Trump's tariffs and deportation policies, with businesses reporting a decline in visitors and increased anxiety among international travelers. Canadian tourists, in particular, are boycotting American products and canceling travel plans due to Trump's threats and immigration policies. Local hotels are bracing for price increases on goods and services due to tariffs, and businesses are concerned about cancellations of conferences and reduced travel spending. The Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board is worried about the negative impact on the perception of the U.S. as a travel destination.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has issued rulings this week declaring that migrants have the right to a hearing before they are deported. The Supreme Court this week put an important check on President Trump’s power to arrest and quickly deport people who are alleged to be members of a foreign crime gang. Those who face deportation “are entitled to notice and opportunity to challenge their removal” before a federal judge, the court said. They must be given “a reasonable time ... that will allow them” to make their case on why they should be spared from deportation, the justices said.</p>

Regional Water Quality Control Board found no dangerous levels of wildfire-related chemicals. However, beachgoers are warned to watch out for physical debris like sharp objects. There are no plans to remove the sediment due to potential coastal erosion and harm to marine habitat, as the ecosystem will naturally recover.</p>

            <p>A Trump administration plan to share IRS data with ICE is causing fear among undocumented taxpayers in California, who worry about being targeted for immigration enforcement. The deal, outlined in a memorandum of understanding, has drawn criticism from state leaders and immigrant rights groups, who argue it will undermine trust and discourage tax payments. California relies heavily on tax revenue from undocumented immigrants, and the plan could have significant economic consequences.</p>

            <p>California’s national forests are on the chopping block — literally — in the wake of the Trump administration’s April 5 order to immediately expand timber production in the United States. Last week, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins issued an emergency declaration that ordered the U.S. Forest Service to open up some 112.5 million acres of national forestland to logging. The announcement included a grainy map of affected forests, which did not specify forest names or the amount of impacted acreage in each. However, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials have confirmed to The Times that the order will touch all 18 of the Golden State’s national forests, which collectively span more than 20 million acres.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has ordered the expansion of timber production in all of California's national forests, opening up over 20 million acres to logging. The directive stems from President Trump's executive order to increase American timber production by 25%, arguing it will boost domestic timber supplies, create jobs, and reduce wildfire risks. Environmental groups have criticized the order, saying it will bypass environmental laws and harm endangered species. Experts debate the effectiveness of large-scale logging in reducing wildfire risks.</p>

Some commenters argued that expecting the man to pay is old-fashioned, while others maintained that the person who initiates the date should offer to pay. The woman, who prefers a dynamic where the man takes the lead and covers the first date, ultimately decided not to pursue a second date due to an overall "off" vibe.</p>

            <p>Farmers in the US are worried about the impact of China's steep tariffs on U.S. exports, which are making farm supplies more expensive and raising the risk of retaliation against U.S. crops. President Trump has imposed tariffs on countries worldwide, including a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, leading to concerns about losing customers. While the White House is considering ways to help farmers, the payments are not a fix for the longer-term damage done by tariffs. China's increased purchases of Brazilian soybeans during a previous trade dispute highlight the potential for lasting market losses.</p>

Researchers tested crows' ability to identify irregular quadrilaterals among squares and parallelograms, demonstrating their understanding of right angles, parallel lines, and symmetry. This discovery challenges assumptions about mathematical abilities in the animal kingdom and opens new avenues for investigating cognitive skills in other species.</p>
