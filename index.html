          <p>A Wisconsin county judge, Hannah Dugan, was arrested by the FBI on obstruction charges for allegedly interfering with the arrest of an immigrant by ICE agents at her courthouse. According to the FBI, Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected agents away from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who had been previously deported and illegally re-entered the U.S., after he arrived for a court appearance. Witnesses claim Dugan escorted Flores-Ruiz through a non-public exit, though he was later apprehended following a foot chase. Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin criticized the arrest as part of President Trump's undermining of the courts.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine are nearing a deal following talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and President Putin in Moscow, though Ukraine was not present at the meeting. Trump expressed support for Russia retaining Crimea, a stance rejected by Ukrainian President Zelensky, who insists only the Ukrainian people can decide the fate of their territories. Despite pressure from Trump to concede territory, Zelensky indicated a willingness to discuss territorial issues if a full ceasefire is agreed upon, while criticizing Russia for failing to agree to previous ceasefire proposals.</p>

          <p>Sources claim that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office implemented a system allowing him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols. A computer monitor in Hegseth's office reportedly provides remote access to his personal cellphone's Signal app and text messages, even within a sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF) where cellphones are prohibited. This revelation follows reports that Hegseth shared details about U.S. airstrikes in Yemen within a private Signal group that included individuals without a clear need-to-know, raising further security concerns.</p>

          <p>A group of Yale University classmates has penned an open letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging him to reconsider his role in the Trump administration, arguing that it is leading the United States towards authoritarianism. The letter, signed by over 140 alumni, implores Bessent to stand up for democratic principles and not be responsible for enabling fascism. Bessent responded by defending his service to the American people within the Trump administration, dismissing his critics as close-minded progressives. This echoes a similar letter sent to former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in 2017.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) claims to have saved billions in US government spending, but an analysis by BBC Verify raises questions about the evidence supporting these claims. While Doge reports significant savings from cancelling contracts and reducing fraud, the analysis found a lack of evidence for some of the largest claimed savings, with accounting errors and overstated figures. For example, Doge's largest listed saving from cancelling a contract for a migrant children's facility appears to be based on speculative figures, with the actual savings significantly lower.</p>

          <p>Royal Caribbean recently made a major change to the itinerary of several of their cruise routes. The popular cruise line will no longer be making stops at Labadee, Haiti. Labadee is home to a private beach resort owned by Royal Caribbean. The change is being made due to the increase in crime, gang activity, and political unrest in Haiti. The U.S. Department of State has given the island nation a level 4 travel advisory, the highest level alert they issue, citing, “Do not travel to Haiti due to kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care.”</p>
