          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested at Columbia University after occupying Butler Library in an attempt to revive campus protests from the previous spring. The protesters, who renamed the library ‚Äúthe Basel Al-Araj Popular University,‚Äù faced a standoff with security before the NYPD was called in to make arrests. Acting President Claire Shipman cited safety concerns as the reason for involving the police, noting that two public safety officers were injured. The university is also under pressure from the Trump administration, which has cut federal research funding due to concerns about the protection of Jewish students. This article provides a comprehensive account of the events, including the motivations of the protesters and the university's response.</p>
