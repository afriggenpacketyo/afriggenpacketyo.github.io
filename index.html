          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died after being struck by a boat in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay, an incident that also threw a passenger overboard. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found on a shallow sandbar. Officials were alerted to the whale's presence in the bay shortly before the collision was reported. Due to tidal conditions and the need for heavy equipment, a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death is scheduled for Monday. Boaters are being advised to use caution in the area.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending the termination of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report that included downward revisions for previous months. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited these revisions as evidence for the decision, while President Trump accused the agency of rigging numbers. The move has sparked criticism from economists, who fear it could undermine public trust in government data. Hassett stated the president "wants his own people there" to ensure data is more transparent and reliable, dismissing concerns that the firing was retaliation for unfavorable economic news.</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans have introduced a new congressional redistricting map that could significantly alter the state's political landscape by adding up to five GOP seats. The proposed changes would redraw district lines in Democratic areas like Dallas, notably moving the home of Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett outside of her current district. Democratic leaders have condemned the plan as a partisan power grab designed to silence voters and may force some incumbent Democrats to run against each other. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has vowed to fight the proposal politically, governmentally, and in court.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old woman has been arrested in New Zealand after a two-year-old girl was found alive inside her suitcase in the luggage compartment of a bus. The bus driver became suspicious after noticing the bag moving and discovered the child upon opening it. Police reported the girl was very hot but appeared to be physically unharmed and has since been taken to a hospital for assessment. The woman faces charges of ill-treatment and neglect of a child. Authorities commended the bus driver for his immediate action, which they said prevented a potentially worse outcome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of mis-sold car finance, with payouts expected to be less than £950 per deal. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that found hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, but allowed for claims where commissions were unfairly large. The FCA will consult on a payout scheme, estimated to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with the first payments anticipated next year. The regulator advised that claims could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and urged consumers to contact their loan providers directly. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where taste tests and spicy challenges go viral. While effective, restaurants face the challenge that younger diners move on from trends quickly, pushing brands to constantly innovate with new, often globally-inspired, flavor profiles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and staunch supporter of Donald Trump, as the U.S. Attorney for Washington D.C. The vote was 50-45, falling along party lines. Pirro, who previously served as a district attorney and judge in New York, has been a controversial figure for promoting false claims about the 2020 election. Her confirmation places a prominent Trump loyalist in charge of the nation's largest federal prosecutor's office, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats who question her impartiality and fitness for the role.</p>

          <p>In response to recent Israeli airstrikes that exposed vulnerabilities, Iran has revived a high-level defense council for the first time since the Iran-Iraq War. The new council, chaired by President Masoud Pezeshkian, will centralize command over the military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to improve coordination. This move is seen as a significant shake-up of Iran's national security apparatus, aiming to reassert control and prepare for potential future conflicts. The restructuring signals that Tehran is adopting a wartime posture, raising concerns about escalating tensions with Israel and the United States.</p>

The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard detailing the impeachments was removed from a section on presidential power limits. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied that the removal was due to pressure from the Trump administration, explaining the placard did not meet museum standards for presentation.

The trend has prompted debate, with some celebrating it as female self-determination while political groups like the far-right AfD call for pro-natalist policies.

          <p>State media footage suggests that China's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult launch system. A segment aired by CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a jet for take-off from the carrier. This marks a significant milestone for the Fujian, which is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy. The successful test moves the vessel closer to its expected entry into service with the People's Liberation Army Navy later this year.</p>

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by rambling statements and factual errors, have renewed questions about his mental fitness. Experts point to instances of him drifting off-topic, such as a lengthy, unprompted rant about windmills, and confabulating stories, like a false claim about his uncle and the Unabomber. While the White House dismisses these concerns, some psychologists suggest his behavior shows signs of cognitive deterioration. This scrutiny follows a period where President Biden's mental acuity was heavily questioned, highlighting a growing focus on the cognitive health of presidential candidates.</p>

          <h2>Divorce Attorneys Suggest Ways to Protect Finances During a Rocky Marriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For couples facing marital difficulties without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies to protect personal finances. The first is to gather comprehensive information about all joint assets, liabilities, and accounts while still married, as access is easier. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, or postnup, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys advise that proactively addressing these financial matters can provide security and prevent more significant conflicts later on.</p>

          <p>A report by HR technology firm Checkr has ranked the best U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential, with mid-sized cities like Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin taking the top spots. The study analyzed the 100 largest metro areas based on factors like unemployment rates, income growth, and labor force size. Notably absent from the top 10 are major coastal hubs like New York and Los Angeles. The findings suggest a geographic shift in opportunity, where strong job markets and high earning potential are increasingly found in more affordable, growing mid-sized cities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific calming phrases can effectively manage children's tantrums by fostering connection rather than control. Instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" can validate their emotions and make them feel safe. This approach helps regulate a child's nervous system and teaches them that their feelings are acceptable, which can reduce the intensity and frequency of future meltdowns. The goal is to set boundaries with compassion, not shame.</p>

          <p>Recent geopolitical shifts, including the direct conflict between Iran and Israel, are reportedly causing China to reassess its traditionally neutral stance in the Middle East. An expert analysis suggests Beijing perceives a weakened Iran and is increasingly recognizing Israel's strategic importance, particularly in technology and innovation. While maintaining its energy interests with Arab nations and Iran, China is also expanding its economic ties with Israel, with bilateral trade growing. This pragmatic pivot could see China playing a more significant role as a mediator, aiming to enhance its global image while balancing complex regional rivalries.</p>

While the exact number is unclear, reports suggest up to 300 children could be brought over, accompanied by a parent or guardian. This initiative follows criticism that the government had not previously established a formal medical evacuation scheme during the conflict. The plan is being developed as aid organizations continue to warn of a dire humanitarian crisis and a collapsing healthcare system within Gaza.</p>
