          <h2>IBM Shares Decline Despite Overall Earnings Beat as Software Revenue Falls Short</h2>

          <p>International Business Machines (IBM) experienced a notable drop in its stock price despite reporting second-quarter results that surpassed overall Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue. The decline was primarily driven by the company's software revenue, which, despite growing 10%, fell short of analyst consensus estimates. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients are exercising caution due to geopolitical tensions and reprioritizing their spending towards hardware. However, the company maintained its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow, expressing optimism about its generative AI business and a more rational environment for mergers and acquisitions.

          <h2>Tesla's Q2 Profits Slump Amidst Concerns Over CEO Elon Musk's Political Impact on Brand</h2>

          <p>Tesla reported a 16% slump in profits and a 12% drop in revenue for the second quarter, marking a continued financial downturn for the electric vehicle manufacturer. Analysts attribute the decline not only to increased competition but also to the negative perception of CEO Elon Musk, whose political activities have reportedly damaged the brand's reputation among potential buyers. One Forrester analyst described Tesla as a "toxic brand that is inseparable from its leader," alienating customers in key markets. Despite the poor quarterly performance, some investors remain focused on the company's long-term prospects in autonomous robotaxis and artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share, causing its stock to rise in after-hours trading. The company's overall revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, with strong performance from its YouTube and Google Cloud segments. In a significant move, Alphabet also raised its projected capital expenditures for 2025 by $10 billion, bringing the total to $85 billion, primarily to support growing demand for its Cloud and AI services. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of AI Overviews and the Gemini app, signaling a continued aggressive investment in artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's second-quarter earnings report revealed a 16% decline in automotive revenue, falling for the second straight quarter and missing analyst estimates. The company's financial performance has been affected by several factors, including backlash from CEO Elon Musk's political activities and new legislative changes like the repeal of a federal EV tax credit. CFO Vaibhav Taneja warned of limited vehicle supply in the U.S. due to supply chain shifts necessitated by tariffs. While near-term financials are weak, Musk directed focus towards the future of autonomous ride-hailing, aiming to make it available to half the U.S. population by year's end, pending regulatory approval.

          <p>A new Fox News national survey reveals significant challenges for President Donald Trump six months into his second term, with a majority of voters disapproving of his job performance and his recently signed budget law. The poll indicates that 54% of voters disapprove of the president, and 58% disapprove of the new budget, with key elements like increasing the debt ceiling being highly unpopular. Despite these headwinds, the survey shows slight improvements in public perception of the economy and the country's direction. Trump's approval rating remains steady at 46%, and he receives his highest marks for handling border security, while facing disapproval on the economy and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, President Trump was informed by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May that his name appeared multiple times within the government's files on Jeffrey Epstein. The officials reportedly advised against releasing additional documents due to the presence of child pornography and sensitive victim information, a decision Trump deferred to. This revelation comes as the administration faces pressure from its base to release the files, a promise Trump made during his campaign. The White House has dismissed the story, while Bondi and her deputy stated they simply made the President aware of their findings, which they concluded warranted no further prosecution.</p>

This decision came shortly before a report emerged that President Trump had been told his name was in the Epstein files, a claim the White House has denied.

          <p>The ubiquitous word "OK" is a uniquely American invention that originated as a joke in 19th-century Boston before being popularized by a presidential campaign. Most scholars trace its first appearance to a Boston newspaper in 1839 as a playful abbreviation for "oll korrect," a deliberate misspelling of "all correct." The term gained widespread prominence during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," referencing his nickname "Old Kinderhook." Its simplicity and versatility allowed it to flourish in the technological age, spreading globally with American soldiers during the world wars and becoming one of the most recognized words on the planet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on home sales, a move aimed at stimulating the housing market. Currently, profits from a primary home sale are taxed once they exceed $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples. The proposal follows the introduction of the "No Tax on Home Sales Act" by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who argues the tax penalizes long-term homeowners, especially seniors in high-value areas. While the National Association of Realtors supports reform, some experts believe a complete elimination is unlikely, suggesting that raising the existing exemption thresholds is a more probable outcome.

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a year since the Obama administration in 2014. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 deportations in the first half of the year, projecting an annual total over 300,000. While this represents a significant increase fueled by a government-wide crackdown, it still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations. With a recent infusion of billions in funding, officials believe the one-million target could become possible as the agency plans to hire 10,000 new agents and expand detention capacity.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. against right-wing podcast host Candace Owens. The complaint responds to an eight-part series in which Owens spread baseless claims that the first lady was born a man and had transitioned. The lawsuit states that Owens rejected multiple retraction demands and continued to publish "outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions" for fame and profit. A spokesperson for Owens framed the lawsuit as an attack on First Amendment rights by a foreign government. The Macrons hope the legal action will end what they describe as a "campaign of global humiliation."</p>

          <p>In a temporary ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to fire, without cause, three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) who were appointed by former President Biden. The decision challenges a 90-year-old precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects the independence of certain regulatory agencies by limiting the president's power to remove officials except for misconduct. The fired commissioners had sued, arguing their removal was unlawful. The Trump administration contended the president has the right to remove officials who exercise executive power. The court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision, which allows the firings while the case proceeds in lower courts.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's internal watchdog has reportedly obtained evidence that encrypted Signal messages from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's account contained details from a classified email. According to senior officials, the messages, which detailed a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen, derived information from an email marked "SECRET//NOFORN," indicating its disclosure could cause serious damage to national security. The existence of the Signal chat became public when a reporter was inadvertently added. Despite initial denials from the administration that any classified information was shared, the Inspector General is now evaluating the secretary's use of commercial messaging apps for official business.</p>

          <p>The viral video of a married CEO and his subordinate cuddling at a Coldplay concert has sparked a broader conversation about privacy in the digital age. This article analyzes how the incident quickly escalated from a lighthearted moment into a public spectacle fueled by online sleuths, social media commentary, and even corporate marketing. The author discusses the phenomenon of "panopticontent," where ordinary people are unwillingly turned into public figures, blurring the lines between public observation and invasive surveillance. The case highlights a growing cultural tendency to commodify personal drama and raises ethical questions about how easily private information can be accessed and weaponized for entertainment.</p>

          <p>According to the Global Footprint Network, July 24 marks Earth Overshoot Day for the year, the date when humanity's demand for ecological resources exceeds what the planet can regenerate in that entire year. This year's date arrived more than a week earlier than the last, partly due to revised data showing oceans absorb less CO2 than previously thought. The trend of overconsumption, which began in the 1970s, is visible in deforestation, biodiversity loss, and atmospheric carbon accumulation. High-income nations like Qatar and the U.S. reach their individual overshoot days much earlier in the year, highlighting a global disparity in resource consumption that experts warn is creating a dangerous ecological debt.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, is reportedly struggling to secure grand jury indictments in cases against individuals accused of misconduct during recent protests over immigration raids. Despite filing felony charges against at least 38 people, many cases have been dismissed or reduced to misdemeanors after grand juries refused to indict, an unusually rare outcome. Some federal law enforcement officials have raised concerns about the strength of the cases and the reliability of statements from immigration agents. Critics suggest Essayli is pushing legal limits to align with the administration's political priorities, while his office maintains it is unapologetically prosecuting assaults on federal agents.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant rulings, federal judges in Tennessee and Maryland have acted to protect Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immediate deportation. A Tennessee judge ordered his release from criminal custody while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges, denying a Justice Department request to keep him detained. Concurrently, a Maryland judge barred immigration authorities from immediately taking him into custody upon release and ordered he be returned to supervised status in Maryland. The rulings are a rebuke of what his lawyers call the government's "lawless conduct," after he was previously deported in what the administration admitted was an "administrative error."</p>

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City was a pivotal moment that fundamentally changed how the United States responds to missing children cases. Before Patz, police departments often had mandatory waiting periods before opening an investigation, a practice that has since been replaced by an understanding of immediate action. The case spurred the creation of national registries, emergency alert systems, and better inter-agency communication. It also led to the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and ignited a cultural shift, popularizing the concept of "stranger danger" and creating a generation of more cautious parents.</p>

Critics, including opposition lawmakers and EU officials, warn that the move destroys the independence of these crucial institutions and is a "serious step back" for Ukraine's path toward EU integration.
