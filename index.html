          <p>Karla Flores, experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem. During an MRI before surgery, a second chordoma was discovered on her spine. Dr. Mohamed Labib devised a plan to remove both tumors, including a novel "third nostril" approach through Flores' eye to access the spinal tumor. The 20-hour surgery successfully removed the tumor, and Flores underwent radiation and rehabilitation, with no evidence of cancer a year later, though she faces significant medical bills. The procedure could potentially be used for other difficult-to-reach tumors. The optimism score is based on the successful treatment and innovative surgical approach used in Flores' case.</p>

          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for expelling transgender troops, requiring them to voluntarily leave active duty by June 6, after which involuntary separations will begin. The guidance instructs personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth and outlines criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria. Critics argue that these policies are worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and that they contradict the military's promise to treat transgender service members with dignity and respect. The new policy has raised concerns about national security and the future employment prospects of transgender veterans.</p>

          <p>US immigration authorities are collecting and uploading the DNA information of migrants, including children, to a national criminal database. The database, managed by the FBI, includes DNA of individuals arrested or convicted of a crime. Experts criticize this practice as a massive expansion of genetic surveillance and an unjustified invasion of privacy, with more than 133,000 migrant teens and children's DNA collected and uploaded to Codis. The expansion was possible because there are fewer limitations on DNA collection within the context of immigration.</p>
