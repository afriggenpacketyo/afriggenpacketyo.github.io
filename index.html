          <p>Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP), led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, achieved a decisive victory in the country's 14th general election, securing 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats.

The PAP increased its vote share to 65.57%, a notable improvement from the 61.2% in the 2020 election. Wong emphasized that the results signal trust, stability, and confidence in the government, while the U.S. and EU expressed their commitment to strengthening ties with Singapore.

          <p>China is undergoing a transformation where engineers, biologists, and physicists are increasingly governing the nation, marking a shift towards technocratic meritocracy. A study reveals that nearly half of the Communist Party's youngest bureau-level officials hold PhDs, with a significant proportion possessing technical backgrounds. This pivot is rooted in Chinese tradition, where scholar-officials were revered, and today's technocrats are evaluated by competence rather than ideology. This trend reflects a broader shift where state-affiliated roles offer stability amidst economic uncertainty, attracting highly educated individuals to public service.</p>

          <p>Millions of workers in China, particularly in the tech industry, fear the "curse of 35," a term describing the risk of being laid off once they reach that age. This phenomenon reflects growing age discrimination amid a tight job market, with many job listings explicitly stating candidates should be no older than 35. The perception of 35-year-olds being too old stems from a combination of factors, including the industry's fast-paced nature and a preference for younger, often cheaper, labor.</p>

          <h2>Conclave Author Draws Parallels Between Papal Selection and TV Show 'The Traitors'</h2>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave," which was adapted into an Oscar-winning film, draws a comparison between the selection of a new Pope and the TV show "The Traitors," highlighting the element of surprise and shifting alliances. Harris argues that the secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a "rather brilliant device" for finding the right leader, a process that UK political parties should emulate. He also expresses his belief that the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and papal elections is anachronistic. Harris was granted special access to parts of the Vatican while researching his novel.</p>

          <p>America's European allies are experiencing a period of reckoning and backlash during President Trump's first 100 days, marked by trade disputes and shaken alliances. Trump's rhetoric and tariff policies have shocked and insulted Europeans, undermining trade relationships and raising concerns about NATO's commitment to European defense. While Europeans acknowledge the need to increase defense spending, they fear that the Trump administration may abandon them, jeopardizing one of the greatest alliances in modern history. The uncertainty has prompted a reevaluation of transatlantic relations and a push for greater European self-reliance.</p>

The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining.

Critics, primarily Democrats, argue that the bill will siphon funds from already underfunded public schools, benefiting wealthier students.

Despite his downfall, Filner is remembered for his advocacy for labor, environmental, and civil rights issues, tracing back to his involvement in the Freedom Rides in the 1960s.
