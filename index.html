          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has initiated an investigation into the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) regarding accusations of discrimination based on race, color, sex, and national origin in its hiring and employment practices. The probe cites CalEPA's "Practices to Advance Racial Equity in Workforce Planning" document, which advocates for a "racial equity lens" in workforce development and diverse interview panels. This investigation aligns with broader federal scrutiny of DEI policies in state agencies, following similar actions against other institutions. The DOJ emphasizes that race-based employment practices violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>

          <p>Italy's recent surge in banking mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has encountered significant obstacles, with several high-profile bids failing or being challenged. UniCredit withdrew its bid for Banco BPM due to opaque government conditions, and Mediobanca's offer for Banca Generali was rejected by shareholders. State-backed Monte dei Paschi (MPS) continues its pursuit of Mediobanca, highlighting ongoing consolidation efforts in Europe's fragmented banking sector. These developments underscore the complexities of navigating national "golden power" rules and the European Union's push for cross-border banking integration, as Italy becomes a case study for M&A evolution in the EU.

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, is preparing for the inaugural test launch of its Soyuz-5 rocket in December, aiming for full operational status by 2028. This medium-class launch vehicle, a reincarnation of the Zenit-2, is designed to carry a 17-ton payload and features powerful RD-171MV engines. The project proceeds despite significant funding shortages faced by Roscosmos since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which led to severed ties with the European Space Agency and a shift to launching from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome. The successful launch would mark a crucial step for Russia's independent space capabilities.</p>

Kim is accused of stock manipulation, receiving free opinion polls, and accepting luxury gifts in exchange for business favors. These indictments follow President Lee Jae Myung's approval of investigations into the previous administration, signaling a significant political shake-up and legal scrutiny for high-ranking officials.</p>

          <p>The White House has named Jim O'Neill, deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the new acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), following the ouster of Susan Monarez.

This change comes amidst a wave of resignations from senior CDC leaders, who cite concerns over vaccine policy, budget cuts, and the "weaponizing of public health" under Kennedy's leadership. The appointments signal a shift in the agency's direction, sparking widespread concern among health experts and lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit marks a potential thaw in relations, despite deep-seated suspicions and border disputes. Both nations face U.S. tariffs, pushing them towards reluctant economic cooperation. India seeks to curb its widening trade deficit with China and leverage its "China Plus One" manufacturing strategy, while China eyes access to India's market amid domestic slowdowns. The summit could signal a willingness to find common ground, though experts remain cautious about the long-term prospects of a lasting friendship given historical grievances and differing geopolitical alignments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. tariff exemption for global parcel shipments valued under $800, known as the de minimis rule, officially ended, impacting businesses and supply chains. This permanent change, championed by the Trump administration, aims to increase tariff revenues by up to $10 billion annually and restrict the flow of narcotics like fentanyl. A six-month transition period allows for flat duties of $80-$200 per package, depending on origin, before full ad valorem rates apply. Critics express concerns about rising costs for consumers and small businesses, alongside potential disruptions to international mail services, though major carriers are reportedly prepared.</p>

This policy change, which subjects these parcels to a 10% tariff for UK goods, is expected to increase costs and create barriers for small businesses exporting to the U.S. Many small business owners, like Helen Hickman, have paused shipments due to the inability to provide upfront costs to customers and fears of excessive charges or returns. The Federation of Small Businesses warns this will hinder UK firms competing with larger brands and force some to stop exporting to the U.S. entirely.</p>

          <h2>Three Former Memphis Officers Granted New Trial in Tyre Nichols Case Due to Judge Bias Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted in connection with the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. The decision by Judge Sheryl Lipman stems from concerns of bias after the original presiding judge allegedly suggested the Memphis Police Department was "infiltrated to the top with gang members." Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing his death. This development prolongs the legal process in a case that sparked nationwide protests against police brutality.</p>

          <p>A former Department of Justice employee, Sean Charles Dunn, accused of throwing a "Subway" sandwich at a federal officer, has been charged with misdemeanor assault after prosecutors failed to secure a felony indictment from a grand jury. Dunn allegedly shouted expletives at federal officers deployed to Washington D.C. by President Trump to address crime. Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly touted Dunn's termination from the DOJ. This case marks the second recent instance where prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. have been unable to obtain a requested indictment for alleged assaults on federal law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, continues to struggle with rebuilding efforts, citing ongoing disputes with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over $34 million in outstanding funding. Mayor Andrew Gilich highlights critical unfinished projects, including a pier and vital sewage and stormwater system upgrades, which are stalled due to FEMA's refusal to approve increased cost estimates. The city's experience reflects broader issues, with 254 other post-Katrina projects in Louisiana and Mississippi remaining incomplete. This situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's proposed overhaul of FEMA, raising concerns about future disaster response.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3) have triggered a "snapback mechanism" to reimpose major UN sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's "clear and deliberate" non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. This move, which could restore sanctions in 30 days, comes amidst escalating tensions following Iran's increased nuclear activities and its barring of UN inspectors. Iran's foreign minister rejected the E3's legal jurisdiction, asserting readiness for "fair and balanced" negotiations if goodwill is shown. The U.S., which withdrew from the deal in 2018, welcomed the snapback, while expressing openness to direct engagement for a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>A prestigious Napa Valley winery, Hundred Acre, is reportedly under investigation by California fire officials for its potential role in sparking the 6,800-acre Pickett fire. The blaze, which ignited on August 21 at an address part of the winery's property, continues to threaten hundreds of buildings and dozens of wineries. A source suggests investigators are examining whether discarded ashes from the vineyard could have caused the major fire. While no structures or vineyards belonging to Hundred Acre have been destroyed, the investigation highlights the ongoing risks of wildfires and the scrutiny faced by businesses in fire-prone regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines is revising its "customer of size" policy, which previously guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by travelers needing more space. Effective January 27, 2026, refunds will only be issued if the flight departs with at least one open seat and specific fare class conditions are met. This change, part of a broader shift to assigned seating, has drawn criticism from advocates for the plus-size community, who fear it will create financial burdens and accessibility barriers. Many view it as a reversal of Southwest's inclusive stance, potentially increasing anxiety and limiting travel options for a significant segment of passengers.</p>

          <p>New analysis by BBC Verify reveals that Israel struck Gaza's Nasser Hospital at least four times during a deadly attack, not twice as initially reported, killing at least 20 people including five journalists. The investigation identified two near-simultaneous strikes on staircases in the first wave, followed by two separate projectiles hitting the eastern staircase milliseconds apart during a later attack on first responders. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially expressed regret for a "tragic mishap" and later claimed a Hamas camera was positioned nearby, but has not acknowledged multiple strikes. International legal experts question if the attack violated international law.</p>
