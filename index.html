        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Thursday, mirroring a positive trend from Wall Street where a tech rally boosted major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all recorded increases in early trading. This upward movement occurred despite underlying investor concerns about the broader economy and continued focus on global bond markets, where long-term borrowing costs remain under pressure. The rally in U.S. tech shares was partly fueled by optimism following a court decision in an Alphabet antitrust case, suggesting tech giants might withstand regulatory challenges.

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its 2022 demotion of Republican Representative Ronny Jackson, restoring his retired rank of rear admiral. Jackson, a former White House physician for Presidents Obama and Trump, had been demoted following a Pentagon investigation into allegations of misconduct, including making inappropriate comments and violating alcohol policies, which he has consistently denied. The Navy Secretary's decision follows a review of the case, and a spokesperson noted Jackson's decades of distinguished service. The move comes amid other Pentagon decisions seen as potentially favorable to supporters of former President Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, challenging a federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of its country-specific tariffs illegal. The lower court had decided that President Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the levies, stating that tariffs are a core power of Congress. The administration is urging the Supreme Court to take up the case on an expedited basis, arguing the ruling creates legal uncertainty that undermines the president's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security. A final decision could potentially come in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have recovered an 18th-century Italian painting, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork was discovered after Dutch journalists spotted it in an online real estate listing for a home in Mar del Plata, which belonged to a descendant of a senior Nazi legal advisor. The painting was originally part of the collection of Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose assets were seized by top Nazi official Hermann Göring. Valued at approximately $50,000, the recovered portrait is reported to be in good condition and is being held for safekeeping.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights that China's decade-long industrial plan, 'Made in China 2025,' is strategically positioning the nation to become a dominant force in technology. The policy was designed to shift the country from a low-tech manufacturer to a high-tech innovator, with information technology being a primary focus. The plan utilizes a coordinated approach, combining central government leadership with flexible local implementation and substantial state funding to overcome previous structural weaknesses. This institutionalized strategy is aimed at transforming China into a leading producer, not just a consumer, of advanced IT products and other key technologies on the global stage.

          <p>Following Representative Jerry Nadler's announcement that he will retire, speculation has arisen about who will seek his influential Manhattan congressional seat. A spokesperson for Chelsea Clinton confirmed she is not considering a run, dismissing rumors to the contrary. However, John F. Kennedy’s grandson, Jack Schlossberg, indicated that a campaign for the seat is "certainly a possibility," marking his most direct signal of political ambition yet. Nadler's decision to step down after over three decades opens up a key Democratic stronghold, potentially setting the stage for a high-profile primary contest as a new generation of leaders emerges.</p>

The administration had used the obscure wartime statute to expel hundreds of alleged gang members, arguing their presence constituted an incursion. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument, finding that encouraging illegal immigration is not equivalent to an armed invasion. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, though the government can still seek removal under other authorities.</p>

          <p>During an emotional press conference on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse called for the full release of government files related to the case. One survivor, Lisa Phillips, announced that the group has started compiling a confidential list of Epstein's associates who were allegedly involved in the abuse, a list created by and for survivors. The event, organized by lawmakers pushing for greater transparency, featured nine women who shared detailed accounts of their experiences. They urged the Department of Justice to release all documents, stating many victims fear repercussions if they were to publicly name individuals themselves.</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, a city in eastern China, has introduced a new stimulus measure to boost local consumption by offering subsidies to people who host large banquets. Under the plan, individuals who host five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan on a meal will be eligible for a subsidy of up to 5,000 yuan. This initiative is part of a broader effort to encourage spending across various sectors, including dining, cars, and housing, amid concerns about strained economic growth. The policy highlights the challenge local officials face in promoting consumption while adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article explores the trend of some members of Gen Z creating a facade of a luxurious travel lifestyle on social media, often through debt or deceptive means. Business consultant Jon Morgan shared an example of a mentee who built an online persona suggesting a $500,000-a-year lifestyle on an actual budget of $12,000 by using day passes at exclusive clubs and tipping hotel staff for photo opportunities. This fabricated image ultimately led to lucrative brand partnerships. The article also notes that others fund extravagant trips with personal loans or by splitting the cost of a single night in a luxury rental among friends to create the illusion of a longer, high-end vacation.</p>

Also unveiled was a new, longer-range variant of the DF-5 nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile, reportedly able to carry up to 12 warheads and reach any part of the United States.

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the UK's main federation of trade unions, is calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider implementing a range of wealth taxes in the upcoming budget. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak argued that such measures are necessary to fund public services and that the government should explore options like a tax on windfall profits for banks, which have seen record earnings. The proposal also includes equalizing capital gains tax with income tax. In response, the Treasury indicated that the government believes it has already achieved the right balance in taxing the wealthy through recent increases on private jets and second homes.

          <p>The United Arab Emirates has issued a stern warning to Israel, stating that any move to annex the occupied West Bank would be a "red line" and would undermine the 2020 Abraham Accords that normalized relations between the two nations. A senior Emirati official emphasized that such an action would be a "death knell" for the two-state solution. The warning came after Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, proposed a plan to annex approximately 80% of the West Bank. The UAE was instrumental in halting previous annexation plans as a condition for signing the accords, which were seen as a pathway to support Palestinian statehood.</p>

The Democratic National Committee intervened, arguing the move was partisan and violated federal law. The resulting consent agreement allows the affected individuals to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively preserving their ability to vote while satisfying the legal requirements.</p>
