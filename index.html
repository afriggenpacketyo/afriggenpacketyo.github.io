The Israeli military acknowledged the strike, stating it was targeting a Hezbollah militant operating within a civilian area and that it is reviewing the incident. The children's grandfather emphasized that the family had no affiliation with any militant groups and believed they were safe. The children's mother and another daughter survived but were seriously injured in the attack.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent announcement advising pregnant women against using Tylenol and linking it to autism has drawn sharp criticism from scientists and medical experts. Researchers, including one whose work was cited by the White House, stated that Trump distorted their findings and that his comments are dangerous. Experts worry that such misinformation will lead people to avoid necessary medications and proven vaccines, while also undermining legitimate scientific inquiry into the complex causes of autism.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Democratic congressional leaders, significantly increasing the probability of a government shutdown on October 1. Trump claimed the meeting would not be productive after reviewing what he called the Democrats' "unserious and ridiculous demands" for a funding deal. Democratic leaders accused the president of throwing a tantrum and running away from negotiations, asserting that he and his party would be responsible for any resulting shutdown.</p>

          <p>A phenomenon dubbed "financial nihilism" is reportedly taking hold among young adults, who are increasingly turning to high-risk investments like meme stocks, crypto, and sports betting. This trend is driven by a sense that traditional paths to financial security, such as homeownership, are unattainable due to soaring costs, student debt, and a difficult job market. For many, taking big financial risks feels like the only viable option to accumulate wealth in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>
