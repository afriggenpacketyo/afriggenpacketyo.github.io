          <p>A group of former inmates in Boston is volunteering to help renovate the historic Tremont Temple Baptist Church, a landmark known as America's first integrated church. One volunteer, who served 21 years in prison, expressed that the restoration work has given him a new sense of purpose, likening the church's renewal to his own personal reform. The project, which includes painstakingly reupholstering and reinstalling balcony chairs from the 1890s, is seen by participants and the church's pastor as a powerful example of personal transformation and community acceptance. The renovations are anticipated to be completed in October.</p>

Both Vance and Trump Jr. spoke at Kirk's memorial service and are expected to attend numerous TPUSA events in the coming months to support its mission ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A military court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has sentenced former president Joseph Kabila to death in absentia for treason and war crimes. The charges against Kabila, who ruled the country for 18 years until 2019, included murder, sexual assault, torture, and insurrection. He was also accused by the current president, Felix Tshisekedi, of being the mastermind behind the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group that has seized territory in the eastern part of the country. Kabila, whose current whereabouts are unknown, has denied all allegations and has been in exile.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has delivered a searing rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio violated the First Amendment. The judge found they unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian international students for deportation based on their protected political speech, with the intent to chill activism on college campuses. In the 161-page decision, the judge accused the officials of misusing their power for "ignoble ends" and criticized the use of masked ICE agents to "terrorize Americans into quiescence," affirming the judiciary's role in defending constitutional values.</p>

          <p>A federal government shutdown would likely lead to the closure of Washington, D.C.'s most prominent cultural institutions, including the 21 Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo. While the Smithsonian might use reserve funds to stay open for a short period, a prolonged shutdown would shutter its doors and turn off popular animal webcams. Outdoor sites like the Lincoln Memorial would remain physically accessible, but National Park Service staffing and services would be suspended.

          <p>India's cricket team overcame a significant middle-order collapse to defeat Sri Lanka by 59 runs in their opening match of the Women's World Cup. After slipping to 124-6, a crucial 103-run partnership between Amanjot Kaur and Deepti Sharma revived the innings, helping India post a competitive total of 269-8. In response, Sri Lanka started well but faltered after the dismissal of their captain, Chamari Athapaththu. Deepti Sharma also excelled with the ball, taking three wickets as India bowled Sri Lanka out for 211 in front of a record-breaking crowd in Guwahati.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown as lawmakers remain deadlocked over a short-term funding agreement, with Democrats and Republicans unable to agree on health care policy provisions. If a shutdown occurs, up to 4 million federal employees and military service members could go without pay, though essential workers like TSA officers and air traffic controllers would be required to work. The disruption would affect numerous services, potentially closing national parks, halting non-essential FDA inspections, and delaying justice department litigation, echoing the economic damage seen in the historic 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019.</p>

A legitimate company will also have a transparent fee structure and is legally prohibited from charging upfront fees before successfully settling a debt. They will provide honest communication about the process's risks, including potential credit score damage, and offer a realistic timeline for resolution.</p>

Pfizer's CEO, present for the announcement, stated that the threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured abroad motivated the company's swift action, which includes moving more production to the U.S. The discounted drugs will eventually be available through a new government-run website called "TrumpRx."</p>

          <p>The "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily refers to the provision in the Fair Credit Reporting Act that requires most negative information, like late payments and charge-offs, to be removed from a credit report after seven years. This clock starts from the date of the first delinquency. Additionally, states have statutes of limitations, often around seven years, which limit a creditor's ability to sue for the debt. However, the debt itself does not disappear after seven years; collectors can still attempt to contact you for payment, though they lose their legal recourse to sue.</p>

          <p>For homeowners considering a large home equity loan, a $200,000 loan currently costs approximately $2,463 per month for a 10-year term and $1,936 for a 15-year term, based on today's average rates. While recent Federal Reserve rate cuts have made these loans slightly cheaper than they were in previous months, the difference is not substantial. A loan of this size is a significant financial commitment, using one's home as collateral, and is only advisable for those with substantial equity and the clear ability to manage the payments without risk of foreclosure.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of House Democrats has raised concerns that the Trump administration may be improperly seizing the tax refunds of defaulted student loan borrowers without providing the legally required notice. Federal agencies must typically warn borrowers 60 days before an offset, but lawmakers fear the administration is relying on old notices issued years before the pandemic-era pause on collections. With collections resuming, this failure to issue new warnings could harm millions of borrowers who have experienced significant life changes. The lawmakers are urging the Education Department to ensure proper procedures are followed before garnishing benefits.</p>

          <p>State leaders in Florida have officially approved the construction of Donald Trump's presidential library on a 2.6-acre plot adjacent to Miami's historic Freedom Tower. The decision followed a unanimous vote by Miami Dade College's board to transfer the land to the state, a plan championed by Governor Ron DeSantis. The project has drawn sharp criticism from some community members and academics, who argue that placing a library dedicated to Trump next to the Freedom Tower—a symbol of refuge for Cuban exiles—is a contradiction. Protesters contend the land should be preserved for student and community use.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are urging a judge to sentence Sean “Diddy” Combs to 11 years and three months in prison following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. In their sentencing memo, prosecutors described Combs as "unrepentant" and argued that a substantial prison term is necessary due to the seriousness of his crimes, which involved violence and fear. The recommendation comes after Combs's defense team requested a sentence of no more than 14 months, citing his rehabilitation while incarcerated. Letters from victims, including his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, were submitted to the court detailing their ongoing trauma.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a new educational target, aiming for two-thirds of young people to attend university, pursue further education, or enter a high-quality apprenticeship by the age of 25. This marks a significant shift from the previous Labour government's goal of 50% university attendance, giving more prominence to technical qualifications and skills training. The new ambition includes a goal for at least 10% of young people to pursue higher technical courses or apprenticeships by 2040. The policy was welcomed by colleges and manufacturers as a step toward valuing vocational training equally with university degrees.</p>

          <p>Two trained Harris's hawks, named Alice and Bubba, were stolen from SoFi Stadium during a Los Angeles Rams game on Sunday. The hawks are employed by a falconer to deter other birds from flying over the stadium and bothering fans. According to Inglewood police, a suspect stole the utility vehicle where the birds were housed, driving off with them still inside their containers. The birds of prey, known for their intelligence and cooperative hunting skills, are an essential part of the stadium's operational team.

          <p>Labor unions in Greece have called for a general strike to protest a new government bill that could allow for a 13-hour workday in certain circumstances. The conservative government, led by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has been pushing for more "flexible" labor laws, having already introduced a mandatory six-day work week in some sectors. While the government claims the 13-hour day would be voluntary and exceptional, unions argue it legalizes exploitation and will harm worker well-being and productivity. The strike aims to halt transportation and public services across the country in opposition to the reforms.</p>
