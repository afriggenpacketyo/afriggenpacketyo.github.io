          <h2>Tesla's Q2 2025 Earnings Report Shows Decline in Revenue and Profit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 19:33:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has reported a second consecutive quarterly drop in revenue and profit, with automotive revenue falling 16% to $16.7 billion. The company missed analyst expectations for earnings per share and overall revenue, leading to a dip in its stock price. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the potential for "a few rough quarters," citing challenges like expiring federal EV tax credits and the impact of tariffs. The decline is also attributed to public backlash against Musk's political activities and increased competition from other automakers, particularly in the affordable EV market.

          <p>Following Spain's semi-final victory over Germany, they are set to face England in the Euro 2025 final, creating a highly anticipated rematch of the 2023 World Cup final, which Spain won. This match pits the reigning World Cup champions against the defending European champions, the Lionesses. While England has undergone significant squad changes since their last major final, including new players and retirements, experts believe they have the capability to defeat Spain.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has described the current market as a mixed environment, presenting both positive and negative forces for investors to consider. He pointed to strong earnings from banks and healthcare, as well as the long-term potential of the data center sector, as reasons for optimism. However, Cramer also warned of speculative "froth" reminiscent of past market bubbles, cautioning against risky trading in certain low-priced stocks. He advised investors to remain skeptical but not cynical, acknowledging that while there are concerning speculative activities, there are also significant opportunities for profit.

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit that will allow female passengers to request female drivers. The feature, called "women drivers," will also enable women to opt for shared rides exclusively with other women. The company acknowledges that users of this feature may experience longer wait times due to the lower number of female drivers on the platform. This initiative, which allows female drivers to also set a preference for female riders, follows similar successful programs Uber has implemented in 40 other countries.</p>

The company's revenue surged by 35% year-over-year to 22.23 trillion won, with operating profit jumping 68% to 9.21 trillion won. This impressive performance is largely driven by sustained high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is a critical component in chipsets used for generative AI. As a leading supplier to companies like Nvidia, SK Hynix's success highlights the ongoing boom in the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The original project aimed to provide a more complete history, including difficult truths about historical figures like John Muir.

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Pressure on the Federal Reserve Risks Economic Stability</h2>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is a dangerous power play that threatens the central bank's independence. The author contends that the push for lower interest rates is not about sound monetary policy but about making the government's massive borrowing and spending agenda appear more affordable, a situation known as "fiscal dominance." While acknowledging Powell's past policy missteps, the piece warns that politicizing the Fed could erode confidence in U.S. Treasuries, leading to inflation and financial instability. The true problem, it concludes, is excessive government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM's shares fell in extended trading even after the company reported second-quarter results that exceeded overall Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings. The decline was attributed to the company's software revenue, which, despite growing 10%, came in slightly below analyst forecasts at $7.39 billion. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients reprioritized spending toward hardware, which saw strong growth. IBM's consulting and infrastructure segments also performed well, and the company reaffirmed its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow, signaling underlying confidence in its business.

          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a 42% drop in second-quarter profit, with earnings and revenue falling short of analyst estimates. The airline posted an adjusted profit of 43 cents per share on $7.24 billion in revenue, citing weaker domestic travel demand earlier in the year. However, the company noted that demand has since stabilized and announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. The results come as Southwest overhauls its business model, moving away from policies like open seating and introducing new fare structures to better compete in the current market.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for President Trump to fire members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission without cause, siding with the administration in a significant ruling on presidential power. The decision effectively weakens the independence of certain federal regulatory agencies, whose leaders have traditionally been protected from removal except for malfeasance. In a sharp dissent, Justice Elena Kagan argued that the majority's decision negates Congress's design for bipartisan, independent agencies. The ruling follows a pattern of the court's conservative majority using its emergency docket to expand executive authority.</p>

          <p>A search warrant reveals that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's bomb squad technicians who were killed in a recent explosion initially believed the grenades they were handling were inert. The three veteran detectives had responded to a call about grenades found in a storage unit and, after an initial X-ray, reportedly told Santa Monica police the devices were inactive. The next day, at least one of the grenades detonated at a training facility as they were being handled, killing all three. The investigation by the sheriff's department and ATF is now focused on how the detonation occurred.</p>

          <p>President Trump's large-scale immigration raids are causing concern among some California Republicans, who fear a political backlash in a state with a large immigrant population. While the administration frames the operations as targeting criminals, data suggests many of those arrested have no criminal record, impacting the state's workforce, particularly in agriculture. Some GOP lawmakers from competitive districts have publicly urged the administration to focus on criminals and are supporting bipartisan reform efforts. This creates a difficult political balancing act, as they risk alienating their base while responding to the economic and social impacts in their communities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the European Union are in a race against time to secure a trade deal by an August 1 deadline set by the White House. Without an agreement, President Trump has threatened to impose a 30% tariff on EU imports, which could lead to retaliatory tariffs from the EU and raise costs for businesses and consumers. Recent U.S. trade pacts with other partners, such as a deal with Japan that set a 15% tariff rate, are seen as potential templates. Negotiations are ongoing, with a potential compromise on a lower tariff rate and investment commitments from the EU being key to avoiding a damaging trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 100 international aid and human rights organizations, including Oxfam and Save the Children, has issued a dire warning about mass starvation spreading across Gaza. The groups state that the population and their own aid workers are "wasting away" due to Israel's siege, which severely restricts the entry of food, water, and medicine. The UN reports that a quarter of the population faces famine-like conditions, with children and the elderly suffering from record rates of acute malnutrition. The organizations are pressing for immediate international action, including a permanent ceasefire and the full opening of all land crossings.</p>
