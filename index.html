          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly condemned Japan's plan to deploy the U.S.-made Typhon intermediate-range missile system during joint military exercises next month. Beijing stated the move undermines the security interests of other nations and insisted that the U.S. and Japan must not proceed with the deployment. Japanese media reported the system will be stationed at the U.S. Iwakuni base for the duration of the drills, which analysts see as a strategic warning to China, particularly concerning Taiwan. The Typhon system is scheduled to be withdrawn once the military exercises conclude.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired a Justice Department paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making a vulgar gesture and uttering obscenities at National Guard members in Washington D.C. The termination was immediate, with a department spokesperson emphasizing that a lack of support for law enforcement is incompatible with the agency's values under Bondi's leadership. This action occurs as the Trump administration has increased federal and military presence in the capital, declaring a crime emergency despite data showing a 30-year low in violent crime. The deployment has faced legal challenges, leading to a negotiated agreement to maintain the city's police chief in command.</p>

          <p>A fierce political battle over congressional redistricting is intensifying, with California and Texas at its center. After Texas Republicans passed a new map to create five more GOP-favored seats, California's Democratic lawmakers retaliated with a plan to neutralize the move by adding five Democratic-leaning districts. The conflict has expanded as Missouri's governor called a special session to draw a map adding another Republican seat, following calls from President Trump for loyal states to engage in mid-decade redistricting. This arms race over gerrymandering aims to secure control of the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Halts Trump Administration's Expansion of Fast-Track Deportations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 22:25:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from expanding its fast-track deportation policy, known as expedited removal, across the entire country. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the expansion, which allowed for deporting migrants anywhere in the U.S. without a court hearing if they couldn't prove two years of residency, likely violates due process rights. Previously, this policy was limited to migrants found within 100 miles of a border who had been in the country for less than two weeks.

          <p>Novak Djokovic overcame a lower back injury to defeat Britain's Cameron Norrie and advance to the last 16 of the U.S. Open. The 24-time Grand Slam champion won the match in four sets, marking his seventh victory against Norrie in as many meetings. Djokovic, 38, required two medical time-outs during the nearly three-hour contest to address his back issue. The victory keeps his quest for a record 25th major title alive in his first tournament since the Wimbledon semi-finals seven weeks ago. Norrie's exit marks the end of British singles contention at the tournament.</p>

The section of Highway 2, which provides access to popular hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, was severely damaged by rock slides and pavement collapses during the stormy winters of 2022 and 2023, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening is expected to reduce overcrowding at other trailheads, though it coincides with extreme fire danger warnings for the area.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that many of the extensive tariffs President Trump imposed on numerous countries are not legally permissible. The court found that the president exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he had invoked to justify the import taxes. While the ruling is a significant blow to Trump's trade strategy, it does not immediately block the tariffs, as the court has given the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.

El-Fasher is the last army stronghold in the Darfur region, and the RSF has been accused of intensifying its offensive by deliberately targeting civilian areas, including hospitals and markets.

          <p>A new investigation has concluded that Buford Pusser, the legendary Tennessee sheriff whose anti-crime crusade inspired the movie "Walking Tall," killed his wife, Pauline, in 1967 and staged it to look like an ambush by his enemies. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation re-examined the cold case and found inconsistencies between Pusser's account and the physical evidence, including signs of prior domestic violence. Prosecutors stated that if Pusser, who died in a car crash in 1974, were alive today, he would be indicted for murder. The finding aims to provide closure and correct the historical record surrounding the iconic lawman.</p>

          <p>Major pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens are now limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines in certain states, in some cases requiring a prescription or not offering them at all. This change is a response to varying state laws and regulations following the FDA's approval of new vaccines for seniors but only for younger individuals with specific health conditions. For example, CVS stated it cannot administer the vaccine even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico due to state laws. The adjustments reflect the complex regulatory environment as the nation transitions away from emergency use authorizations for vaccines.</p>

          <p>President Trump has revoked the Secret Service protection for his 2024 election opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective Monday. In response, California officials have arranged for the California Highway Patrol to provide her with dignitary protection. While former vice presidents typically receive six months of protection after leaving office, then-President Biden had signed an order extending Harris's detail until July 2026. Critics, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have condemned Trump's move as an act of political revenge that could put the former vice president in danger.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson gave a measured response when confronted with California Governor Gavin Newsom's comments about Louisiana's high crime rate. Newsom had suggested that if President Trump wants to deploy troops to suppress crime, he should look at states like Johnson's, where the murder rate is nearly four times higher than in California. On Fox News, Johnson called Newsom an attention-seeker and stated that his hometown of Shreveport has been making gradual progress in reducing crime. He emphasized that crime is an issue in cities across America that his party is committed to addressing.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts, escalating a national partisan conflict over gerrymandering. The move follows similar efforts in Texas and California, as both parties seek to gain an advantage in the U.S. House for the 2026 midterm elections. Kehoe's proposed map specifically targets the Kansas City-area district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by adding rural, Republican-leaning areas. Democrats have condemned the action as a partisan power grab orchestrated by President Trump to undermine democracy and silence voters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed it revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials, effectively blocking them from attending the upcoming U.N. General Assembly in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to their efforts to seek unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and for undermining peace efforts. The move is highly unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the U.N. headquarters. The Palestinian leadership called the decision a clear contradiction of international law, while Israel's foreign minister welcomed it.</p>

          <p>Major coffee chains like Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling as consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations, evolve. The rise of trendy alternatives like matcha, offered by newer chains such as Blank Street Coffee, is drawing customers away from traditional coffee-focused brands. Analysts suggest that in a competitive market, legacy brands are caught between cheap, quick options like Greggs and the high-end experience of artisanal shops. With home coffee machines becoming more popular, chains must offer unique, treat-worthy products to entice customers, a challenge for brands that have been slow to adapt to new trends.</p>
