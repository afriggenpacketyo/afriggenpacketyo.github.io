          <p>Authorities in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, have launched a search and rescue operation for three Taiwanese individuals who are believed to be stranded on Mount Hiuchigatake. The three were part of a larger group of ten who began climbing the mountain on Tuesday, but the group had to turn back midway through their ascent. Two men in their 50s and 70s stayed behind to assist a woman in her 70s who fell ill during the descent. A staff member at the mountain hut reported the three missing after they failed to return by Tuesday night, prompting the search efforts by land and air.</p>

          <p>Toyota Industries Corp. experienced a significant drop in share value following the announcement of a $33 billion buyout deal by the Toyota Group. The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for Toyota Industries shares at 16,300 yen apiece, a price considered unattractive by some analysts. Toyota Group will establish a new holding company, with investments from Toyota Fudosan and Akio Toyoda, backed by loans from major banks. This move reflects a broader trend in Japan where companies are facing pressure to unwind cross-shareholding ties, with the Financial Services Agency advocating for a reduction in such arrangements.

          <p>President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill" is encountering opposition from Republican senators who are concerned about the potential impact of the spending package on the national debt. The bill addresses tax policy, border security, defense, and other issues, but it is projected to increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. Senator Rand Paul has voiced his strong opposition to the bill, leading to a public disagreement with Trump. The White House defends the bill, arguing that it will stimulate economic growth and generate more tax revenue, while critics like Elon Musk have called it an "abomination."

The Domestic Abuse Commissioner and Victims Commissioner jointly stated that these services are "pushed to the brink" due to funding cuts and rising costs. This intervention precedes the chancellor's spending review, which is expected to include cuts to public spending.

          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-anticipated growth in the first quarter of the year, with a 1.3% year-on-year increase, falling short of the projected 1.5%.

Extreme weather events also played a role, impacting mining, tourism, and shipping industries.

Alliance for Human Rights withdrew subpoenas issued to Bass and two city councilmembers to avoid delaying the proceedings. The alliance argues that the city has failed to comply with a settlement agreement requiring the provision of 12,915 beds for the unhoused population by 2027, while city officials maintain they intend to comply by the deadline.

The Trump administration stated that the guidance "do[es] not reflect the policy of this Administration."
