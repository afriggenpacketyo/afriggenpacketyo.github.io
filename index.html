            <p>Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican representing upstate New York, is reportedly considering a run for governor of New York in 2026. This comes after President Trump withdrew her nomination for UN ambassador, citing the need for her continued presence in the House. Stefanik has gained prominence for her conservative stances and role in congressional responses to antisemitism on college campuses. While New York has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold, recent elections have shown a shift towards Republican candidates, making the gubernatorial race potentially competitive. </p>

            <p>Fyre Festival 2, organized by Billy McFarland, the promoter behind the infamous 2017 Fyre Festival, has been postponed with no new date set.

            <p>The Florida House of Representatives has unanimously voted to prevent the construction of golf courses and pickleball courts in state parks, effectively shelving Governor Ron DeSantis's "Great Outdoors Initiative." The bill, which now moves to the Senate, aims to preserve the natural state of Florida's parks and ensure that any development is conservation-based and supports activities like hiking and swimming. This decision follows significant public opposition to the governor's initial proposal, with supporters emphasizing the importance of maintaining the state's wild spaces. Development is still allowed if it supports conservation-based recreational uses.</p>

            <p>The escalating trade war between the United States and China, marked by soaring tariff rates, is causing significant disruptions to global supply chains. As tariffs on some goods reach triple digits, manufacturers are reportedly exploring various methods to evade these costs, including smuggling and utilizing proxy factories. This shift is raising concerns about the potential for a complete decoupling of the two economies, leading to a new era of evasive logistics. The White House claims that China faces tariffs as high as 245% on imports to the United States due to retaliatory actions.</p>

He says HHS is committed to investigating environmental causes of autism, calling it a preventable disease.

            <p>Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys is facing a fourth sexual assault lawsuit, with the accuser alleging that the alleged rape led to HPV and cancer. Lauren Penly claims that Carter raped her twice in 2005, infected her with STDs, and caused emotional distress. Carter's legal team denies the allegations, stating that he does not recall ever meeting Penly. The lawsuit echoes similar allegations raised in previous lawsuits against Carter, who has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women.</p>

            <p>President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live, a White House official confirmed Wednesday. The president has voiced frustration with the 1973 law and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Critics of the Endangered Species Act claim the law goes far beyond the initial intent and is overly burdensome.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in areas where endangered species live. This would likely involve changes to federal regulations, potentially including repealing the definition of 'harm,' which currently protects species' habitats. Critics argue that the Endangered Species Act is overly burdensome, while environmentalists express concern that weakening the law could lead to the extinction of species. The Endangered Species Act has been credited with saving 99% of listed species.</p>

            <p>The city of Berkeley, California, has adopted new wildfire safety rules requiring residents in high-fire-risk areas to remove plants and other flammable materials within 5 feet of their homes. This measure aims to create defensible space and slow the spread of wildfires. The proposal follows deadly wildfires in Los Angeles and is driven by concerns about the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires due to climate change. While some residents have expressed concerns, experts emphasize the importance of limiting fuel to protect homes and allow more time for evacuation.</p>

            <p>California has become the first state to sue the Trump administration over its tariffs, challenging the President's authority to enact them. Governor Gavin Newsom argues that California has been disproportionately affected by the tariffs, which are 10% on most countries and 145% on China. The lawsuit challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, arguing that such powers rest with Congress. The White House dismissed the lawsuit, stating that it would continue addressing the national emergency of trade deficits.</p>
