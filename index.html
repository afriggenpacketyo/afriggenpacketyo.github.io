          <p>Rental car company Hertz is enhancing its e-commerce platform to allow customers to handle nearly the entire used car purchasing process online, including financing and trade-ins. This strategic move aims to improve the company's retail sales channel, which is its largest for offloading its fleet of around 560,000 vehicles. By modernizing its sales approach and maximizing resale prices, Hertz hopes to accelerate its fleet turnover and bolster its financial recovery following its 2020 bankruptcy. The initiative will be promoted through a new campaign featuring football star Tom Brady.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government has implemented a nationwide internet shutdown in Afghanistan, cutting off both fiber-optic and mobile data services. This drastic measure follows a partial blackout in northern provinces, which a spokesperson justified as necessary to "prevent immorality." The move has sparked severe concerns among activists, business owners, and educators, who warn of devastating consequences for the economy, press freedom, and online education, which has become a lifeline for girls and women banned from schools. International watchdogs have condemned the action as an unprecedented escalation of censorship and repression.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly humanlike, society must prepare for the concept of AI personhood, argues a researcher from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. Millions of people are already forming emotional connections with AI companions, leading to significant mental health effects and raising questions about their legal and social status. The article contends that current AI safety research is too focused on technical benchmarks rather than the profound social upheaval that will result from coexisting with digital minds. Without a new framework beyond treating AI as mere property, humanity risks being unprepared for the societal integration of a second intelligent species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former prosecutors and legal scholars express concern that President Trump's public and private efforts to secure the indictment of ex-FBI Director James Comey could backfire by suggesting a politically motivated prosecution. Trump's campaign against Comey included replacing a U.S. attorney who deemed the case weak with a White House adviser and publicly urging the attorney general to act. While the pressure resulted in Comey's indictment on charges of lying to Congress, critics argue this interference undermines the Department of Justice's independence and could provide Comey's defense with strong arguments for dismissing the case.</p>

          <p>Significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), resulting from President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," are beginning to impact millions of low-income Americans. The changes, effective October 1, eliminate funding for the SNAP-Ed program and are expected to terminate or reduce benefits for an estimated 4 million people. Food banks are already struggling with increased demand and rising food costs, and they are now bracing for a further surge as families lose this critical support.

The author argues that this superficial understanding of Judaism is a product of centuries of anti-Semitism and assimilationist pressures.

In a trilateral call with U.S. President Trump, Netanyahu assured Qatar's prime minister that such an attack would not happen again, a move that appears to have de-escalated the diplomatic crisis. The incident had initially drawn a furious reaction from Qatar, a key U.S. ally and host of the Hamas political bureau.</p>

          <p>Despite having animal welfare enshrined in its constitution, Germany faces significant challenges, including a thriving black market for exotic animals and booming online puppy mills. Animal shelters are overwhelmed, yet promised federal funding has not materialized in the 2025 budget. Critics also point to the new Agriculture Minister's perceived lack of commitment and the slow transition to organic farming. While Germany was the first country to ban the killing of male chicks, animal welfare organizations argue that broader reforms are urgently needed to address systemic issues in animal trade, testing, and agriculture.</p>

          <p>In a strategic reversal, Senate Democrats are now leveraging the threat of a government shutdown to achieve policy goals, a tactic they fiercely criticized when Republicans used it in the past. Democrats are withholding support for a government funding bill unless Republicans agree to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies, adopting a playbook pioneered by the GOP. This shift comes as many Democratic voters push their leaders to take a more confrontational stance against the Trump administration. The move risks public blame but reflects a new political calculation in a deeply polarized Washington.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over the suspension of his account following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riots. The settlement filing states that it does not constitute an admission of liability by the company. This follows similar settlements Trump has reached with Meta and X (formerly Twitter) after they also suspended his accounts. The move comes after several Democratic senators had previously expressed concern that such a settlement could represent a quid-pro-quo arrangement to avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security has immediately enacted new rules that automatically apply trade restrictions to any company that is at least 50% owned by a firm already on the U.S. Entity List. This move is designed to close a loophole that allowed blacklisted Chinese companies, which Washington considers national security threats, to circumvent sanctions by operating through their subsidiaries. Analysts suggest the revision is an overdue corrective measure that could have a significant impact on affected Chinese firms and their global operations, further straining trade relations.</p>

          <p>Over 100 congressional Democrats, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, are warning that the Trump administration's move to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly one million immigrants will severely strain the U.S. healthcare system. In a letter to administration officials, they argue that removing work authorization for these individuals, many of whom are essential healthcare workers, will create a "perfect storm" when combined with major cuts to Medicaid. The lawmakers caution that these policies will exacerbate workforce shortages in nursing homes and home care, ultimately harming the most vulnerable Americans.</p>

          <p>The popular image of college students as fragile "snowflakes" intolerant of free speech is a misconception, argues Princeton's president in a new essay. He contends that while a few high-profile disruptions receive disproportionate media attention, the vast majority of students are eager to engage in constructive debate. The author criticizes flawed free-speech rankings that mistake controversy for censorship and silence for freedom. He suggests the biggest challenge on campus is not overt censorship but self-censorship due to peer pressure, a problem reflecting broader societal polarization rather than a unique issue with today's youth.</p>

          <p>The recent wave of countries like Britain, Canada, and Australia recognizing a Palestinian state is more than just a symbolic gesture, as it directly challenges the Israeli settler right's goal of permanently preventing Palestinian sovereignty. While these declarations do not change the immediate reality on the ground in Gaza or the West Bank, they establish a framework for future international political action. This global commitment to a two-state solution signals that the world may not accept Israel's attempts to create "facts on the ground" through settlement expansion as a final resolution to the conflict.</p>

Viral videos of aggressive ICE tactics and the agency's increasing unpopularity are fueling calls for Democrats to offer a clear alternative, setting the stage for a major policy fight within the party ahead of the 2026 and 2028 elections.</p>

          <p>A new analysis explores how Rupert Murdoch transformed a single newspaper inherited from his father into a global media empire that has profoundly shaped politics and culture in Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. Inheriting a philosophy of using newspapers to influence power, Murdoch expanded ruthlessly, employing sensationalist tabloid formulas to drive circulation and build political alliances, notably with Margaret Thatcher. His creation of Fox News in the U.S., following the deregulation of broadcasting rules, applied this tabloid approach to television, creating a highly profitable and polarizing propaganda model that has permanently altered the media landscape.</p>

          <p>Germany's manufacturing-heavy economy, which thrived during the first "China Shock" of the 2000s by supplying industrial machinery, is now facing a potentially catastrophic second wave. Chinese companies have rapidly advanced to become direct competitors in Germany's core industries, including automobiles and high-end equipment, causing German exports to plummet. Unlike the first shock, which affected low-end manufacturing, this new competition targets the heart of the German economic model. Economists warn this could lead to a deindustrialization crisis more severe than what the U.S. experienced two decades ago.</p>
