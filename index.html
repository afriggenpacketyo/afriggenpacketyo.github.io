          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter but exceeding forecasters' expectations of 0.1%. The growth was primarily driven by the services and construction sectors, providing what Chancellor Rachel Reeves called "positive" news for an economy that has felt stagnant. However, critics point to a sharp fall in business investment and a dip in household spending as signs of underlying weakness. Despite the better-than-expected performance, some economists express doubt that this pace can be maintained amid global uncertainty and potential future tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man accused of deliberately driving a car into a crowd during Liverpool FC's victory parade now faces 24 additional charges, including attempted grievous bodily harm against two infants. Paul Doyle appeared tearfully in court via video link, where it was revealed the new charges relate to the more than 130 people injured in the May incident. Prosecutors allege he used the car as a weapon, and the new counts bring the total number of alleged victims to over two dozen, including five children. The defense requested more time to review the new evidence, and the case has been adjourned until September.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been observed with grotesque, horn-like growths, causing public concern, but scientists assure there is no reason to panic. The growths are caused by the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus that spreads among rabbits via fleas and ticks but cannot infect humans or other animals. The virus, which likely inspired the myth of the jackalope, typically resolves on its own as the rabbit's immune system fights it off. The growths are only dangerous if they interfere with a rabbit's ability to see or eat, and officials note it is not uncommon to see such cases.</p>

Guo, who was on a mission to raise money for cancer research, was accused of providing false flight information after diverting his plane due to engine failure. A Chilean court dropped the charges on the condition he donate $30,000 to charity, but officials have not permitted him to fly his plane off the base, citing various reasons he claims are false. He describes feeling like a "prisoner" and is eager to continue his fundraising journey.</p>

While the city experienced a spike in 2023, that trend has since reversed, though public perception has not caught up, with many residents still feeling crime is a major problem. Analysts note a partisan divide in crime perception, which the president's rhetoric often leverages to mobilize voters. This move highlights the significant gap between statistical reality and the public's feeling of safety, which can influence policy debates.</p>

          <p>In Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, a growing number of workers are finding it difficult to save, with 60% reporting they lived paycheck to paycheck in 2024. This trend is attributed to a combination of high living costs, including housing and imported goods, and a cultural shift where younger generations prioritize experiences over long-term savings. Economists point out that real median income has slightly decreased since the pandemic, shrinking purchasing power. The article suggests this financial precarity reflects not just economic pressure but also changing societal values around spending and debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite California enacting the nation's first heat-safety regulations for outdoor workers nearly two decades ago, farmworkers continue to die from heat-related illnesses every summer. The author argues this is a failure of enforcement, citing too few inspectors, light penalties, and a state agency mired in bureaucracy. The problem is compounded by a worsening climate and the constant threat of immigration raids, which discourages undocumented workers from reporting unsafe conditions. The article calls for modern solutions like wearable heat sensors, real-time enforcement networks, and better training, asserting that the state has failed to match its enforcement urgency with the life-threatening risks workers face.</p>

The path forward, according to the article, is to support a new generation of unbought, progressive leaders who are not afraid to confront powerful lobbies like AIPAC.

          <p>President Trump's recent federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force, justified by claims of a crime crisis, echoes a 1992 incident but with a key difference in context. Thirty-three years ago, the murder of a congressional staffer prompted a federal push for a death penalty referendum when the city was genuinely experiencing a record-high murder rate. In contrast, Trump's action comes as D.C.'s violent crime is at a 30-year low, highlighting a use of federal power based on an exaggerated portrayal of current conditions. The article contrasts the historical event, which failed to impose the death penalty, with the current situation, which D.C. leaders call an unprecedented assault on home rule.</p>

The article notes that while forecasting technology has improved, budget and staffing cuts at key agencies like NOAA and the National Weather Service could undermine these advances. These reductions, including the elimination of research divisions and a decline in weather balloon launches, have created vulnerabilities in the nation's ability to predict and respond to severe storms. The true impact of these cuts may only become clear when a major hurricane makes landfall.</p>

The unionization was facilitated by a neutrality agreement from parent company Microsoft, which has allowed thousands of its gaming employees to organize more easily.

They discuss a time of immense freedom and collaboration with artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, contrasting it with today's more constrained environment.

He stated the move is intended to "bury the idea of a Palestinian state" by connecting the Maale Adumim settlement to Jerusalem, which would sever the West Bank's territorial contiguity. This decision comes as several countries have declared their intention to recognize a Palestinian state and has been condemned by anti-settlement groups as an act that deepens annexation. Settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law.</p>

          <p>Civilians trapped in the besieged city of el-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region are facing a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with rare footage revealing widespread starvation and a deadly cholera outbreak. The city, a key frontline in the two-year civil war, has been blockaded by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), causing food prices to skyrocket and aid to be cut off. Doctors report that malnourished children are dying daily, while a cholera epidemic sweeps through displaced persons' camps. International aid organizations have condemned the situation as the "calculated use of starvation as a weapon of war."</p>

          <p>UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick has accused French police of inaction after he reported a group of approximately 50 migrants with life jackets near Calais, seemingly preparing to cross the Channel. Jenrick claims that despite his call to emergency services, he was told police would likely not respond, and no officers ever arrived. The incident occurred during a visit where he also had to flee a migrant camp after a man allegedly threw glass bottles at him. Jenrick described the situation as a "national security emergency" and criticized the French response as an "utter farce," despite the UK providing significant funding to curb illegal crossings.</p>

          <p>An accident at Coney Beach Pleasure Park in Porthcawl, Wales, resulted in minor injuries to thirteen children and one adult after a cart on a rollercoaster derailed. The incident occurred on the "Wacky Worm" ride, described as a small introductory rollercoaster, on Wednesday evening. One witness described a loud bang before a metal railing fell onto her son's pram, and she saw children screaming as a cart left the track. South Wales Police and ambulance services responded, with seven patients taken to the hospital for further treatment, and the park will remain closed for investigation.</p>

          <h2>Wolverhampton Council Faces Criticism Over Higher Burial Fees for Larger Graves</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council is facing criticism for introducing what some are calling a "fat tax" for burials at its Danescourt cemetery. Families requiring a wider 6ft plot will now pay £2,700, a 20% increase compared to a standard 5ft grave. The council states the change responds to increased demand for larger graves due to rising obesity rates and covers the extra costs incurred. However, a local funeral director and some residents have criticized the move as unfair discrimination, adding a financial burden on grieving families. The council notes that many other local authorities have similar pricing structures.</p>

          <p>German football champion Bayern Munich has ended its controversial sponsorship deal with Rwanda's government tourist board, which featured "Visit Rwanda" on its branding. The club cited a "strategic evolution" for the change, though the decision follows significant pressure from fans and human rights activists concerned about Rwanda's human rights record and its alleged role in the conflict in DR Congo. Instead of the branding deal, Bayern will now focus on a partnership for football development through its youth academy in Kigali. Experts suggest the initial deal was part of a broader strategy for European clubs to expand into the African market.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, a Kyiv resident describes the visceral terror and emotional numbness of living under escalating Russian bombardment in the fourth year of the invasion. The author details the new Russian tactic of exhausting air defenses with drones before launching devastating missile strikes on sleeping cities. He notes that civilian casualties and Russian territorial gains have surged since the Trump administration re-engaged with Moscow, arguing that this is seen as weakness by the Kremlin. The article powerfully conveys the human cost of a single day's attack, recounting the names of families and children killed, and the collective trauma of a nation where grief has become a constant.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasing its direct influence over corporate America, exemplified by demanding a share of Nvidia's revenue and calling for the firing of specific executives, yet CEOs are largely remaining silent. This approach, which includes public attacks and demands for policy alignment, represents a significant escalation of presidential intervention in private business. Experts express concern that this creates a "state capitalism" environment where business success depends on political cronyism rather than free-market principles. Despite unease, many corporate leaders are avoiding public criticism, reportedly due to fear of retribution from a vindictive White House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A national political battle over congressional districts has intensified, with at least eight states now considering redrawing their maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The conflict was ignited by President Trump's request for Texas Republicans to create five more GOP-favorable seats, prompting a swift response from California Democrats who plan a ballot measure to counter-gerrymander. This article provides a state-by-state breakdown of the complex situation, detailing the legal and political hurdles in Texas, California, Missouri, Ohio, New York, Illinois, Indiana, and Florida. The outcomes in these states could significantly impact control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps is an Effective Target for Health Benefits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While 10,000 steps a day is a popular fitness goal, a comprehensive review of scientific data suggests that aiming for around 7,000 steps provides significant health benefits with diminishing returns beyond that number. A new study in The Lancet Public Health found that taking 7,000 steps daily was associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of dying compared to taking just 2,000 steps. It also correlated with lower risks of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. Researchers emphasize that while more steps are not harmful, 7,000 can be a more realistic and highly effective target for people struggling to be more active.</p>
