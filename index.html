          <p>Miami quarterback Cam Ward was selected by the Tennessee Titans as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. Ward's selection marks the third consecutive year a quarterback has been chosen first overall, highlighting the position's importance in the league. The draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is considered less talent-laden than previous years, leading to greater unpredictability in team selections. Rounds two and three will take place Friday, followed by rounds four through seven on Saturday.</p>

          <p>Joseph Kling, a 19-year-old, has been charged with aggravated arson and arson after allegedly starting a bonfire that led to a large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey. The fire, which consumed over 15,000 acres and destroyed a commercial building, is about 50% contained, and officials fear it could be the largest in the state in 20 years. The wildfire prompted evacuation orders that have since been lifted, and the smoke caused air quality alerts in New York City. Kling is currently held at the Ocean County Jail pending a hearing, and authorities emphasize the dangers of starting fires in dry conditions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration experienced a series of legal defeats in federal courts, impacting policies on education, voting rights, and immigration. Judges blocked the government from withholding funds from schools with DEI programs and sanctuary jurisdictions. A judge also prevented the administration from requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration, asserting that only Congress can institute such a change. Further legal challenges involve immigration issues and the dismantling of the Department of Education, presenting ongoing obstacles to the president's agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of a negotiated settlement to the war between Russia and Ukraine. This would reverse a decade of U.S. policy, including the official "Crimea Declaration" issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, which pledged to maintain non-recognition of Russia's annexation until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored. As a candidate, Trump had previously expressed openness to the idea of recognizing Russian control, signaling a potential shift in American foreign policy.</p>

He criticized the schools' "pathetic" rules that keep children indoors, advocating for a shift towards less technology and more outdoor engagement in education. Grant urged other parents to join him in challenging the overreliance on technology in schools, suggesting that collective parental action could drive change.</p>

Concerns stem from potential effects on the online ads market, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, due to tariffs and changes to the de minimis exemption. The company expects potential impacts on materials needed for technical infrastructure and a pullback in advertising spending due to budget constraints, but executives emphasized the company's experience in managing through uncertain times.</p>

Lower-end stores are expected to be hit hard by tariffs on low-cost imports, and the first signs of shortages are anticipated in price-sensitive categories like toys, games, budget home goods, and apparel. The risk of retail shortages will depend on the duration of high tariff levels and the extent to which companies have frontloaded inventory.</p>

          <p>Taylor Fresh Foods, a Salinas-based produce supplier, is facing lawsuits from nine victims of a November E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce. The outbreak, which resulted in one death and at least 88 illnesses, was not publicly disclosed by the FDA, despite federal investigators tracing the cases back to a single grower. The lawsuits allege that Taylor Fresh Foods originated the "defective and unreasonably dangerous" food products, while the company denies being the source of the outbreak. The FDA's decision not to publicize the outbreak has raised concerns about transparency and food safety.</p>
