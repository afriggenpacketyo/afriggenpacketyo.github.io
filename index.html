          <p>Analysts suggest that trade relations between the U.S. and China are experiencing a period of stability following heightened tensions and tariff battles. Both countries appear to be retreating from extreme positions, aiming for an eventual agreement. A temporary pause, initiated in May, is expected to last three months, potentially capping tariffs and encouraging resumed rare earth exports from China. While the Iran crisis introduces some uncertainty, its impact on a U.S.-China deal is projected to be minimal, with any effects primarily limited to rhetoric. Optimism is growing that a more organized and moderated approach to negotiations will lead to a resolution. </p>

          <p>A man has pleaded guilty to a federal crime after allegedly kicking a Customs and Border Protection K9 named Freddy at Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred as Freddy, a beagle trained to detect illicit agricultural contraband, was inspecting luggage from an EgyptAir flight. The man, identified as Hamed Aly Marie, reportedly kicked Freddy so hard that the dog was lifted off the ground, resulting in injuries that required veterinary care. Marie has been sentenced to probation and ordered to pay restitution; if he remains in the U.S. beyond the current week, he must return to court for additional probation conditions. </p>

          <p>The State Department is potentially preparing to lay off hundreds of Washington, D.C.-based employees as part of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's effort to streamline the bureaucracy. The timing of these cuts is contingent on a looming Supreme Court decision that could impact the administration's ability to proceed with the reductions in force. The American Foreign Service Association has urged the State Department to comply with a federal court order prohibiting mass layoffs during ongoing litigation, but a senior State Department official denies any plans to violate court orders. Internal correspondence suggests that over 2,000 staffers could be affected, with potential layoffs beginning soon. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals approaching retirement, annuities are increasingly considered as a means to secure guaranteed monthly income. A $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65 could yield monthly payments ranging from approximately $1,200 to $1,300, influenced by factors such as gender, annuity type, and prevailing interest rates. Women typically receive slightly lower monthly amounts due to longer life expectancies, and the annuity structure impacts payouts, with single-life annuities offering higher payments that cease upon death. The decision to purchase an annuity should align with an individual's broader retirement income strategy, considering factors like Social Security benefits, longevity expectations, and liquidity needs.

          <p>Spain's Constitutional Court has largely upheld the amnesty law for Catalan separatists involved in the 2017 independence push. The law has pardoned over 300 people and was part of an agreement between the Socialist Party and Catalan separatist parties to maintain Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in power. The conservative opposition has criticized the law as unconstitutional, but the court, with a Socialist-nominated majority, rejected most points of their appeal. However, the ruling does not directly benefit Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan separatist leader who remains in self-imposed exile due to embezzlement charges. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of South Carolina's effort to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. The court's 6-3 decision reverses a lower court ruling and allows the state to strip the organization of Medicaid funds. The ruling hinged on whether Medicaid beneficiaries can sue to enforce their ability to seek care from the provider of their choice. Justice Jackson dissented, arguing that the decision weakens civil rights protections and deprives Medicaid recipients of their freedom to choose their healthcare provider, potentially leading to tangible harm for real people. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans encountered a significant setback in their efforts to pass a tax and spending package as a chamber official ruled against a key Medicaid provision. The nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian determined that the proposed change to state taxation of Medicaid providers does not comply with the rules for passing the bill with a simple majority. This provision was intended to offset the costs of the bill's tax cuts, leading Senate Republicans to propose a $15 billion rural health stabilization fund, which was also rejected.

          <p>A woman in the United Kingdom has been sentenced to 28 months in prison for jewelry theft after selfies posted on social media led to a criminal investigation. Lucy Roberts, 39, was convicted of stealing over Â£124,000 worth of jewelry and cash from a luxury store where she was previously the manager. Roberts acquired the jewelry during her employment, falsely claiming to colleagues that she was sorting stock at home. After leaving her job, she posted selfies on a cruise ship wearing the stolen jewels, prompting her former coworkers to alert the police. </p>

          <p>Emergency fire and ambulance services in small US towns, traditionally staffed by volunteers since the 1970s and 1980s, are facing increasing challenges. The aging volunteer base and declining enrollment among young people, coupled with a higher cost of living and diminishing rural population, have made volunteering less appealing. Experts suggest that a potential solution to revitalize these services may involve compensating volunteers for their time. This approach aims to address the financial constraints and incentivize participation in essential emergency response roles within these communities. </p>

Concerns center around Mamdani's support for taxing the ultra-wealthy, financial transactions, and passive income, as well as his endorsement of a state-level wealth tax. Shares of New York regional bank Flagstar and office-focused real estate stocks have already declined in response to Mamdani's primary victory. </p>

The survey also reveals that a majority of CFOs (64%) believe tariffs will negatively affect the economy, and all CFOs acknowledge that current policy uncertainty is impacting their ability to make business decisions. CFOs anticipate bond yields on the 10-year Treasury to remain elevated, and most do not expect inflation to return to the Fed's target rate of 2% before the second half of 2026.

Azizi argues that Khamenei's policies have led to economic destruction, international isolation, and domestic repression, leaving him weakened and isolated. He explores possible succession scenarios, including the potential rise of Khamenei's son, Mojtaba, and the possibility of a more pragmatic, developmentalist regime focused on economic integration with the West.

          <p>AI reasoning models, designed to tackle complex problems by breaking them into logical steps, are facing scrutiny over their actual problem-solving capabilities. Recent research, including a white paper from Apple, suggests that these models struggle to generalize and may simply be memorizing patterns instead of generating genuinely new solutions. Concerns have been raised about the models' "jagged intelligence" and their limitations in meeting real-world enterprise demands. While some experts argue that these warnings may be influenced by companies positioning themselves in the AI race, the constraints could indicate potential issues with the narrative driving the AI infrastructure market. </p>

          <p>Japan's transport ministry is considering changes to delivery rules to promote contactless drop-offs and reduce redeliveries, addressing the driver shortage. The ministry held its first panel meeting to discuss measures needed to prevent theft and damage when parcels are left unattended. Panel members also raised concerns about security and privacy when drivers enter residential premises while customers are away. Participants discussed ways to encourage customers to install parcel boxes and lockers. </p>
