The government denies these claims, citing security concerns as the reason for restrictions on public events. This situation unfolds within a broader context of what critics describe as a shrinking space for civil liberties and rising authoritarianism in the country, as noted by international rights organizations.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for the establishment of an international center to coordinate global governance on artificial intelligence, aiming to address what he terms a "fragmented trend." The proposal, made at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, is seen as an effort by China to expand its influence in the rapidly evolving sector. This move comes as the U.S. releases its own policy framework designed to bolster American AI dominance.</p>

          <p>Travel and housekeeping experts have highlighted several of the dirtiest spots in hotel rooms, which can harbor significantly more bacteria than permitted in hospitals. Beyond obvious areas, decorative elements like pillows and bed runners, which are rarely washed, are major culprits. Other high-touch surfaces such as remote controls, light switches, and even ice buckets are also frequently contaminated, prompting advice for guests to disinfect these items upon arrival.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunis to denounce President Kais Saied's rule, marking the fourth anniversary of his move to dissolve parliament and govern by decree.
