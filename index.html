          <p>The Royal Air Force (RAF) has reversed a 60-year-old ban on Tunnock's teacakes after tests proved they don't explode at high altitudes.  The ban stemmed from a 1965 incident where unwrapped teacakes in a cockpit depressurized, causing a sticky mess.  Following altitude chamber tests conducted by the RAF Centre of Aerospace Medicine, the teacakes were deemed safe for flight. The results were broadcast by the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS).</p>

This move is driven by the EU's significant reliance on U.S. tech companies and the perceived unfairness of Trump's tariff calculations, which only considered goods trade deficits.

          <p>Birmingham, UK, is experiencing mile-long queues at mobile waste collection sites due to an ongoing bin workers' strike.  The strike, declared a major incident, has resulted in a significant backlog of uncollected waste.  The council's attempts to implement a contingency service have been hampered by the union's actions.  The situation is further complicated by reports of fly-tipping and concerns about increasing pest problems due to the accumulating rubbish.</p>

          <h2>Strong Job Growth in March Offers Temporary Relief Amidst Economic Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March, significantly exceeding expectations and suggesting a resilient labor market.  However, this positive news is tempered by the recent imposition of tariffs, which could negatively impact future job growth.  Economists are divided on the long-term implications, with some suggesting the strength of the labor market could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. The strong job numbers are seen by some as a temporary positive before the impact of the tariffs is fully realized.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian refugees in the U.S., who arrived under the Uniting for Ukraine program, are facing potential deportation following the Trump administration's suspension of the program and the halting of work permit renewals.  Many Ukrainians are unable to renew their temporary legal status or find alternative pathways to remain in the country.  This situation leaves them in a precarious position, caught between the ongoing war in Ukraine and the uncertainty of their legal status in the U.S.  Advocates are urging Congress to intervene and provide a pathway to legal status for these refugees.</p>
