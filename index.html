          <p>According to analysis from CNBC's Jim Cramer, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia distinguished themselves from the other 'Magnificent Seven' technology stocks by ending the first half of 2025 at all-time highs. Microsoft's success was attributed to its Azure cloud business beating growth expectations, demonstrating significant momentum. Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip sector continued to drive its value despite earlier concerns about competition and US government sales restrictions in China. Meta's outperformance was linked to its surprisingly strong quarterly earnings and robust advertising capabilities, showcasing its resilience in the market.</p>

          <p>A New York jury has awarded $22.75 million to Maruf Hossain, a deliveryman who lost all five toes on one foot after falling from a damaged subway platform in 2017. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) was found liable for the incident, which also caused Hossain pelvic fractures and head trauma. During the trial, the MTA's defense argued that Hossain had attempted suicide, a claim his lawyers refuted by noting his lack of any psychiatric history. Hossain's attorney stated the verdict sends a message to powerful corporations that they cannot evade responsibility for negligence that results in severe harm.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the suspect accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in November 2022, is reportedly set to accept a plea agreement. This development comes as a surprise, as his trial was scheduled to begin in August, and it has drawn criticism from victims' families who were hoping for the death penalty. Investigators linked Kohberger, a criminology Ph.D. student at the time, to the crime through DNA from a knife sheath left at the scene, cellphone records, and surveillance of his vehicle. The plea deal would bring a conclusion to a case that has garnered international attention for its brutal nature.</p>

          <p>Despite navigating turbulent US trade policies, China's economy has remained relatively stable through the first half of 2025, keeping its annual GDP growth target of around 5% within reach. The country has managed to offset a decline in US shipments by increasing trade with a more diverse range of international partners. However, economists warn of significant challenges ahead, with some forecasting that export growth will slow or even contract in the second half of the year. This potential slowdown is attributed to the front-loading of orders and an anticipated decrease in US consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Since his transfer to Real Madrid, Trent Alexander-Arnold has quickly justified the club's decision to pay a fee to secure him before his Liverpool contract expired. The right-back provided a crucial assist in the Club World Cup, helping his new team advance and earning them an additional Â£10 million in prize money, more than covering his transfer cost. Under new coach Xabi Alonso, Alexander-Arnold is adapting to a wing-back role in a different tactical system, showing growing confidence with each match. While questions about his defensive work remain, his offensive contributions and high-quality deliveries are already proving to be a valuable asset for the Spanish club.</p>

Bass defended the city's stance, condemning federal raids for indiscriminately targeting residents and creating fear, and asserted that city leaders would not be intimidated.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a move aimed at accelerating housing construction across the state. The reforms, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, will waive CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing developments in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This change eliminates a major tool that opponents have historically used to delay or block new housing projects through lengthy environmental reviews and lawsuits. While other hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the legislation marks a major shift in state policy, prioritizing housing abundance over previous development regulations.</p>

Critics argue that the overhaul, which exempts many urban developments from environmental review, represents an unprecedented rollback of fundamental protections for ecosystems and vulnerable communities. A coalition of over 100 groups warned that the changes could allow industrial facilities to be built without proper oversight, posing risks to public health.

          <p>A provision within a new government spending bill could represent one of the most significant federal restrictions on abortion access since the 1976 Hyde Amendment. The measure would block abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any services, including non-abortion care like cancer screenings and STI testing. This would affect clinics nationwide, not just in states with existing abortion restrictions, potentially forcing many to close or drastically reduce services. The move marks a strategic shift, targeting the financial viability of providers across the country and departing from President Trump's previous "leave it to the states" stance.</p>

To secure passage, leadership made last-minute concessions, including adding a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals and other provisions targeted at moderate holdouts like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives for a challenging vote.</p>

          <p>Following its narrow passage in the Senate, President Trump's sweeping policy bill now faces an uncertain future in the House of Representatives, where Speaker Mike Johnson confronts potential opposition from within his own party. Several House Republicans have already voiced objections to the Senate's version, which includes deeper Medicaid cuts and a larger increase to the debt ceiling than the original House bill. With a razor-thin majority, Johnson can only afford to lose a few votes to pass the legislation. The situation is further complicated by potential attendance issues and a tight, self-imposed deadline to get the bill to the president's desk.</p>

          <p>A New York jury has reached verdicts on four of the five counts against music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs but remains deadlocked on the primary racketeering charge. The jury found consensus on two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation for prostitution involving two women, though the verdicts have not yet been revealed. Prosecutors accused Combs of using his Bad Boy Entertainment enterprise to facilitate a pattern of abuse, coercion, and sexual assault over decades. The trial featured graphic testimony from former girlfriends and an assistant who described a culture of control and violence orchestrated by Combs.</p>

          <p>In a last-minute change, the Senate version of President Trump's domestic policy bill eliminated a proposed excise tax that would have significantly impacted the renewable energy industry. The tax targeted wind and solar projects using materials from prohibited countries like China and was expected to raise consumer energy prices. The bill also modified the phase-out of clean energy tax credits, extending the timeline for some projects already in development. Despite these concessions, environmental groups argue the legislation will still harm the clean energy sector by ending key consumer tax credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient home improvements.</p>

Speaking at a conference, Powell explained that the Fed adopted a cautious "wait and see" approach after the tariffs were announced, as inflation forecasts subsequently rose. He noted that while the tariffs have not yet had a major economic impact, they could lead to higher inflation later in the summer. This stance has drawn repeated criticism from President Trump, who has publicly pressured the Fed to ease rates to stimulate the economy.</p>

          <p>The major tax-and-spending package passed by Senate Republicans contains numerous provisions that could significantly affect Americans' personal finances. The bill aims to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent while introducing new deductions for tip income, overtime pay, and car loan interest. It also proposes raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction and creating new child savings accounts. However, these benefits are offset by substantial cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, an overhaul of the student loan system, and the elimination of clean energy tax credits, creating a mixed financial outlook for different households.</p>

          <p>The spending bill advanced by Senate Republicans includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, a move the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cause 11.8 million people to lose health insurance by 2034. The legislation imposes strict new work requirements for many beneficiaries and caps the provider taxes states use to help fund their Medicaid programs. Healthcare advocates warn these changes will not only strip coverage from vulnerable populations but also threaten the financial viability of rural hospitals, which are heavily reliant on Medicaid funding. While a small fund was added to support these hospitals, critics argue it is insufficient to offset the massive cuts.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid has secured a spot in the Club World Cup quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over Juventus in Miami. The decisive moment came from 21-year-old academy striker Gonzalo GarcÃ­a, who scored his third goal of the tournament with a powerful header from a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross. The match also saw the long-awaited debut of Kylian MbappÃ© for Real Madrid, who came on as a substitute after recovering from a stomach virus. Despite Juventus having early chances, Madrid controlled much of the game, setting up a next-round match against either Borussia Dortmund or Monterrey.</p>

          <h2>France Implements Widespread Public Smoking Ban to Combat High Smoking Rates</h2>

          <p>France has enacted a new law banning smoking in most public outdoor areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in an effort to "denormalize" the habit. Violators of the new rules could face fines up to 700 euros. This measure aims to address France's high smoking rate, where over 30% of adults smoke and 75,000 people die from tobacco-related illnesses annually. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public spaces like restaurants since 2008, cafÃ© terraces remain a notable exception, which some smokers view as a final bastion of personal freedom.</p>

          <p>Retailer Nordstrom will be closing its store at the Santa Monica Place shopping center in August as part of a broader restructuring to adapt to the rise of online shopping. While the company cited a desire to better serve customers through surrounding stores and digital channels, the closure comes amid growing concerns over public safety in downtown Santa Monica. The area has experienced high-profile robberies and an increase in its homeless population, creating challenges for local businesses. This move is part of a larger trend of major retailers, including Macy's and Walmart, closing physical locations to realign their business strategies.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team defeated England by 24 runs in Bristol, taking a commanding 2-0 lead in the five-match T20 series. After a shaky start, India recovered to post a strong total of 181-4, thanks to impressive half-centuries from Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur. In response, England's batting lineup faltered early, slumping to 17-3 and failing to build momentum despite a solid knock of 54 from Tammy Beaumont. The loss highlights ongoing struggles for England's batters and puts the team's new leadership under pressure as they face a confident and rapidly improving Indian side.</p>
