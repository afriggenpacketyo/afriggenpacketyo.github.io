          <p>A suspect is in custody following a targeted act of violence at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, where six people were injured during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails while yelling "free Palestine." The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, sustained burn injuries, with one in critical condition. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism, and authorities have evacuated several blocks of Pearl Street as they continue their investigation. The Boulder Jewish community expressed sadness and heartbreak, emphasizing the importance of community support and safety during this difficult time.</p>

          <p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, expressed concerns about a potential wave of repression by Nicolás Maduro's regime following the U.S. decision to restrict Chevron's operations in Venezuela. Machado, who is in hiding, stated that the economic situation in Venezuela is unsustainable and worsening, with triple-digit inflation and a minimum wage of just $1.50 per month. She believes Maduro's regime is increasingly isolated internationally and faces an irreversible economic crisis, although the military's continued support and a divided opposition present challenges. Machado views the partial revocation of Chevron's license as a positive step, hoping to limit resources available to the regime during a potential democratic transition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by Universities UK warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more effectively to deliver courses amidst a challenging financial situation. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed support for collaboration where possible, acknowledging the financial difficulties facing the higher education sector. The report suggests that greater collaboration between universities could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient, preventing isolated decisions about course closures or mergers. Increased collaboration may involve universities agreeing to specialize in specific subjects to avoid duplication and ensure cost-effectiveness, ultimately benefiting students by maintaining access to a wider range of courses.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures preventing children in temporary accommodation from "going missing" from schools and GPs, following widespread family displacement across the country. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary housing, with over 164,000 homeless children currently in temporary accommodation across England. Families are being displaced due to a lack of affordable housing, with some Londoners moved far away from their original communities, impacting children's education and well-being. The government claims to be investing £1 billion in homelessness services this year to aid families in temporary accommodation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks suffered a frustrating 85-80 loss to the Phoenix Mercury at Crypto.com Arena, marking their third consecutive defeat after relinquishing an 18-point lead. The Sparks struggled in the third quarter, being outscored 24-9, which proved to be their undoing, as consistency in transition defense and fluid ball movement were lacking. Despite a strong first quarter with a new starting lineup, the Sparks became visibly frustrated in the second half, and the game turned physical and chippy. Odyssey Sims led the Sparks with 32 points, relentlessly attacking the basket, but her effort wasn't enough to secure the win as the team now faces a challenging road schedule.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law granting the state the power to expropriate privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, sparking controversy both domestically and internationally. The law, known as the Expropriation Act, aims to address racial inequality in land ownership, as most private farmland is still owned by white people. While compensation is expected in most cases, the law allows for expropriation without compensation in rare instances, such as when land is unused or held for speculative purposes. The government hopes the new law will expedite land reform and restore land to black people dispossessed during white-minority rule, though critics argue it threatens property rights.</p>

Despite numerous appeals to various official bodies, Williams has been told that his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time.

          <p>Dozens of wildfires in Canada have forced the evacuation of over 25,000 residents across three provinces, significantly impacting air quality in both Canada and parts of the U.S. Manitoba has declared a state of emergency, with the majority of evacuees coming from that province, and neighboring provinces like Saskatchewan and Alberta are also experiencing significant displacement. The ongoing hot, dry weather is exacerbating the fires, stretching resources thin, and smoke is reducing visibility and worsening air quality. International assistance is being provided by the U.S., which is sending firefighters and equipment to help combat the blazes.</p>

          <p>An analyst argues that unpredictability stemming from the White House under the Trump administration is negatively impacting the stock market, creating a "Trump discount." The analyst suggests that the lack of stability is causing investors to look elsewhere, even to economies with weaker fundamentals, and cites examples of various sectors being held back by this uncertainty. The analyst points to potential government interventions, regulatory changes, and unpredictable policy decisions as factors contributing to the market's instability. The analyst believes the market is not accurately reflecting the strength of many U.S. companies due to the pervasive influence and uncertainty generated by the White House.

          <p>Pharmacists are warning that a shortage of Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, is significantly affecting cancer patients, who require the medication for digestion. Patients are reportedly rationing their medication, skipping meals, and traveling long distances to obtain it, with some experts predicting shortages continuing into next year. The National Pharmacy Association reports that current arrangements for managing the shortages are inadequate, and a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson cited European-wide supply issues. Without the drug, patients lose weight and strength, which reduces their ability to cope with cancer treatments like chemotherapy.</p>

          <p>A study predicts that Earth's atmosphere will eventually revert to a state rich in methane and low in oxygen, leading to the suffocation of most complex life forms, including humans, in about a billion years. The shift will occur rapidly, taking the planet back to conditions similar to those before the Great Oxidation Event, and is driven by changes in the brightness of the Sun and a corresponding drop in carbon dioxide levels. The researchers say that atmospheric oxygen is unlikely to be a permanent feature of habitable worlds in general, which has implications for our efforts to detect signs of life further out in the Universe.</p>
