The call between Mr. Trump and the Russian leader, which the Kremlin confirmed on Saturday, would be their second publicly acknowledged conversation over Ukraine since Mr. Trump took office in January. The relentless drone assaults are intended, in part, to exhaust Ukraine’s air defenses so that larger bombardments that often feature cruise missiles and ballistic missiles have a greater chance of inflicting maximum damage.</p>
