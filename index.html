          <p>As pollen seasons lengthen and intensify, Americans are facing more allergy symptoms. The article suggests using over-the-counter remedies to alleviate symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. Solutions include oral antihistamines, corticosteroid nasal sprays, and nasal washes to remove allergens. Additionally, air purifiers can improve indoor air quality by filtering out dust, pollen, and pet dander, creating a haven from high pollen counts.&#x20;</p>

          <p>A US neo-Nazi terrorist group, The Base, led by a Russia-based leader, is reportedly calling for targeted assassinations and infrastructure attacks in Ukraine, aiming to destabilize the country during ceasefire negotiations. The group, previously under FBI investigation, is now openly aligning with Kremlin's geopolitical goals, raising concerns about its involvement in Russian sabotage and propaganda. The Base is offering cash for attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and personnel, promoting a white nationalist enclave in the Zakarpattia region. The authenticity of videos showing alleged members marking locations in Ukrainian cities is being verified.</p>

          <p>China aims to establish cities like Beijing and Shanghai as international arbitration hubs, rivaling London and Singapore. However, experts believe that China needs to further align with international practices and build trust to compete effectively. While China has a significant number of registered arbitration institutions, progress toward becoming true international arbitration centers remains uncertain. The goal is to better address disputes arising from Chinese companies' overseas investments, but significant work is needed to achieve this.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is quietly moving to reverse bans on toxic PFAS and other dangerous chemicals in consumer goods, potentially exposing the public to higher levels of substances linked to cancer, hormone disruption, and reproductive damage. This involves changing how the EPA carries out chemical risk evaluations, pre-empting state laws that offer checks on toxic chemicals. The new rule would require the agency to evaluate whether a chemical presents a risk for each intended use, claiming most chemicals do not present an "unreasonable risk" in consumer goods because they make up such a small part of products. The state laws are effective because they create pressure on industry to stop using dangerous chemicals.</p>

          <p>Oakland's First Fridays street fair faced criticism for using an AI-generated image on its spring flyer instead of commissioning an artist. Organizers defended their decision by citing budget constraints as a local non-profit running a free event.

The debate highlights the increasing presence of AI in creative fields and its potential impact on artists.</p>

The company embraced its unique appearance and shifted its messaging towards self-expression, leading to significant revenue and profitability growth. While Crocs' revenue has been rising, the brand is also trying to grow another casual footwear brand in its portfolio called HeyDude, which it acquired in 2022 for $2.5 billion in cash-and-stock deal. The brand has seen sales decline since its acquisition by Crocs, and was forced to pay nearly $1.9 million to customers in 2024 after facing FTC allegations that it suppressed negative reviews of its product online and improperly refunded customers.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the shift in the United States' image from a welcoming haven for the persecuted to a less appealing option for refugees. The ban on Pride flags over U.S. embassies, driven by anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, sends a negative message to LGBTQ+ individuals fleeing persecution. The author contrasts this with Russia's ban on the rainbow flag and discusses Daria Kasatkina's defection from Russia, highlighting the United States used to be a safe haven for the persecuted, but now that is no longer true.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's environmental policies, including regulatory rollbacks and budget cuts, will negatively impact Americans' health and finances. Reports indicate the changes could lead to premature deaths, increased asthma attacks, and higher healthcare costs. The administration's claims of easing regulatory costs are contradicted by data showing significant financial and health losses. Low-income communities and communities of color will be disproportionately affected by these policies.</p>

          <p>Poodle-dog bush, a plant known for causing skin rashes, is growing in fire-scarred areas of the Angeles National Forest. The plant thrives after wildfires, and hikers are advised to avoid contact. While the plant is native and plays a role in the ecosystem, it can cause severe skin irritation. Plant experts say conditions have paved the way for a new crop of Eriodictyon parryi in the Angeles National Forest — one that could potentially blanket thousands of acres etched with popular recreation trails for a decade to come.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Los Angeles' Measure ULA, a transfer tax on high-value properties, needs reform. It highlights the tax's negative impacts, including a decline in high-value property sales, reduced revenue, and a slowdown in housing production. The authors suggest potential solutions, such as restricting the tax to single-family homes or adopting marginal rates. The most effective approach may be state action, and the article points out the importance of balancing revenue needs with policies that encourage housing and job creation.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler has accused President Trump of exploiting the fight against antisemitism to exert control over universities. Nadler argues that Trump's actions are a guise for authoritarianism and that curtailing free speech on campuses will ultimately harm Jewish people. He points to Trump's appointments of alleged antisemites and the dismantling of the Education Department's civil rights office as evidence of his insincerity. Nadler also expresses concerns about the definition of antisemitism under the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) and its potential to suppress criticism of Israel.</p>
