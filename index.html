          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is directing his company's future towards a comprehensive artificial intelligence strategy, believing that artificial superintelligence (ASI) will arrive within a decade. Building on his historic investment in Alibaba, Son is now aggressively acquiring and investing in AI-related firms, from chip designers like Arm to AI model creators like OpenAI. Despite past setbacks with the Vision Fund and an early, unsuccessful venture into robotics, Son's long-held vision is to create a powerful, integrated AI ecosystem. This high-risk, high-reward strategy positions SoftBank at the forefront of what Son believes is the next fundamental technological revolution.</p>

          <p>Five journalists from Al Jazeera were killed in an Israeli airstrike near the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, according to the broadcaster. The organization condemned the event as a "targeted assassination" and a premeditated attack on press freedom. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed striking one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, a claim al-Sharif had previously denied. The incident brings the total number of journalists confirmed killed in the conflict since October 2023 to 186, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>

          <p>A trash fire that spread to an AT&T communications facility in Gardena, California, caused a temporary outage of the 911 system in nearby Redondo Beach on Sunday. The blaze involved lead-acid batteries, prompting a hazardous materials response and a shelter-in-place order for local residents. Over 100 firefighters battled the fire for five hours before extinguishing it. Redondo Beach police reported that the impact was minimal, with 911 calls being intermittent for a short period before service was restored. No injuries were reported, and the cause of the initial fire is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the only way to achieve the "complete the defeat of Hamas." Speaking to foreign media, Netanyahu outlined goals that include demilitarizing the enclave and installing a non-Israeli civilian administration, while asserting that Israel does not intend to occupy Gaza. The plan, which involves moving Palestinian civilians to designated safe zones, has drawn international condemnation over humanitarian concerns. Netanyahu's statements came as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting and reports emerged of heavy Israeli bombardment in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, a trend driven by climate change that is causing significant shifts in marine life. Scientists and naturalists have observed an influx of species not typically found in UK waters, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish. This warming trend, which includes more frequent and intense marine heatwaves, is also negatively impacting cold-adapted native species like cod. The changes pose challenges to local ecosystems and fishing communities, highlighting the tangible effects of rising global temperatures on the marine environment.</p>

          <p>Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China. This unprecedented arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses for Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips, which are tailored for the Chinese market under U.S. export controls. The agreement comes after the U.S. recently reversed a ban on the sale of the H20 chip to China, removing a significant hurdle for the companies in a key market. The Trump administration has not yet specified how the collected revenue will be utilized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President J.D. Vance has indicated that President Donald Trump is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports as a response to Beijing's ongoing purchases of Russian oil. While no firm decision has been made, the move would be part of the administration's broader effort to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The White House is reportedly weighing its options carefully, acknowledging the complex nature of the U.S.-China relationship and its wide-ranging economic effects. In response, Beijing's embassy in Washington stated that its trade with Russia is normal and falls within the scope of international law.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their collaborative "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe constituted cultural appropriation. The design was inspired by traditional Mexican huarache sandals but was reportedly made in China without consulting or crediting the Indigenous Oaxacan communities who originated the style. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who condemned the practice. Chavarria expressed deep regret for not partnering with the Oaxacan community, and Adidas has committed to a respectful dialogue to honor their cultural legacy.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Israeli Settler Campaign to Displace West Bank Palestinians Has Intensified</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC analysis reports that Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank have significantly intensified their campaign to drive out Palestinians since the Hamas attacks of October 2023. Under the justification of enhanced security measures, ultra-nationalist settlers, supported by hardline government ministers, are accelerating the expansion of settlements and extinguishing hopes for a Palestinian state. Human rights groups accuse Israeli forces of failing to protect Palestinians and, in some cases, participating in attacks. This escalation is transforming the landscape and creating what UN experts call a systemic pattern of human rights violations and forcible displacement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded that homeless people in Washington, D.C., be moved out "IMMEDIATELY" to locations "FAR from the Capital," suggesting the federal government would provide places for them to stay. The statement, made on social media, follows his administration's move to increase federal law enforcement presence in the city and hints at a potential federal takeover of the capital's governance. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, noting that violent crime has been decreasing and is at a 30-year low, contrary to the administration's claims of a crime spike.</p>

          <p>A large gorse fire broke out on Arthur's Seat, the prominent hill in the center of Edinburgh, sending plumes of smoke across the city during one of its busiest festival weekends. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service dispatched four appliances to tackle the blaze, which spread rapidly across the landmark in Holyrood Park. Police urged the public to stay away from the area, and a large section of the park was closed to pedestrians. No casualties were reported, but the incident follows a series of wildfire warnings in Scotland after a particularly warm and dry summer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has ruled that a Trump administration directive allowing commercial fishing in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument is illegal. The decision overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that sought to reverse protections established by the Obama administration. The court stated that the agency violated federal law by bypassing the required public notice and comment process for changing fishing regulations. This ruling is a significant victory for environmental and Native Hawaiian groups who sued to protect the monument's vulnerable ecosystems, coral reefs, and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Arne Slot's tenure as Liverpool manager began with a penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield after a 2-2 draw at Wembley. The match featured competitive debuts for four new Liverpool signings, with Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong both scoring. However, Liverpool twice surrendered the lead, highlighting defensive vulnerabilities that need addressing. Despite the loss, the performance of record signing Florian Wirtz was a standout positive, as he played a free-roaming attacking role and was central to Liverpool's offensive play. The result continues a trend where Community Shield winners rarely go on to win the Premier League.</p>

Despite a mid-innings wobble caused by the Superchargers' spinners, the Rockets reached their target with four balls remaining, maintaining their undefeated start to the tournament.</p>
