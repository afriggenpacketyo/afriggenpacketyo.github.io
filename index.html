          <p>Senate Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes to pass a signature budget bill before a July 4th deadline. The 940-page legislation, which extends tax cuts and overhauls spending, faces opposition from at least three Republican senators, imperiling its passage in the narrowly divided chamber. Key disagreements revolve around welfare cuts, the size of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and new requirements for Medicaid. The White House is pressuring for its approval, warning that failure would be a significant betrayal of the party's agenda.</p>

          <p>Dave Parker, the formidable outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates and a 2025 National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, has passed away at the age of 74.

It also includes a contentious deal to raise the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions and proposes significant cuts to Medicaid, potentially affecting millions. Last-minute changes, such as eliminating the "revenge tax" and adding carve-outs for specific industries, highlight the intense negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe mudslide triggered by heavy rains caused a 12-mile traffic standstill on the West Virginia Turnpike, stranding thousands of motorists for over eight hours. The incident, which occurred about 20 miles south of Charleston, completely blocked northbound lanes, and authorities failed to reroute traffic, leaving drivers stuck overnight. The West Virginia Parkways Authority has taken full responsibility for the failure to implement a detour and is revising its emergency procedures. While no injuries were reported, the event drew criticism for the lack of communication and support for those trapped.</p>

The loss of SSMIS, which accounts for nearly half of all microwave instruments, could severely degrade forecast accuracy and public safety during hurricane season.

While it will not ultimately prevent a vote, the tactic maximizes the political pain for the majority party.

The student-designed device features open hardware, making it accessible for BISM's blind and low-vision employees to operate.

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved new record highs this week, demonstrating resilience in the face of significant geopolitical risk following U.S. military action in Iran. Markets initially reacted to fears of a wider conflict, but a subsequent drop in oil prices eased concerns about a major impact on economic growth and inflation. Investor focus also shifted to potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with markets now pricing in a higher likelihood of three cuts by year-end. This optimism persisted even as the latest PCE inflation data came in slightly hotter than anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with a clear trend of victories for conservative-led states and broad claims of executive authority. While lacking the blockbuster rulings of previous years, the court's 6-3 conservative majority consistently sided with Republican states on issues like transgender care and abortion clinic funding. The justices also reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural win for the current administration. This pattern reflects a states-rights style of conservatism and a deference to presidential power that has largely benefited the administration's agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a "matriarchal society" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published in Science this week. Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a "Mother Goddess" cult and signs of a matriarchal society. A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building. During the early years in Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said. Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males. "We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line â€” a matrilineal system," study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science, said in a statement. These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage. Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said. Researchers said upon the release of their findings, "It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities." contributed to this report.</p>

          <p>A new study of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society where women held significant power.

The original 25mm Bushmaster cannon was replaced with a Russian 2A72 gun, likely to address the lack of compatible ammunition for the captured Western hardware. While Russia has made limited use of captured Bradleys on the battlefield, this modification could be for operational trials, propaganda purposes, or to enable sustained use.

          <p>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) held a party congress to address its political future after a poor showing in recent parliamentary elections. Former Chancellor Olaf Scholz gave a farewell speech, defending his government's policies while also delivering a stark warning about Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine. The congress also saw leadership changes, with Labor Minister BÃ¤rbel Bas elected as a new co-chair. The event reflects a period of transition and self-reflection for the center-left party as it navigates its role in Germany's new political landscape.</p>

          <h2>Republicans Seize on NYC Mayoral Nominee to Brand Democrats as Socialists</h2>

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's primary victory in the New York City mayoral race, Republican leaders are using his self-identified democratic socialist platform as a national line of attack. Figures like Donald Trump and the RNC are portraying Mamdani's win as evidence that the entire Democratic party is embracing "radical" and "communist" ideologies. This strategy aims to energize conservative voters and paint Democrats as out of step with the country ahead of elections. The tactic has also drawn condemnation for what some call Islamophobic attacks against the candidate.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris delivered a stunning qualifying lap to take pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix by more than half a second. Norris described the lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, stating that he felt like "the old me back" after a season hampered by qualifying mistakes. The dominant performance was aided by recent car upgrades that improved his feeling with the front axle. His McLaren teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri, will start in third, setting up a crucial race for Norris to close the points gap.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 13:54:10 EDT</div>

          <p>The wedding celebration of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has created a stark divide in the city, mixing celebrity glamour with local protests. While A-list guests like Leonardo di Caprio and Kim Kardashian arrived for the gala, activists demonstrated against the event, citing concerns over climate change, capitalism, and the impact of "over-tourism" on the fragile city. City officials defended the wedding as "high-quality tourism," but some locals expressed frustration that Venice is becoming an exclusive playground for the ultra-wealthy, pushing out residents.</p>
