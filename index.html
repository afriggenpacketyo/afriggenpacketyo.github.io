This optimism follows Powell's focus on slowing job growth, which outweighed concerns about tariffs, leading to a powerful Friday market rally.

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency due to its infant mortality rate reaching a decade-high, nearly double the national average at 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. Black infants are disproportionately affected, with racial gaps widening. Leading causes include congenital malformations, premature birth, and low birthweight, often exacerbated by structural inequities and limited healthcare access. The declaration aims to expand prenatal services and strengthen community health programs, though federal funding cuts to vital initiatives like PRAMS complicate efforts to address this tragic and preventable crisis.</p>

          <p>Russian officials claimed Ukrainian drones ignited a fire at a nuclear plant in the Kursk region and caused a blaze at Ust-Luga port, coinciding with Ukraine's Independence Day. While the nuclear plant fire was quickly extinguished with normal radiation levels, a transformer was damaged, and no injuries were reported. The UN nuclear watchdog acknowledged media reports but could not independently confirm them, emphasizing the need to protect nuclear facilities. Russia's Defense Ministry stated 95 Ukrainian drones were intercepted, while Ukraine reported 48 Russian drones shot down or jammed, highlighting ongoing intense aerial warfare.</p>

          <p>A contingent of National Guard members in Washington D.C. has been authorized to carry service weapons, escalating President Trump's intervention in local policing. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the arming of these troops, a reversal of previous guidance. Nearly 2,000 Guard members are stationed in the city, primarily protecting landmarks and assisting with crowd control, despite local officials stating violent crime has been declining in recent years. This move comes as Trump asserts control over the Metropolitan Police Department, claiming an "epidemic of crime" and sparking political debate over federal overreach.</p>

This initiative aims to enhance public understanding of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) modernization efforts.

The databank will provide comprehensive insights into these ongoing military developments, including new weapons systems, and their strategic implications for the region and the global balance of power.</p>

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a grim milestone in its spectacular collapse under massive debt. Once China's largest real estate firm, its founder Hui Ka Yan was fined and banned for overstating revenue by $78 billion. The liquidation process continues, with only a fraction of its $45 billion debt recovered, and liquidators believe a complete overhaul is out of reach. This crisis, along with issues faced by other developers, has severely impacted China's economy, leading to widespread layoffs and decreased household wealth, with experts seeing no immediate end to the property slump.</p>

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the 9/11 attacks, new evidence, including a video of a Saudi national filming the US Capitol in 1999 and an airplane sketch, has surfaced. This crucial information, turned over to the FBI post-9/11, was reportedly never shared with field agents or top intelligence officials. Former FBI and CIA analysts express anger and surprise, suggesting it could have aided investigations and prevented the attacks. The evidence is now part of a lawsuit against the Saudi government, which denies involvement, while Omar al-Bayoumi, the Saudi national, remains uncharged.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify deploying federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, overriding local authority. This move, following deployments in D.C. and Los Angeles, is criticized by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson as an abuse of power and unconstitutional. Democrats highlight declining crime rates in Chicago, contrasting Trump's claims of an "out of control" city. The debate underscores deep divisions over federal intervention in local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been removed as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with his deputy assuming the role, a move that caught DIA employees off guard. Congressional intelligence leaders were notified but given no reason for the firing, prompting concerns about politicization. This follows a DIA assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities set back Tehran's program by months, contradicting President Trump's claim of "decades." Senator Mark Warner criticized the administration for treating intelligence as a "loyalty test," indicating deep institutional unease.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident for charging a Tesla in their driveway using the car's standard Level 1 cable, citing aesthetic concerns about "electrical chords running along the ground."
