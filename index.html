          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, linking the move to the ongoing criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, which President Trump described as a "Witch Hunt." This action is part of a broader tariff strategy but is uniquely targeted at Brazil's internal politics, despite the U.S. maintaining a trade surplus with the country. The letter also criticizes Brazil's trade barriers and its Supreme Court's scrutiny of social media platforms, while Brazilian President Lula has vowed to respond with economic reciprocity measures.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice is suing California, arguing that the state's animal welfare laws, which mandate more space for egg-laying hens, are illegal and contribute to high egg prices nationwide. The lawsuit claims these state-level regulations are preempted by federal law and constitute "unnecessary red tape" that harms consumers and farmers. Supporters of the California laws, including the Humane Society, maintain they are crucial for preventing animal cruelty and reducing food safety risks. The legal challenge represents another front in the ongoing political and legal battles between the Trump administration and California's state government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six agents for their roles in the security failures connected to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July 2024. The disciplinary actions, which include suspensions ranging from 10 to 42 days, follow an independent Department of Homeland Security review that found the agency had become "complacent" and was not performing at elite levels. The shooting incident in Butler, Pennsylvania, resulted in the death of a rally attendee and prompted the resignation of then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle amid criticism of the agency's operational breakdowns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 positions at NASA, targeting senior-level employees with specialized skills as part of a broader effort to reduce the federal workforce. According to internal documents, the cuts would deprive the space agency of decades of experience, with most affected staff working in core mission areas like science and human space flight.

Health experts attribute the resurgence of the nearly-eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates, as herd immunity requires a 95% vaccination rate, a threshold many communities are no longer meeting.

          <p>Polaris is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its three-wheeled Slingshot with a limited-edition model, the Slingshot 10, based on the high-performance R version. This vehicle delivers a visceral and unfiltered driving experience, powered by a 2.0-liter ProStar engine that produces 204 horsepower. The open-air cockpit, firm suspension, and direct steering create an intense connection to the road that is neither a car nor a motorcycle but something uniquely in between. While not built for comfort, the Slingshot 10 excels at providing raw, adrenaline-fueled fun and turning heads with its radical design and commemorative styling.</p>

          <p>Detectives in Wales are investigating historical sexual abuse allegations involving a convicted former bishop, Anthony Pierce, and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. A BBC investigation reveals that concerns about Pierce were first reported to church officials in 1986, yet he was later promoted to Bishop of Swansea and Brecon. Victims have come forward to describe how their reports of abuse were ignored for years, prompting calls for an independent inquiry into the church's handling of such cases and its safeguarding procedures. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings.</p>

          <p>The cost of all-inclusive family package holidays from the UK has significantly increased for popular destinations like Spain, Cyprus, and Turkey. According to data compiled for the BBC, the average price for a week in Cyprus in August has risen by 23% compared to last year, while trips to the UAE are up 26%. Travel industry experts attribute the price hikes to higher operational costs for hotels and airlines, including energy, food, and wages. In response, some holidaymakers are opting for shorter trips or mid-week travel to manage costs, though some are still upgrading to premium packages.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California, alleging that the state's policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's and girls' sports violate Title IX. The complaint argues that these policies constitute illegal sex discrimination by depriving female student athletes of equal opportunities. Attorney General Pam Bondi cited comments from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had previously called the issue one of "fairness." A spokesperson for Newsom's office criticized the lawsuit as a politically motivated action by the Trump administration, highlighting the ongoing national debate over transgender rights in sports.</p>

Rather than undertaking a lengthy overhaul of its data centers for liquid cooling, AWS developed this new plug-in solution to support the scale of its operations.

In contrast, Real Madrid appeared shapeless and disjointed, with new star Kylian Mbappé struggling to make an impact against his former team. The result emphasizes PSG's successful post-Mbappé rebuild and raises questions about Madrid's ability to integrate its star attackers into a cohesive unit.</p>

This peak comes as institutional interest grows, with significant corporate purchases and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation. Analysts suggest that the bullish momentum could continue, potentially pushing prices even higher in the near term as trading volumes remain thin during the summer months. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident highlights a broader issue in China's hyper-competitive manufacturing sector, where shrinking profit margins often force companies into a race to the bottom.
