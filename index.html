          <p>Exit polls from South Korean broadcasters KBS, MBC, and SBS indicated that liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung was expected to win the presidential election. With a significant portion of the votes counted, Lee was projected to secure a substantial lead over conservative challenger Kim Moon Soo. A spokesperson for Lee's Democratic Party stated that voters had delivered a strong rebuke to the previous government, while a Conservative party representative expressed shock at the projected outcome. The election is seen as a critical juncture for South Korea, potentially shifting its political direction. Optimism for this article is based on the peaceful transfer of power. </p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its growth expectations for the UK economy downwards, citing the impact of US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt. The OECD now projects UK growth at 1.3% for this year, a decrease from the 1.4% forecast in March. The organization is urging Chancellor Rachel Reeves to address the "very thin" buffer in public finances through increased tax revenue and spending cuts. While acknowledging recent better-than-expected growth, the OECD cautioned that business sentiment is deteriorating, posing a risk to the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) withdrew from the ruling coalition due to disagreements over migration policy. Prime Minister Dick Schoof announced that new elections would be held, with his administration serving in a caretaker role until the vote. Wilders expressed frustration with coalition partners, citing a lack of action on proposals to curb immigration. The collapse comes just weeks before the Netherlands is due to host a NATO summit, potentially impacting planned increases in NATO spending. </p>

          <p>Millions of legal immigrants are facing difficulties in obtaining employment due to a quiet rule change by the US Social Security Administration, which has halted the automatic issuance of social security numbers.

This change requires applicants to visit a Social Security Administration office separately, causing delays and complications.
