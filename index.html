          <p>Key European leaders, including those from Germany, France, the U.K., and Poland, are insisting that Ukraine must be directly involved in any peace negotiations with Russia. While they expressed support for President Trump's efforts to broker a deal with Vladimir Putin in an upcoming Alaska summit, they co-signed a statement emphasizing that a path to peace cannot be determined without Ukraine's participation. The leaders also stressed the need for robust security guarantees for Ukraine. This comes as Vice President JD Vance described the planned summit as a major diplomatic breakthrough aimed at finding a negotiated settlement.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul stated she has found "areas of alignment" with Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist frontrunner for New York City mayor, particularly on the issue of affordability. While acknowledging their many political differences, Hochul noted that Mamdani's campaign has "touched a nerve" with voters who feel left behind by economic policies. Hochul, who once served as Lieutenant Governor under Andrew Cuomo, affirmed her commitment to working with whomever voters choose as mayor. Cuomo is also running in the general election as an independent candidate after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani.</p>

          <p>A violent shootout at a nightclub in the coastal province of Guayas, Ecuador, has left eight people dead and three others injured, marking the latest incident in a severe wave of crime sweeping the nation. Authorities reported that heavily armed suspects arrived on motorcycles and in vehicles before opening fire. This attack follows another recent incident where gunmen killed four people on a boat. Ecuador has been grappling with a surge in violence attributed to disputes among organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels, with thousands of homicides recorded this year alone.</p>

          <p>A large gorse fire broke out on Arthur's Seat, the iconic hill in the center of Edinburgh, prompting a major response from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. The blaze spread rapidly across the landmark, which is popular with tourists and locals, sending plumes of smoke across the city during the busy festival season. Police urged the public to stay away from the area and closed a large section of Holyrood Park to pedestrians. Eyewitnesses described seeing the fire grow quickly and having to rush down the hill to safety. This incident follows a series of wildfire warnings in Scotland amid a particularly warm and dry summer.</p>

The UN warned of "another calamity" and described the hunger crisis as "starvation, pure and simple." The U.S. defended Israel's right to act, asserting the war could end if Hamas released the hostages.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted landmark heat safety laws for outdoor laborers, farmworkers continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. Advocates and some lawmakers argue that the system is failing due to ineffective enforcement by Cal/OSHA, which has been criticized for insufficient staffing and outdated procedures. The situation is compounded by the fact that many farmworkers are undocumented and fear retaliation if they report unsafe working conditions. As climate change brings more frequent and intense heatwaves, the risks for these essential workers are escalating.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators marched through central London, calling for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Led by the UK's chief rabbi, protesters held Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages, some of whom are believed to still be alive. Many attendees expressed anger at the UK government's conditional plan to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a "reward for Hamas" and arguing the priority should be securing the hostages' freedom. The Metropolitan Police reported three arrests during the demonstration, which saw minor scuffles with a few counter-protesters.</p>

The union is demanding that federal health officials, including HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., issue a clear and unequivocal condemnation of such disinformation.

          <p>A new NPR series, "The World, Reordering," examines the significant shifts occurring in the global power structure. For decades, the "liberal international order" was defined by U.S. leadership, globalization, and multilateralism, but this system is now fracturing due to the resurgence of authoritarian powers and shifting alliances. The series explores how U.S. policies are prompting allies to seek new security and defense partnerships, creating a vacuum that other nations are moving to fill. It aims to understand the dynamics of this new, uncertain era and how apparent disorder may be laying the groundwork for a new system of international relations.</p>

          <p>The FDA is facing turmoil over its drug approval process, highlighted by the recent suspension of a gene therapy from Sarepta Therapeutics for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The treatment, which costs $3.2 million per patient, was granted accelerated approval in 2023 despite limited clinical data, a decision initially seen as a sign of the agency's flexibility for rare diseases. However, after three patients died from acute liver failure, the FDA requested the company halt distribution, causing Sarepta's stock to plummet. This case underscores the difficult dilemmas the agency faces when balancing rapid access to novel treatments with ensuring patient safety.</p>

This action is seen as the latest reflection of ongoing tensions between Trump and his predecessors.

          <h2>Conservative Commentator Charlie Kirk Criticizes Trump's Potential Marijuana Reclassification</h2>

          <p>Conservative pundit Charlie Kirk has publicly criticized President Trump for reportedly considering the reclassification of marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. On social media, Kirk expressed his hope that the change does not happen, complaining that public spaces are already negatively impacted by marijuana use. This stance contrasts with a 2018 post from Kirk where he stated people should not be imprisoned for marijuana-related offenses. The Trump administration is reportedly considering moving marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, which would ease some federal restrictions and open the door for more medical research.</p>

          <p>A London demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws, resulted in 532 arrests, the largest number by the Metropolitan Police on a single day in a decade. The majority were arrested for displaying placards supporting the banned organization, which is a criminal offense. The protest was organized to challenge the ban, which critics like Amnesty International argue is overly broad and threatens freedom of expression. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the proscription, stating it was based on strong security advice regarding serious attacks committed by the group.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine, a move Trump initiated to broker a peace deal. The summit follows several unsuccessful rounds of talks and a deadline Trump set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will not be present at this initial meeting, a White House official indicated a trilateral meeting could happen later. The proposed deal reportedly involves territorial swaps, a concept Zelenskyy has firmly rejected, stating any decisions made without Ukraine's involvement would be meaningless.</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid a heartfelt tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who died at the age of 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," described him as a man who dared to lead others to places most would not go on their own. Lovell commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, which famously overcame an in-flight explosion to return the crew safely to Earth. Hanks noted that Lovell's voyages were fueled by the challenge of being alive, not a desire for riches or celebrity, and wished him godspeed on his next voyage to the cosmos.</p>

          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that building a personal brand is a crucial career tool, especially for introverted professionals who are often underestimated. She defines a personal brand as simply what people know you for at work and suggests it allows individuals to shape their own professional narrative. Chan advises starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or participating in hobby groups, to build confidence and visibility. This approach helps introverts showcase their talents and create opportunities without feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of self-promotion.</p>
