          <p>While visiting Scotland, President Donald Trump addressed questions regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. He dismissed the ongoing controversy as "not a big thing" and denied being briefed on his name appearing in related files. When asked about the possibility of granting clemency to Maxwell, who is currently being interviewed by the Justice Department, Trump stated it was not the appropriate time to discuss pardons. The president's comments come as he prepares for high-level meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, mixing official duties with events at his golf resorts.</p>

          <p>A grenade is missing following a deadly explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility that killed three deputies. Officials confirmed that one of two grenades, initially believed to be inert and recovered from a Santa Monica garage, detonated at the facility. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is now leading an extensive search for the second, unaccounted-for explosive. In response to the tragedy, the department has updated its protocols, vowing to treat all recovered explosive devices as live. The incident marks the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, prompting a comprehensive investigation.</p>

          <h2>Family Files Lawsuit Against Funeral Homes for Mishandling Son's Remains</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:21:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A family is suing two funeral homes after allegedly receiving their deceased son's brain in an unmarked, leaking box that they discovered in their car. The lawsuit claims the funeral homes in Georgia and Pennsylvania were negligent and inflicted severe emotional distress by improperly handling the remains. The parents describe the horrific experience of the box leaking fluid, which they were later told was their son's brain, onto the father's hands. The family is seeking compensation and answers, while their attorney states the incident represents a profound failure in industry standards for handling biohazardous material, leaving the family questioning if their son is truly at rest.</p>

          <p>Tesla's plan to expand its vehicle service to the San Francisco Bay Area for employees' friends and family is facing regulatory clarification from California officials. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that while Tesla holds a permit for a private car service, it does not authorize the company to operate autonomous robotaxis for the public. Any service offered must include a human driver in control at all times, as Tesla is not permitted to transport passengers in autonomous vehicles, with or without a safety driver. This development highlights the ongoing regulatory hurdles for autonomous vehicle deployment, even as Tesla tests a supervised robotaxi service in Austin, Texas.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly condemned Major League Soccer's decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi and teammate Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because both players, who were selected for the MLS All-Star game, chose not to participate, citing rest and injury concerns. Mas described the league's policy, which mandates a one-game suspension for unexcused All-Star absences, as a "draconian" punishment that the players do not understand. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision and stated the league will re-evaluate the long-standing rule in consultation with the players.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former U.S. Representative George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin his 87-month prison sentence. Santos pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges, including wire fraud and identity theft, for fabricating his background to defraud donors and enriching himself with campaign funds. Prosecutors detailed how he used the money for luxury goods, Botox, and lavish accommodations. After his sentencing, Santos appealed to President Trump for a future pardon, claiming his sentence was politically motivated. His expulsion from Congress was a historic event, marking him as only the sixth House member ever to be removed by his peers.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced a significant increase in certain insect populations, such as ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a key food source, and prompted early sightings of numerous butterfly species, a positive sign after record lows last year. However, experts express concern that the lack of rainfall could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year. The dry weather may prevent eggs from being laid and cause vital wetland habitats to dry up, posing a long-term threat despite the current abundance.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The lawsuit argued that the city's ordinance, which limits cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, illegally obstructs federal immigration enforcement. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion to dismiss the case. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson praised the decision, stating that the city is safer when its police force can focus on local needs rather than being compelled to participate in what he termed the administration's "reckless and inhumane immigration agenda."</p>

The piece recounts anecdotes from former staff and journalists who describe his focused, and sometimes impatient, style of play on his courses. While his golf properties are prestigious assets, they are not always profitable, underscoring that for Trump, the game is about influence and access as much as it is about sport.</p>

          <p>Former MasterChef host Gregg Wallace has issued an apology to anyone he offended with his on-set behavior but has strongly denied more severe accusations. In his first interview since being fired, Wallace stated, "I'm not a groper, a sex pest or a flasher," addressing claims that arose from a BBC News investigation. An independent inquiry upheld 45 allegations against him, including unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate language. Wallace attributed some of his comments to his background and a recent autism diagnosis, while also defending his sacked co-host, John Torode, insisting he is not a racist.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC Verify investigation into the food aid boxes distributed in Gaza by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised serious concerns about their nutritional value. While the boxes contain sufficient calories for survival, consisting mainly of dried goods like pasta and lentils, experts say they lack essential vitamins and minerals. An analysis by nutrition and development professors found the diet to be deficient in iron, calcium, and multiple vitamins, which could lead to diseases like anemia and scurvy over time. The aid also fails to address the specific nutritional needs of young children, and the reliance on dried goods presents challenges given the severe water and fuel shortages in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' first aired, some psychologists and social experts are arguing that reality television may have positive effects on viewers. The genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, offering a window into different social landscapes and fostering greater understanding. By showcasing raw emotions and difficult conversations about topics like mental health, gaslighting, and disability, these shows can make viewers feel less isolated and spark important national discussions. While the welfare of participants remains a serious concern, experts suggest that even constructed reality can prompt valuable self-reflection and conversations about societal values.</p>

The meeting follows President Trump's push for Texas to redraw its congressional maps to favor the GOP, a move Democrats argue will illegally dilute the power of minority voters. In response, Newsom is exploring options to counter-gerrymander California's districts to favor Democrats, a departure from the state's independent redistricting process. The Texas legislators pledged to use every available tool to fight the redistricting, which they see as a threat to democracy.</p>

This surge in demand is colliding with smaller harvests caused by heatwaves and a shortage of tea farmers in Japan.

Konyndyk argues that Israel's blockade and reliance on the ineffective Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which provides poor-quality aid and forces people into dangerous situations to access it, are primary drivers of the crisis.
