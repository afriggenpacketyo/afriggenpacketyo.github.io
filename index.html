          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, following a lawsuit filed by the university. The lawsuit was initiated after the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students under the F-1 visa program, a move that affected over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium. Harvard argued that the ban was a blatant violation of the First Amendment and a retaliatory measure for the university's rejection of government demands to control its governance and curriculum. The judge's decision provides a temporary reprieve for international students at Harvard.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if the company does not manufacture its iPhones in the United States. This threat came after Apple CEO Tim Cook visited the White House for meetings, during which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the importance of bringing precision manufacturing, particularly semiconductors, back to the U.S. Bessent expressed concerns about external production vulnerabilities, especially in semiconductors, and hopes that Apple will help secure the semiconductor supply chain. The Trump administration is trying to incentivize companies to manufacture in the U.S. through tariffs and other measures.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are using two planes for their road trips this season, one for players and another for coaches, staff, and other personnel, in an effort to improve team chemistry and player recovery. This initiative, driven by the players themselves, aims to create a more comfortable and restful environment for players, allowing them to arrive at road cities earlier and have a full day off before games. The two-plane system also provides a fail-safe contingency plan in case of mechanical problems, ensuring that players and critical staff can travel as scheduled.

          <p>Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues that the intense criticism and punitive actions directed at Harvard University, including funding cuts and restrictions on international students, constitute a form of "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." Pinker acknowledges that Harvard has serious issues, including a lack of viewpoint diversity and instances of compromised academic freedom. However, he contends that the university is not the "woke madrasa" or "Islamist outpost" that its critics claim, and that the appropriate response is to diagnose and remedy specific flaws, not to cripple the institution entirely. He argues that the nation needs a sense of proportionality in dealing with its educational and cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Apple if the company does not shift iPhone manufacturing to the United States, disapproving of Apple's decision to move part of its supply chain to India. Analysts say that relocating Apple's supply chain to the U.S. is highly unlikely due to the time, expense, and higher labor costs involved. While final assembly in the U.S. is theoretically possible, it would take years and result in higher prices for consumers. Trump has previously exempted phones, computers, and chips from tariffs on China-made goods, providing major cost savings for Apple.</p>

The study, published in The Lancet, also showed that contrast-enhanced mammography can find tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography, although MRI scans are still better at detecting more tumors overall. While contrast-enhanced mammography is not yet widely used for screening in the United States, experts suggest it could become a standard of care for women with dense breasts and high cancer risk.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union and a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in America, causing market uncertainty. Trump's actions are seen as an escalation of his trade war, aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing and protecting jobs. The EU has not commented on the latest threat, which came just ahead of trade talks between the two sides. Shares in the U.S. and EU fell following the announcement, with Apple shares opening more than 2% lower.</p>

          <p>Stock markets dropped on Friday after President Trump threatened the European Union and Apple with steep tariffs. The S&P 500 fell about 1 percent in early trading in New York, and Apple's stock fell nearly 3 percent. Trump announced on social media that trade negotiations with the European Union were "going nowhere" and called for a 50 percent tariff on all goods imported from the bloc starting June 1. He also said that he wanted iPhones sold in the United States to also be made in the country, threatening a 25% tariff if they are not.</p>

          <p>Experts say that credit card interest rates are unlikely to fall soon, and could remain elevated well into 2026. While the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark rate could help with lowering credit card rates, numerous other elements come into play with setting card rates. Even if the federal funds rate comes down later this year or in 2026, it won't automatically bring credit card APRs down. Card issuers will want to see real improvements in delinquency rates and other metrics before lowering APYs on their credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

The preliminary injunction prevents agencies from implementing reductions-in-force, placing employees on administrative leave, and proceeding with job cuts. The judge ruled that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch — but only after obtaining approval from Congress.</p>
