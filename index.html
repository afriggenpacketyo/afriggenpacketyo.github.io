          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89 due to pneumonia. Known as "Mr. Giants," Nagashima was a key player and manager for the Yomiuri Giants, contributing significantly to the team's dominance in the 1960s and 1970s. His charismatic personality and on-field heroics made him a national icon, fondly remembered by many Japanese as a symbol of the country's economic boom era. His retirement was a major national news event, and his famous speech at his retirement ceremony has become ingrained in Japanese culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following technical and logistical issues during the February California bar exam, a committee approved new scoring adjustments, leading to more than 200 test-takers changing from "fail" to "pass." The grading change raised the exam's overall pass rate from 56% to 63%, nearly doubling the state's historical average. Applicants who nearly passed and received a second read on their written questions will be given the higher of two scores for each question. The state bar has already implemented a lower raw passing score and "imputed" scores for test takers who failed to complete significant portions of the two-day exam.</p>

          <p>An independent review has revealed that the water sector in England and Wales is underperforming and requires stricter regulation to better protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted that public trust has been compromised due to issues such as pollution, financial instability, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. The review was initiated by the government in response to growing public concerns regarding sewage spills and increasing bills. Despite these concerns, the government has ruled out nationalizing the sector, deeming it too expensive and not necessarily leading to improvements.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is increasing its defense spending and modernizing its military capabilities in response to perceived threats from Russia and concerns about the future of NATO. The plans include building new nuclear-powered attack submarines, increasing weapons stockpiles, and investing in cyber defense. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the need to confront growing threats on land, air, sea, and in cyberspace, aiming to make the British Army more lethal. This strategic shift also serves as a message to Washington that Europe is committed to investing in its own security.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda stated that the central bank will not aggressively pursue policy rate hikes unless economic and price conditions improve, citing significant uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs. Ueda reiterated the BOJ's policy of raising rates if the economy and prices align with expectations but emphasized caution due to potential impacts from trade frictions triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. The BOJ has raised its key interest rate three times since March last year as part of efforts to normalize monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Richardson, the acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), reportedly stated during a meeting that he was unaware that hurricane season had started. Sources familiar with the meeting indicated that Richardson planned to adhere to the existing plan and not interfere with the FEMA advisory council established by President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson has stated that the comment was a joke and that FEMA remains focused on disaster response. The hurricane season begins on June 1 and continues through November 30.</p>
