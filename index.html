          <p>The US embassy in Iraq has issued a warning about potential terrorist attacks targeting US businesses and locations frequented by US citizens, urging them to avoid large gatherings and reconsider travel to Iraq altogether. This alert comes amid heightened tensions in the region, particularly between Iran and Israel, and reflects concerns about the safety and security of Americans in Iraq. The US embassy in Israel has also announced its closure for a day, citing the ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza, and is unable to assist with evacuations. With no consular relations with Iran, the US is advising its citizens to depart the country immediately, and Switzerland has temporarily closed its embassy there. The situation underscores the complex and volatile security environment in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel, resulting in at least five deaths and numerous injuries, marking an escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two nations. One missile landed near the American consulate in Tel Aviv, causing minor damage, while Israel responded by striking command centers in Tehran. The fighting has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the US and Iran, and the US State Department has issued a directive to embassies to reiterate that the US was not involved in Israel's actions. The attacks have intensified concerns about regional stability and the potential for further escalation, prompting international calls for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of this century due to global warming, impacting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. As warmer weather breaks up upstream ice, it drifts downstream and can refreeze in colder areas, forming destructive ice jams. These jams can cause flooding and damage to downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. Researchers analyzed 160 years of ice jam flood dynamics to reach their conclusions, highlighting the shift in geographic distribution of hotspots downstream.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has emphasized the necessity of pushing through reforms to cut the benefits bill, despite potential opposition within the Labour Party. MPs will soon vote on measures aiming to reduce the benefits bill by Â£5 billion by 2030, including proposals to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) for disabled individuals. Starmer asserted that the current system is not effective for those needing support or for taxpayers, and reform is essential. The government aims to address systemic issues and improve the efficiency of welfare programs.</p>

          <p>The owners of a formerly Michelin-starred restaurant in western Japan have been arrested for ignoring an order to temporarily shut down the establishment following a series of food poisoning incidents. Hirokazu Kitano, along with his son Hirotoshi Kitano, and his wife Noriko, were involved in the operation of Kiichi, a traditional Japanese restaurant in Kawachinagano, Osaka Prefecture. The restaurant received a suspension order after 33 customers experienced vomiting and diarrhea, with norovirus detected in some individuals. Investigations revealed the business continued to sell bento boxes during the suspension.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered an expansion of the detention and deportation of migrants across the country amid ongoing protests against his immigration policies. Trump called on federal agencies to "do all in their power" to deliver "the single largest mass deportation program in history," targeting cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. He also directed immigration authorities to focus on sanctuary cities and prevent anyone who undermines the domestic tranquility of the United States from entering the country. This order signals a continuation of Trump's campaign promise to increase deportations, despite growing protests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be transported to England daily following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a shortage of incinerators to handle the extra demand, necessitating the export of waste as a short-term solution. While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites, the transportation of waste will lead to a short-term increase in emissions from heavy vehicles. The long-term strategy involves reducing household waste and increasing recycling rates, although progress in domestic recycling has been slow.</p>
