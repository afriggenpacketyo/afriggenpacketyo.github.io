        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a traditional coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As he is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his new status brings renewed focus to the country's male-only succession laws. With only one other male heir younger than the current emperor, the event has reignited discussions about whether the rules should be changed to allow female succession, a move supported by much of the public but opposed by conservatives. The shrinking number of heirs reflects Japan's broader demographic challenges.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial occurs under a shadow of political tension, as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has criticized the institution for promoting "globalist uniformity," echoing historical denunciations by the Nazi party. Despite these attacks, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its program, which focuses on the evolution of modern materials and sustainable design. The situation highlights the ongoing culture wars in Germany and fears among cultural institutions about the potential impact of rising far-right influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C., to address crime has created a significant political conflict. Congressional Democrats have criticized the move as an overreach and embarrassing on the world stage, especially since it was not requested by the city's mayor. Conversely, some Republicans argue the presence of troops has made the city safer and question why Democrats oppose the security measures. The deployment is being challenged in court by D.C.'s Attorney General, who argues it violates laws preventing military involvement in domestic policing.</p>

          <p>A writer recounts their journey of becoming a Buffalo Bills fan, despite having no prior interest in sports, after being introduced to the team by their partner's family. The article explores how the team embodies the spirit of Buffalo, a city with a history of resilience and a reputation for being an underdog. The author reflects on the powerful sense of community and shared identity that comes from supporting a team, particularly one known for its passionate and loyal fanbase. This experience illustrates how sports allegiance can be a way of finding a sense of home and connection, even from afar.</p>

          <h2>China's Crackdown on Intense Price Competition May Lack Force of Previous Reforms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 04:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to analysis from Oxford Economics, China's recent efforts to combat "involution"—a term for destructive, low-quality price competition—are unlikely to mirror the large-scale supply-side reforms of 2015. While President Xi Jinping has criticized this cutthroat competition, experts believe the current economic environment lacks the conditions for significant production cuts or major consumption stimulus. Investors who anticipated a major policy shift similar to past campaigns may be disappointed, as the path to resolving China's supply-demand imbalances appears more complex and less direct this time.

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new long-term compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The plan, which requires shareholder approval, would grant Musk up to 12% of Tesla's stock over a decade if he achieves extremely aggressive growth targets, including increasing the company's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion. The proposal is designed to retain Musk and incentivize him to lead Tesla's expansion into AI and robotics. However, the plan has raised concerns among some analysts about corporate governance and the precedent it sets for executive compensation.</p>

This shift forces India to re-evaluate its westward tilt and reconsider the principles of strategic autonomy or non-alignment.

          <p>World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has advanced to the US Open final after defeating Félix Auger-Aliassime in a four-set semifinal match. After a dominant first set, Sinner appeared to be hampered by a stomach issue in the second, which Auger-Aliassime capitalized on to level the match. However, the defending champion recovered his composure and form, ultimately securing the victory and booking his place in a third consecutive Grand Slam final against his rival, Carlos Alcaraz. The win continues Sinner's remarkable season, in which he has now reached the final of all four major tournaments.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech describing President Donald Trump as a maverick "risk taker" whose political instincts identified widespread anxieties in Western societies. In the speech, Mandelson will draw parallels between the mandates for national renewal that brought both Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to power. The address is seen as a strategic effort to bolster the UK-US special relationship under the unconventional Trump presidency. The article also notes that Mandelson, a key architect of New Labour and a former Remainer, will frame Brexit as an opportunity for closer US ties.</p>

          <p>Yi Huiman, who served as the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) from 2019 to early 2024, is now under investigation for "severe breaches of discipline." The probe was announced by the Communist Party's top anti-graft agency, which is a common indicator of a corruption investigation. Yi is the second head of China's stock market watchdog to be investigated for graft in the past decade. The investigation signals a continuation of the country's extensive anti-corruption campaign, which has increasingly targeted the financial sector, including banking and capital markets.

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 140 mph, is currently moving across the Pacific Ocean on a path toward Hawaii. While no coastal warnings are in effect yet, forecasters anticipate that swells from the storm could generate life-threatening surf and rip currents for the islands by the end of the weekend. The state has declared a state of emergency in preparation for potential impacts, which could include heavy rainfall and high winds beginning early next week. The storm is expected to strengthen slightly before a gradual weakening trend begins on Sunday.</p>

          <p>A media report suggesting that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to announce a possible link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use in pregnancy and autism has drawn responses from health officials and medical experts. The Department of Health and Human Services has labeled the report as "speculation" pending the release of its official findings. Medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintain there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship, emphasizing that the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders are complex. The discussion highlights the ongoing scientific debate and the difficulty in isolating singular causes for conditions like autism.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping recently hosted leaders from the world's other four ruling communist parties, highlighting the continued importance of party-to-party diplomacy in China's foreign policy. This channel, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, operates alongside traditional state-level relations and is a key tool for engagement, particularly with ideologically similar nations. While not aimed at creating a global communist movement like the Soviet Union, this diplomatic strategy has become an increasingly active part of Beijing's outreach. The International Department has connections with over 600 political parties worldwide and plays a central role in these high-level interactions.</p>
