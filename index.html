            <p>Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have revised the death toll from a recent boat fire, stating that 33 people died, significantly lower than earlier reports of 148. The incident occurred on the Congo River near Mbandaka, where a wooden boat carrying approximately 400 people caught fire, allegedly due to cooking activities onboard. Poor infrastructure leads many Congolese to travel by boat, but overcrowding and lack of safety measures often lead to accidents. The mayor of Mbandaka attributed the initial discrepancies to confusion following the event.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the deaths of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding." The inquiry also found that the killing of a UN worker shortly after was "a breach of orders during a combat setting." The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The incident involved a convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulances, a UN car, and a fire truck that came under fire near Rafah on March 23.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, ensuring detainees have a chance to argue their case in court. The ACLU raised concerns that the Trump administration was attempting to swiftly deport individuals allegedly linked to the Tren de Aragua gang, potentially sending them to dangerous prisons in El Salvador. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted prematurely.</p>

            <p>Former Trump White House border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleging he is an MS-13 member and a threat to public safety. Homan claimed the administration does not have the authority to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. for a trial, despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return. He also criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family deny his MS-13 affiliation, and his wife asserts he has never been convicted of a crime.</p>

            <p>British RAF Typhoon jets intercepted two Russian aircraft flying close to NATO airspace near Poland in separate incidents. The interceptions, which took off from Malbork Air Base in Poland, were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing. The UK's involvement in NATO's enhanced air policing is called Operation Chessman and sees personnel from across the RAF deployed to Malbork alongside Sweden, Nato's newest member. This follows Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP.</p>

            <p>The author recounts a humorous anecdote about telling a lie on a first date 30 years ago, claiming to drive a Land Rover when she did not. She reflects on the commonality of lies in dating, ranging from harmless "butler lies" to more egregious deceptions. She questions whether all dating lies are inherently awful, suggesting that some may stem from insecurity or a desire to present a better version of oneself. Ultimately, the author's date discovered the truth years later but was unfazed, leading to a long and successful relationship.</p>

This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar.
