          <p>The Liberal Democrats are proposing a £10,000 bonus for new army recruits after completing training and serving for two years, aiming to boost troop numbers amidst concerns over global instability. Former armed services personnel would receive £20,000 for returning to serve two additional years. The party argues this scheme would increase the number of trained UK regular soldiers to 73,000, funded by an increase in the Digital Services Tax. Sir Ed Davey emphasized the need for Britain to be "war-ready" given threats from Russia and challenges posed by the United States, also suggesting public awareness campaigns to prepare households for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The starting salary for new recruits is £26,334 a year.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated that Kneecap's scheduled performance at Glastonbury Festival is "not appropriate" after a band member, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, was charged with a terror offence.

Kneecap responded by accusing the prime minister of arming a genocide, referring to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. A BBC spokesperson stated that while the BBC does not ban artists, its programming would adhere to editorial guidelines.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran war has entered its second week with ongoing strikes, including one targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility in Isfahan. Iran's foreign minister warned against U.S. intervention, deeming it "very dangerous." Israel's defense minister claimed the military killed three senior Iranian commanders, including one who allegedly financed Hamas. The U.S. State Department confirmed that several U.S. citizens sustained minor injuries from an Iranian missile strike, and the U.S. has begun assisting with evacuations of Americans and green card holders from Tel Aviv to Athens. President Trump is considering military intervention, with a decision expected within two weeks.</p>

          <p>Galal Yafai's world title aspirations were dealt a significant blow as he suffered a shocking points loss to Francisco Rodriguez Jr. in Birmingham. The British flyweight, an Olympic gold medalist, was knocked down in the final round of the high-tempo contest. Rodriguez's relentless pressure and punch volume proved too much for Yafai, resulting in scores of 119-108, 119-108, and 118-109 in favor of the Mexican fighter. This defeat marks Yafai's first loss in 10 professional bouts and costs him his WBC interim title.</p>

          <p>The presence of a senior Taiwanese officer at a U.S. military exercise in Alaska has garnered attention, suggesting closer defense cooperation between Taiwan and the United States. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force’s flight training division, observed the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise, which involved personnel and aircraft from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. Analysts believe this move indicates the U.S. will maintain its security commitments despite President Trump’s transactional approach to regional allies.</p>
