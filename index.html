          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:19:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of over $118,000, driven by significant inflows into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs saw their largest daily inflow of the year at $1.18 billion, fueling a rally that also saw Ether climb back above the $3,000 mark. The upward trend, which began after the Federal Reserve's latest meeting minutes, was intensified by a wave of short liquidations totaling over $650 million. Analysts suggest that expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and upcoming crypto-friendly legislation are contributing to the positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:14:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crystal Palace has been disqualified from the Europa League, with Nottingham Forest taking their place due to UEFA's multi-club ownership regulations. The issue stems from John Textor's ownership stake in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, which also qualified for the tournament. Because Lyon finished higher in their respective league, they were given precedence. Crystal Palace's failure to meet a March deadline to restructure their ownership was a critical factor in the decision. The club is now relegated to the less prestigious Conference League and is expected to appeal the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium cabin offerings, similar to how it unbundled its main cabin with basic economy fares. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, stated that the goal is to provide more choices for customers with different needs, as premium seat revenue continues to grow. While specific changes were not detailed, possibilities could include cheaper business-class tickets without lounge access or more luxurious suites with additional amenities. This move reflects an industry trend where airlines are focusing on maximizing revenue from front-of-plane seating, where demand has remained strong compared to economy.</p>

          <p>Sources report that FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino has expressed significant frustration over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, leading to a clash with Attorney General Pam Bondi. This internal friction comes after the Department of Justice and FBI released a joint review concluding there was no client list and that Epstein's death was a suicide. The report, along with a surveillance video with a missing minute, has fueled public outrage and conspiracy theories. The White House has dismissed the reports of division, stating President Trump is proud of the Attorney General's work.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned the plea agreements for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other men accused of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks, prolonging the decades-long legal case. The 2-to-1 ruling found that former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had the authority to cancel the deals, which would have spared the defendants the death penalty in exchange for life sentences. Defense lawyers had argued the deals were legally binding once approved by military court officials. This decision deepens the frustration for some 9/11 families hoping for a resolution, while others who support a death-penalty trial view it as a victory for justice.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited Central Texas to tour the areas devastated by recent flash floods, which have killed over 120 people. Accompanied by Texas officials, Trump met with first responders and families, praising Governor Greg Abbott's handling of the crisis. This response contrasts with his past criticism of other governors during natural disasters. The visit occurs amid scrutiny of the local and federal response, including questions about the adequacy of warnings and the future of FEMA. The White House has defended its actions, attributing the disaster to a "hundred-year catastrophe" while pushing back on criticism of its policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a surprising budget surplus of $27 billion in June, largely due to a significant surge in customs duties from tariffs. This monthly surplus contrasts with the fiscal year's overall deficit, which stands at $1.34 trillion. Tariff collections for the month were $27 billion, a 301% increase from the previous year, following President Trump's implementation of widespread import tariffs. Despite the monthly surplus, the government's finances remain challenged by high interest payments on the national debt, which totaled $84 billion in June alone and are projected to reach $1.2 trillion for the full fiscal year.

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's request to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that TikTok intentionally uses addictive and manipulative design features to exploit young users and keep them engaged on the app for longer periods. The state's attorney general argues these practices put children at risk. The judge ruled that the state's claims were valid and focused on the app's allegedly dangerous features rather than its user-generated content. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions by states targeting the design and safety policies of major tech platforms.</p>

Despite being cleared of personal wrongdoing, the incident cast a shadow over his leadership. He stepped down in 2008 after losing the support of then-Mayor Boris Johnson.

This article outlines several financial strategies for homeowners and those with savings. Options include reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 or older to receive monthly payments from their home equity. Another possibility is purchasing an annuity, which provides guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum payment. While less ideal due to interest costs, personal loans are also presented as a way to create an emergency fund to bridge any financial gaps. (not investment advice)</p>

He is accused of running a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as "Los Chapitos," which allegedly oversaw a massive fentanyl trafficking operation into the U.S. and used extreme violence. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez must provide "substantial assistance" to the U.S. government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. He was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the current season of the reality show 'Love Island USA' serves as a portrait of Gen Z's dating habits, characterized by emotional guardedness and a lack of deep romantic connections. Despite high viewership, the season has been criticized for featuring more "situationships" than genuine romance. The author suggests this reflects a generation that grew up online, has less real-world relationship experience, and is anxious about vulnerability. Contestants who do show strong emotions have become fan favorites, possibly because viewers relate to the struggle of putting oneself out there in a culture that often values being chill.</p>

          <p>Christina Block, heiress to Germany's Block House steakhouse chain, is on trial in Hamburg, accused of orchestrating the violent kidnapping of her two youngest children from their father in Denmark. The indictment alleges that on New Year's Eve 2023, hired men ambushed her ex-husband, Stephan Hensel, and forcibly took the children to Germany. The incident is the culmination of a bitter, long-running custody battle. Block's defense claims she was a desperate mother whose children were wrongfully kept in Denmark, while Hensel argues he was protecting them. If convicted, Block faces up to 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% import tariff on Brazilian goods has sparked outrage in the South American nation. Trump linked the proposed tariffs to what he called the unfair "witch hunt" trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a political ally. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva condemned the move as an unacceptable interference in his country's sovereign judicial process and stated that any unilateral tariff increase would be met with a reciprocal response. The situation has created a diplomatic rift, with Trump using trade policy to influence the domestic legal affairs of another country.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tax legislation, known as the "big beautiful bill," temporarily increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 but includes a phaseout that could create a tax surprise for high earners. The benefit begins to decrease for those with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $500,000 and is completely eliminated at $600,000. Tax experts warn this creates a "SALT torpedo," where the effective federal tax rate on income within that $100,000 window could jump as high as 45.5% due to the simultaneous loss of the deduction.

          <p>This article explores the origins of the popular 10,000-steps-a-day fitness goal, revealing it began as a marketing campaign for a Japanese pedometer in the 1960s, not as a scientifically derived health metric. While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research suggests it is a reasonable benchmark for physical activity. Studies show health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts like 2,500 per day, with benefits often plateauing around 7,500 steps. Experts emphasize that while 10,000 steps is a good target, the most important thing is to increase daily movement, as any activity is better than none.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its most severe measles outbreak since 1992, with over 1,290 confirmed cases reported in 2025, largely driven by an outbreak in Texas. Health experts are concerned that the summer travel season will further accelerate the spread of the highly contagious disease. The rise in cases is linked to declining vaccination rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted routine immunizations and amplified anti-vaccine sentiment. Officials stress that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the most effective protection and urge the public to ensure their immunizations are up to date.</p>

Conversely, Carolina A. Miranda's review of Greg Grandin's "America, América" suggests the U.S. can learn from Latin American democracies, which pioneered concepts like birthright citizenship. Together, the essays argue that the U.S. is not immune to global patterns of authoritarianism or democratic innovation.</p>

A recent CDC analysis suggests the virus has settled into a biannual surge pattern, peaking in late summer and again in winter.

The repeal, a major win for the state's business lobby, reverses a ballot measure passed just eight months ago. The original law allowed workers to accrue one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked. Worker advocacy groups, who spent years campaigning for the measure, called the repeal a betrayal of Missouri families.

The initiative aims to reduce the number of people signed off as "not fit for work" and is part of a broader government effort to decrease the 2.8 million people currently out of the workforce due to health conditions.
