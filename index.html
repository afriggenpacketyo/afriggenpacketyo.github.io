            <p>Luxury car thefts are dramatically increasing in the U.S., with stolen vehicles often shipped overseas by teenage bandits and international crime rings seeking higher profits and reduced risk of prosecution. Washington, D.C., experienced the highest vehicle theft rate in 2023, prompting undercover police operations targeting repeat offenders involved in organized carjacking schemes. Soft-on-crime policies in major cities exacerbate the problem, providing a green light for thieves to operate with impunity, while the use of RFID cloning disks and tracking devices further facilitates these crimes. Interpol is increasing efforts to combat the sale of stolen cars traveling from America and Europe by increasing the efficacy of entry checks.</p>

            <p>Tom Thibodeau, the Knicks' coach, faces persistent criticism for allegedly overworking his starters, a narrative fueled by high minutes played and comments from players like Mikal Bridges. However, in-depth data analysis of NBA injury records reveals no clear link between Thibodeau's coaching style and increased injury risk among his players. While injuries are rising across the NBA due to factors like increased early specialization and reduced practice time, there's no conclusive evidence that Thibodeau's approach directly contributes to a higher likelihood of injuries. The debate continues, however, around whether all teams should embrace depth more proactively, given the rising injury rates, especially among starters.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's immigration chief is retiring early following criticism of stricter rules for spouses from mainland China. The National Immigration Agency (NIA) faced backlash for enforcing a policy requiring mainland-born spouses to provide documentation of abandoning their mainland nationality. Failure to comply could result in revocation of their Taiwan residence permits and household registration, forcing them to return to the mainland. This policy, based on a 2004 revision to immigration law, has been criticized for potentially disrupting thousands of families.</p>

            <p>Shares of Maersk, a major shipping company and indicator of global trade trends, experienced a significant increase after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs for most countries.

            <p>The Labour Party is planning to deploy dedicated police teams to patrol town centers during peak hours in England and Wales, aiming to address the policing "postcode lottery." The initiative includes assigning named local officers to each neighborhood and increasing police ranks by 13,000 by 2029. Labour argues this will combat shoplifting and anti-social behavior, putting prevention at the forefront of policing. However, the plan faces financial challenges, with police forces grappling with budget constraints and potential cuts to existing officers, though Labour defends its overall investment in policing.</p>

            <p>President Trump's social media post urging people to "BUY!!! DJT" preceded his announcement of a 90-day tariff pause, leading to significant market gains. The S&P 500 gained back approximately $4 trillion, and Trump Media's stock soared by 22.67%, raising questions about potential insider trading. While the White House defended Trump's post as reassuring markets, ethics experts suggest it could be seen as market manipulation. The ambiguity of whether Trump meant buying stocks in general or Trump Media specifically fueled speculation and investment in the latter.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices declined for a second consecutive month, while producer price deflation deepened, signaling rising deflationary pressures amidst an escalating trade war with the U.S. Consumer price index slid 0.1% year on year in March, while producer prices fell 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Despite these pressures, core inflation rose 0.5%, indicating some signs of recovery. Experts anticipate further stimulus measures from Beijing aimed at boosting domestic consumption to offset the impact of rising tariffs.</p>

            <p>Despite the potential for economic hardship, many Chinese citizens are voicing support for Beijing's decision to retaliate against increased tariffs from the U.S. Unlike the previous trade war, there is a widespread sense of defiance and frustration, with many believing China is being unfairly targeted. Beijing has responded with 84% tariffs on all US products, vowing to fight "to the end" while emphasizing the need for equal and respectful dialogue. Chinese surveyed express frustration and concern, but also a determination to withstand the challenges.</p>

            <p>A New York jury awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years. The lawsuit was filed after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago. The verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals "who don't treat women appropriately."</p>

            <p>Molly Harbron, a 26-year-old woman from Batley, West Yorkshire, has been awarded a multimillion-pound compensation deal after losing her leg due to hospital failings. Medics at Dewsbury Hospital failed to properly assess her case, leading to a delayed surgery that resulted in the amputation of her left leg in April 2020. The Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust admitted to the mistakes and acknowledged that earlier surgery could have saved her leg. The compensation has enabled her to move to a bungalow and obtain a prosthetic leg.</p>

Aluko, who won the first stage of a High Court libel claim against Barton, emphasized the importance of language and treating women with respect. The case stems from comments made by Barton that targeted Aluko's race, gender, and family.</p>
