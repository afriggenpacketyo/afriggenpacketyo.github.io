        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has cautioned Mexico against its plan to raise tariffs on cars imported from Asia, threatening to implement countermeasures if the proposal proceeds. The warning comes after Mexico's Secretary of Economy announced intentions to increase the duties from 20% to 50%, a move that requires congressional approval. China emphasized its role as a significant trade partner and expressed reluctance to see economic cooperation affected by the tariff hike. This development occurs amid ongoing trade tensions and significant investment by Chinese auto manufacturers in Mexico, aiming to leverage the USMCA trade agreement for access to the North American market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has intensified discussions about safety and freedom of expression on college campuses. Security experts note the constant challenge of balancing open access with the need to protect controversial speakers, recalling how past violent events have led to significant security overhauls. Free speech advocates worry about a potential "assassin's veto," where violence is used to silence debate, pointing to survey data showing a small but growing acceptance of violence among students to stop certain speech. While some campus police chiefs anticipate heightened diligence, they do not foresee an end to large outdoor events featuring political figures.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The court ruled that Bolsonaro orchestrated a plot to retain power following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The verdict also bars him from running for public office until 2033. The trial has drawn international attention, with figures like Donald Trump criticizing the prosecution as a "witch hunt," while Brazil's foreign ministry has pushed back against such characterizations. Bolsonaro's lawyers plan to appeal the sentence, which they have described as "absurdly excessive."</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, serves as a crucial remedy for the deficiencies in the current global order. The author argues that the post-World War II multilateral system, symbolized by the United Nations, is weakening due to unilateral actions, trade disputes, and the marginalization of the Global South. The SCO is presented as a platform that embodies principles of cooperation and allows countries with diverse cultures and political systems to work together. The organization is framed as a necessary alternative in a world where some nations undermine global institutions while others fail to enact meaningful reforms.</p>

Kirk's wife, Erika Frantzve, was present for the tribute and was seen deplaning with second lady Usha Vance upon arrival in Phoenix. The event marks the beginning of official honors for Kirk, who was assassinated during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. President Donald Trump has announced he will attend the funeral, as federal authorities continue their search for the suspect, offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at a Florida golf course, commenced with an unusual opening statement from the defendant, who is representing himself. Routh's philosophical remarks were cut short by the judge for not adhering to court procedure. Prosecutors argued that Routh's plot was "carefully crafted and deadly serious," aiming to take the choice of the election away from the American people. The first day of testimony included a Secret Service agent who described discovering Routh with an AK-style weapon and a civilian witness who followed the suspect's vehicle after hearing gunshots, providing crucial information to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The father of Vadim Kruglov, a 37-year-old Russian man killed at the Burning Man festival, has publicly appealed to President Trump to assign the FBI to the investigation. Kruglov was found dead from what friends describe as a "professional knife strike to the neck" on August 30 amidst a crowd of over 80,000 attendees. The Pershing County Sheriff's Department is currently leading the homicide investigation but has released few details. In a video published by a pro-Kremlin tabloid, the victim's father expressed frustration with the pace of the local inquiry, stating that "evil must be punished" and urging federal involvement to solve his son's murder.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on his supporters to respond peacefully to the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, as the manhunt for the shooter continues. A day after a more inflammatory address blaming the "radical left," the president shifted his tone, stating that Kirk was an "advocate of nonviolence" and that he would like to see people respond in kind. The statement came as authorities reported making "big progress" in the investigation, though the gunman who fatally shot the 31-year-old Turning Point USA founder at a Utah university event remains at large. The killing has sent shockwaves through the American political landscape, heightening concerns about political violence.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in England are raising concerns that an increasing number of children are starting reception class without fundamental skills, such as being toilet-trained or able to speak in full sentences. A recent survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers revealed that nine in ten have observed a decline in speech and language abilities among new students over the past two years. Experts suggest that social isolation and increased screen time may be contributing factors, limiting children's exposure to meaningful conversation. This trend presents a significant challenge for educators, who must dedicate more time to basic development, and for the government, which aims for 75% of children to reach a good level of development by 2028.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fussy eating is a normal developmental phase for more than half of all children, and parents should not blame themselves for it, according to child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed. To make mealtimes less stressful, she recommends allowing children autonomy by letting them choose whether to eat, which can paradoxically encourage them to try more foods. Other tips include avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad," focusing on making the dinner table an enjoyable place, and being mindful of natural fluctuations in a child's appetite. Involving children in food preparation and consistently exposing them to a variety of foods can also help them become more adventurous eaters over time.</p>

The album is described as a response to a difficult period in his life, aiming to create joy while exploring cultural influences from his international tours, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. While the record incorporates instruments like the sitar and tabla, some critics find that these elements are assimilated into his familiar pop formula rather than pushing new musical boundaries. The album balances upbeat, radio-friendly tracks with personal ballads, representing an effort to satisfy his massive global fanbase while potentially missing an opportunity for greater artistic risk.</p>

This comprehensive strategy elevated Denmark's cancer outcomes from among the lowest in wealthy nations to near the top.

          <p>For the first time, new COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. are not available to the general public, with the FDA restricting eligibility to those 65 or older or with high-risk health conditions.

While officials claim anyone who wants a shot can get one through a doctor's prescription or by "self-attesting" eligibility, many report being turned away by pharmacies.

The decision upholds a lower court's ruling and gives the government two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act. The court noted that the practice of women taking their husband's surname was a "colonial import," as many African cultures traditionally saw women retain their birth names.

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's $12 trillion stock market are testing the ability of regulators to manage a sustainable bull run without repeating the wild boom-and-bust cycles of the past. Beijing aims to establish the equity market as a reliable source of household wealth, which could help shift assets away from the volatile property sector and boost consumer spending. After a period of nonstop gains, a recent pullback may indicate a transition to a more measured "slow bull" market, which could reduce the risk of speculative trading by retail investors. The challenge for regulators is to guide this growth in a way that supports long-term economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern Water has prohibited water tanker companies from extracting water from its standpipes after it was discovered that water was being legally delivered to the estate of American billionaire Stephen Schwarzman to fill a new lake. The deliveries were sourced from an area in Hampshire under a drought order, angering local residents who are subject to a hosepipe ban. While the use of water for construction is not covered by domestic restrictions, the water company's managing director called the situation "appalling" and imposed an immediate ban. A spokesperson for Schwarzman stated that the water was sourced legally and that the lake would primarily be filled by an advanced irrigation system.</p>

          <p>An ongoing manhunt continues for the suspect who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Authorities have revealed that a single shot was fired from the roof of a nearby building, and a high-powered, bolt-action rifle was later recovered in a wooded area. The FBI has released photos of a "person of interest," described as being of college age, who was seen on video fleeing the campus after the shooting. The attack has been widely condemned across the political spectrum as a political assassination, sparking intense debate about rising political violence and its impact on American democracy.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, security measures have been significantly tightened for President Trump and other political figures across the United States, reflecting a heightened state of alert. The location of a presidential speech was changed out of caution, and an increased law enforcement presence is expected at upcoming public events. The shooting has prompted bipartisan concern, with some lawmakers canceling events and others vowing to carry firearms for personal protection. The unease is compounded by anonymous threats made against several universities and a bomb threat at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, highlighting widespread anxiety about political violence.</p>

Struthers had served as the administrative director for the Kennedy Center's jazz programming, which has seen its mainstage schedule significantly reduced. The departure follows that of renowned jazz artistic director Jason Moran in July, raising concerns about the future of jazz and other programming at the beleaguered arts institution.</p>

          <p>In a move to overcome Democratic delays, Senate Republicans have voted to change chamber rules, making it easier to confirm President Trump's executive branch nominees. The new procedure allows for non-cabinet level nominees to be considered in batches rather than through individual votes, significantly speeding up the confirmation process. Majority Leader John Thune argued the change was necessary to restore standard practice and allow the president to assemble his team efficiently. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move not as a solution to obstruction but as another act of "genuflection to the executive branch," diminishing the Senate's oversight role.</p>

The piece calls for honoring Kirk's legacy by recommitting to the principles of free speech and the Judeo-Christian values he championed.

His comments come after Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in a year amid weak demand and high costs.

These worms are predators of essential earthworms and can devastate local populations, impacting soil health and native plant growth. The worms also secrete a toxin that can irritate the skin of humans and pets. Officials are urging the public not to squish or cut the worms, as this can cause them to multiply through regeneration. Instead, they should be captured and killed by freezing them or drowning them in soapy water, and sightings should be reported to citizen science platforms to help track their spread.</p>
