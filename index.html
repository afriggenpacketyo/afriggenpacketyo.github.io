          <p>Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned to air following a week-long suspension by ABC, prompted by Kimmel's comments criticizing the MAGA movement's reaction to Charlie Kirk's killing. Audience members described an emotional monologue, which garnered standing ovations, though Kimmel did not issue an apology. This return occurs amidst scrutiny from President Trump and the FCC, with some affiliate stations preempting the show. Trump also referenced a past $16 million settlement with ABC related to a defamation lawsuit.</p>

Their potential absence creates challenges, forcing other players into larger roles, though the offense demonstrated resilience in a recent win.</p>

          <p>A new bronze statue has appeared on the National Mall, controversially depicting President Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, celebrating their past association. The installation, which has a temporary permit, includes plaques with lines from an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein. This art piece highlights a persistent issue for Trump, reminiscent of other critical sculptures previously displayed on the Mall. The sculpture underscores the continued public scrutiny of the former president's relationship with the convicted sex trafficker.</p>

          <p>An article fact-checks President Donald Trump's inaccurate claims regarding autism, Tylenol use during pregnancy, and childhood vaccinations. Trump suggested a link between Tylenol and autism, contradicted by medical evidence, and falsely claimed Amish children don't get vaccines or autism. The article clarifies that children receive fewer vaccine doses than Trump stated and that the Hepatitis B vaccine is crucial for newborns due to mother-to-child transmission risks. Health experts emphasize that genetics play the largest role in autism likelihood, not acetaminophen.</p>

          <p>Iconic 76-year-old pop star Lulu has publicly revealed her past struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," describing it as a "liberating" confession. She sought help in 2013 after admitting her problem to family, subsequently checking into rehab and committing to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu, who was a "highly functioning alcoholic" even during her time on Strictly Come Dancing, had hidden her addiction for years due to shame and a desire to protect her image. Her decision to share her story aims to help others and break a family pattern of addiction.</p>

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt demanded an investigation after an escalator at the UN abruptly halted as President Donald Trump and the First Lady stepped onto it. Leavitt suggested the incident might have been intentional, referencing prior jokes by UN staff about disrupting Trump's visit. However, a UN official stated a person traveling with Trump inadvertently hit the stop lever. Trump publicly mocked the UN's infrastructure quality, linking the escalator issue and a faulty teleprompter to a past rejected bid for renovations.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young people in the UK are unable to afford moving out of their parents' homes due to rising living costs. Leoni Clancey, 21, returned home after her savings were depleted by utilities, council tax, and rent. Research indicates that nine out of ten young adults living with parents would face housing costs consuming nearly half their income. This trend not only impacts young adults' independence and relationships but also creates financial strain for parents. Experts advocate for building more affordable homes to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a 19-year-old Chelsea academy graduate, has seized a first-team lifeline after a potential transfer to Fulham fell through. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George scored a crucial equalizer and assisted the winning goal in Chelsea's Carabao Cup victory against Lincoln City, preventing a potential upset. His impressive performance provides manager Enzo Maresca with a valuable attacking option, especially given other striker injuries. George's dedication, including extensive personal training, is helping him disrupt the typical Chelsea youth pathway and pursue first-team success.</p>

          <p>Following the 2024 presidential election, spurious claims of fraud alleging Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump, won are flourishing online, mirroring 2020 election denial theories. These claims often rely on elaborate but flawed statistical analyses and unsubstantiated allegations, such as a supposed NSA audit. Experts like Justin Grimmer note the striking similarity to previous debunked theories, emphasizing that voter behavior is complex and real-world election processes include numerous safeguards. Debunking these persistent, abstract interpretations of data remains a frustrating challenge for election experts.</p>

While seemingly pro-Ukraine, the shift is viewed skeptically, potentially as a "tantrum" or a way to "wash his hands" of the conflict, having failed to broker peace. The article highlights the lack of concrete action items for increased U.S. aid and the reliance on European support. This unpredictability leaves allies unsettled and suggests a continued reordering of global alliances.</p>

          <p>California is moving to regulate excessively loud commercials on streaming services, with Senate Bill 576 awaiting the governor's signature. The legislation, inspired by a new mother's experience with commercials disturbing her newborn, would prohibit streaming ads from being louder than the programming. While federal law already regulates broadcast and cable TV ad volume, streaming services were exempt. The Motion Picture Assn. and Streaming Innovation Alliance initially opposed the bill but became neutral after an amendment removed private lawsuit provisions, indicating progress towards consumer relief.</p>
