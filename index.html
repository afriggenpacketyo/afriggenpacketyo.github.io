          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's shares rose significantly despite the company lowering its full-year earnings per share forecast due to expected $50 million impact from tariffs. The company's first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with sales rising to $1.10 billion. Abercrombie is mitigating the tariff impact by diversifying its sourcing network, moving away from China to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. Despite the tariff-related challenges, the company is optimistic about future growth, particularly from its Hollister brand, and anticipates a return to growth for the Abercrombie brand in the latter half of the year.

          <p>Mortgage rates increased for the third consecutive week, reaching their highest point since January, yet demand from homebuyers continued to rise. Applications for home purchases climbed 2% compared to the previous week and were 18% higher than the same period last year, driven by increased housing inventory. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.98%. Economists suggest that the increased housing inventory is supporting transaction volume despite economic uncertainty, while refinance applications experienced a decline due to the higher rates.</p>

The exact implementation of the policy remains to be seen, but officials from countries with a history of targeting dual nationals for criticizing their governments on social media are likely targets.</p>

          <p>Peter Cunningham, a man wrongly identified on social media as the driver who injured 79 people at the Liverpool parade, has moved his children out of their home due to safety concerns. False accusations circulated online after the incident, leading to harassment and fear for his family. Cunningham stated he was with his children miles away from the incident and urged police to release the suspect's name to stop the accusations. Police have been granted more time to question the actual suspect, while social media platforms face criticism for spreading disinformation.</p>

The company is profitable and stands to raise $240 million in the IPO, but the significant insider sales highlight the pressure on tech investors for exits. (not investment advice)</p>
