          <h2>Trump Administration to Provide Tariff Relief for U.S. Automakers</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to provide tariff relief to U.S. automakers, preventing tariffs from stacking on top of each other, including those on steel and aluminum. While the 25% tariff on imported vehicles will remain, the new measures will reimburse manufacturers for tariffs already paid and provide a phased reimbursement for tariffs on auto parts, giving automakers time to move their supply chains back to the U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick emphasized the move as a victory for President Trump's trade policy and a partnership with domestic automakers and American workers. The announcement aims to alleviate the financial burden on the automotive industry while incentivizing domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Liberal Party leader Mark Carney has won the Canadian election, securing his party's decade-long hold on power after replacing Justin Trudeau as prime minister. President Trump made a social media post on the day of Canada's election suggesting that Canadians should vote for him in order for Canada to become the 51st state, which drew criticism from Canadian politicians who affirmed Canada's sovereignty. Carney responded with a video emphasizing Canada's independence, while Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre told Trump to "stay out of our election." The Liberal Party will either form a minority or majority government, solidifying their position in Canadian politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's ambitious attempt to overhaul the federal government as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has largely failed due to Cabinet resistance and legal challenges. Despite initial efforts to cut spending and reduce the federal workforce, Musk's agenda faced pushback from Cabinet secretaries who felt their authority was being undermined. The president ultimately sided with the Cabinet, limiting Musk's power and leading to his reduced involvement. While some of DOGE's initiatives, such as dismantling certain agencies, will have lasting consequences, Musk's vision of running the government like a tech startup ultimately proved unsustainable.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that individual investors are maintaining their positions during market instability due to their confidence in President Trump's tariff policies. Citing data from Vanguard, Bessent noted that the majority of Americans have not made trades recently, contrasting this with institutional investors who have shown signs of panic. While retail investors have bought stocks during market dips, institutions worry about the impact of tariffs on consumers and the economy, with some economists predicting a summer recession due to trade-related shortages. Ken Griffin of Citadel also expressed concern that Trump's trade policies could damage the U.S.'s reputation.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. study suggests that common chemicals found in everyday plastic products may be associated with cardiovascular disease worldwide, with the most significant impact in Asia, the Middle East, and the Pacific. The study estimates that exposure to the phthalate DEHP could have contributed to 350,000 deaths in 2018, although it doesn't establish a direct causal relationship. Researchers recommend avoiding microwaving and dishwashing plastics to reduce exposure to harmful chemicals. A global plastics treaty is currently being negotiated by the United Nations, while the European Union has already banned phthalates like DEHP in toys and cosmetics.</p>

The company's organic revenue increased 6% during the quarter, driven by higher prices on its drinks.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores how AI-generated text is influencing human communication, potentially leading to a standardization of language. AI tools are increasingly integrated into writing processes, and as a result, language may become more verbose and formal, reflecting the style of these tools. While some believe this will lead to a homogenization of language, others suggest it could spark a countermovement, with people embracing their own linguistic mannerisms to differentiate themselves. The article also discusses the possibility of AI tools evolving language separately from humans, creating a distinct linguistic style.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the administration's actions to downsize the federal workforce violate the Constitution because Congress has not authorized them.

While national average CD rates vary, top CDs from online banks offer competitive interest rates, with short-term CDs often providing the best returns.
