          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by a slight 0.1% in August, following a revised 0.1% contraction in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. This marginal growth comes as the government faces increasing pressure to bolster the economy ahead of the upcoming Budget. Economists and institutions like the Institute for Fiscal Studies are warning that tax increases or spending cuts may be necessary to manage the government's finances. The ONS highlighted that over the three months leading to August, the economy grew by 0.3%, driven by the services sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third quarter, with profits surging 39.1% year-over-year, significantly exceeding market expectations. This remarkable growth is attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes AI applications, accounted for 57% of its revenue. Advanced chips, those 7-nanometer or smaller, constituted 74% of total wafer revenue, underscoring the industry's shift towards more powerful and efficient processors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for this action remains unclear. Trump stated this move is crucial for pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine, adding that the halt would involve "a little bit of a process." In response, India's external affairs ministry emphasized that its import decisions are guided by consumer interests and energy security. India is currently one of the largest buyers of Russian crude oil, a significant point of contention in its relationship with the United States.</p>

This has led to a political dispute, with the Conservative opposition accusing the Labour government of undermining the case to protect relations with Beijing.

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is actively working to break out of a significant postseason slump, taking the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice during a workout day. Ohtani has struggled at the plate since the start of the playoffs, with just two hits in 25 at-bats and 12 strikeouts. Manager Dave Roberts has emphasized the team's need for Ohtani's bat to succeed. The article also explores whether Ohtani's return to pitching this season has contributed to his offensive struggles, a notion he himself downplayed while acknowledging the physical demands of his two-way role.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from terminating federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two unions after more than 4,000 employees received reduction-in-force notifications. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts suggesting the layoffs were intended to punish political opponents by targeting "Democrat Agencies." The order provides temporary relief for thousands of workers and sets up a further legal battle over the administration's actions during the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>A long-lost diary written by Chinese naval officer Lam Ping-yu has shed new light on the role of Chinese personnel in the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944. Rescued from a Hong Kong building slated for demolition, the diary provides a detailed firsthand account of the landings from aboard the British battleship HMS Ramillies. Lam was one of over two dozen Chinese officers sent to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe. Historical researchers have since confirmed that at least 14 Chinese officers participated in the naval operations, adding a previously little-known international dimension to the historic liberation of France.</p>

Survivors have described the prospect as "sickening," while their lawyer called it "shameful." The trust managing the group's affairs stated it cannot redirect the assets and must distribute them to the listed beneficiaries under a court order.</p>

The anonymous scientist, who worked on chronic diseases, described the situation as chaotic and compared it to "an episode of 'Squid Games.'" Her termination was part of a reduction-in-force that initially targeted about 1,000 CDC employees before being partially rescinded, still resulting in around 600 layoffs. The cuts have impacted entire programs and are expected to hamper the agency's ability to respond to public health threats like disease outbreaks.</p>

This project is part of a series of aesthetic changes Trump is making to the capital, including a White House ballroom and a "Presidential Walk of Fame."

          <p>A CBS News investigation into California's jury duty system found that consequences for failing to appear are inconsistent and often non-existent across the state's 58 counties. While summonses threaten fines and jail time, data reveals that about one in four summoned residents, over 2.7 million people, failed to appear last year, with 21% of counties admitting they impose no sanctions at all. This lack of enforcement raises concerns about the ability to assemble a jury of one's peers and may skew the demographic of who serves.
