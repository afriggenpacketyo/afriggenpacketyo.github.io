          <p>A major power outage struck Cannes and its surrounding areas on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes due to a fire at a substation. Police suspect arson as the cause, but a connection to the film festival is unconfirmed. The festival organizers switched to an alternative power supply, ensuring the closing ceremony proceeded as planned, although morning screenings were briefly interrupted. The incident caused traffic disruptions and shop closures in the resort town, with teams working to restore the network; the cause of the pylon falling is still being investigated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is weighing the possibility of returning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the public market, potentially ending 17 years of federal conservatorship. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believes it could benefit taxpayers and the housing market. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, express concerns that it could drive up housing prices. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a crucial role in the U.S. mortgage market by guaranteeing trillions of dollars worth of mortgages, and their privatization could have significant implications for homebuyers and investors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU, European Union Trade Commissioner Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç emphasized that any trade deal must be based on mutual respect rather than threats. Trump cited frustration with the pace of trade agreement progress and claimed a $250 million annual trade deficit with the EU.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News alleges that broadcast networks exhibit bias in their coverage of political books, favoring negative "tell-all" books about Trump while downplaying similar books about Democrats. The article cites examples from 2018, when ABC, CBS, and NBC dedicated significant airtime to Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged." The author contrasts this with the limited coverage of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book about Biden, suggesting the networks actively promoted a favorable narrative during Biden's presidency. The piece claims networks downplayed concerns about Biden's fitness, reflecting a broader pattern of biased reporting.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in underwater communication, successfully transmitting acoustic data across 600km of ocean with zero errors. The project, led by Professor He Chengbing at Northwestern Polytechnical University, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement has profound implications for both civilian and military applications, potentially enabling reliable long-range undersea messaging for tasks such as coordinating underwater drones.</p>

          <p>Labour MPs are increasingly questioning Chancellor Rachel Reeves' economic policies, particularly her plans for welfare cuts and adherence to strict fiscal rules. The article highlights disagreements within the party, with some MPs advocating for alternative approaches such as wealth taxes and relaxed borrowing rules. Unions and left-wing MPs are calling for a new tax on the wealthiest, while others suggest restoring the 50p top tax rate and aligning capital gains tax with income tax. The growing unease within Labour's ranks reflects concerns about the impact of Reeves' policies on poverty and economic growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump's economic policies, including extending tax cuts and imposing tariffs, are facing growing skepticism from Wall Street investors. Concerns center on the US's "twin deficit" position and the potential for Trump's policies to stoke inflation and trigger a recession. Moody's recently downgraded the US's credit rating, reflecting unease about rising debt levels. The proposed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is projected to increase annual deficits, adding to America's already substantial debt pile. Economists warn that persistent deficits could erode investor confidence and drive up borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>Current and former state department officials express concern that the Trump administration is downplaying the threat of white supremacists. The officials cited the banning of the term "racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism" in the state department's style guide and proposed cuts to offices working on countering violent extremism. Critics suggest the administration is prioritizing threats that resonate with Trump's base while deprioritizing the far right, potentially emboldening far-right terrorist groups. The moves follow a pattern of shifting resources away from programs focused on domestic extremism.</p>

          <p>Despite criticisms of the "defund the police" movement, cities like Austin and Seattle are seeing progress in shifting resources from law enforcement to social services. In Milwaukee, funds were redirected to affordable housing and youth programs, while Seattle created a third public safety department focused on mental health crises. Austin has increased investment in homeless services after diverting funds from the police budget. While backlash followed the 2020 protests, these initiatives demonstrate a shift towards reimagining public safety and addressing community needs beyond traditional policing.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that UK employees continue to work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week. This trend is particularly prevalent in English-speaking countries and is attributed to factors such as commuting costs and lengths. Despite some companies implementing return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized in the UK since 2023. The study also notes that younger workers show a stronger preference for office work, while parents favor hybrid arrangements.</p>

          <p>Republicans are attempting to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would make permanent the 2017 tax cuts that largely benefited wealthy Americans. Critics argue that the bill is fiscally irresponsible and regressive, as it would increase the national debt and disproportionately benefit the rich while cutting key government assistance programs. The bill includes cuts to corporate tax rates and social programs, which Democrats argue will harm working-class families. Economists suggest that the tax cuts did little to help the middle class, with companies spending more on stock buybacks than wage growth.</p>

The article highlights uncertainty surrounding the rollout of Lenacapivir, a new injectable drug hailed as a "miracle" for HIV prevention, due to funding cuts for preventative services. The UN estimates that if Pepfar's treatment and prevention services are stopped entirely, it would result in an additional 6.6m HIV infections by 2029.</p>

          <p>After 4,000 baby chicks died in a USPS truck, a Vox article highlights the mass transportation and deaths of farmed animals. While this incident received news coverage, the article emphasizes the larger issue of millions of farmed animals dying in transport annually, often due to extreme conditions and lack of federal protections. The author points out that the poultry industry doesn't publish statistics on these deaths, but estimates suggest millions of chickens die during transport each year. The article argues that the meat industry prioritizes profit over animal welfare, leading to preventable deaths.</p>

The costumes are meant to prevent the cub from bonding with humans, ensuring a successful return to the wild. The cub, found underweight and weak, requires four enrichment and feeding sessions daily and will remain in the center's care for up to a year.
