          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 10:12:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has proposed moving up its ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to January 2027, a year earlier than previously planned. This measure is part of a new sanctions package aimed at reducing Russia's war revenues, reportedly influenced by pressure from the United States. The proposal also targets entities in third countries, including China, that assist Russia in circumventing existing oil sanctions. Despite significant reductions in pipeline gas, Russia still supplied 19% of the EU's gas in 2024, highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving energy independence.</p>

          <p>Following ABC's indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," fellow late-night hosts have responded with solidarity and sharp criticism of what they term censorship. Jon Stewart used satire to mock the network's decision, while Stephen Colbert called it a "blatant assault on freedom of speech." The suspension occurred after Kimmel made comments about the reaction to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, leading major station owners like Nexstar to pull the show. The collective response from the hosts highlights growing concerns about free speech and media independence under political pressure.</p>

          <p>Wiltshire Police have arrested two South Western Ambulance Service workers as part of a major investigation into the deaths of six adults. The inquiry began in 2023, leading to the arrest of a man in his 30s on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter and ill-treatment, and a 59-year-old woman for gross negligence manslaughter. The ambulance service confirmed it launched an internal investigation upon learning of the concerns and that the two staff members were immediately removed from patient-facing duties. The service has reassured the public that this is an isolated incident with no ongoing risk to patients.</p>

          <p>The Chinese shipping company SeaLegend Line has launched its first vessel on a new Arctic express route, aiming to expedite deliveries to Europe. The ship, Istanbul Bridge, departed from Qingdao and is scheduled to reach Gdansk, Poland, in under a month, a significantly shorter transit time than the traditional Suez Canal route. This new service is specifically designed to cater to time-sensitive cargo, such as cross-border e-commerce parcels and high-value goods. While the Arctic route is faster, the company notes that it comes at a higher cost per container compared to conventional sea freight.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly set to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for refusing to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that federal investigators found no clear evidence of mortgage fraud by James, yet Trump administration officials pressured Siebert to prosecute her anyway. The move has heightened concerns about the weaponization of the Department of Justice to target political adversaries. The administration is expected to install a replacement who will more aggressively pursue the investigation into James, one of Trump's most prominent critics.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization," but legal experts say the move faces significant hurdles. There is currently no legal mechanism for the U.S. government to designate a domestic group as a terrorist organization, partly due to First Amendment concerns. Furthermore, antifa is a decentralized movement with no formal leadership or structure, making it difficult to define as a singular entity. Critics argue that such a designation would be an attempt to prosecute an ideology rather than specific criminal acts of violence.</p>

          <h2>Retailers Employ 'Tariff Arbitrage' Strategy to Mitigate Costs for Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 08:50:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To counter the impact of U.S. tariffs, some retail companies are using a "business-to-business-to-consumer" (B2B2C) model to lower their import duty bills. This strategy involves routing online sales through a third-party middleman company that acts as the official importer. This middleman purchases the product from the retailer at a wholesale price and pays the tariff on that lower value, rather than the final retail price paid by the consumer. Companies using this method report significant savings, allowing them to avoid passing the full cost of tariffs on to their customers.</p>

          <p>Liz Uihlein, a billionaire businesswoman and a top financial donor to Donald Trump's campaign, privately mocked the president's assertion that he holds the upper hand in trade negotiations with China. In an email to her staff, Uihlein shared a cartoon depicting Trump claiming "I hold the cards," with Chinese President Xi Jinping replying, "The cards are made in China." This private skepticism is significant as it comes from a key political ally whose company, Uline, reportedly imports a substantial amount of its merchandise from China and is affected by trade policy.</p>

The demonstrators blocked an underground garage used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to transport detainees. Inside the building, eleven elected officials, including the city comptroller, were also detained after demanding to see the conditions in the ICE intake facility. The protest was a response to recent ICE actions, including arresting immigrants in courthouse hallways, which critics say erodes due process and instills fear.</p>

          <p>A rare, 3,000-year-old golden bracelet belonging to King Amenemope has been permanently lost after being stolen from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. An investigation revealed that a restoration specialist working at the museum stole the artifact and sold it for less than $4,000. The bracelet was then passed through several gold dealers before being melted down and reshaped into new jewelry. Authorities have arrested four suspects and recovered the money from the sale, but the priceless historical artifact is irrecoverable, sparking outrage over the breach of trust and cultural loss.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has defended his decision to recognize a Palestinian state, asserting that it is a necessary step to isolate Hamas and advance peace. Responding to criticism from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the plan "reckless," Macron argued that Hamas's goal is the destruction of Israel, not the creation of a state. Therefore, he believes that pursuing a peace plan that includes statehood is a precondition for stopping the war and undermining the extremist group's objectives. France plans to formalize its decision at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.</p>
