          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once projected as a high-round pick, fell to the fifth round of the NFL draft, raising questions about his perceived value and reported off-field issues. Despite his talent, concerns about his interviews and work ethic contributed to his slide, forcing him to compete for a starting position with the Cleveland Browns. Sanders now faces the challenge of adjusting to a complex NFL offense and proving his worth to coaches who may not have fully supported his acquisition. This experience serves as a reality check, demanding hard work and adherence to a system where he is no longer the primary decision-maker.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. defeated Conor Benn after 12 grueling rounds in a fight marked by family history and drama. The victory was made more poignant by the reconciliation of Eubank Jr. with his father, Chris Eubank Sr., who had been estranged for years. Benn, while disappointed, acknowledged the special bond between Eubank Jr. and his father, stating that their reunion was more valuable than the fight itself. The match was the culmination of a rivalry that had been building since their fathers' iconic duels in the 1990s, and was briefly derailed by a doping scandal.</p>

          <p>Europe's pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential disruptions as President Trump considers imposing tariffs on drugs imported from the European Union. The tariffs could significantly impact the flow of essential medicines, such as insulin and heart treatments, which have traditionally been exempt from such duties. The move would have uncertain consequences for European drug manufacturers, potentially affecting the availability and cost of pharmaceuticals in the American market, which is a key source of revenue for many companies.</p>

          <p>Australia is considering capping the number of international students as a measure to address unaffordable housing, a key concern for voters ahead of the upcoming election. This shift marks a significant change for the country, which has historically viewed international education as a major economic driver. While politicians argue that capping student numbers will reduce demand for rentals and lower housing prices, others worry about the potential negative impacts on the education sector and the broader economy.</p>
