          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement operations. Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, stating that it would only escalate tensions and that the federal government was attempting to take over the California National Guard. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address lawlessness in California. The move marks a significant escalation in the ongoing tensions between the federal government and California over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles is described as a response to a manufactured crisis, rather than an actual insurrection. The author argues that Los Angeles is not in chaos, and the protests are isolated and manageable by local law enforcement. Trump's actions are seen as an expansion of presidential power aimed at U.S. civilians, based on a lie. The author suggests that Trump's true motive is to laser-focus on a few bad actors to make an example of the city and increase his own power.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contempt, signaled by a sour tone or attitude, is a significant predictor of divorce. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication styles also contribute to frequent arguments. Strategies for moving past these conflicts include naming the effect, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load, and using the "five-second rule" for time-outs.</p>
