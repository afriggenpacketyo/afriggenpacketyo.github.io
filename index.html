          <p>Phan Thi Kim Phuc, famously known as the "Napalm Girl" from a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph during the Vietnam War, shares her story of survival and advocacy for peace. Fifty years after the war's end, Kim Phuc, now 62, hopes her image will remind people of the devastating impact of war on children, drawing parallels to current conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. The article details the events of June 8, 1972, when Kim Phuc was severely burned in a napalm attack, her subsequent struggles with physical and emotional scars, and her eventual journey towards forgiveness and establishing a foundation to support child victims of war. Kim Phuc stresses the importance of bearing witness to the ugly realities of war, regardless of how cruel the images may be.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party secured victory in Canada's federal election, according to projections, although it remains unclear whether they will achieve a majority. Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre conceded defeat, but the election was heavily influenced by US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and comments about making Canada the 51st state. Many voters shifted support to the Liberals due to Trump's antagonism, giving Carney a boost in popularity. The election outcome marks a comeback for the Liberals after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation.</p>

The incident occurred after a far-right Israeli official spoke at the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters, sparking protests and counterprotests. Police are investigating the attack on the woman, who claims she was kicked, threatened, and subjected to racist abuse. The protest highlights the ongoing tensions and divisions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in New York City.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Actions Enable Liberal Victory in Canada</h2>

          <p>Anthony Zurcher analyzes how Donald Trump's actions contributed to Mark Carney and the Liberal Party's victory in the Canadian election. Trump's constant badgering of Canada and comments about making it the 51st US state coincided with a reversal in fortune for the Liberal Party. Carney successfully ran against Trump's perceived threat to Canada's sovereignty and economy. The election outcome suggests a potential shift in Canada's focus towards Europe as a more reliable partner than Trump's America.</p>

While the EU has a vast network of trade and aid agreements, it must address complaints about its mindset and colonial attitudes.
