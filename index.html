          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will remain headquartered in Pittsburgh. According to Trump, this partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with the bulk of the investment occurring within the next 14 months. Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel was previously blocked by former President Joe Biden over national security concerns. Trump has also said he'll hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn, are leaving the firm to start their own law firm. This follows criticism of the firm's chairman, Brad Karp, for reaching a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order restricting the firm's business. Dunn has overseen debate preparation for prominent Democrats like Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, and the departing partners also include antitrust lawyer Bill Isaacson and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee. The move is seen as a significant blow to Paul Weiss, which has faced internal and external criticism for its perceived capitulation to the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top buyers of his meme coin, but attendees like Nicholas Pinto criticized the event for its underwhelming experience. Pinto, who spent a significant amount on the token to attend, described the food as poor and the security as lax, noting that phones weren't locked and attendees were more focused on the coin's price than engaging with Trump. Trump made a brief appearance, delivering crypto talking points before departing via helicopter without interacting with most guests.

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. NPH is caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulating in the brain, leading to difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems, and is estimated to affect hundreds of thousands of older Americans. The singer is undergoing physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during his recovery, as early diagnosis and treatment with surgery can often reverse symptoms. Experts emphasize that the condition is likely underdiagnosed because its symptoms can easily be dismissed as normal effects of aging.</p>

          <p>Jon Worrell has been charged with the murder of his wife, Doris Worrell, nearly 19 years after fleeing the U.S. with the couple's nanny. Doris Worrell was found fatally shot in 2006, initially believed to be the victim of a botched robbery. However, suspicion later turned to Jon Worrell, who had been having an affair with the nanny and fled to Costa Rica, and was concerned that if he divorced Doris, he would lose his children. The case was reopened after investigators found the nanny in Costa Rica, who provided information corroborating other evidence, and Worrell has been denied bond and authorities are still trying to determine who shot Doris Worrell.</p>

The order against Jenner & Block instructed officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearances, identify any goods, property, material and services provided by the federal government and stop providing them, terminate any government contracts that may exist with the law firm, and not hire any employees of the firm for any future federal jobs.</p>

          <p>A two-month-old black bear cub, found alone and starving in California's Los Padres National Forest, is being cared for at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center. Wildlife officials attempted to reunite him with his mother overnight, but she didn’t return. To minimize human imprinting, staff are using enrichment sessions that mimic maternal behavior, including wearing bear costumes, using plush toys, and camouflaged headsets. The goal is to prepare the cub for a future return to the wild, with release expected in late spring or early summer of next year.</p>

          <p>A new Supreme Court ruling has allowed Donald Trump to fire members of independent regulatory agencies, potentially overturning 90 years of precedent. The ruling, delivered through the Court's “shadow docket,” is seen as a major win for Project 2025, which seeks to seize control of independent agencies. This decision could lead to a radical shift in the balance of power between Congress and the White House, with potential implications for the way Americans live their lives.</p>

          <p>Eight of the ten individuals accused of robbing Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016 have been found guilty after a month-long trial.

Kardashian stated that the crime was the most terrifying experience of her life, but she believes in growth and accountability. The robbers, dubbed the "Grandpa robbers" due to their ages, received lenient sentences due to their health conditions and the time elapsed since the crime.</p>

The study also found that for every 1% increase in insurance costs, there is a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide, as lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, (not investment advice).</p>
