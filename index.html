          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, is returning to the United States to face charges of illegally transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Garcia on two counts, alleging his involvement in a years-long conspiracy to transport migrants from Texas to the country's interior, with some allegedly being MS-13 members. The alleged conspiracy spanned nearly a decade and involved thousands of non-citizens, including children, from Mexico and Central America, according to sources briefed on the indictment. Garcia's deportation occurred despite a 2019 court order barring his removal to El Salvador due to fear of persecution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small business owners are reportedly pulling back on hiring due to tariff-driven cost increases, making new employees an untenable proposition. Companies are trimming costs, including labor, by pausing hiring, cutting hours, and even laying off staff. Several business owners, including Mike Roach of Paloma Clothing and Shayai Lucero of Earth & Sky Floral Designs, have cited tariffs as a reason for reducing labor-related spending and halting hiring plans. Data from the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) shows a drop in the share of small business owners planning to create new jobs, with labor costs remaining a top concern.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece analyzes the recent public dispute between Elon Musk and Donald Trump on social media, framing it as a clash of "high agency males." The author contrasts this behavior with traditional notions of masculinity, suggesting that their social media exchanges are more akin to passive-aggressive, female-coded communication. The article references examples from reality television to illustrate this point, arguing that this style of masculinity rejects traditional roles of provider or protector in favor of disruption and edgelord posturing. The author suggests that this "toxic immaturity" is becoming increasingly prevalent in American politics.</p>

          <p>The Champlin Park Rebels won the Class AAAA Minnesota high school girls' softball championship, defeating Bloomington Jefferson 6-0, with a complete-game shutout by junior pitcher Marissa Rothenberger.

Outside the stadium, protesters gathered to express their opposition to the Minnesota State High School League's policy allowing student-athletes to compete based on gender identity.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the recent public spat between President Trump and Elon Musk, it may be difficult for Trump to cut ties with Musk due to the US's reliance on SpaceX for space-related projects. SpaceX dominates the space launch industry and is crucial for military, intelligence, and NASA operations. Canceling contracts with SpaceX could halt ambitious projects like the National Reconnaissance Office's satellite constellation and NASA's Artemis program. Furthermore, SpaceX is a frontrunner for building the "Golden Dome" missile defense system, making Musk's involvement essential for Trump's goals.</p>

This perspective views much of populist politics as an anti-managerial revolution aimed at curbing bureaucratic control. While success has been limited, understanding this anti-managerialism is crucial for comprehending the administration's attempts to transform institutions.</p>
