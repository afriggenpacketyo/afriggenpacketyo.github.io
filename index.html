        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a decline of approximately 9% in after-hours trading, even though the company's first-quarter earnings aligned with analysts' forecasts and revenue guidance was raised. The defense technology company reported adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents and revenue of $884 million, surpassing the expected $863 million. CEO Alex Karp emphasized the company's pivotal role in providing the operating system for modern enterprises in the era of AI, noting a surge in adoption of Palantir's software, especially within the U.S. defense sector, and the company's commercial revenue saw a 71% increase, while government sales rose by 45%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted another round of layoffs, impacting approximately 200 employees, including staff at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This move has surprised NIH officials who believed previous cuts had concluded, with affected employees expressing disappointment and uncertainty about the agency's direction. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that these reductions aim to redirect resources towards critical programs and maximize the impact of taxpayer dollars. The layoffs included around 50 employees from NCI's Office of Communications and Public Liaison, affecting programs such as the Cancer Information Service, which provides information to doctors and patients, and updates to cancer information databases for healthcare providers.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has released footage of the electromagnetic catapult system in action on the country's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, offering a glimpse of its cutting-edge jet launch technology. The report also suggested that the Fujian would require longer sea trials than China‚Äôs other carriers due to the complexity of the launch system, dampening speculation of it being ready for service this year. The footage showed an air traffic control officer giving take-off clearance to an aircraft, and commentator Cao Weidong noted that the electromagnetic catapult system allows carrier-based aircraft to take off with full fuel and ordnance, potentially enabling the deployment of fixed-wing early warning aircraft and drones.</p>

          <p>A North Texas high school student, Isaac Leal, is in critical condition after sustaining a severe head injury while participating in a "Senior Assassin" game. The incident occurred when Leal jumped onto the back of a Jeep, which then drove off, causing him to fall and hit his head, and security camera footage shows the vehicle made several turns before he was ejected. Leal's family is seeking a criminal investigation, while police are investigating the incident as a traffic accident. The "Senior Assassin" game, where students use water guns to "eliminate" classmates, has prompted warnings from school officials about potential dangers, and the family is speaking out to prevent similar incidents.</p>

          <p>Newark Airport is experiencing its ninth day of delays and cancellations due to an air traffic controller shortage and ongoing equipment issues.

The FAA is slowing the rate of arrivals to Newark to ensure safety, while Senator Chuck Schumer is requesting an investigation from the Department of Transportation's inspector general, and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has requested support from Duffy.</p>

          <p>Recent trade data indicates that U.S. exports are declining, particularly in the agricultural sector, following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs. Ports like Portland and Tacoma have seen significant decreases in exports, with overall U.S. exports taking a hit, and the decline is linked to reduced containership traffic and changes in global demand due to U.S. trade policy. Retailers are urging consumers to buy sooner rather than later, and Bank of America Global Research suggests that retail inventories may appear lean in the coming months due to supply disruptions, and Hawaii-based freight liner operator Matson lowered its 2025 outlook, citing tariffs and global trade regulatory measures.</p>

Concerns also exist about losing votes to progressive parties like the Greens, and while some believe progressive voters will coalesce around Labour in a general election, others emphasize the need for the government to demonstrate seriousness about immigration and address economic concerns to improve public sentiment.</p>

          <p>Generations of deep-diving among women on a South Korean island may have changed their genetic evolution. The Haenyeo, or "sea women," of Jeju Island, have developed adaptations that allow them to dive for longer periods than other people, and genomic analysis has revealed they have evolved genetically to have lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance. Researchers believe this evolution protects pregnant women while diving, and the findings could help science develop new medical treatments in the future.

Figures like conductor Herbert von Karajan and sculptor Arno Breker were able to resume their work after undergoing a denazification process, and Wieland Wagner, grandson of composer Richard Wagner, even ran the prestigious Bayreuth Festival. These artists often received numerous well-paid commissions in public spaces after 1945, and while some argue that society has not adequately addressed their pasts, others point to efforts to provide context and information about their histories alongside their works.</p>

Within the first 100 days of Trump's second term, a majority of Americans felt the economy had worsened, and Trump has delegated neither economic management nor communications to specialists, leading to a chaotic and unconvincing economic message.</p>

          <p>The governors of six northeastern U.S. states have invited the premiers of six Canadian provinces to meet in Boston to discuss the economic impacts of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The governors, including five Democrats and one Republican, aim to reaffirm their friendship and unique interdependence with Canada, citing centuries-old familial and cultural bonds. This meeting comes as Trump is scheduled to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House, with Trump repeatedly expressing interest in Canada becoming America's 51st state.</p>

The government insists that the move to restrict eligibility for the annual payments was necessary to ensure economic stability and repair public finances, while Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that many voters are unhappy with the cuts. The winter fuel payment, a lump-sum amount for pensioners, was restricted last year to those qualifying for pension credit and other income-related benefits, a move that has faced opposition from unions and other parties.</p>
