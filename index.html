          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to arm certain clans in Gaza to combat Hamas has drawn criticism and concern. Former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman has likened the move to arming a criminal gang akin to ISIS, while Netanyahu defends it as a measure to save Israeli soldiers' lives. Opposition leader Yair Lapid warned of repeating past mistakes, referencing the earlier support given to Hamas.

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking the Supreme Court's intervention to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education and laying off over 1,000 employees. This action follows a lower court ruling that blocked the administration from carrying out these layoffs, citing a violation of the separation of powers. The administration argues that the district court is overstepping its authority by interfering with the Executive Branch's management decisions. The Justice Department asserts that the lower court lacks jurisdiction to question the Executive's internal management of the Department of Education.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock is showing signs of recovery, climbing 5% after a significant drop triggered by the recent conflict between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that the market overreacted to the spat and that a potential truce between Musk and Trump would benefit Tesla's shares. Despite the recent volatility, analysts maintain a positive outlook on Tesla's long-term prospects, particularly regarding its autonomous driving technology. The initial fallout resulted in a substantial decrease in Musk's net worth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with President Donald Trump was overshadowed by Trump's feud with Elon Musk, yet it's viewed as a positive outcome for Merz. Merz addressed topics ranging from US-German relations to tariffs and support for Ukraine. Merz highlighted Germany's plans for higher defense spending, likely a positive note in discussions. The sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party was seemingly avoided.</p>
