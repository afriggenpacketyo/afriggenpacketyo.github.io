          <p>Iran held large public funerals in Tehran for senior military commanders and nuclear scientists who were killed during a recent 12-day war with Israel. Hundreds of thousands of mourners reportedly attended the procession for figures like Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami, with crowds chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans in a display of national defiance. The ceremonies are the first major public mourning event since a ceasefire was declared, underscoring the significant human toll on Iran's military and scientific leadership. The event also showcased a defiant public mood following the intense, short-lived conflict that saw major losses on both sides.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are facing a significant challenge in their effort to pass President Trump's major budget bill before a July 4th deadline, with at least three Republican senators announcing their opposition. The sprawling legislation, which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and introduces new spending cuts, requires a simple majority to pass, but the defections have put its approval in jeopardy. Leadership is actively working to persuade undecided centrist senators like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. The bill's passage is considered a critical part of Trump's second-term agenda, but internal party divisions over welfare cuts and the overall cost are creating major hurdles.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after being bitten in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. While the woman did not see what bit her, state officials and experts who analyzed photos of the wounds believe it was most likely a juvenile sand tiger shark. The woman was treated for non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, but it resumed the next day after drone and lifeguard surveillance of the water found no further signs of dangerous marine life.</p>

Bueckers reiterated her belief that White privilege exists in sports marketing and that coverage is not equal, stating her desire to counteract this imbalance through her actions.

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy sought an urgent explanation from the broadcaster about its due diligence process. Police are now reviewing footage from the performances of both Bob Vylan and the band Kneecap to determine if any criminal offenses were committed during their sets.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of President Trump's major spending bill contains several key provisions that would have wide-ranging effects on taxpayers and businesses. The 940-page package extends the 2017 tax cuts, introduces new temporary tax breaks for tip and overtime income, and raises the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for many households. However, it also includes contentious measures such as deep cuts to Medicaid and work requirements that could cause millions to lose health insurance. The bill notably scraps a controversial "revenge tax" provision, a relief for Wall Street investors concerned about its potential impact. (not investment advice)</p>

The project was initiated after Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), a nonprofit, requested a machine capable of embossing braille onto plastic beer labels, which commercial printers cannot handle. The student-designed device is user-friendly for employees with low or no vision and has already produced 400 labels for a special beer benefiting individuals with vision loss.

          <p>An Ashland, Kentucky man facing arraignment on numerous felony charges earned himself additional time behind bars due to his behavior in court. During a livestreamed hearing, 41-year-old Jeffrey A. Hurn repeatedly interrupted and questioned Boyd Circuit Judge John Vincent, asking for the judge's name and disputing the charges against him. After Hurn attempted to walk away from the podium, the judge found him in contempt of court. This ruling added an immediate 30 days to any future sentence Hurn might receive and resulted in the revocation of his jail privileges.</p>

          <p>Phoenix police officers rescued a baby who had been left alone for several days in an apartment after the infant's mother passed away. Officers were conducting a welfare check requested by a neighbor when they saw the woman unresponsive on the floor through a window. Upon forcing entry, they found the baby on a bed, visibly emaciated. The child was immediately taken to a hospital for lifesaving care and is now expected to make a full recovery. The cause of the mother's death is currently under investigation by the medical examiner's office.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at new record highs, demonstrating remarkable resilience despite the recent U.S. military strikes in Iran. The market initially shrugged off fears of a wider conflict, with a key factor being the rapid decline in oil prices after a brief surge, which eased inflation concerns. Investor sentiment was also bolstered by growing expectations for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of the year. However, a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation reading from the PCE price index suggests that the path for future rate decisions remains complex and uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with a series of significant, though not landmark, victories for conservative states and President Trump's expansive claims of executive power. The court's 6-3 conservative majority handed down rulings that empower states to restrict transgender medical treatments and limit funding for Planned Parenthood clinics. Concurrently, the court sided with the Trump administration by reining in the power of district judges to issue nationwide injunctions. This term reflects a states-rights style of conservatism and a judiciary increasingly willing to defer to presidential authority, at least under the current administration.</p>

The two men, aged 22 and 24, were arrested on suspicion of preparing or instigating acts of terrorism. The arrests come as the UK government moves to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, which would make supporting the group illegal.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests the ancient city may have been a matriarchal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that husbands likely relocated to their wife's household after marriage and that female offspring remained in their birth homes. The findings challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal social structures in ancient societies and point to the central role of women in this well-preserved Neolithic community.</p>

While Russia has made limited use of captured Bradleys on the battlefield, re-arming them would solve the logistical problem of sourcing American ammunition.

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's success. President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed the sites were "obliterated," but preliminary intelligence assessments suggested the setback to Iran's program was only a matter of months. As the week progressed, officials appeared to scale back claims, with some Republican lawmakers acknowledging that destroying Iran's enriched uranium cache was not part of the mission.

          <p>Republican leaders are using the primary victory of Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, in the New York City mayoral race as a new line of attack against the Democratic Party. Figures from Donald Trump to the RNC chairman are portraying Mamdani's win as evidence that Democrats are embracing radical socialism, a narrative they hope will energize their base. While some progressive Democrats have celebrated the win, moderates have been more hesitant. In response to being labeled a communist by Trump, Mamdani has stated that New Yorkers are excited by a candidate who recognizes the inequality they face.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris expressed his satisfaction at feeling like "the old me back" after securing a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix. Norris dominated the qualifying session, finishing more than half a second ahead of the competition on one of the shortest tracks of the season. This performance marks a significant turnaround for the British driver, whose season has been hampered by uncharacteristic mistakes in qualifying. The result, aided by recent car upgrades, puts him in a strong position to challenge his championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, in Sunday's race.</p>
