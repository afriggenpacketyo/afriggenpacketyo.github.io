          <p>This article outlines five main takeaways from the meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. It highlights Putin's symbolic return to the world stage, the probing questions he faced from Western media, and the summit's failure to produce a concrete deal on Ukraine. The analysis also points to the lack of any threatened consequences from Trump and the overall cementing of a diplomatic rapprochement between the U.S. and Russia, despite the unresolved conflict.</p>

          <p>The high-stakes summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded without a significant breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. Trump described the talks as "productive," while Putin proposed a future meeting in Moscow. The meeting was held without Ukrainian participation, raising concerns in Kyiv about potential compromises, and was viewed by Russian state media as a strategic victory for Moscow.</p>

This valuation surge is largely driven by investor optimism surrounding artificial intelligence. While the chart suggests market froth, the article notes that high valuations do not necessarily mean a crash is imminent, as many AI companies have been exceeding earnings expectations.
