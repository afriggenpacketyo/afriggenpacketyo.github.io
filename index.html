          <p>Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with intentions to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service will initially start with about 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the upcoming FSD Unsupervised software. Musk emphasized a cautious approach, stating that Tesla will scale up the service gradually after confirming its safety and effectiveness. He has been promising a fully self-driving car for years, but Tesla has yet to offer a vehicle safe for use without human supervision.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that President Trump's tax cuts are increasing worries about America's debt and deficit among bond investors, potentially leading to higher interest rates for households and businesses. Investors are already uneasy due to Trump's tariff policies, and the proposed tax cuts without spending reductions have exacerbated the bond market turmoil. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that Treasury market volatility could further cloud the economic outlook, potentially causing people to be more cautious.

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned following public criticism over his remarks about receiving free rice, which angered citizens struggling with soaring rice prices. Inclement weather and protectionist policies have led to months of high rice prices in Japan, contributing to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's low approval ratings ahead of an Upper House election. The agriculture ministry's attempts to curb prices by releasing government stockpiles have had limited impact. The article notes that the cheap yen and increased tourism are exacerbating the issue.</p>

          <p>The UK inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, the highest in over a year, primarily due to increased household bills for water, gas, and electricity. The Office for National Statistics reported that housing, household services, transport, and recreation contributed significantly to the rise. The Bank of England anticipates inflation peaking at 3.7% before returning to its 2% target, potentially impacting future interest rate cuts. Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment, while shadow chancellor Mel Stride voiced concern for families facing rising living costs.</p>

It suggests that mainstream conservatives, sharing Murray's belief that the American government is no longer worthy of respect, have been complicit in Trump's actions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camp on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission was needed. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, stating the public has a right of access for open-air recreation, including camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association expressed delight and relief, emphasizing the importance of responsible access. Campaigners are calling for the right to wild camp to be extended across England and Wales.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that despite Israel's announcement to ease its blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, little food, fuel, and medicine has reached Palestinians. Dozens of trucks have crossed into Gaza at the Kerem Shalom crossing, but the United Nations has been unable to move them due to looting concerns. The blockade has left Gazans at critical risk of famine, with tens of thousands of children potentially suffering from acute malnutrition. Ordinary Gazans are struggling to make their limited provisions last, with some vendors selling single onions for exorbitant prices.</p>

Economists attribute this stagnation to high mortgage rates, increasing inventory, and economic uncertainty linked to tariffs. The annual price growth has significantly slowed compared to the previous year. Zillow forecasts a slight decline in home prices by April 2026 due to the rising number of homes for sale, as existing homeowners choose to move despite high mortgage rates.</p>
