          <p>Thames Water's future is uncertain after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest £4bn into the company. This setback increases the possibility of government-supervised administration for the UK's largest water company, which serves a quarter of the UK's population. Thames Water called the news "disappointing" but said it would proceed to work on an alternative plan. Despite ownership changes, water services are expected to continue as normal, and lenders have prepared a plan to raise equity. The government has stated it is ready to take over if necessary, but the company secured a £3bn rescue loan earlier in the year. An independent review has described the current regulatory system as "chaotic" and needing reform, emphasizing the need for long-term investors in the sector.</p>

          <p>The Dutch coalition government, led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof, has collapsed due to disagreements over immigration policy. Geert Wilders, head of the far-right PVV (Party for Freedom), withdrew his party from the coalition, citing frustration with the slow pace of introducing stricter immigration measures. Wilders expressed his discontent on X, formerly Twitter, stating that the PVV would leave the coalition due to a lack of agreement on asylum plans. The collapse follows Wilders' election win in November 2023, where he agreed with coalition partners to implement the "strictest-ever immigration policy."</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two critical mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, one being the decision to have Max Verstappen give back a position after contact with George Russell in Turn One. Team principal Christian Horner stated that the decision was based on recent experiences and perceived penalties, but stewards later ruled no further action was necessary. The second mistake was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a decision Verstappen questioned, and Horner admitted they should have left him on soft tires.

The article explores how politicians, including Donald Trump, navigate these situations, sometimes offering explanations that are transparently insincere. Ross Douthat argues that Trump's willingness to contradict himself is part of his appeal, reassuring voters that extreme positions are provisional. The article also examines how different politicians are perceived when engaging in similar actions, highlighting the role of media coverage and party affiliation.</p>

The MIIT has vowed to increase governance over competition in the industry, while People’s Daily described the sector as being in a “sub-healthy” state due to shrinking profit margins and industrial overcapacity.

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply cut its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. due to the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The U.S. growth outlook was revised down to 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026, citing fallout from tariff policy, economic policy uncertainty, slower immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. Global growth is also expected to be lower, with the slowdown concentrated in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The OECD noted that higher trade costs will push up inflation, though this will be partially offset by weaker commodity prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation into the deaths of dozens of Palestinians near an aid distribution site in Gaza, prompting criticism from Israel. Guterres expressed his dismay at reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid, stating that it is unacceptable for them to risk their lives for food. Witnesses reported that Israeli forces fired on Palestinians waiting for aid, while the Israeli military claimed they fired on "suspects" who posed a threat. The Gaza Health Ministry reported that Israeli forces fired on civilians again in Rafah, killing at least 24 people.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. Lee, from the Democratic Party, holds a significant lead over Kim Moon Soo of the People's Power Party. The election was triggered by the impeachment and removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol. If elected, Lee is expected to pursue a more left-leaning agenda, focusing on economic revival and tariff negotiations with the U.S., with Goldman Sachs noting differences in their economic policy platforms.

          <p>India's heavy industries minister has stated that Tesla is "not interested in manufacturing in India," despite the country's efforts to attract investment from global EV giants. This is the first public admission that India has been unable to lure Tesla, even after offering incentives for EV manufacturing. Minister HD Kumaraswamy confirmed that Tesla would open two showrooms in India and have a retail presence, but analysts suggest the Indian EV market may not be mature enough for local investment. Tesla's sales have also faced challenges due to growing competition and backlash against Elon Musk.</p>
