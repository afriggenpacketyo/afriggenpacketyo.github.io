          <p>A gunman opened fire in the parking area of the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada, resulting in three fatalities and three injuries. The 26-year-old suspect, who had no known connection to the victims, fired approximately 80 rounds from a legally purchased handgun before being shot by police and hospitalized in critical condition. Authorities have identified the victims and are investigating the motive behind the seemingly random attack, which has been condemned by local officials as part of the nation's gun violence epidemic. The resort praised its security team and first responders for their swift actions during the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Google has effectively transformed billions of Android phones into the world's largest earthquake detection network by utilizing their built-in accelerometers. These sensors can detect the initial, subtle P-waves of an earthquake, allowing the system to send alerts to users seconds before the more destructive S-waves arrive. This technology, which has detected over 11,000 earthquakes since 2021, provides a crucial window of time for people to seek safety. While this feature is integrated into Android's "Safety & emergency" settings, iPhone users can access similar alerts through third-party apps like MyShake.</p>

          <p>A 56-year-old man in Worcester, UK, has chosen to stop taking life-saving kidney medication due to his profound exhaustion and frustration with the National Health Service. After being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition that left him bed-bound, he faced years of delays, incorrect referrals, and a failure to provide appropriate equipment for his 6'10" frame. Feeling abandoned by a system he describes as lacking "joined-up thinking," he decided ending his life was a better option than continuing to suffer without adequate support. His case highlights broader systemic issues within the NHS that affect many patients with serious disabilities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Emil Bove, a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a near party-line vote. The confirmation proceeded despite serious allegations from multiple whistleblowers, who claimed Bove instructed Justice Department lawyers to defy court orders and mislead judges. Democrats strongly opposed the nomination, citing these claims and his alleged role in politically motivated actions at the DOJ, calling him a "January 6th sympathizer." Republicans defended the nominee, dismissing the late-breaking accusations as politically motivated smears similar to those against previous conservative judicial nominees.</p>

          <p>Singapore's central bank has maintained its current monetary policy, opting not to adjust its exchange-rate-based strategy, but has signaled caution for the remainder of the year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore projects that economic growth will moderate in the second half of 2025, pulling back from the strong pace seen earlier, particularly in trade-related sectors. This outlook is clouded by significant uncertainty, especially regarding potential changes in global tariffs under the Trump administration, which could impact the nation's heavily export-dependent economy. The decision follows strong GDP performance in the first half but reflects growing concerns about external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a nearly $6.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor. The lawsuit alleged that the university permitted an antisemitic and hostile environment during pro-Palestinian campus protests, where Jewish students were allegedly blocked from parts of the campus and threatened. As part of the settlement, which followed a Department of Justice finding that UCLA violated civil rights laws, the university will fund Jewish community groups and antisemitism-fighting initiatives.

          <p>A zoo in Nuremberg, Germany, has sparked outrage and protests after culling 12 healthy Guinea baboons, citing overcrowding in their enclosure as the primary reason. The zoo stated that conflicts within the baboon population had increased and that attempts to re-home the animals or use contraception had failed, leaving them with no other option. The culled animals were subsequently fed to the zoo's predators. Animal rights activists, some of whom were arrested after entering the zoo in protest, have condemned the decision as illegal and irresponsible, filing a criminal complaint and arguing that the zoo's own breeding policies created the problem.</p>

This technique, originally developed by the military, cools patients three to five times faster than traditional methods, critically reducing the risk of brain damage and organ failure.

          <p>For the first time in five years, the Los Angeles Zoo is now home to Tasmanian devils, welcoming two males named Danny Zuko and Crush. The animals arrived from a conservation organization in Australia and are now on view at the Animals of Australia exhibit. Tasmanian devils, indigenous only to the island of Tasmania, are the world's largest carnivorous marsupials and are known for their powerful bite. The species is currently classified as endangered due to threats from a contagious cancer called Devil Facial Tumor Disease, as well as conflicts with humans and other predators, making their presence at the zoo important for conservation awareness.</p>

          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy who recently died from a rare brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, are speaking out to raise awareness of the risks. They stated that had they known about the dangers of swimming in freshwater lakes like Lake Murray in South Carolina, they would not have let their son get in the water. The infection, primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), occurs when contaminated water is forced up the nose. The family hopes that sharing their tragic story will prevent similar deaths in the future by educating the public on precautions, such as holding one's nose or using nose clips when in freshwater.</p>

While the county sheriff's department already has identification policies, the new rule is aimed squarely at federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The county anticipates a legal challenge from the federal government based on the Constitution's supremacy clause but has signaled its readiness for a court battle.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed repealing its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. This move threatens to dismantle federal climate regulations for vehicles and power plants, but it could also empower states like California to strengthen their own rules. California has a long history of pioneering environmental regulations that predate federal actions, and its authority is rooted in state law. Legal experts suggest that by ceding federal authority, the Trump administration might unintentionally open the door for California to legally pursue its own aggressive climate agenda, though the outcome would undoubtedly face litigation.</p>

The central bank is considering moving away from featuring historical figures to new themes like nature, innovation, or key historical events. Suggestions have included everything from the Angel of the North sculpture to dolphins and the famous Sycamore Gap tree. The high level of engagement, particularly from young people who increasingly use cashless payments, demonstrates the cultural significance of banknotes as a symbol of national identity and celebration.

          <p>The UK government has pledged to build up to 40,000 new homes over the next decade on disused railway land as part of its "brownfield first" development strategy. The £1 billion plan aims to transform former goods yards and industrial sites into vibrant communities, with initial projects slated for Manchester, Newcastle, and Cambridge. A new development company, Platform4, will be created to streamline the process. However, critics note that the target is a small fraction of the government's overall housing promise and that the construction industry already faces significant hurdles, including planning delays and regulatory backlogs that are holding up tens of thousands of homes.</p>

Talks broke down acrimoniously, with both sides exchanging sharp criticisms.

          <p>Atmospheric scientists are warning that air travel is set to become bumpier, as climate change is causing an increase in both the frequency and intensity of severe turbulence. A warmer atmosphere creates more intense thunderstorms and strengthens the jet stream, leading to more "clear-air turbulence," which is invisible and can strike without warning. Research indicates a 55% increase in severe turbulence over the North Atlantic in the last 40 years, with projections for a doubling or tripling globally in the coming decades. While aircraft are built to withstand these forces, the trend could lead to more injuries, higher costs for airlines, and increased anxiety for passengers.</p>
