          <p>President Trump addressed the nation from the White House, declaring the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites a "spectacular military success." He warned Iran of potentially "far greater" attacks if they do not pursue peace. Trump stated the targeted sites, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, were "completely and totally obliterated." The objective of the strikes was to eliminate the nuclear threat posed by Iran, which he considers the world's primary state sponsor of terror, and he thanked U.S. service members and the Israeli military for their support. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes, but stated it would not halt their nuclear program. The international community was called upon to condemn the attacks, and Iran threatened retaliation, prompting Trump to warn of even greater force in response. </p>

          <p>Decades after leaving high school to serve in the Vietnam War, several veterans in Muscatine, Iowa, received their high school diplomas.

Snyder and fellow veteran Richard Hill joined the Muscatine High class of 2025, receiving enthusiastic support from the graduating students. The recognition came through Operation Recognition, an Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs program that has enabled over 100 veterans to graduate, and Snyder shared the honor with fallen high school friends who never returned from the war. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast using mathematical analysis, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state.

This model aligns with the "four symbols" theory, emphasizing balance between yin and yang for health and harmony. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iran marks a significant U.S. involvement in a Middle Eastern conflict, despite his promises to avoid such engagements. Possible outcomes range from a humbling end to Iran's nuclear ambitions and the fall of the mullahs, to Iran retaliating against U.S. targets and closing the Strait of Hormuz. A mixed outcome is most likely, with Iran's nuclear program delayed but continuing, and regional instability increasing. The success of the strikes depends on accurate intelligence and competent leadership, given the unqualified appointees in key national security positions. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Iran and Israel marks a dramatic shift from his promise to be a "peacemaker." This action could lead to greater warfare in the Middle East, with the U.S. as an active participant. UN Secretary-General Guterres warned of a potential "spiral of chaos" resulting from the escalation. Trump's ultimatum to Iran had made it difficult to back down, and the situation could quickly escalate beyond control. </p>

          <p>President Trump ordered a U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities just two days after suggesting a two-week window for diplomacy. On Thursday, Trump said he would decide "within the next two weeks" whether to strike Iran, seemingly to allow for negotiations. However, on Friday, he stated it was to give the Iranians time to "come to their senses," and dismissed talks between European diplomats and Iran. This action contradicted his stated intent, showcasing distrust for his intelligence community and sparking concerns over escalating conflict. </p>

New testing of evidence, prompted by Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies and foreign DNA.

Despite this, the DA's office initially sought to retry her, but later dismissed the charges, and Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women. </p>

Fordo's depth below the Earth's surface has made it difficult to reach with Israel's weaponry, and only the U.S. was considered to have a "bunker buster" bomb strong and large enough to destroy Fordo. </p>
