          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses operating in China are reporting increased difficulties due to regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. The British Chamber of Commerce in China is advocating for a more favorable policy environment characterized by clear, fairly enforced, and consistently applied rules. Despite these challenges, British firms are maintaining a substantial engagement with the Chinese market, although confidence in China's long-term outlook has declined. Escalating tensions between China and the U.S. are causing delays in investments, both in China and globally, for firms with exposure to the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he had never purchased rice due to receiving it from supporters, a remark perceived as insensitive amid a national rice shortage. The comment highlighted the government's struggle to resolve the rice shortage, which has significantly increased prices for Japanese households. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister in an attempt to mitigate the political fallout. The shortage has been attributed to long-standing policies protecting small farmers, hindering new entrants and leaving agricultural land uncultivated.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall “mega tsunami” could potentially devastate America's West Coast if a strong earthquake strikes the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially wiping out cities like Seattle and Portland and causing coastal land to sink. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake and subsequent tsunami would occur rapidly, leaving little time for adaptation or mitigation. Alaska and Hawaii are also vulnerable due to their seismic and volcanic profiles.</p>

          <p>The personal secretary and an adviser to Mexico City's mayor, Clara Brugada, were shot dead in what authorities describe as the worst attack against public officials in the capital in recent years. The victims, Ximena Guzmán and José Muñoz, were killed while in a vehicle on a busy thoroughfare. Mayor Brugada vowed to continue her administration's fight against insecurity, while President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the killings and promised there would be no impunity. Security analysts suspect the attack was intended to put pressure on Brugada's administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that high-dose radiotherapy, commonly used to target and destroy cancer cells, may paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre discovered that high doses of radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even those not directly exposed to the radiation therapy. The research suggests that while radiation therapy can control localized cancer tumors, it may have unintended consequences by promoting the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.</p>

          <p>Satellite analysis indicates that the world's tropical forests disappeared faster than ever recorded last year, with fires overtaking land clearances from agriculture as the main cause. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of pristine, old-growth forests were lost in 2024, an area nearly as large as the Republic of Ireland. The Amazon region was particularly affected due to record drought conditions, raising concerns about the resilience of these forests on a warming planet. While South East Asia showed progress in reducing forest loss through government policies, the overall global trend highlights the intensifying climate change feedback loop.</p>

While surveys show a gender gap in support of far-right parties, young women stand out as more politically interesting due to their increasing turn towards the left. Research indicates that young people hold more progressive values, and the gender gap is driven by a sharp leftward shift among young women.
