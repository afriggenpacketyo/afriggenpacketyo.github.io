          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew for downtown L.A. from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. to address vandalism and looting during ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew zone covers one square mile, bounded by major freeways, with exemptions for residents, workers, and credentialed media. Protests erupted following immigration raids in the Westlake District, leading to nearly 200 arrests and looting of 23 businesses. President Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines in response, escalating tensions and drawing criticism from Governor Newsom, who deemed the action illegal and immoral. The situation is tense, with ongoing legal and political ramifications.</p>

          <p>A UN panel is calling on the UK to renegotiate its agreement with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, arguing that the current deal does not adequately protect the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal returns sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius but allows the UK to maintain a military base on Diego Garcia. The panel asserts that preventing Chagossians from returning to Diego Garcia infringes on their right to access their ancestral lands. The UK Foreign Office maintains that the deal has been welcomed by international organizations, including the UN Secretary-General.</p>

Oral arguments are scheduled for July 31, suggesting the tariffs will stay in place unless further court action occurs. The U.S. Court of International Trade previously deemed many of Trump's tariffs illegal, including those on various trading partners and specific tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China.

          <p>President Trump's speech at Fort Bragg, where he mocked political rivals and encouraged military personnel to jeer at the press, has drawn criticism for violating military traditions. The article questions the silence of senior military officers, including General Randy George and General Dan Caine, in the face of Trump's behavior. It argues that senior officers have an obligation to defend the military's integrity and uphold its values against what it sees as Trump's assault on those principles. The author contends that Trump is using the military for his own narcissistic purposes and that the officers' silence is a failure of leadership.</p>
