          <p>Thames Water is facing a record fine for regulatory breaches related to numerous sewage spills, drawing criticism and prompting concerns about the company's financial stability. The Daily Star humorously refers to the company as "Britain's biggest sewer rats," highlighting the public's frustration with the environmental damage caused by the spills. Separately, Christine Lagarde is reportedly considering leaving her position at the European Central Bank to chair the World Economic Forum, a move that could trigger a succession race within the EU's monetary authority. In other news, veterans' memorial trips are secured with funding, and Rose West is reportedly in her last days in prison.</p>

This decision is a potentially serious blow to the president's economic agenda and ongoing efforts to negotiate trade deals. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling.

Deonte Nash, a friend of Cassie Ventura, testified that he witnessed Combs physically and verbally abuse Ventura, and that she did not want to participate in Combs' sex orgies.

          <p>CBS has secured a legal victory allowing it to continue distributing Sony's 'Wheel of Fortune' and 'Jeopardy!' while its legal battle with Sony Pictures Television continues. A Los Angeles judge initially ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, but an appellate panel has paused that order pending the appeal. CBS argues that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, while Sony claims CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals and underfunded the shows. These game shows remain highly successful despite the decline in traditional TV viewing.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 for leading a criminal enterprise while in prison. While his attorneys are thrilled, prosecutors expressed disappointment, emphasizing Hoover's role in a large-scale drug operation. Former Gangster Disciples enforcer Wallace "Gator" Bradley supports Hoover's release, while prosecutor Ron Safer believes Hoover's crimes were too heinous for such leniency.</p>
