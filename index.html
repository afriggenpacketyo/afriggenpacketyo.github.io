          <h2>Japan's Industrial Output Declines in Fiscal Year 2024</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 19:53:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's industrial output experienced a decrease of 1.6% in fiscal year 2024, according to recent reports. This downturn reflects ongoing challenges in the Japanese economy, possibly influenced by global economic trends and domestic factors such as changing consumer demand. The decline may prompt government and business leaders to consider measures to stimulate industrial growth and maintain competitiveness in international markets. It remains to be seen how this will affect Japan's overall economic strategy in the coming years, particularly in relation to trade and investment policies. The decrease in industrial output raises concerns about the sustainability of Japan's economic recovery efforts. </p>

The companies aim to leverage Waymo's autonomous technology and Toyota's vehicle expertise to accelerate the development of advanced driver assistance systems. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana suggested this partnership could also lead to incorporating Toyota vehicles into Waymo's ride-hailing fleet.

          <p>Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Trump, has faced lawsuits and criticism for his aggressive cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions. Musk promised $2 trillion in savings but has so far achieved far less, with DOGE citing $160 billion in savings through cancelled contracts and asset sales, figures that have been disputed. DOGE's efforts to cut the federal workforce have also been controversial, with estimates suggesting they could cost $135 billion due to paid leave and productivity losses. Despite the controversies, the White House defends DOGE's goals and achievements, asserting that mistakes are rare and corrected immediately. </p>

          <p>A Bell County, Texas jury found Caysen Allison not guilty of murder but guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the 2022 stabbing death of Joe Ramirez Jr. at Belton High School.

Evidence presented included text messages where Allison asked a friend for a gun and testimony about threats Allison made against Ramirez before the stabbing. Allison was released under bond conditions and awaits sentencing in June, facing up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has temporarily suspended Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan after she was charged with obstructing and impeding a federal proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent arrest. The charges stem from an incident where Dugan allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Dugan appeared in court but did not enter a plea and was released on her own recognizance. A reserve judge is covering Dugan's cases during her suspension, and if convicted, Dugan could face up to six years in prison.</p>

          <p>Two dozen states have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over significant cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging the administration is attempting to dismantle the volunteer service organization. The lawsuit argues the cuts, linked to President Trump's cost-cutting efforts led by the Department of Government Efficiency, violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers. AmeriCorps has allegedly put 85% of its staff on administrative leave and slashed its National Civilian Community Corps. The White House claims AmeriCorps has failed audits and made improper payments. </p>

          <p>Mexico’s top prosecutor stated that the Izaguirre ranch in Teuchitlán, initially suspected as an “extermination camp” by groups searching for missing relatives, was actually used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel for training and recruitment. Attorney General Alejandro Gertz clarified that there is no evidence of human cremations at the site, despite earlier comments suggesting otherwise. Search groups, however, maintain their belief that the ranch was used for exterminations based on their findings, accusing officials of attempting to alter the narrative. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are exploring other potential “narco-ranches” in the area.</p>

The FDA's Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, emphasized the need for data to inform recommendations, as many healthcare workers did not receive the last round of booster shots.

          <p>A Venezuelan family is seeking the return of their 2-year-old daughter after U.S. authorities deported the mother to Venezuela and the father to a prison in El Salvador. The toddler, Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal, remains in foster care in the United States, with officials claiming her parents are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, a claim the family denies. The Trump administration has been deporting Venezuelans accused of gang membership, leading to family separations and legal challenges. The child's grandmother is calling for her release and reunification with her parents.</p>

The judge ordered the administration to pay $12 million for its April funding, rejecting the administration's attempts to withhold the money while negotiating new terms of the grant agreement. The Trump administration had terminated the grant in March, but the judge temporarily blocked the termination, stating that Trump cannot unilaterally shut down an organization funded by Congress.</p>

Energy companies are struggling to replace all RTS meters with smart meters before the technology is switched off on June 30. Campaigners estimate more than 300,000 homes could lose heating, particularly vulnerable households. One challenge is the distrust of smart meters, with some customers preferring to remain on their existing Economy 7 tariff.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders walking back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors, and others complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing. The changes modify tariffs so carmakers paying a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components. Despite these concessions, a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles remains in place, raising prices for new and used cars.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that human wounds take more than twice as long to heal compared to other mammals like chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice. The slower healing rate is possibly linked to the evolutionary trade-off where humans shed fur in favor of sweat glands for cooling. Hair follicles, which contain stem cells that aid in skin repair, are more abundant in furry animals, allowing for faster healing. The loss of fur and the increase in sweat glands in humans may have prioritized cooling and other abilities over efficient wound repair.</p>
