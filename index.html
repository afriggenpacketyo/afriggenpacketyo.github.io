          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left one critically injured. Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and rescued numerous people from windows using ladders, with officials praising the heroic efforts of first responders for preventing an even greater loss of life. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and authorities are examining the functionality of the building's sprinkler and alarm systems. The incident has been described as an "unfathomable tragedy" for the community, with support being offered to the families of the victims and the displaced residents.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) for a $5,000 investment. Unusually, short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields (APYs) due to banks hedging against potential future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, calculations show that long-term CDs, despite lower rates, generate substantially greater total returns over their extended terms due to the power of compounding. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals, balancing the higher immediate rates and flexibility of short-term CDs against the larger overall earnings from long-term options.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 12:17:15 EDT</div>

          <p>A London jury has found British aristocrat Constance Marten and her partner, Mark Gordon, guilty of manslaughter in the death of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple went on the run for seven weeks to avoid having their baby taken into care, living in a tent during freezing temperatures. The infant's body was later found in a shopping bag. The trial revealed Gordon's prior conviction for sexual assault and battery in the United States, which was a factor in the couple's fear of authorities. Marten claimed the death was an accident, but prosecutors argued their selfish and reckless actions led to the tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>Former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's legacy is being remembered as a complex mix of achievements and significant failures following his death. Supporters praise his anti-corruption stance and efforts to instill integrity, viewing him as a leader who tried to unite the nation. However, critics point to his autocratic tendencies, disregard for the rule of law, and a presidency marked by economic mismanagement and a violent crackdown on protests like the #EndSARS movement. His tenure, which began with his 2015 democratic election after a past as a military ruler, ultimately leaves behind a deeply debated impact on Nigeria's political and social landscape.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans for a massive investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure, with the company's first AI data supercluster, named Prometheus, set to come online in 2026. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to build several multi-gigawatt clusters to train advanced AI models and attract top research talent. The move follows Zuckerberg's expressed frustration with Meta's progress in AI, particularly after the lukewarm reception of its Llama 4 models. By creating Meta Superintelligence Labs and committing billions to compute power, the company aims to aggressively compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race to develop leading AI technology.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire burning at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire, fueled by strong winds, grew rapidly and exhibited extreme behavior, leading to the loss of National Park Service administrative buildings and visitor facilities. A water treatment facility was also destroyed, causing a chlorine gas leak that temporarily forced firefighters to evacuate. The North Rim, which receives a smaller fraction of the park's visitors, is largely closed, and officials are now facing questions about the initial "confine and contain" strategy used to manage the lightning-caused blaze.</p>

          <h2>Arizona Health Officials Confirm Death from Pneumonic Plague</h2>

          <p>A resident of Coconino County, Arizona, has died from pneumonic plague, a rare and severe lung infection caused by the same bacterium as bubonic plague. This marks the first such death in the county since 2007. Unlike bubonic plague, the pneumonic form can be spread between people through airborne droplets, though officials state the risk of human-to-human transmission is low. The death comes as authorities investigate a separate die-off of prairie dogs in the area, which may also be plague-related, though the two events are not believed to be connected. Health officials have issued guidelines for avoiding contact with wild rodents and their fleas.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of female senators is promoting the "She Drives Act" to address the higher rate of injury and death for women in car crashes. The legislation would require the use of more advanced crash test dummies that better represent the female population, as current tests primarily use a dummy based on an average-sized male from the 1990s. Data shows women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured in a crash. Proponents argue that female-simulating dummies, which are already used internationally, would provide crucial data to design safer vehicles for everyone, while the Department of Transportation has committed to accelerating the process.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is confronting a period of significant political turmoil, undermining his government's desired image of renewal. A key flashpoint was the recent failure to elect new judges to the Constitutional Court, a move that exposed deep divisions within his conservative bloc and drew a rare warning from Germany's president about endangering the rule of law. This internal strife, coupled with looming challenges like major social security reforms and the economic threat of new U.S. tariffs on the EU, has placed Merz in a crisis mode as the parliament heads into its two-month summer recess, with questions lingering about his leadership and coalition stability.</p>

          <p>China's global exports saw an acceleration in June, climbing 5.8% from the previous year, partly due to a rush of orders before a potential reinstatement of U.S. tariffs. However, trade data for the first half of the year reveals the impact of the ongoing trade war, with exports to the United States falling by 16%. Despite this bilateral decline, China's overall trade has remained resilient by diversifying its markets, with significant growth in exports to Southeast Asia and Europe. The data reflects a complex global trade environment where Chinese businesses are adapting to geopolitical tensions, though analysts expect export growth to slow in the coming quarters.

          <p>The process of appointing judges to Germany's highest court, the Constitutional Court, has become highly politicized, leading to a parliamentary impasse. A planned vote for three new judges was abruptly postponed after it became clear that a candidate nominated by the Social Democrats, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, lacked sufficient support from within the governing conservative CDU party. The opposition to her nomination stems from her liberal stance on abortion and has been fueled by the far-right AfD. This breakdown of the traditionally cooperative process has been called a "bad day for democracy" and has exposed deep rifts within the ruling coalition.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates later this year, financial experts are advising savers on how to choose the best certificate of deposit (CD) term. Some experts suggest that short-term CDs remain attractive, as banks are offering competitive rates to attract deposits while anticipating future rate drops. Others argue for locking in today's high yields with a longer-term CD before rates potentially fall. For those uncertain, a CD ladder strategy, which involves spreading deposits across multiple terms, is recommended to balance long-term yields with regular access to funds as they mature.

The company believes this technology will make electric vehicles more affordable and accessible. Production of the new LFP cells is slated to begin by late 2027, complementing the high-nickel batteries GM currently produces for its lineup.</p>

The article argues that Donald Trump's central presence during the trophy presentation, where he was quickly joined by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, hijacked the celebration from the victorious Chelsea players. This act of "shameless grandstanding" is presented as a fittingly grim coda to a flawed tournament, raising questions about FIFA's alliance with political figures. While Chelsea's tactical victory over PSG was impressive, the event's legacy may be defined by the uncomfortable fusion of sport and political spectacle.</p>
