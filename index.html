            <p>Authorities in Washington state discovered the body of Marcia Norman, an 82-year-old grandmother, buried under a shed and partially encased in concrete after she was reported missing on April 4th. Detectives identified Jeffrey Zizz, Norman's handyman, as a person of interest, noting he had dinner with her the night she disappeared. Zizz allegedly fled the state, violating sentence conditions for a previous child molestation conviction, before being apprehended in Montana and extradited to Washington. He remains the primary person of interest in the ongoing investigation but has not yet been charged in Norman's disappearance. </p>

            <p>Japan reported a modest 3.9% rise in March exports, falling short of expectations as U.S. tariffs begin to impact trade. While exports to the Middle East saw a significant increase, growth to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, was more subdued. The data precedes the full impact of recently imposed U.S. tariffs on auto imports, steel, and aluminum. These developments occur against the backdrop of ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S., where discussions include tariffs, military support costs, and trade fairness.

            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced its intent to appeal a federal judge's order requiring the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador. Simultaneously, the DOJ released documents allegedly linking Abrego Garcia to the MS-13 gang, basing the claims on clothing and a confidential informant. Abrego Garcia was deported despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, and his attorneys deny his gang affiliation, questioning the validity of the government's evidence. This comes after a judge ordered government officials to testify under oath regarding their efforts to aid Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs, arguing that such actions require Congressional approval. The lawsuit will contend that the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China is unlawful. California, with the largest state economy, anticipates significant economic damage from the tariffs and seeks an immediate block on their implementation. This legal action marks the first instance of a U.S. state suing the Trump administration over tariff policies.</p>

The Supreme Court has ordered the US government to facilitate Garcia's return, but the White House resists, alleging he is a member of MS-13 without due process.

The initiative aims to help two million people receive faster and more convenient care within their local communities by the end of 2025/26. GPs will collaborate more closely with specialists to access expert advice for patients with various conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome and menopause symptoms. This expansion is part of the government's plan to cut long NHS waiting lists and create extra appointments for patients.</p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for allegedly defying an order to return migrants en route to a prison in El Salvador. Boasberg accused the administration of "willful disregard" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. He warned that he could recommend criminal charges and appoint a private attorney to prosecute the case if the administration does not comply. The Justice Department is unlikely to pursue charges against its own officials, raising the possibility of a constitutional crisis.</p>

            <p>Faced with the impact of U.S. tariffs, China is encouraging domestic consumption to offset lost export revenue, targeting retirees with savings. Initiatives like the "silver train" are designed to boost local economies in underdeveloped rural areas by providing older travelers with convenient and accessible travel options. These special trains offer comfortable travel, medical support, and opportunities to visit tourist attractions and traditional villages, encouraging retirees to spend their savings for the good of the country.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that 1 in 31 children, or over 3%, have been identified with autism, prompting discussion about the causes and implications of the rising rates. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited the figures as evidence of an autism "epidemic," a claim criticized by experts. The CDC report also noted that autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children. Experts suggest improved screening, access to services, and an expanding definition of autism may contribute to the increase.</p>

            <p>The White House has reiterated its refusal to return Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite a court order. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Ábrego García of being an MS-13 gang member and a "woman beater," claims disputed by his lawyer and family. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele also stated he would not allow Ábrego García's return. Meanwhile, Senator Chris Van Hollen was denied access to speak with Ábrego García in El Salvador, further complicating the situation.</p>

            <p>After British actress Aimee Lou Wood called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth "mean and unfunny," impressionists have told BBC News how they tread the line between being funny and offensive. Titled The White Potus - a spin on hit HBO dark comedy The White Lotus - an SNL sketch depicted US president Donald Trump, his family and top team spending time at a fictional tropical hotel. The first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was "not reading the room", it was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking "those all-American, fake-looking teeth".</p>

            <p>In hopes of putting an end to street takeovers that often result in damaged vehicles and injuries, Los Angeles County officials have taken the first step toward dramatically increasing penalties for anyone participating in the illegal events, including spectators. In an effort to combat the events in her communities and in other areas of the county, Los Angeles County Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell proposed a measure to double the misdemeanor fines from $500 to $1,000 on those who participate in street takeovers. The motion clarifies that the fines can be issued against those who organize, participate in and watch the events.</p>

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding that President Donald Trump's administration return a man who it has acknowledged was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison. Last month, the Trump administration sent Kilmar Ábrego García to a facility in the Central American country along with more than 200 Venezuelans and Salvadorans, many of whom officials have claimed are gang members. The Supreme Court last week partially backed Judge Paula Xinis's order requiring officials to "facilitate" the Salvadoran national's release, after the government conceded his deportation was an "administrative error".</p>
