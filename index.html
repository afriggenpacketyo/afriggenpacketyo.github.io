        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Honda Motor Co. reported a significant 76% drop in operating profit for the fourth quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations. The company anticipates further profit reductions due to potential U.S. tariffs on foreign automobile imports. In response to these trade tensions, Honda is reportedly shifting production of its next-generation Civic hybrid to the U.S. from Mexico. Amidst these challenges, earlier merger talks between Honda and Nissan, which could have created the world's third-largest automaker, were terminated in February.</p>

          <p>President Trump commenced a four-day tour of the Gulf states, starting in Saudi Arabia, with the goal of securing business deals worth over $1 trillion. The agreements are expected to encompass investments in artificial intelligence, energy, and significant arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is anticipated to spend considerable time with President Trump, potentially echoing the strategies used in 2017 to foster a positive relationship. The trip is under scrutiny due to the Trump family's pending deals with Saudi-owned firms, a UAE-affiliated cryptocurrency venture, and a Qatari-backed golf project.</p>

          <p>UK newspaper headlines are dominated by a terror probe into a fire at Prime Minister Keir Starmer's home and the government's new immigration policy. The Daily Telegraph leads with the terror probe, while the Daily Mirror describes the fire as a "mystery blaze". The Daily Express focuses on the immigration policy, questioning its effectiveness, while The Guardian reports backlash from MPs who say Starmer's comments echo far-right rhetoric. The Financial Times leads with the US and China agreeing to a ceasefire in their trade war.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan has revealed that approximately half of respondents believed at least one instance of false information on social media. The government is now emphasizing the importance of media literacy to combat the spread of fake news.
