          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, alleging that their "sanctuary" policies obstruct federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit claims that these policies, which limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities, interfere with the enforcement of federal immigration law and violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Local officials have responded by asserting their commitment to defending their values and following all applicable laws, while also criticizing the Trump administration's disregard for the truth. The lawsuit seeks a court ruling to invalidate the challenged state and city laws.</p>

          <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Organization (ITER) is showcasing fusion energy technology at the World Exposition in Osaka, marking its first independent participation in the event. ITER's exhibits explain the fusion energy process and the experimental reactor being constructed in France, with Japan highlighting its significant contributions to the project. Fusion energy, generated by merging light atomic nuclei, is viewed as a clean and byproduct-free energy source, though its practical realization is still decades away. The project involves collaboration between China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the United States, and the European Union, aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion energy.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media platforms during elections should be regulated by law. This sentiment arises from growing concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, highlighting the tension between freedom of expression and the need for accurate information. While Japan has enacted a law to facilitate the removal of defamatory content, its impact has been limited. The survey also reveals divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, and strong support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames and recognizing same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to reduce staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by 1,200 positions and other intelligence agencies by thousands, according to a report by the Washington Post. These cuts are expected to occur over several years, primarily through reduced hiring, with the CIA stating that the changes are part of a strategy to align the agency with President Trump's national security priorities. The CIA aims to infuse the agency with renewed energy and better position it to fulfill its mission. The administration has also eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at intelligence agencies, sparking legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has responded to President Trump's executive order to pull funding for NPR and PBS, asserting that Congress controls its funding, not the president. CPB President Patricia Harrison emphasized that the corporation is a private nonprofit, independent of the federal government, as authorized and funded by Congress. Trump's order aims to block federal funding to NPR and PBS and prevent indirect funding through local stations, alleging that the news organizations fuel partisanship. PBS President Paula Kerger warned that the loss of federal funding would disproportionately impact rural communities.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China faces significant challenges in becoming a credible mediator in the Middle East, particularly in engaging with Syria's new government. Despite China's support for the Syrian ruler, Bashar al-Assad, Beijing now faces a reputational crisis, especially among local authorities in Syria. The dilemma arises from having to deal with a new government that includes individuals identified as "terrorists" by the UN, presenting an uncomfortable situation for China's diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>China has passed a new law to bolster its private economy, set to take effect on May 20, which aims to provide legal recourse for private firms. Observers are closely monitoring how the Private Economy Promotion Law will impact the ability of firms to challenge local governments in court and protect themselves from arbitrary fines. The law includes provisions to curb administrative powers, potentially enabling entrepreneurs to litigate against local governments more effectively. It also forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous fine collections and asset seizures.</p>

The article illustrates the situation through the experience of a Shanghai resident who missed an opportunity to sell her property at a high price before the market cooled. Worries about an asset bubble led to market-cooling measures, followed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which plunged China's property prices into a severe slump.

The King's visit is scheduled to coincide with Carney's upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump, amid frayed ties between the two countries.</p>

Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients that Trump dislikes. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The order had suspended security clearances for the firm's employees and barred its attorneys from government buildings.</p>

Weinstein's initial conviction was overturned, prompting the retrial, where he faces similar charges.
