            <p>Former Tennessee Volunteers quarterback Nico Iamaleava is reportedly expected to transfer to UCLA following a dispute with Tennessee over NIL negotiations. The UCLA coaching staff has reportedly informed its current quarterbacks of Iamaleava's impending arrival. Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee was allegedly due to his desire for a larger NIL deal, reportedly seeking $4 million for the upcoming season, which Tennessee resisted. His move back to Southern California marks a significant upgrade for UCLA's quarterback position, though the financial details of his agreement with the Bruins remain undisclosed.</p>

            <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow left Sunday's game against the Texas Rangers after experiencing lower leg cramping. Despite the early exit, the Dodgers managed a 1-0 victory.

The Dodgers are hopeful that the issue is not serious, as Glasnow has a history of minor cramping incidents. The team is already dealing with injuries to other key players, making Glasnow's health a crucial factor for their season.</p>

            <p>The Texas House approved a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition. The bill, passed after nearly 11 hours of debate, establishes education savings accounts, or school vouchers, for students to attend private institutions. Students would receive $10,000 annually, with additional funds for disabled and home-schooled students. While supporters hail the bill as a victory for parental choice, Democrats criticize it as "welfare for the rich" and express concerns about its impact on public school funding.

The goal sparked wild celebrations and raised questions about Alexander-Arnold's future with the club. Speculation has increased following new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, with Real Madrid reportedly interested in the player. Alexander-Arnold remained guarded about his intentions, focusing on the special moments of winning games and titles with Liverpool. Liverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an overnight order temporarily blocking the removal of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) from Texas. Solicitor General John Sauer called the order "unprecedented" and argued that the detainee plaintiffs lack standing. Sauer urged the justices to limit the order to only pause AEA removals. The government has already paused their pending deportations and is allowing the legal process to play out.</p>
