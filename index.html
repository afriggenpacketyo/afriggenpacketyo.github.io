          <p>India is reportedly nearing a trade deal with the United States, which could involve New Delhi significantly cutting its oil purchases from Russia. As part of this agreement, Washington may slash tariffs on Indian exports from 50% to 15-16%. President Trump indicated that Prime Minister Modi assured him of reduced Russian oil imports, although Modi's public statements on X did not explicitly confirm this. The trade agreement, which also includes India potentially increasing US corn imports, is expected to be finalized at the upcoming ASEAN summit, despite some sensitive areas requiring political clearance.</p>

          <p>More than 800 influential figures, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, former US National Security Advisor Susan Rice, and AI "godfathers" Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton, have signed a statement urging a halt to the development of "superintelligence" AI. The signatories express concerns about potential risks such as human economic obsolescence, loss of freedoms, national security threats, and even human extinction. They advocate for a prohibition until broad scientific consensus and public buy-in ensure safe and controllable development.

          <p>Netflix is fully committing to leveraging generative artificial intelligence across its streaming platform, aiming to enhance recommendations, improve its advertising business, and streamline movie and TV content production. The company has already used AI tools in films like "Happy Gilmore 2" for de-aging characters and in pre-production for series such as "Billionaires' Bunker" for design. Despite broader entertainment industry concerns about AI replacing human jobs and using human-made content, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos stated that AI will help creators tell stories "better, faster, and in new ways" without replacing creativity.</p>

          <p>The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that Gaza faces a health "catastrophe" with generational consequences. Despite a recent US-brokered ceasefire, aid levels remain insufficient to rebuild the collapsed healthcare system and address widespread famine, injuries, and disease outbreaks. Dr. Tedros highlighted that essential medical supplies are being confiscated at the border, and medical evacuation flights are halted. He urged Israel to remove aid conditions and called on the US to ensure all parties respect the fragile peace deal, emphasizing that "peace is the best medicine."</p>

          <p>The Spanish soccer league, La Liga, has canceled its plans for a regular-season match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami this December. The decision follows increasing domestic opposition from players, clubs, and fans, who protested against the game. While the league expressed regret, citing a missed opportunity for international expansion, game promoter Relevent also noted insufficient time for execution. Real Madrid and its goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois were vocal critics, arguing such a match would compromise the fairness of the competition.</p>

          <p>Over 300 individuals have contacted the BBC with allegations of racism, misogyny, and bullying by police, following an undercover Panorama investigation. The investigation exposed evidence of officers revelling in force and being dismissive of victims, particularly in cases of domestic abuse and sexual assault. Some women reported that disclosing their sexual assault experiences to police felt like being sexually assaulted again, while others, including a Black woman, cited racial and misogynistic attitudes. Policing Minister Sarah Jones condemned the "sickening comments" and urged reporting, emphasizing new powers to dismiss officers for gross misconduct.</p>

          <p>Mosquitoes have been found in Iceland for the first time, a development linked to the country's unprecedented high temperatures this spring. Insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason discovered Culiseta annulata specimens, a species known for surviving winter, in a glacial valley near Reykjavik. Previously, Iceland was one of only two mosquito-free regions globally, largely due to its cold climate and lack of stagnant water. This year, however, Iceland experienced its hottest May on record, exceeding 20°C for ten consecutive days. Scientists are monitoring whether the species will establish itself, highlighting the significant impact of climate shifts on delicate ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has urged the Trump administration to pause the demolition of the White House East Wing until a review of President Trump's proposed ballroom plans is completed. The group, a non-profit chartered by Congress, fears the new 90,000-square-foot construction will "overwhelm the White House itself" and disrupt its classical design. Similar concerns regarding scale and architectural harmony have been raised by the Society of Architectural Historians and the American Institute of Architects. The White House, however, dismissed these concerns as "manufactured outrage" from "unhinged leftists," asserting the ballroom will enhance capacity for major functions.</p>

Auto shipments to the US were particularly hard hit. The article also notes the recent appointment of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female prime minister, whose policies are expected to weaken the yen and potentially benefit exporters, although policy factors like tariffs are deemed more impactful than currency fluctuations.

          <p>National Guard troops are expected to arrive in New Orleans by late November, according to Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, to assist with upcoming major events and address police understaffing. The deployment, requested by Governor Jeff Landry, will cover events like the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras. While acknowledging the National Guard as a "force multiplier" for safety, Kirkpatrick emphasized that they are partners, not replacements for local law enforcement, and should not be deployed for routine policing. The city's police department remains understaffed, needing approximately 300 more officers.</p>

          <p>Gold and silver prices saw their largest daily drops in years, halting a recent rally. Spot gold fell over 6% to just under $4,100 per troy ounce, while silver tumbled more than 8%. This decline is attributed to easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, a stronger US dollar, and technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions. Experts are debating whether this signals a necessary correction or a temporary dip, with some analysts remaining bullish on precious metals for the long term due to inflation and geopolitical concerns.

          <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has affirmed that the UK's national sexual assault gangs inquiry's focus will not be "watered down," despite resignations from three abuse survivors who feared its scope would broaden.

Mahmood insisted the inquiry would explicitly examine ethnicity and religion of offenders and that the door remains open for returning survivors.

          <p>Los Angeles communities are grappling with surging copper wire theft, which has plunged streetlights into darkness and caused significant financial and safety issues. The iconic Sixth Street Bridge, for instance, remains unlit due to $11,000 worth of stolen wire, requiring $2.5 million for repairs. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, targeting recyclers who buy stolen metal. The bill mandates stricter identity verification and lawful ownership proof for sellers, increases penalties for non-compliant recyclers, and criminalizes possession of certain stolen public infrastructure metals, aiming to deter thieves.</p>

This potential extension comes amid an ongoing lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia attorney general, alleging that federal officials are exercising pervasive control over state National Guard units, effectively operating them as a federal military police force.

          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy criticized the ongoing government shutdown, labeling it the "Seinfeld shutdown" because, in his view, it is "about nothing." He argued that Democrats are declining to pass a clean continuing resolution, instead demanding extensions for health insurance subsidies and rollbacks of Medicaid restrictions. McCarthy contrasted this with the 2013 shutdown, where Republicans pushed for policy changes. He asserted that Democrats are "trying to find a message" and are "fearful" of their rank-and-file members, contributing to the impasse in a more divided political landscape.</p>
