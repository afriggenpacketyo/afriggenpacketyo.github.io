In response, President Trump lauded the "special relationship" between the two nations, stating the term doesn't fully capture its strength. The event, part of Trump's historic second state visit, aimed to reinforce diplomatic, cultural, and economic links, attended by political figures and tech industry leaders. The day included traditional royal pageantry, a private meeting with the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the exchange of official gifts.</p>

          <p>The University of Colorado's football team, led by coach Deion Sanders, is struggling to find a stable starting quarterback after the departure of his son, Shedeur Sanders, to the NFL. The team, currently 1-2, has cycled through multiple quarterbacks, recently renaming Kaidon Salter as the starter after benching him for Ryan Staub. This marks the first time in his coaching career that Sanders does not have his son as his dependable quarterback, a dynamic that previously spanned from high school through Jackson State. The team's current instability at the key position highlights a new challenge for the high-profile coach.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is actively reviewing social media posts from U.S. service members regarding the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth calling any celebratory or mocking comments "completely unacceptable." Several Army and Marine officers have already been suspended or removed from duties pending investigation into their online remarks. While civilian employees have broad free speech rights, uniformed personnel are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which prohibits conduct that discredits the armed forces. Legal experts note that prosecution under the UCMJ could be challenging, but non-judicial disciplinary actions remain a possibility.</p>

          <p>A man identified as Donald Henson is in federal custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's field office in Pittsburgh in what authorities initially termed a "targeted attack." The incident occurred early Wednesday, after which the suspect reportedly exited the vehicle, threw an American flag over the gate, and fled on foot before being apprehended. No injuries were reported, and a bomb squad was called to clear the vehicle. The FBI noted that Henson had recently visited the office to make a complaint and is believed to have a history of mental health issues.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive BBC interview, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva declared that he has "no relationship" with his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, citing a breakdown in communication. Lula criticized Trump's recent imposition of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as "eminently political," asserting that American consumers will ultimately bear the cost. He contrasted this lack of dialogue with his historically positive relationships with other world leaders. The Brazilian president also commented on the recent conviction of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, and advocated for reforms to the United Nations Security Council to create a more democratic global governance structure.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is meeting under intense scrutiny following a complete overhaul of its membership by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The new panel, which includes figures known for questioning vaccine safety, is expected to vote on recommendations for COVID, hepatitis B, and MMRV vaccines. Former top CDC officials have testified that they were pressured to pre-approve policies without scientific review, raising fears that political ideology is overriding evidence-based public health. The committee's decisions could significantly impact public trust, vaccine access through federal programs, and the nation's overall vaccination strategy.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has become the first U.S. senator to label Israel's military actions in Gaza as genocide, calling the conclusion "inescapable." In a statement, Sanders argued that Israel has waged an "all-out war against the entire Palestinian people," citing high civilian casualty figures and statements from Israeli officials as evidence of intent. This marks a significant shift for the senator, who had previously avoided using the term. Aligning with a recent UN commission's findings, Sanders called for an end to U.S. complicity, demanding an immediate ceasefire and a halt to military aid to Israel's government.</p>

Similarly, the Princess of Wales wore a striking gold couture gown and the historic Lover's Knot Tiara, while Queen Camilla's sapphire blue dress coordinated with King Charles's attire.

          <p>With confidence in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declining across the political spectrum, public health experts are pointing Americans toward other institutions for reliable health guidance. The recent overhaul of the CDC's leadership and vaccine advisory panel under HHS Secretary Robert F.

Experts recommend turning to professional medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and academic institutions for evidence-based information.

          <p>Florida executed David Pittman, 63, for the 1990 murders of his estranged wife's parents and sister, marking the state's 12th execution in 2025. This sets a modern record for the most executions in Florida in a single year, all carried out under death warrants signed by Governor Ron DeSantis. Pittman was convicted of stabbing the three victims and setting their house on fire. His final appeals, which focused on claims of intellectual disability, were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. In his last words, Pittman maintained his innocence before being pronounced dead following a lethal injection.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Recent GOP Tax Bills Create Complex Loopholes Benefiting Specific Worker Groups</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 16:23:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis of recent Republican tax legislation, including the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," argues that the tax code is being reshaped to favor specific groups at both high and low income levels, potentially leaving salaried, middle-class professionals to bear a larger burden. The laws create numerous carve-outs, such as deductions for pass-through business income for the wealthy and tax-free tips for service workers, which encourages structuring income to avoid taxation. This approach contrasts with past GOP efforts at tax simplification, instead creating a more complex and less equitable system where families with similar incomes can face vastly different tax liabilities.

          <h2>Federal Reserve Enacts Quarter-Point Interest Rate Cut Amid Slowing Labor Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 16:20:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 4% to 4.25%, the first reduction since December 2024. The move is a response to a cooling U.S. labor market and slower economic growth, signaling that supporting employment has become a more pressing concern than inflation. Projections from Fed officials indicate two more cuts may occur in 2025, though opinions within the committee are divided. The decision was made with one dissenting vote from new governor Stephen Miran, who favored a larger half-point cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers edge rusher Khalil Mack is expected to miss four weeks after being diagnosed with a dislocated elbow, an injury sustained during a game against the Raiders. While a significant blow to the team's defense, the diagnosis was a relief compared to fears of a season-ending injury. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Mack's toughness following the incident. In his absence, the defense will rely on players like Tuli Tuipulotu and Bud Dupree to step into larger roles, with the team also considering acquiring outside help to bolster the position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that taking a form of Vitamin B3, known as nicotinamide, is linked to a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancers. The research, published in JAMA Dermatology, found the most significant benefit among individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis. This group saw a 54% lower risk of developing another skin cancer compared to those who did not take it. The findings provide stronger evidence for a practice already common among dermatologists and may lead to more rigorous recommendations for its use as a preventive measure.</p>

          <p>A dive team has successfully identified a shipwreck discovered 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing vessel that sank nearly a century ago. The ship was last seen in January 1929 and was lost in a storm with 21 crew members aboard. The salvage company located the wreck site in 2022 and confirmed its identity during dives this past July, matching distinctive features like its winch and steam engine. The discovery provides historical closure regarding the long-lost vessel and the fate of its crew.</p>
