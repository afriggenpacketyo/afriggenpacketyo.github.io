          <p>A 17-year veteran public affairs specialist at the Justice Department, Patty Hartman, has been fired, marking the fourth termination of an official connected to the January 6th Capitol riot prosecutions. Hartman warns that the traditional separation between the White House and the DOJ has disappeared, creating a politicized environment. She characterizes her dismissal as part of a broader destabilization and retribution from the Trump administration, stating that the country appears to be "driving straight into an abyss that holds no memory of what democracy is." Hartman is considering legal action, asserting she was fired without due process.</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have started turning again, 14 months after they collapsed due to a structural failure. The restoration was celebrated with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display, drawing crowds of locals and tourists. The original blades fell overnight in April 2024 with no injuries, and while new aluminum sails were installed before the Olympics, a delayed motor kept them stationary. The cabaret, a symbol of Parisian nightlife since 1889, is a major tourist attraction, attracting around 600,000 visitors annually.</p>

          <p>Julia Hahn, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for public affairs, is leaving the Trump administration to enter the private sector, reportedly to start her own public affairs firm. Hahn, who began her White House career at 25 under Stephen Bannon, has been a key figure in communications related to trade, sanctions, and tax cuts during the second term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller both praised her contributions, calling her an "invaluable asset" and a future "extraordinary ally on the outside." Her departure comes at a time of heightened international trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have left at least 121 people dead and more than 170 missing. The disaster, centered in Kerr County, was caused by the Guadalupe River swelling approximately 26 feet in under an hour. A significant tragedy occurred at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where at least 27 campers and counselors died. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, enabling FEMA support, while scrutiny grows over the adequacy of weather warnings and the potential impact of budget cuts to the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>Political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe posits that a handful of specific words are key to creating successful political slogans that resonate with voters globally. After analyzing 20,000 campaign messages, he identified eight words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—as powerful "emotional shortcuts." He argues these words work across different cultures and political ideologies, citing examples like Bill Clinton's "Putting People First." The article also explores memorable exceptions like "Get Brexit Done" and notes the potential future of campaign messaging lies in AI-driven, individually tailored slogans.</p>

          <p>Author Irvine Welsh, returning to his famous 'Trainspotting' characters with a new novel titled "Men in Love," reflects on cultural shifts since his breakout work. He expresses concern that the internet and AI are creating a "post-culture society," turning people into "dumbed down machines." Welsh's new book explores themes of love as an antidote to modern hate, though it retains his signature gritty style, even requiring a publisher's disclaimer for its 1980s-era language. He argues that society has become a "Precariat," where economic insecurity affects all classes, a trend he believes 'Trainspotting' first heralded.</p>

Global temperatures have risen over 1.3°C, which can translate to UK heatwaves being 3-4°C warmer than they would be otherwise. While many compare the current heat to the summer of 1976, data shows recent heatwaves are more geographically widespread and part of a consistent warming trend.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a significant boom in demand, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022.

The country's birth rate saw its first slight increase in nine years in 2024, offering cautious optimism. However, patients still face high costs and workplace pressures, highlighting ongoing barriers to starting families even with government subsidies for treatments like IVF.</p>

The study, published in Nature Geoscience, found that the longest and rarest heatwaves show the greatest increases in frequency. Researchers warn that adaptation strategies must accelerate, especially as the Trump administration has made cuts to climate change research funding at key agencies like NOAA.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of the Federal Reserve, with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director accusing Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. In a letter, OMB Director Russell Vought highlighted the escalating cost of the Fed's headquarters renovation, now estimated at $2.5 billion, calling it "ostentatious." Vought suggested the project may violate federal planning laws and that Powell misled Congress about its details, such as VIP dining rooms and rooftop gardens. This new line of attack raises questions about whether the administration will seek to remove Powell for cause.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is proceeding with a plan to reduce its domestic workforce by nearly 15%, affecting approximately 1,800 employees through layoffs and voluntary redundancies. The move is part of a significant restructuring aimed at aligning the department with President Trump's "America First" foreign policy and eliminating what officials call post-Cold War redundancies. The changes will merge or eliminate hundreds of bureaus, with some offices focused on immigration and democracy promotion being significantly altered. The announcement followed a Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for the administration's plans for mass government firings.</p>

          <p>Both white-collar and blue-collar workers across China are experiencing heightened job and financial insecurity as companies contend with a lack of production orders and implement cutbacks. The article highlights the story of a corporate director in the manufacturing hub of Dongguan who, despite avoiding a recent layoff, had to accept a significant pay cut. This experience reflects a broader trend where finding a new job with comparable pay has become much more difficult than it was just a few years ago.

          <p>The UK will begin returning some migrants who arrive in small boats to France within weeks under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Standing alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Starmer said the plan aims to break the business model of people smugglers. In exchange for returning some arrivals, the UK will accept an equivalent number of asylum seekers from France, subject to security checks. The deal comes as the number of Channel crossings has reached record levels, with critics arguing the limited scale of the pilot will have little deterrent effect.</p>

          <p>California State University, Los Angeles, is allowing professors to move classes online and provide excused absences in response to growing student fear over federal immigration raids in the area. The university provost acknowledged that many students, particularly on a commuter campus with a large immigrant population, are scared to use public transit or drive to campus. While no raids have occurred on campus, recent federal actions in nearby Los Angeles neighborhoods have heightened concerns. The policy aims to support student well-being without fully reverting to a remote schedule, accommodating those facing extraordinary circumstances.</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official testified in federal court that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and returned to the U.S. to face human trafficking charges. A judge had ordered his release, but the government stated it would then begin removal proceedings to a "third country."

          <p>The FBI has announced it will not release more files on Jeffrey Epstein, stating its review found no evidence of a rumored "client list" or of Epstein blackmailing prominent individuals. This decision has caused a backlash among many Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists who were led to believe the administration would unmask a secret ring of powerful elites. The FBI explained that remaining files contain illegal material involving underage victims that cannot be made public. The reversal has led to feelings of betrayal and new conspiracy theories, with some longtime Trump allies now questioning the administration's motives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is waiving executive privilege to compel former Biden administration aides to provide "unrestricted testimony" to a House Republican investigation into Joe Biden's health. This move forces Biden's aides to either disclose confidential discussions or risk contempt of Congress charges. The tactic is a reversal of Trump's previous stance, when he warned that President Biden's waiver of his privilege for the Jan. 6 investigation would do "grave damage" to the presidency. Constitutional experts worry this establishes a troubling precedent where administrations routinely weaponize the privilege against their political predecessors.</p>
