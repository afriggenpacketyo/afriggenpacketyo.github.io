          <p>Samsung Electronics reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by increased chip sales amidst concerns about potential tariffs from the U.S. The South Korean tech giant saw a nearly 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, with operating profits also climbing. Samsung, a leading manufacturer of memory chips and the world's second-largest smartphone maker, benefited from strong demand in the chip market. While the U.S. has imposed blanket tariffs on trade partners, additional duties on South Korea are currently on hold, providing some relief to Samsung's operations.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to reduce some tariffs affecting the automotive industry, addressing concerns raised by automakers about the impact of tariffs on their operations. While the 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains, the new measures aim to prevent the stacking of tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers assembling cars in the U.S. will be eligible for partial reimbursements on auto parts tariffs for two years. This decision provides some relief to car manufacturers facing increased costs and regulatory uncertainty due to the tariffs, though the long-term effects on the industry are still being assessed.</p>

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana indicated that the partnership could also lead to the incorporation of Toyota's vehicles into Waymo's ride-hailing fleet.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved a $4 billion settlement, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, for victims of sexual assault who were abused as children in county-run facilities and foster homes. The settlement addresses nearly 7,000 claims, primarily involving abuse from the 1980s through the 2000s, and aims to provide closure and compensation to the victims. The county plans to fund the settlement through bonds and its rainy day fund, which will impact future investments in community services. This decision follows Assembly Bill 218, which extended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault cases, leading to a surge in litigation against the county.</p>

DOGE claims to have saved billions by canceling contracts and reducing the federal workforce, though some cost-saving claims have been questioned.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Border Patrol to halt illegal stops and warrantless arrests in California's Central Valley after agents detained farm workers and laborers without reasonable suspicion. The order follows a raid in Bakersfield that sparked outrage after agents were seen slashing the tires of a U.S. citizen. The judge's ruling allows the ACLU to bring a class action lawsuit against the government and requires the Border Patrol to provide detailed documentation of stops and arrests in the area. The ACLU argues that the Border Patrol's actions violated constitutional rights by targeting individuals based on their skin color.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's attempt to gain greater control over a highway and public beach access near its Starbase launch facility in Texas has been rejected by lawmakers. This decision comes as residents vote on whether to incorporate the area into a city.

The rejection of the bill reflects concerns about public access and environmental impact in the area surrounding the launch site.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party narrowly won the Canadian election, securing a minority government and needing support from other parties to pass legislation. The election was dominated by the relationship with the U.S. under President Trump, who imposed tariffs on Canadian goods and threatened annexation. Carney, who positioned himself as the anti-Trump candidate, will now face the challenge of defending Canada's interests in the face of these economic and sovereignty threats. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, suffered a defeat, with Poilievre even losing his own seat.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a Venezuelan mother to Venezuela and the father to a prison in El Salvador, leaving their 2-year-old daughter in foster care in the United States.

This criticism follows earlier speculation about Powell's potential removal and reflects Trump's desire for policies that stimulate economic growth. The President stated that he wanted to be nice and respectful to the Fed, but that he knew much more about interest rates.</p>

Traditional tests failed to diagnose the condition, and Ellie Irwin was even considering having her eye removed. The metagenomics test, which sequences all genetic material in a sample, revealed a strain of leptospirosis likely contracted while swimming in the Amazon River. The diagnosis allowed for targeted antibiotic treatment, leading to clearer vision and reduced inflammation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that human wounds heal more slowly than those of other mammals, including chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice, due to the evolutionary trade-off of shedding fur in favor of sweat glands. Furry animals have numerous hair follicles containing stem cells that aid in rapid skin repair, while humans have fewer follicles and more sweat glands, which are less efficient at healing. This adaptation allowed human ancestors to engage in physical activity in hot environments and cool their brains, but it came at the cost of slower wound healing. This article explores the evolutionary reasons for this difference and the implications for human health.</p>

          <p>A federal judge clarified that her order freezing the enforcement of a new Florida immigration law applies to all local law enforcement agencies in the state. This clarification comes after the Florida Attorney General issued a memo suggesting that local agencies did not need to follow the order. The judge's action aims to prevent the enforcement of a law that makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented migrants to enter Florida, which is being challenged as a violation of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
