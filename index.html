          <p>Coinbase has introduced a new "everything app" that integrates a crypto wallet, trading, and payment functions into a single platform. Built on its Base blockchain, the app aims to attract mainstream consumers who are not necessarily interested in speculative trading, thereby diversifying the company's revenue streams. Key features include the Base Account for identity verification and Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments developed with Shopify, which will soon support in-store tap-to-pay. This move reflects a broader industry trend towards creating "super apps" and comes amid a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck approximately 50 miles south of Sand Point. The initial quake prompted a tsunami warning, leading to evacuations in towns like Seward, but was later downgraded to an advisory as officials determined widespread, large waves were not expected. The U.S. Coast Guard also stood down its evacuation response in Kodiak once the threat passed. While the quake was felt across the region, there was no danger to Anchorage, and only small sea level changes were anticipated in the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid has revealed he is no longer on speaking terms with his former teammate, James Harden, following Harden's contentious departure from the team. Embiid expressed his hurt, suggesting Harden may believe he played a role in the situation that led to Harden not receiving a max contract and subsequently demanding a trade. The duo, once a dominant force in the NBA, saw their partnership end after Harden publicly called the 76ers' president of basketball operations, Daryl Morey, a "liar." Embiid lamented the loss of their on-court chemistry and personal relationship.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old suspect, Raymond Boodarian, has been arrested in connection with the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, both 70. The couple was found dead in their fortified Encino home during a wellness check. Investigators believe the suspect entered the home through an unlocked door and was confronted by the couple when they returned, leading to the fatal shooting. Police used surveillance footage and facial recognition to identify Boodarian, who was apprehended by LAPD detectives and an FBI task force.</p>

Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, recently led the prosecution of Sean "Diddy" Combs and previously secured a conviction against Ghislaine Maxwell. Her termination marks another significant change in the high-profile prosecutor's office, which has seen several leadership shifts under the Trump administration.

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare in Britain has reached £1,076 per child, according to new research from the charity Coram. Prices are rising due to high demand and a shortage of more affordable, council-run options, with some regions seeing price hikes of up to 13% from last year. This financial burden is particularly challenging for working families, especially those on Universal Credit who must pay costs upfront before being reimbursed. The report also highlights a significant lack of available places for older children and those with special educational needs.</p>

Although Trump publicly stated it's "highly unlikely" he would fire Powell, a White House official had earlier indicated a dismissal was probable. The potential move raises legal questions about whether a president can fire a Fed chair for policy disagreements, with experts believing the matter would likely be settled in court. The situation underscores the tension between the White House's desire for lower interest rates and the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed redrawing California's congressional maps to counter a similar Republican-led effort in Texas, a move he frames as necessary to protect democracy from the Trump agenda. This aggressive stance has been met with both support and sharp criticism within his own party, with some Democrats calling it a "crazy hill to die on" and an anti-democratic tactic. The proposal presents legal and political hurdles, as it would require either a novel legal maneuver or asking voters to reverse the non-partisan redistricting process they approved in 2010.

The central question explored is not if consumers will pay the price, but when the effects will become widely apparent in retail prices.

          <h2>Analysis: How Trump's Stance on Epstein Files Risks Alienating His Core Supporters</h2>

          <p>This analysis explores the political fallout from the Trump administration's reversal on releasing the "Epstein files," arguing that the president has primed his base to turn against him on this issue. For years, Trump and his allies fueled conspiracy theories about a "deep state" cover-up, but now the president is dismissing the matter as a "hoax" and lashing out at his "PAST supporters" for believing in it. This creates an irreconcilable conflict with his core political identity as an anti-establishment truth-teller. The article suggests this schism is unique because public suspicion about Epstein is widespread, and the administration's actions appear to confirm it is hiding something.</p>

          <p>Shares of GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer with Donald Trump Jr. as a board member and shareholder, fell more than 20% on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Trump Jr. celebrated the company going public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), calling it a "vindication" against "woke nonsense." The company, which now trades under the ticker PEW, raised $179 million from the merger. The poor market debut highlights the volatility and risks associated with SPACs and companies closely tied to political figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Details have emerged about a major data breach in 2022 where a UK official accidentally leaked a spreadsheet with personal information of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation. To mitigate the risk of this data falling into Taliban hands, the government secretly established the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) to evacuate those affected, spending £400 million so far. The existence of the breach and the subsequent secret operation was hidden from the public by a super-injunction, which has now been lifted. Around 900 individuals and 3,600 family members have been relocated through this emergency scheme.</p>

          <p>A group of seven Liberal Democrat MPs, including party leader Sir Ed Davey, has written to the UK culture secretary, urging intervention after Crystal Palace was demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League. The demotion was a result of breaching UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, as owner John Textor also has a majority stake in French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. The MPs called the punishment "disgraceful," "highly unusual," and "severe," arguing that the process has been opaque and raises serious questions about fairness in football governance.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to pass new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the UK. The new law will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country, closing a loophole that existed post-Brexit. This commitment is part of a broader new agreement between the UK and Germany covering migration, business, and defense. The move is expected to help German authorities disrupt smuggling operations, particularly those involving the storage and supply of small boats used for the dangerous crossings.</p>

This discovery provides a glimpse into a process similar to how our own solar system began, offering invaluable insights into the dawn of planetary systems.

Proponents of lifting the ban argue that it is a crucial step for rehabilitation and reducing recidivism by preventing hunger.

          <p>A Texas judge has scheduled an October 16 execution date for death row inmate Robert Roberson, who was convicted in 2002 for the death of his two-year-old daughter. The conviction was based on what was then known as shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that has since come under significant scientific and legal scrutiny. Roberson's attorneys argue that new evidence shows the child's death was a tragic accident, not a homicide, and that no rational juror would convict him today. The case has drawn widespread attention, with supporters, including a bipartisan group of lawmakers, asserting his innocence.</p>

Initially, Trump distanced himself, calling Epstein someone he "wasn't a fan of," but later he fueled conspiracy theories about Epstein's death. On the campaign trail, he pledged to release the Epstein files, a promise his administration has now walked back, with Trump currently labeling the entire affair a "Democratic hoax."

While the results are hailed as a major scientific milestone, the procedure remains controversial, with critics raising concerns about long-term safety and the ethics of creating heritable genetic modifications, which could open the door to "designer babies."</p>
