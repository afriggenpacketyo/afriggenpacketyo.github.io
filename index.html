          <h2>Beijing Urges Trump to Clarify U.S. Stance on Taiwan Independence for Potential Summit</h2>

          <p>A Chinese foreign policy expert has stated that for a potential summit between Donald Trump and Chinese leadership to be successful, Trump must clearly articulate the U.S. position on Taiwan. Beijing is seeking reassurance that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence, a long-standing point of contention. The expert, Wu Xinbo of Fudan University, emphasized that this clarification is a crucial prerequisite for high-level talks, highlighting the diplomatic tightrope the Trump administration must walk. This comes as the U.S. State Department recently updated its website, removing a phrase that explicitly stated non-support for Taiwan's independence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its long-running feud with California, targeting a wide range of the state's left-leaning policies. The conflicts span from environmental regulations, such as electric vehicle mandates and water management during wildfires, to social issues like sanctuary city designations and transgender athlete participation in sports. President Trump has frequently criticized Governor Gavin Newsom, using executive actions and legal challenges to counter state initiatives. The administration's actions reflect a broader effort to reverse policies it deems radical and assert federal authority over state-level decisions.</p>

          <p>Following former Labour MP Zarah Sultana's departure from the party, Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new left-wing political entity. Corbyn praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated he was delighted she would help build a "real alternative" for voters. This move formalizes long-rumored talks to create a new party from the small group of independent pro-Gaza MPs coordinated by Corbyn. While some on the Labour left have praised the development, none have yet committed to joining, signaling a potential realignment in UK progressive politics.</p>

          <p>The European Commission and Germany are championing the idea of forming a new global trade body to counteract the paralysis of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The proposal, floated by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, aims to create a "coalition of the willing" that can resolve trade disputes, a function the WTO's appellate body can no longer perform due to a long-standing U.S. blockade on appointments. This new organization would initially partner with the CPTPP trade alliance, excluding both the protectionist U.S. and China, which is seen as distorting markets.</p>

          <p>The comprehensive budget bill championed by President Trump, set to become law, introduces significant changes across the U.S. economy and social safety net. Key provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, which primarily benefit corporations and wealthy individuals, while financing these through steep cuts and new restrictions to Medicaid and food assistance programs. The legislation also boosts defense and border security funding by over $250 billion, increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, and introduces tax breaks for tips and overtime. The Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years. (not investment advice)</p>

The Vindolanda Charity Trust found eight shoes measuring over 12 inches long, with one reaching nearly 13 inches, equivalent to a modern U.S. size 15. This high concentration of large footwear is unique compared to other Roman sites, prompting researchers to investigate who might have been stationed at the fort.

The incident began after Amaaz allegedly headbutted and punched another man in the cafe. When police later attempted to arrest him, both brothers reportedly resisted and assaulted the officers, resulting in one officer suffering a broken nose.

They argue that despair is not a solution and that democracy must be actively built from the grassroots level.

The article details how the Continental Army created foundational national symbols and traditions, such as celebrating Washington's birthday instead of the king's and adopting a new flag, which helped build the framework for a national identity that continues to evolve today.</p>

          <h2>A Writer Reconsiders Virginia Woolf's 'A Room of One's Own' and Its Modern Relevance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A writer reflects on her initial reluctance to read Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own," having once viewed it as a symbol of exclusionary white feminism. Upon finally reading the essay, she found a powerful and relatable voice, dissolving her previous grievances. The article explores the enduring relevance of Woolf's arguments about the societal and economic limitations placed on women, noting that issues like the dismissal of female storytelling and the gender pay gap persist today. While acknowledging the book's historical blind spots, the author connects Woolf's ideas to modern intersectional feminism and the ongoing struggle for women's time, space, and financial independence.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has issued a stern warning to India, urging it to stop using Tibet-related issues to interfere in Beijing's internal affairs. The statement came in response to comments from an Indian minister regarding the succession of the Dalai Lama, which Beijing views as undermining its authority. A ministry spokeswoman emphasized the "anti-China and separatist nature" of the Dalai Lama and called on India to honor its commitments and exercise caution. This diplomatic friction highlights the ongoing sensitivity of Tibet as a major point of contention in the complex relationship between the two Asian powers.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's major budget legislation has intensified concerns about the long-term stability of the U.S. dollar and the nation's growing debt. The bill, which includes massive tax cuts, is set to raise the federal debt ceiling by $5 trillion, allowing for greater government borrowing. Analysts note that this move could weaken the dollar's status as a global safe-haven asset, accelerating a pre-existing trend of countries seeking to diversify their holdings away from U.S. currency. The legislation's significant impact on the deficit adds to worries about the country's future fiscal health. (not investment advice)</p>

With Chancellor Rachel Reeves ruling out major tax hikes or increased borrowing, the government faces difficult decisions in its upcoming budget.

Councilmember Traci Park, who introduced the motion, called the practice "gross" and a safety hazard for ongoing debris-clearing operations.

Authorities believe the attack was targeted, with some victims being part of the rapper's inner circle, and are preparing for potential retaliation.

          <p>The recently passed Republican budget bill contains over $1 trillion in federal cuts to Medicaid, a move that experts warn will have severe consequences, particularly for rural communities. States like North Carolina, which recently expanded Medicaid, could see the program automatically terminated due to "trigger laws" designed to end expansion if federal funding decreases. This would strip health coverage from hundreds of thousands of newly insured residents. The cuts also threaten the financial stability of rural hospitals, which rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, potentially leading to service reductions or closures and leaving vulnerable populations without access to care.

He notes that Dutch citizens were in "commotion" and taking up arms to demand rights from their rulers. The letter provides a unique insight into Jefferson's views on armed citizenry in the context of opposing autocracy, just after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War and the signing of the Treaty of Paris.</p>

          <p>This commentary explores the growing phenomenon of AI-generated music, using the popular but likely artificial Spotify band "The Velvet Sundown" as a case study. The author argues that the success of such innocuous, algorithmically-friendly music signifies a cultural shift where music is often used as ambient background noise rather than for active, engaged listening. Streaming services and algorithm-driven playlists have conditioned listeners to prefer a "vibe" over artistry, making the distinction between human and machine-made music increasingly irrelevant. The piece suggests that this trend turns music into a utility for creating an atmosphere or filling a void, rather than a form of cultural or personal expression.</p>

The proposal ignited a culture war, drawing fierce opposition from historians, environmentalists, and locals concerned about the "Disneyfication" of history.
