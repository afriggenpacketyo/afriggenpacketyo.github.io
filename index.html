          <p>Walmart's CFO has indicated that consumers are likely to see price increases later this month and more significantly in June due to tariffs, even with recent agreements to lower duties on imports from China. Despite this, Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter, driven by growth in e-commerce, which posted its first profitable quarter both in the U.S. and globally, benefiting from online advertising and its third-party marketplace. The company is maintaining its full-year forecast, but declined to provide EPS guidance for the second quarter due to fluctuating tariff policy. Walmart's advantages, such as being the nation's largest grocer and a well-known value player, help it navigate the uncertain economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz has voiced reservations about banning the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), despite the party being classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Merz emphasized the need for concrete proof that the AfD is actively undermining Germany's democratic order before considering a ban. While the AfD's platform contains elements that devalue certain population groups, major political parties refuse to form coalitions with them. The debate over how to address the AfD's agenda is becoming a divisive issue within German society.</p>

Chinese investments in Hungary significantly surpass those in other European nations, and the country is unwilling to relinquish these economic benefits.

          <p>Private schools in the UK report a 22.6% average increase in fees compared to last year, exceeding the government's predicted 10% rise following the introduction of VAT on private school fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) attributes the increase to a "triple whammy" of VAT, national insurance changes, and the end of charitable business rates relief. Some schools have reduced fees (excluding VAT) to cushion the impact on parents, but many families are finding private education unaffordable. The government maintains that the fee increases are not solely due to VAT and that ending tax breaks for private schools will fund improvements in state schools.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the music, lyrics, and performances of Eurovision Song Contest winners since 2000 to reveal the formula for success. Key elements include singing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and alluding to folk music without sending an actual folk song. The data suggests avoiding dramatic key changes and embracing over-the-top staging, including fire and pyrotechnics. Most importantly, the article advises against sending a novelty act, as being too silly can lead to failure.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after experiencing higher-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the first three months of the year, driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. While the Labour government celebrates this progress, critics caution that the strong growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased employer taxes. Despite concerns about the cost of living crisis, the government remains optimistic, citing the UK as the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during this period.</p>

Starmer acknowledges that return hubs are not a "silver bullet" but will contribute to tackling people smuggling and preventing Channel crossings.</p>
