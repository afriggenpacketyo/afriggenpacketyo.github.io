          <p>The article discusses the increasing cost of driving lessons in the UK and how it impacts learners, many of whom find it difficult to afford the lessons necessary to pass their driving tests. Instructors justify the rising prices by citing increased expenses such as fuel, insurance, and car maintenance. Learners are forced to cut back on other essential spending or take fewer lessons, prolonging the learning process. The backlog for practical driving tests also contributes to the problem, as learners need more lessons to maintain their skills while waiting for an available test date.</p>

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio argues that a federal court order blocking deportations to South Sudan is causing significant damage to U.S. foreign policy, complicating diplomatic relations with Libya, South Sudan, and Djibouti. The court order requires the U.S. government to maintain custody of deportees, which Rubio claims interferes with diplomatic efforts and exacerbates internal political and security divisions. The Justice Department believes that this situation urgently requires judicial intervention to restore President Trump’s full Article II authority to conduct foreign policy. The administration has asked the court to reconsider its order and "highly burdensome requirements."</p>

          <p>Jon Worrell has been charged with the murder of his wife, Doris Worrell, who was fatally shot in 2006 at their family business in Georgia. Initially, authorities believed Doris died in a robbery attempt, but the investigation went cold until investigators traveled to Costa Rica and found the family’s former live-in nanny, who was willing to cooperate. The nanny's information corroborated evidence collected over the years, leading to Worrell's arrest in Missouri. The investigation revealed Worrell had an inappropriate relationship with the nanny and feared losing access to his children in a divorce, leading him to conspire to commit the murder.</p>

          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in for his second term as President of Ecuador, vowing to fight drug trafficking, corruption, and violent crime. He also promised to implement reforms and work with the private sector to create jobs and investment. The ceremony was attended by international delegates, including U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy and the presidents of Colombia and Peru. Noboa's re-election was seen as favorable to U.S. interests, with the Trump administration considering a permanent U.S. military presence in the country. Violence and high unemployment remain significant challenges for Noboa, who must maintain a congressional majority to push through his agenda.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of California in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The high-definition pictures were released after an interagency team used deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition. The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship during exercises and sank in just 10 seconds. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed near the same area in 1950. The team held a remembrance ceremony, ringing a bell 19 times for each crew member lost at sea.</p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, conceived and largely developed by Israelis, is set to be carried out by foreign contractors, displacing experienced aid agencies like the United Nations. The plan, first proposed by Israeli officials in late 2023, aims to undermine Hamas's control of Gaza and bypass the UN. It involves hiring private contractors, including former C.I.A. officer Philip F. Reilly, to distribute food in zones under Israeli military control. The UN has warned that the plan could restrict aid and facilitate an Israeli plan to displace civilians out of northern Gaza.</p>
