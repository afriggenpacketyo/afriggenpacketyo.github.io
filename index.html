            <p>The UK government is urgently working to supply raw materials to British Steel's Scunthorpe plant after taking control through emergency legislation to prevent its closure by Chinese owners Jingye. Officials are focused on securing coking coal and iron ore to power the plant's blast furnaces, which Jingye had allegedly been selling off. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized the government's commitment to steelmaking in the UK and its efforts to preserve jobs at the Scunthorpe site, which employs 2,700 people and is the last UK plant capable of producing virgin steel. The move follows failed negotiations with Jingye, who reportedly demanded excessive financial support without guaranteeing the plant's future.</p>

            <p>A 38-year-old Pennsylvania man, Cody Balmer, has been arrested and charged with attempted murder, terrorism, and arson after allegedly setting fire to Governor Josh Shapiro's official residence in Harrisburg. The governor and his family were safely evacuated after the fire was reported around 2 a.m. ET; no injuries were sustained, though significant damage was done to the residence. Investigators are exploring Balmer's motives, including potential political grievances related to the Democratic party and possible mental health issues, and are not ruling out Shapiro's Jewish faith as a possible motivating factor. Governor Shapiro addressed the attack, condemning violence and affirming his commitment to celebrating his faith openly.</p>

            <p>British actress Jean Marsh, best known as the co-creator and star of the popular TV series “Upstairs, Downstairs,” has died at the age of 90 due to complications from dementia.

Marsh played the role of Rose Buck, the head parlor maid. The series, which premiered in 1971, became a hit both in the UK and the US, winning seven Emmy Awards and enjoying a revival in 2011 with Marsh reprising her role.</p>

            <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Americans are divided on President Trump's trade and tariff policies, with a majority anticipating higher prices in both the short and long term. While most believe Trump is using tariffs for negotiation purposes, Republicans are more likely to believe in the long-term benefits for U.S. manufacturing jobs and are more patient in judging the impact. Overall, Trump's ratings for handling the economy and inflation have declined, and a growing number of people feel his policies are making them financially worse off. The majority now consider the current economic climate to be influenced more by Trump's policies than those of his predecessor. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Russian missiles struck the Ukrainian city of Sumy during Palm Sunday celebrations, resulting in the deaths of at least 34 people, including two children, and injuring 117 others. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, stating that the strikes targeted a university and street level. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered condolences and reiterated the Trump Administration's commitment to ending the war, while retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg called the attack a violation of decency. The attack follows a similar deadly strike in Kryvyi Rih and comes amid accusations between Russia and Ukraine regarding violations of a U.S.-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Amid recent market volatility and concerns about the role of bonds in a diversified portfolio, experts suggest a bond ladder strategy for investors seeking income and stability. This approach involves investing in a range of treasury maturities, holding them to maturity, and receiving regular income through principal and interest payments. ETFs like the LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offer a similar approach, providing monthly income through 2035 by investing in a ladder of treasuries. While ultrashort bond ETFs have become popular, the bond ladder strategy aims to protect buying power and immunize against liabilities, offering peace of mind in turbulent times.

            <p>In Windsor, Ontario, Canada's car capital, auto workers are bracing for the potential economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs on foreign-made vehicles, steel, and aluminum. Workers express concern about job security and the impact on their families, viewing the tariffs as a "stab in the back" from a close ally. The tariffs are expected to disrupt the deeply integrated North American auto supply chain, with potential ripple effects across the continent. Canadian political parties are proposing various measures to support the auto sector during the ongoing election.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Geologist Minik Rosing argues that the widespread belief in a mineral bonanza in Greenland is a misconception, stating that there is no special concentration of rare earths and minerals compared to other regions. He suggests that the focus should be on the quality of minerals and developing facilities for processing raw materials, rather than acquiring territory. Rosing points out that the U.S. already has untapped rare earths and minerals but lacks the technologies to refine them, with China dominating the market. He emphasizes the need for political will and economic subsidies to create a competitive market and reduce reliance on China.</p>

            <p>President Trump's renewed focus on acquiring Greenland has sparked a sense of defiance on the Arctic island, with residents asserting that they are "not for sale" but open to business. While Greenland has a history of welcoming the U.S., Trump's interest has fueled a spirit of independence and prompted locals to reassess their relationship with Denmark. The U.S. argues that acquiring Greenland is essential for national security and access to untapped minerals, but many Greenlanders remain skeptical, with only a small percentage favoring U.S. control.</p>

If the FTC wins, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be forced to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg has reportedly lobbied Trump to drop the case, which was filed during Trump's first administration. The trial, which could last several weeks, is taking place amidst a backdrop of shifting politics and concerns about potential political interference, particularly after Trump's move to fire two FTC commissioners.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering imposing new tariffs on semiconductors, just days after lifting reciprocal tariffs on certain electronics. The administration is launching an investigation into semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, citing national security concerns. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the electronics tariff exemptions are temporary and will soon be replaced by the semiconductor tariff. China is currently America's top source of electronic products, followed by Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
