          <p>A former Mongolian president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, known for abolishing the death penalty in his country, has called on Japanese lawmakers to take similar action. Elbegdorj argues that politicians should lead in changing public opinion on the matter, despite current support for executions in Japan. He suggests that the Japanese government should disclose more information about the death penalty to foster an open debate. Elbegdorj emphasizes that the death penalty goes against human rights and the sanctity of life, highlighting the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has passed a bill to transform a government advisory body of scientists into a corporate entity. This move has drawn criticism from academics who fear it could compromise the body's independence due to increased state oversight. Under the new law, the Science Council of Japan, currently operating independently from the government, will be reclassified as a special corporate entity starting in October 2026. The change raises concerns about the potential impact on the council's ability to provide unbiased advice.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump can continue enforcing his global tariffs while the court reviews a previous ruling that invalidated their imposition. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington extended a previous temporary allowance for the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs. These tariffs target imports from almost all countries, as well as levies hitting Canada, China, and Mexico over fentanyl. The court's decision provides a temporary reprieve for the administration as it defends its trade policies.</p>

Seltzer argues that the testimony depicts Combs as morally reprehensible but doesn't necessarily prove the government's case. Former federal prosecutor Neahma Rahmani notes that the case hinges on whether the encounters were consensual or coerced.</p>
