He swam in frigid 47-degree water, facing harsh weather conditions and mental challenges due to the constant awareness of sharks. Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, emphasizes the unsustainable rate at which sharks are killed globally, advocating for their protection as essential apex predators for a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>

This shift in tone is evident in President Trump's recent call for a swift resolution to the conflict, contrasting with his earlier support for Israel. Germany and Italy have also voiced strong criticism of Israel's expanded attacks in Gaza, while Britain, Canada, and France have warned of repercussions if Israel does not change course.

          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates a significant disparity between the official unemployment rate and the "true rate" of unemployment, which factors in those seeking full-time employment, but cannot find it, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. While the official unemployment rate stood at 4.2% in April, LISEP's "true rate" was 24.3%, suggesting a more nuanced picture of the labor market. This measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion. The report highlights that millions of households are struggling to maintain a "minimal quality of life."</p>

Former referees' boss Keith Hackett criticized the PGMOL's decision, calling it a "poor management decision" to assign an inexperienced referee to such a crucial game. The disputed call involved a foul against Villa when Morgan Rogers dispossessed the United goalkeeper, with the VAR unable to intervene due to the premature whistle.

          <p>President Trump has expressed criticism of President Putin's recent attacks in Ukraine, describing them as "absolutely CRAZY," yet he has refrained from joining European allies in imposing new sanctions on Russia. This stance creates a strategic gap, where Trump voices disapproval of Russia's actions but remains unwilling to penalize Putin. Experts note this pattern, where Trump signals disengagement from the conflict, expresses shock at Russian attacks, and then declines to implement further economic penalties. Despite complaining about Russia’s continued violence, he has so far been unwilling to make Mr. Putin pay even a modest price.</p>

          <p>Analysts caution that the potential for a trade war remains despite President Trump's decision to delay imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union. The delay, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, provides a six-week window for negotiations, but market watchers warn that significant uncertainty persists. While European stocks rebounded after the announcement, experts note that a lot remains at stake, and the EU is unlikely to capitulate to Trump's negotiation tactics. If substantial tariffs are imposed, the EU would have no choice but to implement significant countermeasures against the United States.</p>

          <p>King Charles is in Canada to deliver the Speech from the Throne, marking the opening of Parliament's 45th session. Prime Minister Mark Carney extended the invitation to the King as a strategic move amidst strained relations with the United States. US President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on Canada and has repeatedly referred to it as the "51st state." Carney stated that the King's visit "clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country," while Governor General Mary Simon emphasized the "enduring relationship between Canada and the Crown."</p>

          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four U.S. airmen who died in the crash of the WWII bomber "Heaven Can Wait" are being laid to rest. The plane was shot down off New Guinea in 1944, killing all 11 aboard. A relative of one of the crew members, Scott Althaus, launched an investigation to locate the crash site. Project Recover, in partnership with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, discovered the wreckage in 2017. The recovery mission led to the identification of four airmen, whose remains are now being returned to their families for burial with military honors.</p>

          <p>Nine European Union member states, led by Italy and Denmark, are advocating for a reinterpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights to facilitate the expulsion of foreign national criminals. The exact demands are unclear, but the move is sparking debate about judicial independence and human rights protections. Critics argue that the European Court of Human Rights is not the primary obstacle to deporting criminals and that the letter is more of a political act. The Council of Europe's secretary-general has cautioned against politicizing the Court and undermining fundamental rights.</p>

Despite a high strike percentage, Scott's pitches have been making too much contact, and his whiff rate has decreased. The Dodgers are encouraging Scott to prioritize missing bats, even if it means issuing more walks, particularly with several key relievers currently injured.

Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said the comments were "connected to an emotional overload of everyone involved".

The announcement follows previous actions to freeze or withdraw funding from Harvard, citing concerns about antisemitism and foreign influence.

He said that the proposed new academy “will gather an entire universe of the highest quality educational content, covering the full spectrum of human knowledge and skills, and make that material available to every American citizen online for free.”</p>
