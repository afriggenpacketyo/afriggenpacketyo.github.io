          <h2>Trump Administration Faces Legal Challenge Over Student Visa Terminations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups over the alleged unlawful termination of student visas. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order, requiring the administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students who claimed their records were abruptly terminated on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The lawsuit alleges that these terminations were designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting, even without violating their visa status. The judge has ordered the administration to notify the court of compliance and has scheduled a hearing for further consideration. Optimism score: 75</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case involving a clash between local school boards' authority to determine curriculum and parents' rights to opt their children out of materials conflicting with their religious beliefs. The case stems from a Montgomery County, Maryland, school board's decision to include LGBTQ+ themed storybooks in elementary classes, which some parents opposed. The court will weigh the school board's argument that accommodating opt-out requests is logistically difficult against the parents' claim that forcing the books on their children violates their constitutional right to free exercise of religion. The outcome could impact how school districts balance curriculum decisions with religious freedom. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly investing in gold ETFs as a hedge against geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, particularly stemming from the trade war and Trump's policies.
