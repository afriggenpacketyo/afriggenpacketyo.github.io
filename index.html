          <p>Brazilian meat giant JBS experienced a rise in shares during its U.S. public market debut, valuing the company at approximately $30 billion. The company's listing on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker "JBS," was delayed by one day due to operational procedures. JBS, the world's largest meatpacking company, has a history of corruption and bribery allegations, leading to opposition from lawmakers. Despite past scandals, the SEC approved JBS's request to list, and shareholders narrowly approved the move, marking a significant step in the company's long journey to the U.S. market.

          <p>Following Israel's military actions against Iran, including strikes targeting military leadership and nuclear sites, several key questions arise regarding the conflict's trajectory. These include whether Israel's objective is limited to dismantling Iran's nuclear program or extends to regime change, the extent of Iran's retaliatory capabilities, and how the conflict will affect Iran's nuclear ambitions. Experts suggest that the answers to these questions will determine the scope and duration of the conflict, as well as the potential for further escalation. The situation remains highly uncertain, with the full impact of recent events likely to unfold over years.</p>

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi informed the United Nations Security Council that a significant portion of Iran's primary enrichment site, Natanz, was destroyed in Israeli strikes.

The IAEA reported normal radioactivity levels surrounding the site, but noted radiological and chemical contamination inside the facilities, manageable with appropriate measures. Grossi reiterated that nuclear facilities should never be attacked due to the serious implications for nuclear security, safety, safeguards, and international peace.</p>

Past parades include those marking the end of the Gulf War, Cold War inaugurations, and celebrations of World Wars I and II.

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn as military strikes between Israel and Iran fueled investor anxieties about a potential war in the Middle East.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates households in the bottom 10% of income distribution would lose about $1,600 per year due to reductions in Medicaid and SNAP. Consequently, millions of children may miss out on the full child tax credit, and over two million could face food assistance reductions.</p>

The current strategy involves preemptive strikes and clandestine operations within Iran, aiming to degrade its military capabilities and destabilize the regime. While this approach may be effective in the short term, the potential for a protracted and destructive conflict remains high.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment improved more than expected in June, driven by optimism following President Trump's rollback of tariffs. The resurgence ended six months of worsening attitudes, and year-ahead inflation expectations dropped sharply. The improvement was reflected across all demographics, indicating a broad positive shift in economic outlook. However, concerns remain about potential price increases from retailers and warnings about elevated inflation in the coming months, creating uncertainty about future economic conditions.

While the Trump administration initially distanced itself from the strikes, it may be compelled to take a more active role to protect U.S. interests and maintain regional stability.
