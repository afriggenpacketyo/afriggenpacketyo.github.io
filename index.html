          <h2>Irish Rap Group Kneecap Apologizes for Controversial Remarks Amidst Funding Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 03:52:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kneecap, a Belfast-based rap group, has issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox following the emergence of footage showing a band member making controversial remarks about Tory politicians. The statement comes amidst scrutiny from counter-terrorism police and calls for prosecution from Conservative leaders, who were spurred by the unearthed footage from a November 2023 concert. The group denies inciting violence and claims the footage was taken out of context, but the incident has led to the withdrawal of government funding and calls for their exclusion from upcoming music festivals, including Glastonbury and TRNSMT. DUP MP Carla Lockhart is also advocating for Kneecap to be denied entry to the USA and Canada ahead of their North America tour.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a significant portion of Britons feel their personal finances are "out of control," with over half experiencing a lack of control in various aspects of their lives, including physical health and work. The survey, commissioned by Smart Energy GB, highlights financial concerns as a major stressor. To address this, Smart Energy GB is collaborating with the Professional Darts Corporation and a sports psychologist to offer techniques for managing stress and regaining control. Dr. Josie Perry suggests using tools like smart meters to help manage energy bills and reduce financial pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars' shares plummeted following the announcement of a substantial cost-cutting plan of 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter. The company attributes the drop to reduced wholesales, adverse currency effects, and overall industry challenges. As a result, Volvo Cars is implementing reductions in investments and redundancies across its global operations and has withdrawn its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026. CEO Håkan Samuelsson cited market headwinds, price competition, and potential tariffs as factors impacting the company's outlook.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to include milkshakes and pre-packaged lattes, potentially impacting a significant portion of milk-based drink sales. The Treasury is also considering reducing the maximum sugar allowance in drinks subject to the levy. While some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families, others support the extension as a means to tackle obesity, particularly among children. The Food and Drink Federation acknowledges the progress made in reducing sugar content in soft drinks but calls for continued support for business innovation.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media is encouraging the public to revisit Mao Zedong's essay "On Protracted War" as a source of inspiration during ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The Beijing Daily suggests that Mao's commentary on China's war against Japanese aggression can instill confidence in achieving eventual victory in the tariff war. This comes after the US imposed significant tariffs on goods from China, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The commentary emphasizes the need to reject defeatist attitudes and illusions of a quick resolution.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals have won Canada's federal election, fueled by anti-Trump sentiment and concerns over the country's economic survival. Carney, a political newcomer, successfully positioned himself as a leader capable of navigating the challenges posed by Trump's tariff threats and comments undermining Canadian sovereignty. While the Conservatives made significant gains, they ultimately fell short of securing a majority. The election results highlight divisions within Canada, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where the Liberals have limited support. Carney has pledged to govern for all Canadians and address the economic anxieties of young people.</p>

          <p>Sophie Power's viral moment of breastfeeding her infant during a 106-mile ultramarathon has inspired significant change for women in sports. Power had not even laced up her trainers for her first run when she signed up to an ultramarathon. Her experience highlighted the challenges faced by mothers, leading to the implementation of pregnancy deferral policies in major events, including the London Marathon. Power's advocacy has been central to these positive changes, ensuring greater inclusivity for women in sports.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a remarkable victory in the Canadian election, largely due to the influence of Donald Trump. Trump's persistent badgering of Canada and suggestions of annexation coincided with a reversal of fortune for the Liberal Party. Carney focused on the threat Trump posed to Canada's sovereignty, which resonated with voters. The election broke the trend of incumbent governments losing ground, as the Liberals replaced Trudeau and ran against what they characterized as the real threat Trump posed to Canada.</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers were released from prison after serving sentences related to national security convictions. Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki served four years and two months on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion. They were part of the "Hong Kong 47," arrested for participating in an unofficial primary poll in 2020. Critics argue that the lawsuit was part of a broad assault by Beijing on rights and democracy in the former British colony.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, experienced slower economic growth in the first quarter compared to the national average, with GDP growth of 5.2 percent versus the country's 5.4 percent. The city's exports declined by 8.7 percent, while China recorded a 6.9 percent gain, attributed to firms rushing to export before US tariffs took effect. Experts suggest that Shenzhen's high baseline from the previous year and unique pressures from the tariff war contributed to the disappointing numbers. The city faces challenges including high costs, insufficient orders, and pressure on foreign trade and exports.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party won Canada's federal election, with opposition leader Pierre Poilievre conceding defeat. The win marks a comeback for the Liberals, whose popularity had suffered prior to Justin Trudeau's resignation. A lot of the NDP's supporters shifted to the Liberals as US President Donald Trump's tariffs and comments about making Canada a US state weighed on the minds of voters. Carney has said Canada will "win this trade war" with the US and warned that America wants Canada's land, resources, water, and country.</p>

CEO Georges Elhedery cited momentum in earnings and strategy execution as drivers of the strong results.
