          <p>According to sources, the United States had advance notice of Israel's strikes against Iran, which targeted the country's nuclear program and military leaders. Israel launched dozens of strikes early Friday, reportedly killing nuclear scientists and high-ranking military officials. Iran responded with an aerial attack involving approximately 100 drones, all of which Israel claims to have shot down before reaching their targets. A U.S. official stated that the U.S. did not provide assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike. The context of the attack is heightened tensions in the Middle East, specifically regarding Iran's nuclear program.</p>

To counter higher costs from tariffs, RH is shifting more production out of China, expecting receipts from the country to drop significantly, and plans to open stores internationally, including in Paris. The CEO noted that RH has pressed ahead with plans to open stores in other countries, including one of the most exclusive retail addresses: Paris' Champs Ã‰lysÃ©es (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Hay fever sufferers are experiencing particularly severe symptoms this year due to high pollen levels, warm weather conditions, and pollution. Experts recommend a "cocktail approach" of antihistamine tablets or drops, steroid nasal sprays, and eye drops to manage symptoms. Additionally, avoiding triggers, maintaining good hygiene, and regularly cleaning the home can help reduce the impact of hay fever. Long-term, climate change may exacerbate hay fever seasons by lengthening them and increasing pollen concentration.</p>

The operation aimed to curb Iran's nuclear program, which Israel and Western countries suspect is secretly working towards developing nuclear weapons.

Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman expressed concern that the bipartisan commission overseeing America250 was not consulted on these decisions, suggesting a hijacking of the group's mission for personal gain.

          <p>Protests are planned across the United States against President Trump's policies, particularly his immigration stance and deployment of the military in Los Angeles. The "No Kings" protests aim to challenge the administration's actions, which opponents view as a threat to democratic principles. These demonstrations coincide with Trump's military parade in Washington D.C., intended to mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The protests are intended to highlight opposition to Trump's policies.</p>

However, geopolitical tensions and unpredictable trade policies could still disrupt the IPO market's momentum. The increase in investment banking diversifies Wells Fargo's revenue streams so the bank is not as reliant on interest-based income (not investment advice).</p>
