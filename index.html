          <p>Shedeur Sanders believes that much of the criticism he receives stems from negativity directed towards his father, Deion Sanders. Speaking to Cleveland.com, Sanders noted that the younger generation, unlike the older one, forms its own opinions and doesn't rely on past perceptions of his father. He enjoys meeting people in person and answering their questions directly, as he finds less negativity offline. Sanders is entering a crowded quarterback room with veterans and fellow rookies, and all eyes will be on him during offseason workouts.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack on Ukraine, resulting in casualties and widespread damage across the country. Ukrainian officials reported that the attack involved nearly 370 missiles and drones, with at least 12 people killed and dozens injured. The strikes underscore the failure of diplomatic efforts to broker a cease-fire, with President Zelenskyy accusing Russia of prolonging the war. Despite the ongoing conflict, Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange, releasing 303 people on each side after cease-fire negotiations held this month in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail. Arias-Cristobal was initially pulled over for a false turn, but the charges were later dropped. However, she was then transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) due to her undocumented status, nearly missing the Daca deadline. The arrest sparked national attention and reignited debate over immigration enforcement policies, particularly 287(g) contracts, which deputize local officials to carry out immigration enforcement arrests.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming toward the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. After a series of Israeli airstrikes on Syria targeting weapons and hostile groups, Trump met with al-Shara and announced plans to lift sanctions. This shift in American foreign policy has led to a decrease in Israeli strikes, raising concerns about the potential rise of an anti-Israel neighbor.

          <p>President Trump has renewed his attacks on Harvard University after a judge blocked his administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that some of Harvard's international students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and receive free education. This follows the federal government's freezing of over $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard over alleged violence, antisemitism, and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. A hearing is scheduled to determine whether the temporary restraining order should be extended.</p>
