          <p>Chicago is implementing a range of strategies to resist President Trump's mass deportation agenda, building on a history of protecting its immigrant communities. The city has implemented "Know Your Rights" campaigns and rapid-response groups to monitor ICE activity. Despite increased volunteer interest, there is still fear among immigrants as deportations rise and volunteer interest has surged, there's still a strong sense of fear among immigrants. The city's pro-immigrant stance is evident through extensive policies and collaboration between organizations, making it a model for other cities seeking to protect immigrant rights.</p>

          <p>Theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek explores the concept of quasi-worlds and their relationship to fundamental physics. The ability to describe physics inside materials using the same ideas as fundamental physics in empty space has been remarkably fruitful. This has enabled modern electronics and computer technology, continuing to inspire innovation. Wilczek contrasts ancient philosophical ideas with more scientific approaches, highlighting the ongoing debate about the nature of space and its role in physical phenomena.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's affinity for Victor Hugo's 'Les MisÃ©rables' is examined, considering the story's themes of social injustice and redemption. Despite the musical's focus on the plight of the downtrodden, Trump plans to attend a performance at the Kennedy Center, now filled with his appointees. The article explores the irony of Trump's appreciation for a story that critiques a punitive regime, contrasting it with Hugo's own history as a political outcast and advocate for freedom. The adaptation of the musical is a sweetened, antiseptic version of his weird, digressive underworld of moral and literal sewers.</p>
