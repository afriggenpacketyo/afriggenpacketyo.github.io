          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have killed at least 38 people across Gaza, according to health officials, intensifying the humanitarian crisis. Despite growing international pressure for a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations that his nation must "finish the job" against Hamas. The conflict has led to the near collapse of Gaza City's healthcare system, with aid groups like Doctors Without Borders suspending activities due to unacceptable risks. The worsening food situation and high casualty count, exceeding 65,000 killed, underscore the dire circumstances facing the region's civilian population.</p>

The records, containing sensitive information like her social security number, were obtained by an ally of her Republican opponent in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, Jack Ciattarelli. Sherrill condemned the act as an "illegal and dangerous weaponization of the federal government" intended for political gain.

          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto swirls in the Atlantic, meteorologists are monitoring the possibility of it interacting with a nearby developing storm system. Such an event could produce the rare Fujiwhara effect, a phenomenon where two storms become entangled around a common center, essentially dancing around each other. While experts believe this outcome is unlikely due to the second system's relative weakness, it remains a scientific possibility. Humberto is currently a Category 4 storm, and its path, along with the second system, is being closely watched for potential impacts on the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>As "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" marks its 50th anniversary, its legacy is being kept alive by dedicated fan groups and their interactive "shadowcast" performances. These groups meticulously recreate the film live in theaters, complete with screen-accurate costumes and audience callbacks, offering an immersive experience that predates modern trends. For many, the film and its community serve as a vital safe space, particularly for queer and neurodivergent individuals, celebrating non-conformity and fostering a sense of belonging. The tradition continues to thrive, proving the film's timeless appeal as a cornerstone of cult cinema and queer history.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has announced that Berlin is pursuing agreements to facilitate the deportation of individuals to Syria and Afghanistan. The proposed deal with Syria aims to first repatriate criminals and later those without legal residence status, while efforts are also underway to establish "regular and systematic" deportations to Afghanistan. This policy shift comes as Germany hosts nearly a million Syrian nationals and has not deported anyone to Syria since 2012.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is actively promoting an "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union to enhance the country's economic prospects. She has called on the Office for Budget Responsibility to incorporate the potential positive economic impact of such a scheme into its official forecasts ahead of the autumn Budget. This move is seen as a way to potentially lessen the need for future tax increases or spending cuts to address fiscal gaps. The proposal has drawn criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK, who argue it resembles a partial return to the pre-Brexit freedom of movement.</p>

          <p>Danish security authorities have reported additional sightings of unidentified drones over military installations, including the country's largest air base in Karup. This incident is the latest in a series that has prompted temporary airport closures and led Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to label them as "hybrid attacks." The drone incursions are fueling heightened security tensions across the Nordic and NATO-aligned regions, following similar incidents in Poland and Romania. An investigation is underway, but the origin of the drones remains unknown, adding to concerns about potential foreign interference.</p>

The facility, operated by private prison corporation CoreCivic, was opened rapidly as part of the Trump administration's effort to expand immigration detention capacity.

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, the Trump administration has initiated a series of actions widely seen as an assault on free speech, including pressuring media companies and vowing to prosecute "hate speech." This has created a notable split on the political right, with libertarian groups like the Cato Institute and some conservative figures criticizing the moves as hypocritical and unconstitutional. These critics argue the administration is promoting a "free speech for me, but not for thee" policy, abandoning long-held conservative principles and setting a dangerous precedent for government censorship.</p>

          <p>This article explores how President Trump's willingness to openly engage in actions that would have been career-ending scandals for previous presidents is reshaping political norms. By brazenly pressuring the justice department to target rivals or boasting about tax avoidance, he projects what some supporters see as authenticity, desensitizing the public to the behavior. Observers argue that this strategy, combined with a constant flood of controversies, prevents any single issue from gaining sustained traction and normalizes what would have previously been considered corrupt conduct, posing a challenge to traditional accountability.</p>

This year's threat is considered more severe, as the White House has directed agencies to prepare for permanent mass layoffs rather than the temporary furloughs seen in past shutdowns. The political impasse stems from a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over key policy issues, including demands for extending healthcare subsidies.

          <p>The American state fair, a cherished tradition, has evolved significantly from its 19th-century origins as a showcase for livestock and agriculture. While these roots remain central, modern fairs have transformed into large-scale events that blend agricultural competitions with amusement park attractions, live music, and an endless variety of fried foods. This combination of heritage and entertainment has ensured their continued popularity, making them a major economic contributor and a vibrant platform for local artists, crafters, and communities to celebrate their unique cultures and talents each year.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plans for a new generation of towns in England are showing strong signs of influence from the long-held architectural philosophies of King Charles. Officials have outlined a vision for walkable, sustainable communities with "gentle density" like terraced housing, mirroring the principles of the King's projects such as Poundbury. Once criticized by the architectural establishment, the King's focus on traditional styles, local materials, and community-centric public spaces is now seen as a mainstream approach to creating more humane and desirable living environments.</p>

          <p>After more than a century, the remains of two Scottish soldiers killed during the Battle of Loos in World War I have been identified through a meticulous investigation. The Ministry of Defence's "war detectives" used a combination of historical records, battlefield artifacts, and DNA analysis to confirm the identities of Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan. A key breakthrough came from small tramway buttons found with McPherson, which linked him to his father's employer and ultimately to his living relatives, providing long-awaited closure for their families.</p>

          <p>The cost of policing a series of ongoing protests in the English town of Epping is expected to reach £1.7 million by October, according to the local police, fire and crime commissioner. The demonstrations began in July after an asylum seeker staying at The Bell Hotel was charged and later convicted of sexual offenses. Despite some disorder and arrests, the substantial policing bill must be fully covered by the Essex Police force, as it falls below the £4 million threshold required for central government financial assistance.</p>

          <p>South Korea is confronting a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate has fallen to 0.748, one of the lowest in the world and far below the 2.1 replacement level needed to maintain its population. Economic studies warn this trend could stall the nation's growth within two decades, potentially leading to economic contraction by the 2040s and undoing the progress of the "Miracle on the Han River." Despite the government investing over $270 billion in pro-natalist policies, the measures have failed to reverse the decline, threatening the future of the workforce, pension system, and national defense.
