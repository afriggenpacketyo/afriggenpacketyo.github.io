          <p>Houthi rebels in Yemen reported that a US airstrike hit a migrant center in the Sadaa governorate, resulting in numerous casualties. Houthi-controlled media broadcasted graphic images of the aftermath, depicting bodies and wounded individuals at the scene. The Houthis, an Iran-backed Shiite Muslim militia, have been engaged in a civil war in Yemen since 2014 and have recently targeted ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in response to Israel's actions in Gaza. The US military has not yet commented on the incident, but had previously reported striking Houthi targets in mid-March.</p>

          <p>Alfred Kammer, the IMF's Europe head, stated that increased infrastructure spending in Germany will not be enough to counteract the negative effects of US tariffs on the euro zone's economic growth. The IMF recently lowered its growth forecasts for the euro area due to President Trump's tariff policies, with the negative impact partially mitigated by Germany's infrastructure spending bill. Exemptions to Germany's debt rules have allowed for higher defense spending and a substantial infrastructure and climate fund, potentially altering the country's economic trajectory.</p>

          <p>Following Liverpool's Premier League victory, discussions are underway regarding potential defensive reinforcements, especially at full-back positions. Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to join Real Madrid, and Andrew Robertson's age prompts speculation about Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez as a successor. Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy suggests a center-back addition may depend on Arne Slot's assessment of current players like Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah, emphasizing the need for a backup with Virgil van Dijk's age and Ibrahima Konate's injury history being a concern.</p>

          <p>A new study supports the historical account of the Han dynasty's conquest of the Nanyue kingdom in southern China in 112 BC. Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen, and historical records to determine the impact of the Han's riverine warfare on the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples revealed a decline in swamp cypress pollen around 100 BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Nanyue's capital, Panyu, which was set ablaze, indicating a link between the conquest and the decline of this now-endangered tree species.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including mining giants and energy majors, are investing in the exploration of natural hydrogen, also known as white hydrogen. This resource, found naturally beneath the Earth's surface, contains no carbon and produces only water when burned. Companies like Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Gazprom, BP Ventures, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures are backing exploratory efforts in various countries. While some are skeptical about its potential, others believe natural hydrogen could revolutionize the global energy landscape, but it will likely take decades to achieve industrial production.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that populist politics, while initially appearing liberating, often lead to increased complexity and chaos when applied to real-world problems. Brexit has resulted in more border hassle, and stricter immigration controls create new bureaucracies. The Trump administration's interventionist approach and Reform UK's rigid policies exemplify this trend. The author suggests that centrists should highlight the rigid and backward-looking nature of conservative populism, offering a more inclusive vision for the future.</p>

          <p>Laboratory testing of baby food pouches from leading UK brands revealed that many are low in essential nutrients like vitamin C and iron, with some containing excessive sugar levels. Experts suggest that parents are being misled by marketing claims, and the pouches should only be used sparingly as a complement to homemade meals, not as a primary source of nutrition. The BBC investigation found that savoury pouches contained minimal iron, fruit pouches lacked vitamin C, and some pouches contained more free sugars than recommended for a one-year-old.</p>
