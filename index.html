          <p>Rolando Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a boxing match held in Times Square, marking the biggest win of Romero's career. Garcia was knocked down in the second round and struggled throughout the fight, which was his first since a previous victory was overturned due to a failed drug test. Devin Haney also won his fight against Jos√© Ram√≠rez, and Te√≥fimo L√≥pez retained his WBO junior welterweight title in the event funded by Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority. The article notes the unconventional setting and the uncertainty surrounding Garcia's future in the sport.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in local elections across England, securing control of several councils and winning a parliamentary by-election. Both Labour and the Conservatives experienced substantial losses, with the Liberal Democrats also gaining seats and control of councils. The article highlights Reform UK's victories in traditionally Conservative-controlled areas and Labour's struggles in key regions. The projected national share of the vote indicates a weakening grip of the main parties on voters, with the Conservatives falling to fourth place nationally.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has criticized Germany's decision to designate the far-right AfD party as a "right-wing extremist" group, sparking a diplomatic row. US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, condemned the move, with Rubio calling it "tyranny in disguise." The German Foreign Ministry defended the decision, stating it was based on a thorough investigation to protect the constitution and that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped.

          <p>A New York Times article reveals that water supplies ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire due to the shutdown of the main reservoir for repairs. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power had considered reviving an old reservoir as a temporary solution but failed to complete the project in time. Emails show that the city searched for solutions but couldn't rectify the supply shortage before the fire. The inability to bring either reservoir online undermined the potential water supply, and firefighters reported hydrants running dry in some areas during the blaze.</p>

          <p>International researchers claim to have found a candidate for a ninth planet in our solar system using data from infrared space telescopes. The potential planet's long orbit would enable them to see it move across the sky, and they found 13 pairs of dots that could be explained by a moving planet resembling Planet Nine. However, astronomer Mike Brown, who was part of the original hypothesis team, remains skeptical, stating that the potential planet's orbit would be on a much greater tilt than the solar system's plane. Astronomers will have a closer look using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory on Chile‚Äôs Cerro Pach√≥n mountain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. Judge Beryl Howell framed the targeting of Perkins as an assault on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The ruling permanently blocks the order, which had imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients and causes that Trump disliked. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, the first accuser to testify against Harvey Weinstein at his Manhattan retrial, completed two days of cross-examination marked by emotional outbursts and contentious exchanges with the defense lawyer. Haley recounted the details of the alleged sexual assault, while Weinstein's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, questioned her recollection and suggested she had benefited from her relationship with Weinstein. The judge intervened multiple times to maintain order, and the retrial continues after Weinstein's previous conviction was overturned.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order regarding Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) payments for college athletes after meeting with former Alabama football coach Nick Saban. Saban expressed concerns about the current NIL system and its impact on college sports, leading Trump to direct aides to study the possibility of an executive order. The potential order could upend the evolving landscape of college athletics, which has seen athletes gain the ability to earn money from endorsements and transfer more freely.

          <p>A BBC article explores the increasing number of autism diagnoses and the reasons behind the trend. The article references a study that found an eightfold increase in new autism diagnoses in the UK between 1998 and 2018. Experts suggest that the rise in diagnoses is not necessarily due to an increase in the number of autistic people, but rather changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, particularly among women and adults. The article also highlights the debate surrounding the definition of autism and the diversity of experiences within the autistic community.</p>
