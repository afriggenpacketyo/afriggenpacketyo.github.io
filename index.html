          <h2>Supreme Court Rejects Mexico's Lawsuit Against US Gun Manufacturers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 11:24:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled against Mexico's lawsuit seeking to hold U.S. gun manufacturers accountable for the trafficking of their weapons to Mexican drug cartels. Justice Elena Kagan stated that federal law grants broad immunity to U.S. gun companies, protecting them from Mexico's claims under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005. Mexico argued that the gun companies aided and abetted the illegal flow of weapons across the border, seeking $10 billion in damages and stricter safety measures, but the court found that Mexico did not plausibly allege the required conscious participation in wrongdoing. The decision marks the first time the high court has weighed in on gunmaker immunity, ending Mexico's lawsuit while not affecting the ability to hold those who break the law accountable. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid have frozen $114.5 million allocated for the USAID Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Program, jeopardizing the delivery of nearly a billion dollars' worth of donated medicines. This program, recognized as a cost-effective intervention in global health, relies on partnerships with pharmaceutical companies that donate drugs, contingent on USAID covering distribution costs. Advocates fear that the elimination of the program could lead to the expiration of these drugs and a potential halt in production by pharmaceutical firms. The USAID NTD Program has delivered over 3.3 billion treatments to more than 1.7 billion people, helping 14 countries eliminate at least one NTD. </p>

          <p>Unusually warm temperatures have caused rapid snowmelt in the western US, rivaling record rates and raising concerns about wildfire season. This, combined with reduced staffing and budget constraints due to Trump administration cuts, creates a dangerous scenario. Federal fire crews are short-staffed, and off-season training has been hampered, potentially overwhelming firefighters and incident management teams. Experts fear limited water availability and increased drought conditions will exacerbate the situation, requiring residents in fire-prone areas to prepare contingency plans. </p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has implemented an interest rate cut, marking the eighth reduction in the past year, as the ongoing trade war weighs on the economy. This decision extends the ECB's divergence from the Federal Reserve, which has maintained steady rates since the end of the previous year. The rate cut aims to stimulate economic activity in the Eurozone amidst concerns about the impact of trade tensions on growth and stability. The move reflects the ECB's efforts to navigate challenging economic conditions and support the region's recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation introducing a new travel ban affecting nationals from 12 countries and restricting entry from seven others, citing national security concerns. The ban, set to take effect on June 9, includes exemptions for U.S. permanent residents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, and athletes participating in major sporting events. The selected countries were chosen based on factors such as the presence of terrorists, failure to cooperate on visa security, and high rates of illegal visa overstays. The move follows similar travel bans issued during Trump's first administration, which faced legal challenges but were ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. </p>

          <p>This CNBC article examines how tariffs could affect the price of common goods such as shoes and sweaters, with potential price increases for consumers. Retail consultancy group AlixPartners created pricing models showing that tariffs on products from China and Vietnam could significantly raise costs. For instance, a men's cotton sweater made in China could see a 19% price increase under current tariffs and a 90% spike under higher tariffs. Retailers are using various strategies to offset the cost of tariffs, but the levies could still take a major toll on U.S. households. (not investment advice)</p>
