          <p>China's efforts to strengthen ties with Niger's military government, which took power in 2023, are facing challenges despite Beijing's policy of non-interference. China provided a substantial financial lifeline to Niger in the form of an oil-backed loan. However, relations have been strained due to disputes over salary disparities and contract terminations affecting Chinese oil executives and companies, leading to the expulsion of some executives. Observers suggest that these disputes highlight the limits of China's non-interference policy, which, while intended to avoid entanglement in domestic affairs, can incur economic costs as some nations experience a rise in nationalism. The article also mentions that China's policy entails regime strengthening since Beijing tends to invest heavily in the economic priorities of the regimes or ruling parties in question. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan lags behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership roles. The report acknowledges that current efforts remain insufficient, referencing Japan's low ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. Despite setting a goal in 2003 to raise the share of women in leadership positions to about 30 percent by 2020, the target was delayed due to slow progress. The government plans to intensify efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across various fields. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures suggest that UK companies are holding back on hiring or not replacing departing workers, leading to a decrease in job vacancies. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate slightly increased. This weakening in the labor market is attributed to factors such as increased employer National Insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage. Economists predict that the unemployment rate could rise further as businesses seek to offset increased employment costs. </p>

          <p>A recall on cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded due to a mislabeling issue that poses a serious health risk. The cans, labeled as "zero sugar," were found to contain the full amount of sugar present in regular Dr Pepper, around 39 grams. The recall, affecting 19,203 cases distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, was upgraded to Class II by the FDA. This mislabeling can cause issues for individuals needing to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, potentially leading to hyperglycemia or even fatal ketoacidosis if left untreated. </p>

          <p>Smugglers are exploiting a loophole in Europe's regulatory system to traffic ketamine, swapping it for substances like salt during transit. Ketamine, legally regulated as a medicine in some European countries but classified as a narcotic in others, is being transported across multiple borders to confuse authorities. Criminal gangs are reportedly earning more from ketamine sales than from other illegal drugs, leading to an epidemic of its use. The drug is smuggled from India through countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, before entering the black market. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, aiming to lower the elevated prices of the country's staple food. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with expectations to sell the 2020 rice at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. The move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks in March and April. The farm minister said that the stockpiled rice will be quickly delivered to consumers at lower prices. </p>

          <p>Drug deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a massive reduction in fatal overdose risk among Gen Z. Ages 20 to 29 lowered the risk by 47%, cutting it right in half, with the latest available records showing fentanyl and other drugs killed more than 31,000 people under the age of 35 in 2021, but by last year, that number had plummeted to roughly 16,690 fatal overdoses. Researchers attribute this shift to factors including wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, and less risky drug use among teens and young adults. Despite this positive trend, experts caution that sustaining progress may be difficult, and there is uncertainty surrounding potential funding cuts for addiction services. </p>
