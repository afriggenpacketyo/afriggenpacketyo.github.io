          <p>Eleven adult men escaped from a New Orleans jail on Friday, prompting a full-scale search operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. One inmate, Kendell Myles, charged with attempted second-degree murder, was quickly apprehended in the French Quarter. Ten inmates, including four charged with second-degree murder, remain at large and are considered armed and dangerous. Officials believe the inmates likely had assistance and have changed clothes, urging the public to remain alert but avoid panic. The sheriff's department has launched a full investigation into the escape to determine how it occurred and hold those responsible accountable.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced plans to reduce the Fed's headcount by 10% over the next few years, citing the need to consolidate functions and modernize business practices. The reduction will include offering a voluntary deferred resignation program to eligible employees. This move comes as the Trump administration pushes for cost cuts across civil service agencies, though Powell's memo did not explicitly mention this as a factor. The Fed's 2023 annual report indicated nearly 24,000 employees, meaning the reduction would bring the number below 22,000.</p>

          <p>Staff employees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts are moving to unionize, citing job insecurity following major changes initiated by the Trump administration. Over 150 employees across various departments, including education and arts programming, express concerns about the institution's future. They aim to restore stability, improve transparency, and enhance communication from leadership, which they claim has been lacking. The unionization effort follows layoffs and restructuring after President Trump appointed himself as chairman of the Board of Trustees and dismissed key executives, with staff reporting a decline in ticket sales and a lack of information about ongoing changes.</p>

          <p>US prosecutors are considering dropping a criminal charge against Boeing related to the two 737 Max crashes, opting for a non-prosecution agreement. This move would avoid a trial over the criminal fraud charge, which was scheduled to begin in June, after a judge rejected an earlier settlement. Lawyers representing families of the crash victims expressed deep disappointment, arguing that Boeing has never stood trial for the loss of 346 lives. They accuse the Department of Justice of letting Boeing off too lightly with just a financial penalty.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts to fund President Trump's agenda are causing concern among low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. An analysis estimates that the cuts could increase the number of uninsured by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While some Republicans insist the cuts will only eliminate fraud and waste, beneficiaries fear losing essential services like nursing home care and medication. Some individuals worry about having to choose between healthcare and basic necessities if coverage is reduced or lost, and work requirements could further complicate access to care.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million.

The event has drawn criticism from Democrats, who view it as a wasteful display of ego, while the White House defends it as a fitting tribute to the military's service and sacrifice.</p>

The debt relief follows the lifting of US sanctions on Syria by President Trump and a meeting between Trump and Syria's new president.

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to the Middle East focused on securing deals and investments for the United States, with Gulf states obliging through arms deals, investments, and the purchase of Boeing planes. Qatar gifted Trump a 747 to replace Air Force One, a gesture met with criticism due to potential violations of the Emoluments Clause. Trump's approach prioritized transactions over discussions about democracy or human rights, focusing on a Middle East defined by commerce and technology. The trip also touched on issues such as Syria, Iran, Gaza, and Ukraine, with Trump making promises about ending wars but facing challenges with key leaders.</p>

          <p>Boeing may avoid criminal responsibility for its role in the deadly 737 Max crashes, with the Justice Department considering a deal that would allow the company to avoid pleading guilty. The agreement would involve Boeing agreeing to concessions, including contributing to a victims fund, without admitting guilt. Lawyers for the families of the victims are deeply disappointed and will fight the deal in court. This represents a potential reversal in the effort to hold Boeing accountable for the crashes.</p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners, halting the bill's progress. The hard-liners, including Reps. Clyde, Brecheen, Smucker, Norman, and Roy, voted against clearing the bill, citing concerns that the savings in the legislation don't take effect until after Trump leaves office. This move is a setback for Speaker Johnson and Trump, who had called for unity behind the bill. Negotiations will continue, but the delay presents a challenge for passing the bill before the Memorial Day recess.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a setback as conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee, citing insufficient spending cuts. Five Republicans voted against advancing the legislation, which would extend tax cuts while enacting new ones, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The bill's timeline for implementing work requirements for Medicaid recipients also drew criticism. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to putting the legislation on the floor before Memorial Day, despite the disagreements within his party.</p>
