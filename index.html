          <p>A suicide bomber detonated explosives inside the Mar Elias Church in Dweil'a, Syria, during a prayer service, resulting in at least 12 fatalities and numerous injuries, according to Syrian state media. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported a higher death toll. The attack, the first of its kind in Syria in years, occurred as the government attempts to gain the support of minorities amidst concerns about extremist sleeper cells. The Syrian Interior Ministry attributed the attack to an extremist from the Islamic State group, who fired at the people before detonating himself, while Church Bishop Moussa Khoury said the attacker also threw a grenade into the church during the afternoon Mass. Security forces and first responders rushed to the scene, where panicked survivors wailed amidst the debris and blood.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Jacob Olidort, an expert on the Middle East and U.S. national security, suggests Iran may attempt a "face-saving" retaliation, but lacks the capacity for a significant escalation. Olidort anticipates potential cyber-attacks or attacks on regional infrastructure, noting Iran's weakened state after Israeli strikes on its nuclear and missile sites. He estimates the U.S. operation could set back Iran's nuclear program by up to a decade, depending on future actions and agreements. The U.S. launched a surprise strike on Iranâ€™s Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear facilities using B-2 stealth bombers, and the full extent of the damage is still being assessed.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance asserted that the U.S. is not at war with Iran, but rather with "Iran's nuclear program," following U.S. strikes on three of the country's nuclear sites. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Iran's "nuclear ambitions have been obliterated" after the strikes on facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated Iran reserves all options to defend itself, raising concerns about regional escalation. Vance emphasized the U.S. seeks peace, but only in the context of Iran not possessing nuclear weapons, expressing confidence the recent actions have substantially delayed their nuclear weapon development.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the U.S. is prepared to meet with Iran following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, emphasizing the strikes aimed to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions, not to attack the Iranian people or pursue regime change.

He warned of consequences if Iran chooses a path other than diplomacy, asserting that the U.S. will defend its personnel and impose costs if Iran attacks American personnel, whether directly or through proxies. Rubio also addressed concerns about Iran potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, calling it a "suicidal" move.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher on Sunday following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Egypt's EGX30 index was a major regional gainer, closing significantly higher. An expert suggested the Gulf region's call for appeasement and condemnation of Israeli aggression has helped it isolate itself from the conflict, minimizing short-term market impact.

          <p>Iran's parliament approved a measure endorsing the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil transportation route, following U.S. airstrikes in Iran. The decision, however, ultimately rests with Iran's Supreme National Security Council. Around 20% of the world's oil and gas flow through the strait, and its closure could lead to rising fuel costs. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned against closing the strait, calling it an escalation of conflict.</p>

          <p>Kevin Durant is reportedly being traded from the Phoenix Suns to the Houston Rockets, with the Suns receiving Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No 10 pick in this yearâ€™s draft, and five second-round picks in return. Durant averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 4.2 assists for the Suns in 62 games in 2024-25. The Rockets would be Durantâ€™s fifth team, and he can sign a two-year extension worth up to $122m when the new league year starts in July. The Rockets finished second in the Western Conference but were eliminated by the Warriors in the first round of the playoffs.</p>

          <p>A Florida homeowner is facing a potential $5,000 fine for having grass that is 8 inches tall, despite the lack of a specific law about grass height in her area. The homeowner, who lives outside an homeowners association, says this was her second violation, and city code enforcement warned that a third could escalate to the Code Enforcement Board and result in a fine of up to $5,000. The city couldn't point to any clear rule she broke, with the enforcement officer basing violations on comparisons to neighboring properties. She is exploring converting her yard into a certified Florida native habitat, which is protected under Florida's SB 82 (2019) and other landscaping laws.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Hamas and the Houthis have vowed retaliation, raising fears of a wider regional conflict. President Trump had said Thursday that he would decide within two weeks whether to get involved. Iran had pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, and President Trump reiterated his stern warning to the Islamic Republic on Saturday night against targeting any U.S. assets in the region. There are roughly 40,000 American troops deployed in the Middle East, many of them based within easy striking distance of Iran's missiles.</p>

          <p>Spain has reached an agreement with NATO to be excluded from the alliance's 5% of GDP defense spending target, according to Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Sanchez stated that a 5% spending would be disproportionate and unnecessary for Spain, which can meet its NATO commitments with 2.1% of its GDP. The agreement comes after Spain initially opposed the increased spending target, raising concerns about derailing the upcoming NATO summit. Spain had the lowest proportion of expenditure on defense in the alliance last year, estimated at 1.28% of GDP.</p>

The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a "geofenced area" in Austin. The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to one analyst.</p>

The deal was reached after Spain secured an exemption, claiming the rise to 5% was "disproportionate and unnecessary." The agreement calls for at least 3.5% of national GDP to be spent on core military needs, while an additional 1.5% can be allocated for related expenditures.
