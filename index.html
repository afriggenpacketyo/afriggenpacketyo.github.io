          <p>Amani Golugwa, the Deputy Secretary General of CHADEMA, Tanzania's main opposition party, was arrested at Julius Nyerere International Airport while attempting to travel to Brussels for an International Democracy Union conference. Police claim Golugwa has a history of circumventing legal procedures when leaving and returning to the country, and are investigating the matter. The arrest is the latest in a series of actions targeting the opposition party as Tanzania prepares for elections in October, with human rights groups accusing President Samia Suluhu Hassan's government of repression. The IDU condemned the arrest and called for Golugwa's immediate release and global pressure on Tanzania to uphold human rights.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with key components of their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, including significant Medicaid cuts, despite facing resistance from within their own party. The bill proposes imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients, increasing the frequency of eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to undocumented immigrants. While the Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save $880 billion over the next decade, it also projects that at least 8.6 million more Americans will become uninsured.

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he will place holds on President Trump's Justice Department nominees in response to the Qatari government's offer to donate a jet for the president's use.

He is requesting the Justice Department disclose all activities by Qatari foreign agents inside the U.S. that could benefit Trump or his family's organization, and is demanding Attorney General Pam Bondi testify before Congress.</p>

This is part of an effort to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill. The bill includes a "community engagement requirement," mandating at least 80 hours per month of work, volunteer work, or educational program enrollment. Exceptions exist for those under 19, pregnant women, and those under postpartum medical care.

State leaders are expressing alarm about the budgetary fallout from President Trump’s economic agenda, warning that they will not be able to pick up the bill if the federal government reduces its funding for major public services. Republicans have framed their thinking as a matter of fiscal necessity and federalism, arguing that states should shoulder more of the financial burden for their citizens at a time when the national debt exceeds $36 trillion.

In 2008, Sullivan applied to the CCRC for help, specifically asking if it would look for DNA evidence that could exonerate him, but the available test was limited and the CCRC was told by forensic scientists that they were unlikely to be able to recover any useful DNA, so his application was rejected.</p>
