          <p>The Trump administration escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to block new federal grants, citing concerns over antisemitism, affirmative action policies, and a perceived lack of viewpoint diversity. Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent a contentious letter to Harvard's president, Alan M. Garber, accusing the university of "disastrous mismanagement" and betraying its ideals. This action follows Harvard's lawsuit challenging the government's decision to cut research funding. The administration's move is a shift in tactics, potentially signaling a more organized attack on elite universities perceived as hostile to conservatives. The loss of federal research dollars could significantly impact Harvard's finances, as federally sponsored research accounts for a substantial portion of its revenue.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is set to launch a program offering illegal aliens commercial flights and a $1,000 stipend to encourage self-deportation from the United States. This initiative aims to reduce costs for American taxpayers, as the DHS estimates that deporting an individual currently costs over $17,000, while self-deportation with the stipend would cost around $4,500. Illegal aliens can access this assistance through the CBP Home self-deportation app, and the stipend will be paid upon verification of departure. DHS anticipates a significant increase in self-removals as a result of this announcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine may offer protection against heart disease. Researchers found that individuals who received the vaccine had a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The protective effect was particularly notable in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. While the study focused on a live zoster vaccine, the findings suggest potential benefits for heart health beyond preventing shingles. The CDC recommends the shingles vaccine for adults aged 50 and older.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an anticipated $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs. The automaker expects to offset $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion. Ford cited near-term risks such as potential supply chain disruptions and the possibility of increased tariffs as reasons for pulling its guidance. The tariff impact is less than that projected by General Motors, as Ford imports fewer vehicles. The automotive industry is currently dealing with 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA, citing ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport and broader issues affecting the East Coast. Schumer pointed to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, budget cuts, and outdated technology as contributing factors. He also questioned the FAA's decision to offer bonuses to air traffic controllers at certain towers but not in high-need areas like New York. The FAA acknowledged the problems, attributing them to an antiquated air traffic control system and the stress it places on controllers.

This is the first time the Trump administration has taken a position on the challenge involving mifepristone, which was initially filed by anti-abortion rights groups.

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is facing scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by allegedly coordinating with a super PAC through a practice known as "red-boxing." Cuomo's campaign website featured a page with detailed spending instructions and strategic information that appeared to align with the super PAC's advertising efforts. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned campaigns about the new rules targeting red-boxing, which prohibits candidates from directly communicating with outside groups. If found in violation, Cuomo could face penalties and lose public matching funds.</p>

          <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has moved to drop its appeal of a ruling that allowed KalshiEx, a commodities exchange, to offer bets on the outcomes of U.S. political elections. The agreement requires both sides to bear their own costs and attorney fees, and for Kalshi to waive all legal claims arising from the litigation. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour hailed the decision as a victory for prediction markets. However, the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets criticized the CFTC's decision, calling it a "stark betrayal of the public interest."</p>
