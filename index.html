          <p>An alleged airstrike by Myanmar's military has resulted in the deaths of numerous students at two private schools in Rakhine state. The Arakan Army, an ethnic armed group in conflict with the ruling junta, reported that the attack on a village it controls killed 19 students and wounded 22 others. This event is part of the broader armed conflict that has engulfed Myanmar since the military coup in 2021. The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, has condemned the incident as a "brutal attack," highlighting the severe impact of the ongoing violence on civilians and children.</p>

          <p>An animal shelter in Billings, Montana, faces an uncertain future after its staff was hospitalized due to exposure to methamphetamine smoke. The incident occurred when the FBI used the shelter's incinerator, typically for animal carcasses, to destroy two pounds of seized narcotics. A ventilation issue caused the smoke to fill the building, leading to the evacuation of 14 workers and 75 animals. The shelter remains closed pending contamination testing, and staff members have reported lingering health symptoms, raising questions about the safety protocols for drug disposal near public facilities.</p>

          <p>Facing declining sales and a nearly $3 million operating loss, the Girl Scouts of the USA are introducing a new cookie flavor called "Exploremores." Inspired by rocky road ice cream, the new treat is intended to boost interest and revenue following the discontinuation of two other flavors and rising cookie prices. The organization has also seen a significant drop in membership since the pandemic and plans to increase dues. The new cookie has sparked online debate, with some expressing excitement while others raise concerns about allergens and the need for more inclusive options.</p>

          <p>New documents suggest that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who has been accused of mortgage fraud, declared her Atlanta property as a "vacation home." This information, found on a loan estimate from her credit union, appears to counter allegations that she improperly claimed two different properties as her primary residence to gain tax and mortgage benefits. The controversy is part of a larger political battle over the independence of the Federal Reserve. Cook has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has filed a lawsuit to prevent her dismissal by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Fast-food chains are losing their morning customers to convenience stores, which are investing heavily in their prepared food offerings. In the three months ending in July, breakfast traffic to fast-food restaurants grew by only 1%, while visits to food-focused convenience stores like Wawa and Casey's surged by 9%. Consumers are drawn to the variety, perceived value, and quality of c-store options, which often include made-to-order items and a wider selection of beverages. This trend marks a reversal, as fast-food giants like McDonald's now look to convenience stores for strategies to boost their struggling breakfast sales.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-sharing company of systematic discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The lawsuit alleges that Uber violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by refusing service to individuals with service animals or wheelchairs, improperly charging fees, and failing to train drivers on ADA compliance. This legal action follows a 2022 settlement where Uber compensated users for charging wait-time fees to disabled riders. Uber has stated that it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for service denials.</p>

World Athletics defends the policy as necessary for protecting women's sport, but critics argue the SRY test is an unreliable indicator of biological advantage and raises ethical concerns.

          <p>The U.S. economy is showing signs of heading toward stagflation, a rare combination of stagnant growth and rising inflation, which some economists blame on Trump administration policies. Recent data reveals a slowdown in job growth alongside an increase in the inflation rate to 2.9%, creating a challenging scenario for the Federal Reserve. Economists point to tariffs, which raise consumer prices, and crackdowns on immigration, which shrink the labor supply, as key drivers. This situation complicates economic management, as traditional tools like interest rate adjustments are less effective when both unemployment and inflation are concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of scientists is advocating for Chagas disease, spread by 'kissing bugs,' to be treated as an endemic disease in the United States, not just a condition found in Latin America. The disease, which can cause serious heart and digestive problems years after infection, is often unheard of by the American public and many physicians, leading to underreporting and lack of awareness. The report, published in a CDC journal, notes that local transmission has occurred in at least eight states.

          <p>According to Google Flights and other travel experts, the single most effective strategy for securing cheap airfare is to be flexible with travel dates. Flying midweek, specifically on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays, can be significantly cheaper than weekend travel, with potential savings of around 13-14% on domestic flights. Experts also advise traveling during a destination's off-season or shoulder season to find better deals. The long-held myth that booking on a specific day of the week, like Tuesday, yields the best prices is largely debunked, as the day of travel has a much greater impact on cost.</p>

The book's editors argue that this history of cooperation and shared interests has been lost in the current climate of intense competition and distrust. They aim to remind readers of the mutual benefits that arose from engagement, a policy now viewed with skepticism in both nations.</p>

          <p>Nikos Michaloliakos, the founder and leader of Greece's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, has been released from prison to serve the rest of his 13-year sentence at home. The 67-year-old was convicted in 2020 for running a criminal organization linked to violent attacks and the murder of an anti-fascist musician. A judicial council approved his conditional release on health grounds after he served less than half of his sentence. The decision has sparked outrage among left-wing parties, who argue it sends a message of impunity for fascism and undermines justice.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to Washington, has been recalled after newly published emails revealed the depth of his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The emails showed Mandelson offering support to Epstein after his 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor, which the British government deemed "new information" that was materially different from what was known at his appointment. This marks Mandelson's third forced departure from a government position over ethical concerns and adds to a series of scandals plaguing Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which had initially defended the ambassador.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, some historians are drawing parallels between the current political moment in the U.S. and the divisive 1850s that preceded the Civil War. Scholars note similarities in widespread disillusionment with the Supreme Court, spasms of political violence, and the rise of paramilitary-like political movements. While cautioning that today's fractures are not as deep as in the 19th century, they point to the paranoid reactions to violence as a dangerous echo of the past. The experts emphasize that the key lesson from that era is the imperative to de-escalate tensions to avoid conflict.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece posits that President Biden's decision to run for a second term acted as a roadblock for the next generation of Democratic leaders, including Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom. The author references Biden's 2020 statement framing himself as a "bridge" to future leaders, suggesting he initially signaled a one-term presidency. By delaying his exit, Biden left his successor with only 107 days to mount a full presidential campaign. The column suggests that critiques from Harris about her challenges should be seen as constructive feedback for a party that needs to understand why it struggled in 2024.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica has declared a state of fiscal distress, citing a combination of post-pandemic economic struggles and hundreds of millions of dollars in legal settlements. The city has already paid $229 million to settle claims of sexual abuse by a former police dispatcher and still faces 180 more. This financial strain is compounded by declining tourism, retail revenue, and business departures from its downtown area. The declaration has raised concerns about potential layoffs among city employees, though officials state the move is intended to seek aid and realign operations rather than cut staff.</p>
