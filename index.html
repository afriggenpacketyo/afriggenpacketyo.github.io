        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, after appearing at the U.S. Open, defended his rhetoric regarding federal intervention in major cities, stating his goal is to "clean them up" rather than go to war. This follows a social media post he shared depicting an AI-generated image titled "Chipocalypse Now," which threatened to show Chicago why the Department of Defense was renamed the Department of War. Despite data showing lower crime rates in Chicago compared to some cities in red states, Trump has continued to single it out, prompting strong criticism from local Democratic leaders who accuse him of authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas defended Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as a "disrupter" at the CDC, stating he is working to restore trust in the agency. Marshall, a former OB-GYN, argued that not every person needs every vaccine and emphasized empowering parents and doctors to make individualized healthcare decisions. He pushed back against criticism from fellow Republican senators, asserting that the distrust in the CDC originated from its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, not from current policies making vaccines more bespoke.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts safety Cam Bynum went viral after performing a bizarre celebration following an interception against the Miami Dolphins. Known for his elaborate post-play antics, Bynum ran towards his end zone and began flailing his body around, capturing the attention of the NFL world. The safety, who joined the Colts after four seasons with the Vikings, has previously stated that making big plays earns players the right to have fun and express joy on the field. His past celebrations have included emulating an Olympic breakdancer and recreating a dance from the movie "White Chicks."</p>

          <p>Leaders of major UK trade unions are warning the government against watering down its proposed Employment Rights Bill, a significant piece of legislation intended to ban zero-hours contracts and enhance protections against unfair dismissal. Concerns have been amplified following a cabinet reshuffle that saw key proponents of the bill, including Angela Rayner, moved from their positions. Union leaders fear ministers may delay or weaken the bill as a concession to business interests amid economic strain, and they have vowed to campaign furiously against any such changes.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a formidable and proudly liberal force in California politics for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. Known for his pro-labor stance and often profane, passionate demeanor, Burton was instrumental in shaping state policy on welfare, foster care, and environmental issues. He served as a state assemblyman, a congressman, and the powerful Senate president pro tem, leaving a lasting legacy that helped establish Democratic dominance in California.

          <p>Microsoft has confirmed that its Azure cloud services are experiencing disruptions due to cuts in undersea fiber optic cables located in the Red Sea. The damage is causing increased latency and delays for internet traffic routed through the Middle East, affecting users in several countries, including India and Pakistan. While the cause of the cuts has not been specified, Microsoft has rerouted traffic through alternative paths to mitigate the impact. These subsea cables are a critical part of the global internet infrastructure, transmitting vast amounts of data between continents.</p>

          <p>After numerous sightings since 2019, police in the Czech Republic have arrested the driver of a Formula 1-style racing car seen on a public motorway. The 51-year-old man was tracked to his home after the red, Ferrari-liveried car was spotted again on the D4 motorway. Police had previously questioned the owner in 2019 but could not press charges because the helmeted driver could not be identified. The vehicle is believed to be a Dallara GP2 car, and the owner now faces fines for driving an unroadworthy vehicle.</p>

          <p>The advancement of artificial intelligence is raising concerns that the traditional corporate career ladder may be disappearing as AI systems begin to replace entry-level jobs. A study found a 50% decline in new roles for recent graduates at major tech firms since 2019, suggesting that the first rung of the career ladder is being removed. This trend could reshape how organizations develop talent and may end the classic narrative of rising from a junior position to a leadership role. The shift puts pressure on new graduates to acquire advanced skills independently before entering the workforce.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that concerns about the negative impact of tariffs on small businesses, particularly the end of the "de minimis" exemption for purchases under $800, may be overstated. The article argues that this specific policy change affects only a small minority of the 33 million small businesses in the U.S., most of which are service-based and do not import goods. The author contends that the more critical economic indicators to watch are consumer income and wealth, which determine whether people can absorb the resulting price increases from tariffs.

The vessel was made from mycelium, the root-like network of fungi, cultivated on a hemp substrate inside a kayak-shaped mold. The 12-hour journey marks the world's longest open-water crossing in such a boat and aims to highlight the potential of fungal materials as a biodegradable and sustainable alternative to plastics used in marine recreation.

The majority of arrests were made under the Terrorism Act for allegedly supporting a proscribed organization. Police reported that the protest turned violent, with 17 officers assaulted, a claim disputed by organizers who stated they were peacefully defying the ban. The government proscribed Palestine Action in July, making it a criminal offense to be a member or show support for the group.</p>
