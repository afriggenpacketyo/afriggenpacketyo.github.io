          <h2>Singapore's July Inflation Rate Falls to 0.6%, Reaching Lowest Point Since Early 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:39:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest point since January 2021, as the city-state braces for slower economic growth later this year. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%, below forecasts. This moderation is primarily attributed to falling prices in retail, other goods, and electricity and gas, with private transport costs still rising due to higher car prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates inflation will remain modest in the near term, influenced by easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. The central bank has already adjusted its monetary policy twice this year, signaling proactive measures to manage the economic outlook amid a downshift in the global trade environment and rising trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly criticized the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, labeling it an unconstitutional affront to his appointment powers and alleging it gives Democrats veto power over his judicial nominees. He urged Senator Chuck Grassley to abandon the century-old custom, which Grassley defends as a norm for maintaining balance and state input. Trump's frustration is heightened by a recent ruling against an acting U.S. attorney, and he believes only Democrats are confirmed in states with a single Democratic Senator. This article details Trump's ongoing pressure campaign, which could significantly impact future judicial vacancies and appointments in the months ahead.</p>

          <p>A limited number of National Guard members in Washington D.C., fewer than 50, have been authorized to carry their service weapons starting Sunday night, as directed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This move marks an escalation in President Trump's law enforcement crackdown in the nation's capital, despite local officials stating that violent crime has been declining. The troops are operating under established Rules for the Use of Force, permitting force only as a last resort against imminent threats. This article highlights the significant shift from previous directives where Guard members were unarmed, prompting questions about their changing role in the city.</p>

          <p>Global labor markets are experiencing a significant shift from the "Great Resignation" to a "Great Stay," where fewer employees are voluntarily leaving their jobs. This trend is accompanied by a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze, as employers become hesitant to make hiring or firing decisions due to economic uncertainty. While initial U.S. jobless claims remain low, the momentum in hiring is clearly slowing, with July seeing weaker-than-expected nonfarm payroll growth. This article explains how the U.S. and U.K. are both observing this cautious environment, with businesses awaiting more economic confidence before expanding workforces.</p>
