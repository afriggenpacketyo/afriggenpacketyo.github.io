          <p>Congressional Republicans are struggling to pass 12 individual appropriations bills to fund the government and enact spending cuts before the September 30 deadline. The House and Senate are at odds over spending levels, and partisan divisions are making a bipartisan agreement difficult, increasing the likelihood of a temporary stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution. This situation creates a tense legislative environment, as failure to reach a deal could lead to a partial government shutdown, a scenario both parties are trying to navigate amidst political polarization.

          <p>A new law has been passed in the UK establishing an independent regulator to oversee the top five divisions of men's football in England. This body, a key recommendation from a fan-led review, aims to improve financial sustainability and prevent clubs from joining breakaway leagues like the European Super League. The regulator will also give fans a greater say in club decisions, such as changes to team colors or stadium locations, marking a significant shift in the governance of the sport.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, is scheduled for sentencing after being convicted of federal civil rights violations connected to the 2020 raid that resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor. A jury found Hankison guilty of using excessive force by blindly firing shots into Taylor's apartment through a covered door and window. The Justice Department's recommendation of only one day in prison has drawn sharp criticism from Taylor's family and civil rights advocates, who argue it undermines the verdict and fails to deliver meaningful accountability.</p>

When asked directly, all three university officials affirmed that denying the Jewish people's right to self-determination—a core tenet of Zionism—is a form of antisemitism. The author contends this acknowledgment helps separate legitimate criticism of Israeli policy from the delegitimization of Israel's existence. This distinction can foster more productive campus dialogue focused on actions rather than existence.</p>

For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500 annually, while the lifetime limit for all undergraduate loans is $31,000.

The recall, issued by three manufacturers in conjunction with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, affects pools 48 inches or taller with external compression straps. These straps can inadvertently create footholds, allowing children to climb into the pools even when the ladder is removed. Owners are urged to secure or drain their pools and contact the manufacturers for a free repair kit.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks targeting a critical vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software, affecting organizations globally. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to gain full access to SharePoint content and execute malicious code, posing a significant risk. Security researchers noted that once inside, hackers can steal sensitive data, deploy backdoors, and harvest passwords. While Microsoft has released patches for some versions of the software, the widespread use of SharePoint by businesses and governments makes this a serious and ongoing threat.</p>

In an opinion piece, the former New York City mayor described Kennedy as a "peddler of junk science" whose actions are undermining public confidence in vaccines during a historic measles outbreak. Bloomberg argues that Kennedy's leadership has led to needless suffering and death, and he holds the Republicans who confirmed him accountable, warning they will face consequences at the ballot box if they fail to act.</p>

Mosquera had claimed he killed one man in self-defense, but the jury convicted him on both murder counts after being shown what the judge described as "terrible, brutal" video evidence.

The allegation adds to the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Epstein investigation, as an Epstein accuser has also recently recalled telling the FBI about a past encounter with Trump.</p>
