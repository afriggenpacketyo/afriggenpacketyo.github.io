          <p>Following Liverpool's Premier League victory over Tottenham Hotspur, new manager Arne Slot acknowledged Jurgen Klopp's significant contributions to the team's success. Slot, the first Dutch coach to achieve this feat, expressed his appreciation for the culture, work ethic, and quality instilled by Klopp and Pep Lijnders. He humorously adapted a fan chant in Klopp's honor, recognizing the foundation built by his predecessor. Slot also admitted that while a top-four finish was the initial aim, the team's performance exceeded expectations, especially given Manchester City's unexpected struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

While tech stocks remain significant dividend contributors, investors can diversify and limit tech exposure through dividend ETFs.

          <p>China's coastguard seized a tiny sandbank, Sandy Cay, in the South China Sea, triggering a response from the Philippines, which landed on three sandbanks and prompting concern from the White House.

The move coincides with joint US-Philippine military drills, criticized by China as provocative. The US has reaffirmed its commitment to its alliance with the Philippines amid growing tensions in the region, where China claims a vast portion of the South China Sea. </p>

          <p>A recent Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport, which resulted in fatalities, has been attributed to a combination of factors including the use of 'visual separation'. The crew requested and received permission to navigate around other aircraft visually rather than relying on air traffic control. This practice, while common, carries inherent risks if not properly executed. Aviation experts have long cautioned about the dangers associated with mishandling visual separation, which ultimately played a role in the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>A senior figure from South Africa's ruling ANC party has asserted the country's sovereignty amid rising tensions with the United States concerning race relations and a new land law. The US President has criticized South Africa's new expropriation law, suggesting it could allow the government to seize land from ethnic minority Afrikaners without compensation. The ANC official criticized South African citizens who have called on Trump to "punish" the country, highlighting the complexities of the relationship between the two nations. South Africa has appointed a special envoy to Washington to address diplomatic and trade priorities.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed President Trump's trade negotiation strategies but admitted uncertainty about direct communication between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Bessent defended Trump's approach of "strategic uncertainty" in trade negotiations, emphasizing the use of tariffs as leverage. He projected that a trade deal with China could take months, contingent on "good behavior" from negotiating partners. Bessent also addressed investor confidence in the US economy, attributing recent market fluctuations to short-term noise rather than a fundamental loss of confidence.</p>

          <p>Republicans in North Carolina are pursuing legal challenges to overturn a state Supreme Court election result, despite failing to do so on a larger scale after the 2020 presidential election. The current legal battle focuses on a smaller number of ballots, but the outcome remains uncertain. Legal experts from both parties express concern that the case could establish a precedent for nullifying votes based on technicalities, even when voters followed instructions. The case highlights the ongoing efforts to challenge election results and potentially reinterpret voting laws.</p>
