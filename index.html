        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell by a Chinese-led research team has traced the evolutionary history of the potato back nine million years. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists discovered that the modern potato originated from an ancient hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a tuberless, potato-like plant. This research suggests that this cross-species event was the key driver for the development of tubers, the edible part of the potato. The findings provide significant new insights into the origins of one of the world's most important staple food crops.</p>

The 33-year-old captain, who recently led the team to its first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League, expressed the need for a new environment to challenge himself. While his next destination is unconfirmed, there is speculation he may join Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC.

          <p>Los Angeles FC defeated Mexican club Pachuca 4-2 in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in their Leagues Cup match, but the result leaves them on the brink of elimination from the tournament. Despite securing two points for the win, LAFC's total of three points from two matches is unlikely to be enough to advance to the quarterfinals from the 18-team MLS group. The match was eventful, with Dennis Bouanga scoring early for LAFC before an equalizer from Pachuca's Elías Montiel. Both teams finished the game with ten men after receiving red cards.</p>

          <p>Authorities in southwestern Montana are continuing a search for a man suspected of killing four people in a shooting at a bar in the city of Anaconda. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, allegedly opened fire at The Owl Bar before fleeing the scene and is considered armed and dangerous. Police have located the suspect's vehicle but he was not inside, prompting a concentrated search along a highway west of the city. Residents in the area have been urged to remain indoors and on high alert as the manhunt continues.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has maintained a lower court's injunction against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) use of "roving patrols" in Southern California. The ruling affirms that agents cannot conduct stops without reasonable suspicion that an individual is in the country illegally, and that such suspicion cannot be based solely on factors like race or location. The court rejected the government's argument that the injunction would irreparably harm its enforcement efforts. This decision is a significant setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation strategy in seven Southern California counties.</p>

While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel safe, experts advise on the options available for concerned travelers. Standard travel insurance policies typically cover cancellations or curtailments only if official advice changes to "do not travel," though some premium policies offer more flexibility. Airlines are required to provide care for significant delays or cancellations but are unlikely to offer compensation for disruptions caused by wildfires, as they are considered "extraordinary circumstances." Travelers are encouraged to communicate directly with their holiday providers for potential bespoke solutions.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's brand, Skims, has released a new facial shapewear mask, capitalizing on a social media trend of extreme bedtime beauty routines. The product, which retails for £52 and sold out quickly, is marketed to provide a "sculpted" jawline but has drawn criticism for promoting unrealistic beauty standards. Medical professionals state there is no scientific evidence for the mask's long-term effectiveness, warning that it may only offer temporary de-puffing and could cause skin irritation. Critics argue that such products can negatively impact self-esteem, particularly among young consumers, by suggesting that natural features need to be altered.</p>

          <p>China's General Administration of Customs has tightened import regulations for durians from Vietnam after detecting significant health risks in previous shipments. The new rules mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require qualified test reports to accompany the fruit, following the discovery of harmful levels of the organic compound alkaline yellow and the metal cadmium. Under the stricter protocol, all incoming batches of Vietnamese durians will be tested, with any non-compliant shipments being returned or destroyed. The measure has already led to a substantial decrease in the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China.</p>

          <p>A jury in Miami has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages after finding the company partially liable for a 2019 crash that killed one person and severely injured another. The incident occurred when a Tesla Model S, with its Autopilot system engaged, ran through an intersection and struck the victims. The plaintiffs' lawyers successfully argued that Tesla's Autopilot technology failed, as it did not restrict its use to controlled-access highways and should have disengaged when the driver became distracted. Tesla has called the verdict "wrong" and announced its intention to appeal, maintaining the driver was solely responsible.</p>

This solar-driven climate regime is believed to contribute to the observed pattern of "south drought and north flooding."

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant seasonal rise in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from one to as many as fifteen. The increase is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing stingrays closer to shore, coinciding with hot weather that brings more people to the beach. The area near the San Gabriel River, known locally as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant.

          <p>An analysis by the Trump administration's own Environmental Protection Agency indicates that its plan to roll back greenhouse gas emission standards will lead to higher gasoline prices and significant job losses. While the EPA claimed the deregulation would save consumers money, data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency cited in the report projects that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles will increase demand for gasoline, thus raising prices for all consumers. The analysis also projects a loss of 450,000 jobs by 2035 as a result of repealing the Biden-era fuel efficiency and emissions policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended President Trump's decision to fire the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, stating the president has "real concerns" about the accuracy of federal economic data. The defense came after Trump dismissed Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report that showed a hiring slowdown and large downward revisions to previous months' data. Greer suggested that large swings in the jobs numbers, which have occurred previously, were the basis for the president's concerns. The firing has been widely criticized by economists and former officials as a dangerous and groundless move that undermines the credibility of nonpartisan government statistics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's executive order increasing tariffs on imports is expected to raise consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on most countries, the average U.S. tariff rate has reached its highest level in decades, potentially costing American households over $2,000 annually. Economists warn that prices for common imports like clothing, furniture, and cars are likely to rise as companies can no longer absorb the costs. The lack of clear implementation details for the new trade agreements is further complicating business planning and supply-chain management. (not investment advice)</p>

The eatery, known for its classic Southern fare like fried chicken and hoecakes, became a landmark after a glowing USA Today review in 1999 led to Deen's Food Network career. In a statement, Deen announced the closure was a heartfelt decision made with her sons and that they would now focus on their Paula Deen's Family Kitchen franchise locations.

          <p>President Trump has escalated his public attacks on the U.S. Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, urging the board to seize control if Powell does not cut interest rates.

The attacks come as Trump's administration faces scrutiny over its aggressive tariff policies. The move to pressure the Fed on monetary policy has heightened concerns about political interference in the nation's economic management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Soldiers returning from the frontlines in Ukraine are suffering from a specific form of psychological trauma, dubbed "droneophobia," linked to the constant, high-pitched whine of FPV drones. This article details how the ubiquitous sound of these hunting drones has become a source of acute stress and panic, with everyday noises like lawnmowers and air conditioners acting as triggers. Psychiatrists at Kyiv's military hospital report a surge in patients with mental health injuries from being under constant drone activity. The phenomenon highlights how the evolution of warfare technology is creating new and insidious forms of long-term psychological distress for combatants.</p>

These moves suggest a potential thaw as both Asian powers navigate global trade wars and shifting strategic alliances.
