          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, contingent on inflation remaining under control. In a CNBC interview, Waller stated that the Fed should move slowly to ease rates to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market. He emphasized the importance of acting preemptively rather than waiting for a significant economic downturn before cutting rates. Waller's comments led to gains in stock market futures, although it remains uncertain whether his position will garner widespread support within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for thunderstorms. The warning covers parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales, with potential for flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is in place, with concerns about pressures on health and social care services. While the current heat is record-breaking for 2025, it remains below the June peak of 35.6C in 1976.</p>

          <p>The national conversation around clean energy has been dominated by cost, and the same is true for households. Greener options need to be simple and affordable, rather than another thing for people to worry about. For many, the increase in their home electricity bills can be a concern when making the move to an EV, plus they worry about the cost and reliability of being able to charge when they're away from home. Solutions are emerging to help with such cost challenges and anxieties, however.</p>

          <p>China's export shipments of magnets to the US experienced a sharp decline in May, plummeting by 93.3% year-on-year, following export controls imposed by Beijing. The total export of magnets, which dominate China's critical minerals shipments, also fell significantly. This decline has put pressure on US manufacturers in the defense, energy, and automotive sectors. China's Ministry of Commerce stated that it is accelerating the review of rare earth-related export license applications.</p>

          <p>Amid multiple crises, China is stressing resilient governance over ideology. President Xi Jinping recently commemorated the 120th birth anniversary of Chen Yun, one of the foundational economic planners of the Communist Party of China. Xi's speech signals a rhetorical shift, with relatively sparse references to communist conviction. Instead, there was polished language relating to development planning and political resilience. Chen was portrayed as a model of disciplined governance, praising his ability to grasp key points.</p>

The massive and ageing facilities also release high levels of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter into the air.</p>
