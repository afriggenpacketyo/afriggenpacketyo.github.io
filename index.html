          <p>Three Democratic lawmakers are defending their involvement in what they describe as an oversight visit to an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the Trump administration is misrepresenting the situation and weaponizing law enforcement. Representatives McIver, Watson Coleman, and Menendez assert they were justified in their actions, despite accusations of assaulting law enforcement officers and trespassing. They argue that ICE officers escalated the situation and that the administration is spreading misinformation. While acknowledging that the facility appeared to be in good condition, the lawmakers maintain their objections to ICE detentions, sparking a debate over the incident and the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made significant progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with details to be released soon. The potential trade truce aims to ease concerns about a sharp downturn in the global economy, which has been rocked by tariffs imposed by both nations. While specifics of the agreement are unclear, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested that the deal addresses national security concerns related to China's trade practices, but did not confirm whether tariffs would be reduced. The article highlights the disruptive impact of the tariffs on global supply chains, with American companies facing bankruptcy and Chinese factories seeking alternative export routes, and warns of potential economic consequences such as slowed global growth and inflation.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded cautiously to Russia's offer of direct talks, calling it a "positive sign" but insisting on an immediate cease-fire first. This follows a proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold talks on May 15 in Istanbul, which came after European leaders set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions. The Trump administration has aligned with Russia on a UN vote regarding the war, while Ukraine agreed to an American proposal for an unconditional cease-fire in March. Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, Russia resumed long-range drone attacks on Ukraine, complicating the prospects for a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8, valued at approximately $400 million, as a gift from the Qatari royal family, which has ignited accusations of bribery and corruption. The plane would serve as the new Air Force One until 2029, after which it would be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation. Legal advisors within the Trump administration have deemed the gift permissible, arguing it is not conditioned on any official act and therefore does not constitute bribery. However, critics argue that the gift violates constitutional restrictions on foreign emoluments and raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly given the Trump Organization's recent announcement of a $5.5 billion golf course project in Qatar.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and the European Union are at odds over food safety standards, with American officials criticizing EU regulations that restrict imports of American beef and other meats. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has publicly asserted the superiority of American beef due to its production methods, which include the use of hormones, while the EU maintains strict regulations, including a ban on hormones, to meet consumer preferences for hormone-free, grass-fed products. European officials have stated that their food, health, and safety standards are non-negotiable, setting a "red line" in trade negotiations.

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew", TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in making creative and business decisions. Diller argues that relying solely on data can be harmful and that structured information can narrow one's perspective. He highlights examples from his career, such as the making of the TV movie "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker", where trusting his gut led to significant success. Diller emphasizes that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea and that common sense is crucial.</p>
