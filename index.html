The company reported adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share on $5.99 billion in revenue, reflecting an 11% year-over-year growth. Looking ahead, Adobe provided a strong forecast for the fourth quarter, with earnings and revenue guidance that also topped consensus estimates. This positive performance contrasts with the stock's 21% decline year-to-date, suggesting a potential turnaround for the software giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A majority of a Brazilian Supreme Court panel has voted to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro on multiple counts related to an attempted coup to unlawfully remain in power after his 2022 election loss. The ruling, which makes him the first former Brazilian president convicted of such a crime, could result in a lengthy prison sentence and is expected to deepen political polarization. Bolsonaro's lawyers have stated their intention to appeal the verdict to the full 11-justice court, while he remains under house arrest.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has prompted scrutiny of the security protocols in place at his outdoor event at Utah Valley University, which was attended by approximately 3,000 people. The attack was carried out by a shooter from a nearby rooftop, raising questions about whether measures like drone surveillance could have prevented the tragedy. While six university police officers were present alongside Kirk's private security team, experts note that open-air venues present unique challenges, making it difficult to control access and monitor all potential threats effectively.</p>

The potential acquisition would consolidate major assets like CNN, HBO, and the CBS network, further reshaping the media landscape amid the rise of streaming services. While no formal offer has been submitted, the move signals a major strategic play by Paramount Skydance's David Ellison, whose firm recently completed its own merger. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article critiques President Trump and other conservative figures for immediately blaming left-wing rhetoric for Charlie Kirk's assassination before facts about the shooter's motive are known. It argues that this narrative inaccurately portrays political violence as a uniquely leftist problem, ignoring data that shows far-right extremists have perpetrated the majority of recent domestic terror attacks. The author contends that by selectively focusing on certain acts of violence while downplaying others, the administration is creating a dangerous and factually detached political environment.</p>

          <p>Striker Yoane Wissa has completed a £55 million transfer to Newcastle United from Brentford, concluding a contentious saga where the player publicly pushed for the move. Wissa's career has been marked by resilience, notably after surviving an acid attack in 2021 that could have ended his career. While his on-field performance, including scoring 19 non-penalty goals last season, made him a top target for Newcastle, his conduct in forcing the exit has soured his legacy among Brentford supporters. He is now expected to help fill the offensive void left by Alexander Isak's departure from Newcastle.</p>

          <p>This article examines the career of Charlie Kirk, who, at 31, became a highly influential figure in conservative politics by founding Turning Point USA and cultivating a massive following among young people. It details his evolution from focusing on economic issues to embracing culture war topics, which helped brand the MAGA movement for a younger generation and made him a key strategist for President Trump. The author notes that while Kirk's views were often controversial, his charismatic and relatable communication style built a loyal, cult-like following, cementing his strategic ideas within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have initiated a contentious change to the chamber's rules, lowering the voting threshold to overcome Democratic blockades and more easily confirm President Trump's subcabinet-level nominees. The move, described by Democrats as going "nuclear," allows for confirming nominees in groups with a simple majority vote, bypassing the traditional 60-vote requirement. Majority Leader John Thune argued the change is necessary to overcome unprecedented obstruction and allow the president to staff his administration, while Democrats warned it would weaken the Senate and could be regretted.</p>

The episode, which featured the character Eric Cartman mimicking Kirk's debate style, had been praised by Kirk himself as "hilarious" after its initial airing in August. While the episode is no longer in the network's rerun rotation, it remains accessible on streaming platforms like Paramount+.

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her role in a bribery scheme where she accepted cash, gold bars, and a luxury car for political influence. Despite prosecutors seeking a seven-year term, the judge handed down a sentence "substantially below" guidelines, considering her ongoing cancer treatment but also noting she was a "central participant" in the crimes. Her husband, Bob Menendez, is currently serving an 11-year sentence for his conviction in the same corruption case.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the financial structure of the new U.S.-Japan trade deal, where Japan has committed $550 billion for investment in American projects. Under the agreement, the U.S. and Japan will split profits 50/50 from these projects until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift dramatically to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. The deal aims to bolster domestic manufacturing in key sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, funded by Japanese capital in exchange for lower tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

While Oracle has forecasted a 14-fold expansion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030, analysts expressed tempered enthusiasm, noting the significant risk associated with such heavy reliance on one customer.

Critics argue that the current reading lists, which are overwhelmingly composed of works by white male authors, fail to reflect the country's multicultural student population. While some educators and students are calling for reforms to include more female authors and writers with immigrant backgrounds, others stress the importance of studying classic texts to foster critical thinking and understand historical perspectives.</p>

Due to climate change extending mosquito seasons, authorities are urging people to remain vigilant by using repellent and eliminating standing water.

Analysts suggest the incursion was a deliberate test by Russia to probe NATO's defenses and exploit potential divisions within the alliance.
