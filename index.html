Zelenskyy is sending a delegation to Istanbul for ceasefire talks, prioritizing a complete ceasefire, prisoner exchange, and the return of abducted children. </p>

          <p>More than 30 Palestinians were killed and scores wounded in an Israeli attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza health officials. Witnesses reported Israeli forces fired on crowds awaiting aid, while the Israeli army stated it was unaware of injuries caused by its fire within the humanitarian aid distribution site. The incident occurred as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas faltered, with both sides blaming each other. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it delivered aid without incident and dismissed reports of deaths and injuries, though the UN has refused to work with the new system. </p>

          <p>Faith Salie offers a sentimental perspective on the U.S. Treasury's decision to cease making new pennies. While acknowledging the penny's inefficiency and the fact that it costs more to produce than its actual worth, Salie laments the loss of a small piece of history and a symbol of luck. She discusses the historical significance of the penny, including its early depictions of Lady Liberty and the iconic Lincoln profile designed by a Jewish immigrant.

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the administration will be able to continue its tariff agenda despite recent legal setbacks. An appeals court reinstated President Donald Trump’s tariffs this week after a Wednesday court order blocked them. The original injunction of Trump’s tariffs came after the court decided that the administration’s evocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the right to set “unlimited” tariffs. The White House argued that the court order could harm its progress in negotiations.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration’s recent moves to restrict Chinese students’ access to US education are causing uncertainty among families in China, prompting them to reconsider their children’s academic futures abroad. The latest wave of uncertainty crashed ashore last week when US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Communist Party or those studying in “critical fields”. For some, the American dream is giving way to more pragmatic alternatives closer to home or in other Western nations. </p>
