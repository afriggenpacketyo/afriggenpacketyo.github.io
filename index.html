          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is facing a critical test of his leadership as he works to secure votes for a major bill advancing President Trump's agenda. Johnson is working to reconcile concerns from both conservative and moderate Republicans, focusing on issues like Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Trump is actively involved, encouraging Republicans to support the bill, even planning to attend the House GOP conference to rally support. The bill, facing a tight deadline to address the debt limit by mid-July, is undergoing modifications to address concerns raised by the Senate parliamentarian, making the process fragile and subject to change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the government's increasing debt burden and the high cost of rolling over existing debt. The 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 5%, a level not seen since November 2023, before settling slightly lower. The downgrade, while largely symbolic as Moody's was the last major agency to maintain the top rating, reflects growing investor unease about the nation's fiscal health. These yields directly impact loan rates for houses and credit cards, potentially raising costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by First Street projects a significant increase in foreclosures across the U.S. due to extreme weather events linked to climate change, potentially rising by 380% over the next decade. Low- to moderate-income households are particularly at risk, as the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums strain their finances. Lenders could face substantial losses, estimated to reach $5.4 billion annually by 2035, as they absorb the cost of mortgage defaults. The study suggests that integrating climate risk into loan assessments is crucial for lenders and homeowners to prepare for weather-related disasters, though this could also tighten lending conditions and increase housing prices.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are planning a vote on a tax bill that includes President Trump's agenda, but internal disagreements persist. Speaker Johnson expressed confidence in reaching a final agreement, but conservative hardliners and moderates remain divided over issues like the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. Trump is expected to pressure Republicans to pass the bill, even attending the House Republican conference meeting. The legislation is likely to face resistance in the Senate, adding urgency to the House's efforts to pass the bill before the Memorial Day recess and a looming debt limit deadline in July.</p>

          <p>CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon resigned amid growing tensions between the news division and Paramount Global's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone. Increasing pressure from Paramount Global's board to scrutinize "60 Minutes" programming ahead of air dates led to editorial independence concerns. McMahon felt compelled to defend "60 Minutes" from board interference. Redstone has privately criticized McMahon over "fairness and balance" issues and the business performance of CBS News. Bill Owens, a veteran "60 Minutes" executive producer, resigned in April, citing Paramount Global's increased scrutiny of editorial decisions.</p>

The judge determined that USIP is part of the federal government but not the executive branch, supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches as an independent think tank.

          <p>The Spanish government has ordered Airbnb to remove nearly 66,000 listings from its platform due to violations of housing rules, including lacking licenses or providing fake license numbers. The government aims to address a housing crisis where the conversion of residential properties into tourist accommodations has driven up prices. Airbnb stated that the root cause of the issue is a lack of housing supply and that stricter restrictions have failed to ease local housing challenges. The company said it will continue to appeal all decisions linked to the case. The prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has sought to curb foreign buyers, including by proposing a 100 percent tax aimed at foreign real estate investors.</p>

          <p>Recent books about Joe Biden's presidency reveal that he never held a formal meeting to discuss running for a second term, did not hear directly from pollsters about his public standing, and had limited contact with cabinet secretaries by 2024. When in Washington, he often had dinner at 4.30pm and retired to his private quarters by 5.15. On trips, he sometimes skipped briefings while keeping a morning appointment with a makeup artist. These revelations raise questions about his fitness for office and suggest a decline in his abilities, prompting speculation about his vanity, hubris, or incompetence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Having 100% home equity means a homeowner has paid off their mortgage balance in full, or bought the home for cash, resulting in the total home value being theirs without owing anything to a lender. Lenders typically allow borrowing up to 80% to 90% of the home's value, even with 100% equity. Homeowners with this level of equity are generally considered less risky borrowers, positioning them for better rate offers and terms. Home equity loans provide a lump sum, while HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) offer variable rates and interest-only payments during the draw period, making each suitable depending on individual needs and the interest rate climate.</p>

The success of such preparation is measured by the ability to provide more time, because more time means that those affected will have better options.</p>

          <p>Tax relief can be a powerful tool for resolving past-due IRS debt, offering programs that reduce the total amount owed, pause collection efforts, or make payments more manageable. However, relief doesn't mean forgiveness, and interest continues to accrue until the debt is paid off. While IRS actions don't directly impact credit scores, liens, levies, or wage garnishments can hurt financial stability. It's important to be aware of potential scams and to stay compliant with future tax obligations to maintain eligibility for relief. For those who qualify, programs like Offers in Compromise and penalty abatement can offer substantial savings.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an advanced stage of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones prompted questions about his condition and screening practices. The rapid spread is attributed to the cancer being an aggressive form of the disease. Biden did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup while in office, likely due to recommendations against routine screenings for men 70 and older. The diagnosis came after he saw a doctor for urinary symptoms, underscoring the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual. The treatment goal would be to control the cancer, slowing its progression and preserving quality of life.</p>
