          <p>Following meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, President Trump announced he has called Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin arranging a bilateral meeting between the two heads of state. Trump stated that after their meeting, he would join them for trilateral talks to advance a peace process for the nearly four-year-long war. The Kremlin confirmed the call, stating Putin supports continued direct negotiations, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested a potential meeting could occur within two weeks. Zelenskyy affirmed Ukraine's readiness for such a trilateral format, marking a potential diplomatic development.</p>

          <p>Talks in Washington between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, joined by European leaders, yielded several key developments aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. The article highlights that Trump initiated arrangements for a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, to be followed by a trilateral summit. A major point of discussion was the nature of security guarantees for Ukraine, with Trump suggesting U.S. involvement without offering specifics. However, a key divergence remains, as European leaders pushed for a ceasefire as a precondition for further talks, an idea Trump dismissed as not necessarily required.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is projected to move north in the Atlantic, bringing what the National Hurricane Center calls "life-threatening surf and rip currents" to the U.S. East Coast. While the Category 4 storm is not expected to make landfall, its powerful winds and large size will generate dangerous coastal conditions throughout the week. Officials have issued tropical storm watches and storm surge warnings for North Carolina's Outer Banks, where mandatory evacuations have been ordered for some islands due to the risk of significant coastal flooding.

          <p>A landmark wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away. The 672-tonne structure is being transported on giant rolling platforms to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. This complex, two-day operation is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the Arctic city's center to safer ground. The church's interior treasures, including a large altar painting and a 1,000-pipe organ, will remain inside during the move, making the event a deeply emotional and historic moment for the community.</p>

          <p>Meal-kit delivery company HelloFresh has agreed to a $7.5 million settlement to resolve a consumer protection lawsuit led by Santa Clara County, California. The lawsuit alleged that the company misled customers with automatic renewal subscriptions and made it difficult for them to cancel. While HelloFresh denied any wrongdoing, it will pay $6.38 million in civil penalties, investigative costs, and $1 million in restitution to affected California consumers. The case was brought by the state's Automatic Renewal Task Force, which aims to combat deceptive subscription practices that charge consumers without their clear consent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the economic phenomenon of "involution" in China—characterized by intense, self-defeating competition with diminishing returns—is a symptom of deeper problems. The author contends that the issue is not merely one of oversupply, where too many companies enter the same sector, but also a demand-side problem. According to the article, local governments and enterprises engage in this excessive competition because they lack better options for growth and development. This rat race, driven by a scarcity of viable alternatives, ultimately leads to near-zero profit margins and stifles new investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas, California Democratic lawmakers have introduced a plan to redraw their state's own congressional districts. The proposal would place a measure on a special election ballot in November, asking voters to approve new maps drawn by Democrats for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. Democratic leaders frame this extraordinary mid-decade move as a necessary action to neutralize what they call President Trump's attempts to "rig" the midterms. Republicans have condemned the plan as a partisan power grab that subverts the will of voters, who previously established an independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to "lead a movement" to eliminate mail-in voting and certain voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections. He stated that an executive order is being drafted to bar states from using these methods, which he claims without evidence are corrupt and inaccurate. However, the article notes that legal experts assert the president lacks the constitutional authority for such a mandate. The Constitution grants Congress and the states, not the executive branch, the power to regulate federal elections, making any such executive order highly susceptible to legal challenges.</p>

Many of the women are victims of domestic violence and have been abandoned by their families. Due to strict Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions, it is nearly impossible for them to live independently, leaving them with nowhere to go. With the country's mental health services overwhelmed and demand increasing, these women remain in the facility, occupying beds needed by others in desperate need of care.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece examines the escalating federal and military presence in Washington, D.C., following President Trump's takeover of the city's policing. The author notes that with no clearly stated objective or endpoint, the deployment of National Guard troops from politically aligned states raises concerns that the operation could continue indefinitely. The article argues that the action appears to be an improvisational power grab rather than a structured response to crime. It warns this could set a dangerous precedent for similar federal interventions in other Democrat-run cities, potentially normalizing military occupation of major American urban centers.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill that ensures homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. Currently, lenders can deposit insurance funds into an escrow account and keep the accrued interest while homeowners wait for the funds to be released for rebuilding. The new legislation, which now heads to the governor's desk, would close this loophole by guaranteeing homeowners at least 2% simple interest per annum on these held funds. The bill is intended to provide additional financial support to disaster victims during their recovery.</p>

          <p>Leeds United's 1-0 victory over Everton was decided by a contentious second-half penalty, sparking debate over the current handball rule. The spot-kick was awarded after a shot struck the arm of Everton defender James Tarkowski, which he argued was tucked by his side in a natural position. Pundits and managers were split on the decision, with some calling it a scandal while others argued the referee made the correct call based on the player leaning into the ball. The incident highlights the ongoing confusion and frustration among players and fans regarding the subjective interpretation of what constitutes an illegal handball.</p>

The article explains that spinach is rich in powerful antioxidants, gut-healthy fiber, and dietary nitrates, all of which contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties. Its mild flavor and versatility make it an easy ingredient to incorporate into various pasta sauces without being overpowering. For even greater benefits, experts suggest also adding other anti-inflammatory foods like olive oil, garlic, mushrooms, lentils, and salmon to pasta meals.</p>

They now plan to shift their focus to building a legal case to defeat the redistricting plan in court. Upon their return, the legislature regained its quorum, though Republicans have already called another session to advance the controversial maps.</p>
