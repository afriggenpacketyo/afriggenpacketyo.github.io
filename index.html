          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a vast black-market rental sector in London, where tenants are living in dangerously overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. The report details properties plagued by rats, black mould, and fire hazards, often housing far more people than legally permitted. Despite laws requiring licenses for such homes, evidence suggests that illegal operations significantly outnumber legal ones in some areas, overwhelming the enforcement capacity of local councils. The forthcoming Renters' Rights Bill aims to create a national database to help authorities address this growing crisis.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its microchips contain any 'backdoors' that would permit unauthorized remote access or control. The statement follows reports that Chinese regulators summoned company officials to address national security concerns regarding its H20 AI chips, which are designed for the Chinese market. Beijing's Cyberspace Administration is reportedly scrutinizing the chips for potential vulnerabilities and tracking technologies. This development adds another layer of complexity to the geopolitical tensions surrounding semiconductor technology and US-China trade relations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order updating its 'reciprocal' tariff policy, setting new duty rates for dozens of countries that will take effect on August 7. The rates vary widely, with some countries like Thailand and Malaysia seeing reductions, while others face steep duties, such as 41% for Syria. A significant new measure imposes a 40% tariff on any goods found to be transshipped through other countries to evade the primary duties. This move intensifies the administration's aggressive trade strategy aimed at reshaping global commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>El Salvador's parliament has passed constitutional amendments that remove presidential term limits and extend the term of office from five to six years. The changes, approved by a majority loyal to President Nayib Bukele, will allow him to run for office indefinitely. The reforms also eliminate the need for a second-round runoff in presidential elections. Opposition lawmakers have condemned the move, stating that it undermines the country's democracy by concentrating power in the executive branch.</p>

Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief, welcoming new 19% duties which are significantly lower than the rates of 49% and 36% they previously faced. In contrast, Taiwan will face a 20% tariff, a figure its president described as temporary while negotiations continue. The varied reactions highlight the widespread impact and uncertainty created by the US administration's dynamic and assertive trade policies across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This commentary explores the widespread financial anxiety and exhaustion experienced by millennial women who were encouraged to pursue their passions. The author argues that despite working hard in creative and independent fields, many are left with little long-term security. The article posits that this is a systemic issue, where the economic system relies on women's flexibility and often unpaid or underpaid labor, particularly in creative industries. This has led to a generation of women feeling burnt out, broke, and questioning the promises they were raised on.</p>

It explains how tariffs function as import taxes and outlines the administration's rationale, which is to boost American manufacturing and reduce trade deficits. The piece summarizes the latest round of duties, including a 35% tariff on Canada and varied rates for dozens of other nations, which have collectively thrown the global economy into a state of uncertainty. The report also notes that some US companies are raising prices for consumers as a direct result. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $200 million in federal research grants designated for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The action, affecting grants from agencies like the National Science Foundation and NIH, was justified by the administration's claims of 'discrimination' in admissions and a failure to prevent antisemitism on campus. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk called the decision 'deeply disappointing' and a significant loss for national scientific progress.

          <p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced 108 members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's PTI party to prison for their roles in protests against the military in May 2023. The sentences, including a 10-year term for opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, are a significant blow to the party. PTI has denounced the rulings as politically motivated and a 'black day for democracy,' vowing to challenge the verdict. The convictions are part of a broader crackdown on Khan's party following his ousting and subsequent imprisonment.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2017, annual tuition fees for undergraduate degrees in England and Wales have been increased, rising by 3% to £9,535. The government also raised the amount students can borrow through maintenance loans to help with rising living costs. The fee hike follows years of universities expressing concerns about significant funding pressures due to inflation and a drop in international student enrollment. This change will impact students starting their courses in the new academic year.</p>

          <p>Despite having low projected playoff chances, the Los Angeles Angels chose to be buyers at the MLB trade deadline, acquiring veteran players instead of trading assets for future prospects. General Manager Perry Minasian defended the strategy, stating that it was important for the team's young core to play meaningful, competitive games in August and September. This approach, aimed at fostering a winning culture and developing young talent under pressure, contrasts with the rebuilding moves made by many other teams in similar positions.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the executive mansion's grounds. President Trump stated the new facility, which will replace the current East Wing, has been needed for years to host large-scale events without relying on tents on the South Lawn. The project will be funded by the president himself along with other 'patriot donors' and is being described as his 'gift to the country.' This marks the first major structural change to the White House complex since 1948.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is drafting legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire fund, which is at risk of being depleted after recent deadly fires. The proposal would raise the funds through a combination of a 10-year extension of a surcharge on utility customers' bills and a matching contribution from the shareholders of the state's three largest utilities. This move aims to stabilize the fund, which was created to support wildfire survivors and protect utilities from bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top officials in Kerr County, Texas, have testified that they were either asleep or out of town when catastrophic flash floods devastated the region over the July 4th holiday weekend.

The disaster resulted in at least 95 deaths in Kerr County alone, leading to intense scrutiny and questions about whether authorities provided adequate warnings and why key officials were not on duty during the crisis.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have more than doubled in the first five months of the Trump administration compared to the same period last year. Of the more than 109,000 arrests, the majority took place in Southern and border states, with Texas alone accounting for nearly a quarter of the total. The data also shows that most of the individuals arrested were citizens of Latin American and Caribbean countries, reflecting a sharp increase in interior immigration enforcement.</p>
