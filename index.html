        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade determined that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the federal life sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, according to his attorneys. Hoover, 74, has spent nearly three decades in solitary confinement at ADX Florence in Colorado, one of the most secure prisons in the world. Despite the commutation of his federal sentence, Hoover still faces a 200-year state sentence for the 1973 murder of William "Pooky" Young in Chicago. The case has drawn attention from figures in the entertainment industry, with Kanye West and Drake performing at a concert advocating for Hoover's release in 2021.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured their first trophy under the ownership of Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, largely thanks to the performance of Cole Palmer. Palmer, a £37.5m signing from Manchester City, played a pivotal role in Chelsea's Conference League final win against Real Betis, contributing significantly to their 4-1 victory. After a lackluster first half, Palmer's influence grew, setting up goals for Enzo Fernandez and Nicolas Jackson, with additional goals from Jadon Sancho and Moises Caicedo.

          <p>The demand for credit default swaps (CDS) is rising as investors grow nervous about the U.S. government's ability to repay its debt. CDS are like insurance for investors, protecting them if a borrower defaults. The recent surge in demand is seen as a hedge against political risk, particularly concerns about the unresolved debt ceiling. Spreads on U.S. 1-year CDS have increased significantly since the start of the year, reflecting heightened anxiety about U.S. fiscal policy and potential political dysfunction.

The Trump administration informed Nvidia that its previously approved H20 processor for China would require an export license, cutting off sales with no grace period. Despite this, Nvidia reported strong revenue growth, driven by demand for its AI chips, but Huang made it clear that the China situation is a significant concern.</p>

          <p>Canada plans to cull 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm due to avian flu, but Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz have objected to the decision. The ostriches were in contact with the H5N1 virus, a type of avian flu, prompting the Canadian government to order their culling. Kennedy urged Canadian authorities to conduct further testing to better understand the virus, while Oz offered to relocate the birds to his ranch in Florida. However, most veterinarians agree that keeping potentially infected birds alive poses a public health risk.</p>

The funding debate arises as the Department of Homeland Security considers eliminating or downsizing FEMA. An internal review indicated FEMA is "not ready" for the 2025 hurricane season due to staffing limitations and a lack of coordination with states.</p>
