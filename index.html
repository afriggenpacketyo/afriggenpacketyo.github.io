          <h2>Genetic Study Reveals Details of Earliest Human Migration to the Americas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 02:04:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international research team conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study indicates that Native Americans descended from Asian populations, specifically from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct groups due to environmental isolation, completing the longest migration out of Africa. This work, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, offers new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines, while also confirming human presence in South America dating back at least 23,000 years.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is advocating for legislation to regulate AI companies' use of her likeness and voice. She recounts an instance where OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman allegedly created a chatbot voice similar to hers after she declined to voice it. Johansson's legal team intervened, leading OpenAI to remove the voice feature. She emphasizes the need for boundaries in AI to prevent exploitation and encourages other public figures to support such regulations. Johansson also took legal action against an AI image-generating app for using her voice and likeness in an advertisement.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP falling by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter and 0.7% compared to the same quarter last year. The decline was largely attributed to falling exports, compounded by new tariffs imposed by the United States. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies and an aging population are weighing heavily on Japan's economic outlook. Some economists suggest that the possibility of a recession cannot be ruled out, depending on the degree of downward pressure caused by the tariff issue.</p>

          <p>An op-ed in The New York Times warns of a potential disaster in Romania as a far-right candidate, George Simion, gains significant support in the presidential election. The author argues that Simion's rise is rooted in decades of economic failure, leading to widespread anti-establishment anger. While Simion is described as a self-described Trumpist, the author contends that both candidates share an allegiance to the business class and lack plans to alter the country's fundamental economic framework. The article suggests that Romania is falling into an abyss due to the absence of a political project that offers a genuine alternative to the status quo.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors moved away from U.S. markets due to President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. Analysts suggest that Trump's tariff shocks altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, leading to diversification into markets like Japan. Japanese assets are generally considered a safe haven, and their appeal increased as the "sell-U.S." narrative gained ground.</p>

Doctors have informed the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain, raising concerns about its health.
