            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet destined for China's Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's production hub in Seattle due to the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The jet's return highlights the economic consequences of the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, with Chinese airlines potentially facing crippling tariffs on new aircraft deliveries. This development comes as China is reportedly considering ways to support airlines leasing Boeing jets and has asked airlines to pause purchases of aircraft-related equipment from American companies. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo. Optimism Score: 40</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire after reports surfaced of a second Signal chat where he shared sensitive military details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. This revelation follows previous concerns about Hegseth sharing similar information over unapproved channels, potentially endangering troops. The Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app to determine compliance with DoD policies. Amidst the controversy, several former U.S. officials have voiced concerns, and top Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot has resigned, predicting further 'bombshell' stories about Hegseth's conduct and his possible removal from his position.

            <p>Home Plate BBQ, an American-style restaurant in Beijing, is replacing U.S. beef with Australian beef due to the impact of the U.S.-China trade war. Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on U.S. goods have made American beef unaffordable. The restaurant is also switching its pork ribs source to Canada.

            <p>El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has offered to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the US and imprisoned in his country, in exchange for Venezuela releasing the same number of political prisoners. Bukele made the offer directly to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro via social media. The US accuses the Venezuelan deportees of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. Venezuela's government argues that it has no political prisoners. Optimism Score: 35</p>
