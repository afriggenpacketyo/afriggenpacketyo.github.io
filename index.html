          <p>Leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), including India's Narendra Modi and Russia's Vladimir Putin, have arrived in China for a major summit. During a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Modi expressed a commitment to improving bilateral ties based on mutual respect, marking his first visit to China in seven years. The summit is seen by Beijing as an opportunity to strengthen regional cooperation and present an alternative to Western-led global forums, particularly amidst ongoing trade and security tensions with the United States. The gathering highlights deepening ties between Russia and China as Moscow faces international sanctions.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a Trump appointee who led the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), has resigned after a four-month tenure, declaring his "mission accomplished." He worked to reposition the U.S. foreign aid agency from a traditional development body into a strategic investment tool aimed at countering Chinese influence and prioritizing American economic and national security interests. Under his leadership, the MCC focused on projects in countries like Nepal and Kosovo to secure critical mineral supply chains and strengthen U.S. leverage. His departure aligns with the Trump administration's broader "America First" policy of reframing foreign engagement.</p>

          <p>Manchester United narrowly defeated Burnley 3-2 thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a crucial win for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the victory was overshadowed by persistent goalkeeping errors that have plagued the team early in the season. Following mistakes from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana in previous matches, Bayindir made another critical error against Burnley that allowed the opposition to equalize. Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers, stating that the entire team needs to improve, as they have yet to win consecutive Premier League games under his management.</p>

          <p>UCLA's college football season began with a disappointing 43-10 blowout loss to Utah at the Rose Bowl, revealing significant issues on both sides of the ball. After a training camp shrouded in secrecy by new coach DeShaun Foster, the team's performance was lackluster. The defense struggled with missed tackles and failed to pressure Utah's quarterback, who dominated the game, while the offense under new quarterback Nico Iamaleava was inconsistent and unable to establish a running game. The lopsided defeat raises early concerns about the team's competitiveness for the upcoming season.</p>

The region's governor reported that the port city of Chornomorsk was the most affected, with damage to residential and administrative buildings as well. This attack is part of Russia's recent escalation of strikes targeting Ukrainian energy and gas infrastructure.

          <p>Germany is marking the 10-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society, culture, and politics, and its consequences remain a central topic of national debate. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave had found employment by 2022, challenges with integration and unemployment persist. The anniversary prompts a national stock-taking of the successes and failures of Germany's approach to migration over the past decade.</p>

          <p>Five people were arrested in West Drayton, west London, after masked protesters attempted to enter a hotel being used to house asylum seekers. The incident occurred as two anti-asylum groups, totaling around 500 people, marched in the area, leading to clashes with police and damage to security fences. Two officers sustained minor injuries. The demonstrations were part of a series of similar protests and counter-protests taking place across England and Scotland, reflecting heightened tensions over the UK's asylum policies. Police have implemented a dispersal order to prevent further disorder.</p>

          <p>Biologists are testing an innovative method to deter gray wolves from attacking livestock: drones equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's music and clips of actors Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver arguing. The USDA-led experiment, taking place near the California-Oregon border, aims to provide a non-lethal way to manage wolf populations, which have been recovering in the Western U.S. and leading to increased conflicts with ranchers. Preliminary results show that the novel sounds can successfully interrupt wolf hunts, though questions remain about whether the animals will eventually become accustomed to the tactic.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to issue an executive order requiring voter identification for every vote cast in the United States, with no exceptions. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he also stated the order would ban mail-in voting except for military members serving far from home and the "very ill." Trump continues to make unsubstantiated claims about widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. As federal elections are administered at the state level, it remains unclear whether the president possesses the constitutional authority to enact such sweeping changes unilaterally.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is facing a significant political opportunity as public approval for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has fallen sharply. Recent polling shows the KMT's favorability rating has surpassed the DPP's, while public discontent with the ruling party has reached a new high. However, the KMT is currently grappling with internal uncertainty over who will succeed Chairman Eric Chu when he steps down in October. The leadership vacuum creates anxiety within the party as it seeks to capitalize on the shifting political landscape and voter dissatisfaction.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has announced a significant shift in the party's climate policy, pledging to remove all net-zero requirements for companies drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea if her party is elected. The plan, to be detailed in a speech, will focus exclusively on "maximising extraction" to tap into what she calls "vital resources." This move establishes a clear policy division with the current Labour government, which has committed to banning new exploration licenses. Critics warn the policy would accelerate the climate crisis without lowering energy bills for consumers.</p>

          <h2>Trump Expresses Uncertainty Over Arranging Direct Putin-Zelenskyy Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 21:25:35 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump has expressed diminished confidence in his ability to arrange a direct, one-on-one meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While he previously suggested he was organizing such talks, Trump now indicates that a bilateral meeting is uncertain, though a three-way summit involving himself is still possible. His comments come as Zelenskyy voices frustration with Russia's perceived lack of constructive engagement in peace negotiations. Meanwhile, Russia's military claims to be waging a "nonstop" offensive across the front line, potentially seeking to strengthen its negotiating position through battlefield gains.</p>
