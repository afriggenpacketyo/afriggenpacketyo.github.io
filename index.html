          <p>Prisons Minister James Timpson indicated that the UK government is considering expanding the use of electronic tagging for offenders as an alternative to incarceration, aiming to reduce prison overcrowding and improve rehabilitation. Timpson emphasized the importance of addressing issues like drug addiction and mental health to lower re-offending rates, while acknowledging the crisis state of prisons with limited spare capacity. He refuted claims of gangs controlling prisons but admitted that organized crime is a significant concern, contributing to drug-related violence and intimidation within prisons. Timpson highlighted the need for continued prison construction to accommodate the rising population, while also focusing on effective rehabilitation programs.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the deceased British novelist, has been reanimated using AI to teach an online writing course, sparking debate about the ethics of using AI to recreate historical figures. While Christie's family approved the project and insisted on using her own words, some experts argue that the course is still a deepfake, as Christie cannot consent to its creation. The use of AI in this context raises questions about authenticity and the potential for blurring the lines between fact and fiction. Others suggest that it is a creative way to engage with the author's work, but there are questions about whether it is ethical.</p>

The ruling came after lawyers representing a group of migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent their deportation to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing safety concerns. Judge Murphy clarified that any imminent removals to those countries would defy the preliminary injunction he issued last month, emphasizing the need for due process. The judge cited the country's human rights record as a reason to doubt the deportation of migrants to Libya.</p>
