          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run home run, his ninth of the season, during the Los Angeles Dodgers' 7-4 win against the Miami Marlins. The home run, clocked at 117.9 miles per hour, was the hardest-hit in Major League Baseball this season. Ohtani reflected on his confidence boost after homering off a great pitcher in a clutch situation. The article notes that Ohtani also made history at the same stadium in September 2024, becoming the first MLB player to reach 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a single season.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The DOJ stated that Credit Suisse AG Singapore held undeclared accounts for U.S. persons with assets valued at over $2 billion between 2014 and June 2023. This criminal conspiracy allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021, violating a 2014 plea agreement. The tax loss to the U.S. was over $71 million, with Credit Suisse's revenues exceeding $108.6 million.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a cornerstone of its economy, faces potential disruption from proposed U.S. tariffs. Although President Trump paused the tariffs, the possibility of their reinstatement worries workers like Murshida Akhtar, who relies on garment factory jobs to support her family. Bangladesh has grown since the 1980s on the back of its garment industry, with nearly 85% of its exports being garments, primarily bound for the United States. The tariff threat comes as Bangladesh faces a recession and political instability following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina's government.</p>

          <p>President Trump closed a loophole that allowed cheap goods from China to enter the United States without tariffs, potentially slowing the flow of e-commerce shipments. This could deprive companies like UPS, FedEx, and DHL of a significant revenue source. UPS expects a 25% decline in revenue from China-to-U.S. shipments, and is cutting 20,000 jobs. To avoid the tariffs, Chinese sellers are shifting to locally based sellers within the U.S. or exploring markets in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America.</p>

The move came in response to Trump‚Äôs social media post calling for a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the U.S. The film industry is desperate for help due to generous government incentives and cheaper labor luring projects away from Hollywood.</p>
