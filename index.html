          <p>OpenAI has announced new safety measures for teenage users of its ChatGPT platform, which will be rolled out by the end of September. The company stated that users identified as under 18 will be directed to a version with age-appropriate content restrictions, including blocks on sexual material and protocols to contact law enforcement in cases of acute distress. The update also introduces parental controls, allowing parents to link accounts, manage chat history, and set usage limits. This move follows increased scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and a lawsuit from the parents of a teen who died by suicide.</p>

Despite strongly disagreeing with his political views, Curtis stated she believed he was a man of faith and hoped he felt connected to his beliefs in his final moments. She expressed concern that society is becoming numb to humanity due to the constant bombardment of violent imagery, such as videos of Kirk's death and the 9/11 attacks.

          <p>Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks has criticized the United Kingdom's biopharmaceutical policies, stating the country has transitioned from a leader to a "laggard" in the industry over the past two decades. He cited an unattractive market, driven by government drug pricing controls and rebate requirements, as a primary reason for companies like Lilly to pause investments, such as a planned biotech incubator. Ricks suggested these policies serve as a warning to the U.S. as it considers its own drug pricing reforms. He emphasized that capital flows to where it is welcomed, and currently, the UK's environment is not conducive to major investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggested that artificial intelligence could boost the United Kingdom's economy by 10% in as little as five years, following his company's new $30 billion investment in the country's AI sector. This investment is part of a larger $40 billion agreement between the UK and several US tech giants aimed at developing AI infrastructure like data centers. Nadella compared AI's potential economic impact to that of the personal computer, acknowledging that while the technology's energy consumption is high, its benefits in healthcare and productivity are significant.

          <p>China Eastern Airlines is set to launch a new record-long flight route connecting Shanghai, China, with Buenos Aires, Argentina, beginning in December. The 25-hour journey will cover approximately 20,000 kilometers and will include a single transit stop in Auckland, New Zealand. This new route is designed to significantly reduce travel time between the two nations by up to five hours, bypassing traditional layovers in the U.S. or Europe. The service reflects China's strengthening trade and political relationships with Latin America and is expected to establish Auckland as a key southern hub for Asia-South America travel.</p>

          <p>Five top executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, including CEO Eric Langan, have been indicted for allegedly engaging in a multi-million-dollar tax fraud and bribery scheme. The New York Attorney General's office alleges the executives bribed a state tax auditor with complimentary trips to Florida and thousands of dollars for private dances at company-owned strip clubs. In exchange, the auditor allegedly helped the company avoid paying over $8 million in New York taxes between 2010 and 2024. The indictment includes charges of conspiracy, bribery, and criminal tax fraud, causing RCI's stock to drop significantly upon the announcement.</p>

The messages were sent during a two-day manhunt while friends in a group chat noted his resemblance to surveillance photos released by the FBI.

          <p>A framework deal has been reached for TikTok's U.S. operations, which would be controlled by an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz. Under the proposed structure, the group would own an 80% stake, and existing U.S. users would migrate to a new application, with Oracle managing user data on its servers. The agreement comes as President Trump extended the divestment deadline for a fourth time, pushing it to December 16. The deal, which is expected to close within 30 to 45 days, aims to resolve national security concerns over the app's ties to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent data suggests that California's summer wave of COVID-19 may be starting to level off or decline. While coronavirus levels in wastewater remain high, key indicators like the test positivity rate and hospital admissions have begun to fall in some areas, including Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties. For example, the statewide hospitalization rate recently saw a slight decrease. Health officials note that while it is too early to confirm the peak has passed, the trends suggest that community transmission is slowing down. Hospitalizations have remained relatively low compared to previous surges, primarily affecting older, under-vaccinated individuals.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point interest rate cut this week, a decision accompanied by significant political pressure from the White House. President Trump has publicly urged the Fed for a larger, more aggressive cut, and his new appointee to the board, Stephen Miran, is expected to dissent in favor of such a move. While the rate cut itself is largely anticipated by markets, the Fed's updated economic forecast and its 'dot plot' will be closely watched for signals on future policy. The meeting highlights growing tensions between the central bank's mandate and political demands from the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

Waymo already operates in San Mateo County, where SFO is located, but this permit specifically allows for airport operations. This expansion follows similar approvals for Waymo at airports in Phoenix and San Jose, marking another step forward for autonomous vehicle integration into public transportation infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order to once again delay the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. if it does not divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.

The repeated delays have drawn some criticism from lawmakers who passed the bill due to national security concerns.

This use of the military for what the article terms a "political stunt" places the armed forces in a difficult position, blurring the lines between military and civilian roles.
