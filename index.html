          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington to advocate for advanced Tomahawk missiles, which possess a 2,500 km range and are capable of striking deep into Russia. This critical meeting follows Trump's "very productive" phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where they agreed to future face-to-face talks in Hungary, potentially within two weeks. While Zelensky seeks the missiles, Trump has expressed reservations about depleting US stockpiles. The article notes Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Ukraine just hours before the Trump-Putin call, a move Ukraine's ambassador interpreted as Moscow's true, terror-driven attitude towards peace.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone Air experienced an immediate sell-out in China, with both brick-and-mortar stores in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, and online platforms reporting stock depletion within minutes of launch. Online orders now face delays of one to two weeks, indicating robust consumer enthusiasm for the device. This strong demand underscores the iPhone Air's popularity in the Chinese market, even as it navigates heightened competition from domestic tech giants such as Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi. The article notes this success occurs despite a challenging economic environment, reflecting Apple's continued strong position in the high-end smartphone segment.</p>

          <p>Supporters of Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv are banned from their upcoming Europa League match against English Premier League side Aston Villa due to significant public safety concerns. West Midlands Police designated the November 6 fixture as "high risk," referencing violent clashes and hate crime incidents during a previous 2024 match involving Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax, which were linked to the Middle East crisis. This controversial decision has been criticized by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other political figures, who argue against tolerating antisemitism and emphasize the police's responsibility to ensure all fans can attend games safely.</p>

          <p>Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the legendary rock band Kiss, has died peacefully at 74 in Morristown, New Jersey. Known for his iconic "Spaceman" persona, elaborate makeup, and signature smoke-filled guitar, Frehley was a key figure in the band's captivating stage shows. His family expressed profound heartbreak, while bandmates Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons paid tribute, calling him an "essential and irreplaceable rock soldier."

          <p>E-bikes are experiencing a significant market boom, reaching nearly $2 billion, yet this surge in popularity is alarmingly accompanied by a more than threefold increase in emergency room visits for riders aged 10 to 17 since 2019. Local officials, like Montvale Mayor Mike Ghassali, express serious concern over high-speed e-bikes, some capable of 50 mph, being operated by untrained and unlicensed minors, which he calls a "death trap." The article highlights the patchwork of existing regulations and the introduction of new legislation aimed at enforcing helmet use for riders under 18 and funding police efforts against unsafe, underage riding.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military deployed three B-52 bombers on missions near Venezuela's coast, approximately 150 miles north, intensifying the Trump administration's pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro's government. This action is part of a broader, monthslong military buildup in the Caribbean, involving eight warships, a nuclear submarine, fighter jets, and 10,000 U.S. forces. The article highlights previous airstrikes on alleged drug-carrying boats and President Trump's recent confirmation of authorized covert CIA operations within Venezuela. These escalating measures contribute to heightened tensions, with Maduro denying drug cartel ties and accusing the U.S. of attempting regime change.</p>

          <p>Dazzling satellite photos vividly showcase California's dramatic transformation following the season's inaugural major storm, which delivered much-needed precipitation across the state. The images reveal parched brown mountain peaks now blanketed in brilliant white snow, extending into Nevada and Utah, while reservoirs have been replenished to or above historical levels. Experts believe this significant moisture could substantially delay the fire season in Los Angeles. The article emphasizes that even a "weak" atmospheric river can profoundly impact drought recovery, rapidly greening the landscape and setting a favorable start to the water year.</p>

          <p>Two suspects were arrested following an armed home invasion in Odessa, Florida, where authorities allege an Apple AirTag was used to track the victims' SUV. Surveillance footage captured the moment two men forced a couple into their garage, only to flee when the home alarm activated. The AirTag, discovered taped beneath the vehicle, proved instrumental in the investigation because the suspects had registered it using their personal information. The article advises the public to be aware that iPhones automatically alert users to unknown AirTags nearby, and Android users can utilize specific apps to detect them, enhancing personal security.</p>

          <p>Two cases of Clade I mpox, a potentially more severe and easily transmissible strain, have been confirmed in Los Angeles County, marking its first detection in the U.S. without a history of international travel to high-risk regions. Both patients, initially hospitalized, are now recovering at home. This Clade I variant is distinct from the Clade II strain responsible for the 2022 global outbreak, raising concerns due to its potential for more severe illness and easier spread through various close personal contacts, not just sexual activity. Health officials are emphasizing ongoing surveillance, rapid response, and widespread vaccination efforts, urging individuals with unexplained rashes to seek immediate medical attention.</p>

          <p>The small Texas city of Mathis is confronting a severe drinking water crisis as its primary source, Lake Corpus Christi, nears depletion, with water levels recorded at just 15% capacity. City Manager Cedric Davis warned that persistent drought conditions will soon force them to extract muddy, undrinkable water, potentially damaging vital infrastructure. This dire situation underscores the intensifying impact of human-caused climate change, which exacerbates droughts and poses significant threats to global food security and ecosystems. In response, Mathis is urgently digging emergency wells, aiming to ensure residents have access to clean water by the end of December.</p>

          <p>Reese Witherspoon discusses her debut adult thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," co-written with Harlan Coben, emphasizing her desire to center a female protagonist with unique skills rather than sex appeal. Inspired by childhood questions about James Bond films, Witherspoon sought to create a character whose intelligence and intuition, as a talented surgeon, drive the plot. The article notes her personal experiences with career setbacks informed the narrative, starting the protagonist "on her knees." Through her production company, Hello Sunshine, Witherspoon continues to champion complex female storytelling, seeing a "gap" in Hollywood for such roles and enjoying this new creative frontier.</p>

          <p>Uganda's Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit, is increasingly viewed as President Yoweri Museveni's private army, crucial for maintaining his nearly four-decade grip on power and expanding family dynasty. Critics accuse the SFC of abducting, torturing, and killing opposition activists, allegations the unit denies. The article highlights growing discontent among senior generals regarding the SFC's disproportionate influence, which rivals the regular army, and concerns about its recruitment along ethnic lines. Analysts fear a potential power struggle between military factions in the post-Museveni era, though some argue Museveni's son, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, a former SFC commander, is positioned to ensure continuity.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings projects a sustained decline for China's extensive property market, anticipating an 8% fall in nationwide primary property sales in 2025 and a further 6-7% drop in 2026, attributed to persistent soft demand. This prolonged downturn is expected to exert severe pressure on Chinese developers, many of whom are already grappling with the dual challenge of completing homes and meeting their debt commitments. The article highlights actions by major developers like Cifi, which is restructuring by canceling existing debts and issuing new bonds to bolster its capital structure and reduce offshore obligations, signaling ongoing financial distress in the sector.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's unusual public acknowledgment of authorizing covert CIA operations in Venezuela, via a presidential finding, has raised significant concerns about the potential scope of such actions. These authorizations typically grant the agency broad leeway, potentially including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers, influence operations, or efforts aimed at destabilizing or toppling the Maduro regime. The article notes that while congressional intelligence committees must be notified, their approval is not required, meaning the president can define the parameters. Historically, such findings have led to diverse interventions, from arming rebels to regime change, underscoring the lack of clear limitations.</p>
