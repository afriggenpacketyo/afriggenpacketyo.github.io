        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As children return to school, concerns about head lice infestations are increasing, particularly among preschool and elementary-age children. The CDC highlights that lice spread through head-to-head contact, not hygiene, and are not a health hazard as they don't transmit diseases. Prevention involves avoiding direct contact and not sharing personal items, while treatment options range from over-the-counter medications to professional removal services. Experts advocate for updated school policies, noting that immediate removal from school or complete nit removal is often unnecessary. </p>

          <p>Russia's economy is facing significant strain due to the war in Ukraine, with plans for tax hikes and spending cuts to address a growing budget deficit. The government announced a VAT increase to 22% and anticipates cuts to non-defense spending, including social programs, to maintain high military expenditures. Plunging oil and gas revenues, exacerbated by drone attacks on energy infrastructure and sanctions, are major contributors to the economic difficulties. Analysts suggest these pressures could compel President Putin to consider a peace deal sooner, despite differing opinions on the effectiveness of sanctions. </p>

          <p>Denmark is reportedly considering triggering NATO Article 4 after drone sightings forced the closure of Aalborg airport for a second time this week, following a similar incident at Copenhagen airport. Danish authorities describe the events as a "hybrid attack" from a "professional actor," though they specify the drones were launched locally, not from Russia. This development has prompted Denmark to engage with NATO and the European Union, raising concerns about critical infrastructure security across the region, as Oslo airport also experienced drone-related disruptions. </p>

          <p>Robert Kraft has agreed to sell an 8% minority stake in the New England Patriots to two groups, Sixth Street Capital and Dean Metropoulos, in a deal valuing the NFL franchise at $9 billion. The funds from this sale will remain on the team's balance sheet, indicating a post-money valuation exceeding $9 billion. This transaction, which excludes the New England Revolution MLS team, requires approval from the NFL's finance committee. Other recent minority stake sales in NFL teams, like the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers, have also commanded high valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks plans to lay off approximately 900 non-retail staff and close about 1% of its North American stores as part of a $1 billion restructuring effort. This move follows six consecutive quarters of declining U.S. sales, attributed to consumers grappling with inflation. CEO Brian Niccol stated the changes are necessary to build a stronger, more resilient company, though the Starbucks Workers United union criticized the decision for lacking barista input. The company also intends to uplift over 1,000 store locations in the next year. </p>

The cybercriminals, calling themselves Radiant, are demanding a ransom and assert they possess data on parents, carers, and safeguarding notes. An employee confirmed a data breach, and the hackers have published a sample of the stolen data online. Cybersecurity experts have condemned the targeting of nurseries as an "absolute new low," raising alarm bells about the nature of the exposed information. </p>

          <p>Elisa Sunga, a 35-year-old Google UX program manager, has turned her pandemic baking hobby into a wildly successful global phenomenon called 'Cake Picnic.' The event, which requires attendees to bring a whole cake to share, started informally in San Francisco and has since expanded to Los Angeles, New York, and London, attracting thousands. Sunga manages the project with her partner and volunteers, aiming to standardize ticket prices to reinvest in the baking community. Despite its rapid growth, Sunga intends to keep Cake Picnic a passion project rather than a full-time job, preserving the joy it brings. </p>

          <p>A notable shift in U.S. drugs policy is emerging, with Democratic mayors and the president converging on new approaches. In Philadelphia, Mayor Cherelle Parker has pledged to halt city funding for clean needle programs, signaling a move away from harm reduction strategies. This policy change impacts organizations like Prevention Point, which has historically provided essential services to intravenous drug users. The article suggests a broader national trend towards re-evaluating and potentially restricting harm reduction initiatives, marking a significant evolution in federal and local drug enforcement strategies. </p>

          <p>The president's border czar has reportedly been caught in an undercover sting operation, accused of accepting a $50,000 bribe in exchange for influencing government funds.

          <p>Rangers manager Russell Martin is under immense pressure after failing to win any of his first five Scottish Premiership games and suffering a Champions League qualifying humiliation. Initially adhering to his signature front-footed, attacking style, Martin's team has struggled with losing possession centrally and poor "rest defense," leading to vulnerable counter-attacks. Following a 6-0 defeat, Martin has pragmatically shifted his long-held 4-3-3 philosophy to a 4-2-3-1 formation, reducing possession and increasing long passes to solidify the defense. This drastic change highlights the intense scrutiny he faces at Ibrox. </p>

The judge determined that while the IGs "deserved better," their firings did not cause sufficient irreparable harm to justify reinstatement before the lawsuit concludes. The plaintiffs, part of 17 IGs dismissed with vague explanations, argued the administration failed to provide the legally required 30-day notice or substantive rationale.
