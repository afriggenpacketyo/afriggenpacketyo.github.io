          <h2>Trump Deploys National Guard to Los Angeles Amid Immigration Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 01:03:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles following protests sparked by ICE operations, citing the need to quell riots and looting. President Trump criticized California's Governor Newsom and L.A. Mayor Bass for allegedly failing to maintain order, while Newsom denounced the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary. The situation escalated as protesters clashed with authorities, leading to arrests and the use of non-lethal munitions, raising questions about federal overreach and the militarization of domestic law enforcement. The legality of the deployment without the governor's approval remains unclear, and the deployment has ignited a debate over federalism and the appropriate response to civil unrest. The use of Title 10 authority is a waiver of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the U.S. military for law enforcement within the U.S., except in cases explicitly authorized by the Constitution or an Act of Congress.</p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, returned to her job part-time after having a baby and believes that flexible working options are key to addressing recruitment and retention issues in the profession. The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, also suggested more schools should offer flexible hours. Sam Alner, a computer science teacher and vice principal, notes the relentless nature of teaching and the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance, leading some experienced staff to leave for better opportunities. Data suggests that teacher recruitment targets are being missed, particularly in specialist subjects, exacerbating inequalities in disadvantaged communities.</p>

The piece expresses alarm that the U.S. political system is being transformed into one that serves the leader's interests rather than the people's, eroding checks and balances and ethical frameworks.

It cites lawyers who believe there is evidence of Israel following war crimes committed by Hamas with many of its own, including the crime of genocide. The article further discusses the growing international concern over Israel's conduct, including restrictions on aid, and the potential for complicity in criminal investigations if governments do not speak out.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Dakota is projected to spend $2 billion on prisons in the next decade due to tough-on-crime sentencing laws, despite falling national crime rates. The state's incarceration rate is significantly higher than neighboring states, with a substantial portion of inmate population growth attributed to a 2023 law requiring violent offenders to serve their full sentences before parole. High rates of parolees returning to prison for technical violations, coupled with a lack of addiction services, exacerbate the problem. Native Americans are disproportionately represented in South Dakota's prisons, and while some advocate for treatment programs, legislators are reluctant to change the policies driving the need for prison expansion.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, details how tellurium nanowire implants were used in a biocompatible device to restore vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, serving as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement holds promise for treating human blindness and expanding visual capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10 has sparked legal debate, with critics arguing it bypasses the authority of the governor and could violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Legal scholars argue the move is an abuse of power and an attempt to suppress dissent, while the administration claims it's necessary to protect federal personnel and property. Concerns have also been raised about the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act, which would allow the president to use military force domestically. The ACLU has condemned the deployment as dangerous and a threat to democratic principles, and the Los Angeles Police Department stated that demonstrations remained peaceful.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing a demographic crisis. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China's fertility rate has declined to an estimated 1.1 children per woman, well below the replacement level, and traditional expectations place the burden of childcare on women.</p>

The Docomo emoji, introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, played a significant role in shaping digital communication and were particularly popular among Japanese teenagers in the 2000s. The company's Android smartphones and feature phones will now adopt Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji instead.

Astronomers have re-analyzed the data from the James Webb Space Telescope and found insufficient evidence for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), molecules associated with life on Earth. The new studies suggest that other molecules, like ethane, could explain the observed signals, and that the planet's temperature may be higher than previously thought. While the lead author of the original study stands by their findings, the scientific community is engaged in a robust debate about the interpretation of the data.</p>

They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, access to funding, and work-life balance. Europe's most successful companies have achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork, and younger generations are less tolerant of hustle culture.</p>

Since AI learns by absorbing online content, it is crucial to be mindful of the information and values it is exposed to.
