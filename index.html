          <p>Egyptian authorities are investigating the theft of a rare 4,000-year-old limestone relief from a sealed tomb in the Saqqara Necropolis. The artifact, which depicts ancient Egyptian seasons, was reportedly cut from the wall of a Fifth Dynasty tomb belonging to an official named Khenti Ka. This incident marks the second major antiquity theft in Egypt in recent weeks, following the disappearance of a golden bracelet that was later found to have been melted down. The theft raises concerns about the security of historical sites just before the opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum.</p>

          <p>Japanese brewing giant Asahi has partially restarted operations at its six breweries in the country following a disruptive cyberattack. The attack affected the company's ordering and delivery systems, leading to a production halt and causing major retailers to report low stock levels of popular beers like Asahi Super Dry. While the breweries are not yet at full capacity, the resumption of production for beer, soft drinks, and food products marks a step toward recovery. This incident is the latest in a series of cyberattacks impacting major global corporations and their supply chains.</p>

          <p>Turkey has become the world's leading destination for hair transplants, attracting around one million people in 2022 and generating approximately $2 billion for its economy. Patients, primarily from the U.S. and Europe, are drawn by significantly lower costs, with procedures costing a fraction of what they would in their home countries. While the industry is booming, concerns have been raised about the risks associated with unlicensed "black market clinics" and a lack of stringent oversight. The trend is heavily fueled by social media, which has normalized the procedure and transformed it into a popular lifestyle upgrade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles County, accusing its Sheriff's Department of violating Second Amendment rights by excessively delaying and denying concealed carry weapon permits. The suit alleges a pattern of illegal obstruction, with some applicants waiting up to two years for an interview and only two permits being approved out of over 8,000 applications. This legal action highlights a broader conflict between the Trump administration and Democrat-led cities over crime and constitutional rights. Officials argue that such delays leave citizens defenseless amid rising crime rates, a claim the mayor's office contests.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute has erupted between Beijing and Washington after the Chinese embassy in Panama accused the U.S. ambassador of "spreading lies." The accusation followed an interview where U.S. Ambassador Kevin Cabrera described China's presence and investments in the Panama Canal region as "malign" and corrupt. Cabrera claimed that Chinese infrastructure projects in Latin America have been disastrous for the environment and local economies. In response, the Chinese embassy issued a sharp rebuke, escalating tensions over influence in the strategically important Central American nation.</p>

          <p>According to an Adobe Analytics report, U.S. online spending during the upcoming holiday season is forecast to grow by 5.3% to $253.4 billion. This growth rate marks a slowdown compared to the 8.7% increase seen in the previous year and is below the 10-year average, reflecting consumer caution amid economic uncertainty. Shoppers are expected to hunt for discounts and increasingly use AI-powered tools for gift research. While spending remains resilient, other forecasts capturing both online and in-store sales predict even more modest growth, with some surveys indicating consumers plan to cut back on their holiday budgets.

Despite these gains, the article warns that progress is threatened by declining global health funding, the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment in wealthy nations, and the challenge of reaching over 14 million infants who received no vaccines at all.</p>

Pritzker has urged Texas Governor Greg Abbott to refuse the order, arguing that military troops should not be used as political props without a state's consent.

          <p>Manchester City defender Nico O'Reilly, 20, has been called up to the senior England squad for the first time. He replaces Chelsea right-back Reece James, who withdrew from the squad after sustaining an injury during a Premier League match. O'Reilly, who primarily plays as a left-back for his club, will step up from the Under-21s for the upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia. His inclusion follows a breakout season where he established himself in Manchester City's first team, making 21 appearances and scoring five goals.</p>

          <p>Shares in luxury carmaker Aston Martin dropped by 10% after the company issued a profit warning, citing global tariff complexities and a challenging industry outlook. The British firm announced it expects a significant percentage decrease in its 2025 wholesale volumes and no longer anticipates generating positive free cash flow in the latter half of the year. Aston Martin specifically pointed to the U.S.-U.K. trade deal's tariff quota system as a source of uncertainty that limits its forecasting ability. The company is now reviewing future costs and capital expenditures while urging U.K. lawmakers to provide more proactive support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen has criticized CNN commentator Van Jones's apology for his recent remarks about Gaza, stating that it missed the "deeper" issue. Jones had apologized for comments made on HBO's "Real Time with Bill Maher," where he suggested that social media feeds are dominated by a disinformation campaign showing "dead Gaza baby" images. Van Hollen accused Jones of spreading "Netanyahu propaganda" and trivializing the suffering of civilians by framing it as "Iranian fake news." Despite Jones's admission that his comments were insensitive, the controversy highlights ongoing deep divisions over the portrayal of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Vilnius Airport in Lithuania was forced to shut down for several hours, causing 30 flight cancellations, after dozens of meteorological balloons carrying contraband cigarettes floated into its airspace from neighboring Belarus. Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre reported that 25 balloons were detected, with at least two passing directly over the airport. Authorities have recovered 11 balloons carrying 18,000 packs of black-market cigarettes. Officials noted that this rudimentary smuggling method is common in the region, as balloons are cheaper than drones, but poses a significant risk to civil aviation amid heightened European tensions over airspace violations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying in the Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Mexico, with forecasts predicting it could strengthen into a Category 2 storm. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for a portion of the Mexican coast from Punta San Telmo to Punta Mita. While the hurricane's center is expected to remain offshore and move parallel to the coast, its outer bands are projected to bring heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the region. This poses a risk of flash flooding, particularly in higher terrain, as the storm moves toward Baja California Sur.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has unveiled a proposal to reform the house-buying system in England and Wales, aiming to reduce costs, delays, and failed sales. The plan would legally require sellers to provide key property information upfront and introduces the option of binding contracts to prevent last-minute withdrawals or "gazumping." Officials estimate these changes could save first-time buyers over £700 and shorten the transaction time by four weeks. However, the proposal draws comparisons to the previously failed Home Information Packs and faces scrutiny over its potential to increase initial costs for sellers and its effectiveness in addressing broader housing affordability issues.</p>

As part of the potential acquisition, Weiss, who famously resigned from The New York Times citing an intolerant progressive culture, would assume a high-level editorial role at CBS News. The move is seen as a major victory for the anti-woke media movement and suggests a strategic shift by Paramount to appeal to a more center-right audience. The Free Press has become highly successful by focusing on critiques of "woke" ideology, public health establishment skepticism, and strong support for Israel.</p>

Their collective work led to the discovery of regulatory T-cells, a crucial component of the immune system. These cells act as "security guards," preventing the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues, a process known as peripheral immune tolerance. Their discoveries have been fundamental to understanding and developing new treatments for autoimmune diseases, where this process fails, and for cancer, where these cells can hinder the body's ability to fight tumors.</p>

          <p>Two-term Republican Congressman Wesley Hunt has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in Texas, setting up a three-way primary battle against incumbent Senator John Cornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton. Hunt's entry defies the wishes of national GOP leaders, who have backed Cornyn and expressed concerns that Paxton's legal issues could make the seat vulnerable. Hunt, a close ally of Donald Trump, argues that Texas voters want an alternative to the contentious rivalry between Cornyn and Paxton. His campaign adds a new layer of complexity to one of the most closely watched Republican primary races in the country.</p>

Founded as a vigilante movement, the group blames foreigners for crime, unemployment, and strained public services, often using aggressive tactics like blocking hospital access and conducting unauthorized ID checks. Critics and researchers argue that the group's claims are based on exaggerated figures about the migrant population and that it serves as a distraction from government failures and corruption. The movement's actions reflect deep-seated xenophobia in a society still grappling with the inequalities inherited from the Apartheid era.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has resigned after just 27 days in office, deepening the country's political crisis and causing significant market instability. His departure, which came only hours after he appointed his cabinet, makes him the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history. Lecornu cited the inability to build a consensus in a deeply fragmented parliament as the reason for stepping down, particularly with the looming challenge of passing a budget to address France's massive public debt.
