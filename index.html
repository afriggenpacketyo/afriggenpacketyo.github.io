          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced strong first-quarter earnings, surpassing revenue expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company's net loss widened due to stock-based compensation costs related to its recent IPO. Management forecasts revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, fueled by significant capital expenditures, including a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite some initial investor skepticism regarding the company's metrics, CoreWeave's CEO emphasized the influx of new clients and the diversification of its business beyond major cloud providers like Amazon.

          <p>Israel has issued a large-scale evacuation order for civilians in Gaza City, declaring many areas unsafe ahead of 'intense strikes' by the IDF. The targeted buildings allegedly house Hamas command centers, but also shelter thousands of civilians. Humanitarian groups warn of potential casualties and the time needed to evacuate. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has spoken out against expanding military operations in Gaza, citing concerns about the war's impact on the country's morale and international standing.</p>
