          <p>Hamas has submitted what it calls a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-brokered proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, although it stated further negotiations on implementation are necessary. The proposed 60-day deal involves the release of 10 living hostages and the remains of 15 others. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office deemed the changes requested by Hamas "unacceptable" but confirmed a negotiating team would travel to Qatar to continue discussions. The development signals potential, albeit difficult, progress in the nearly 21-month-long conflict.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California's Los Padres National Forest, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly expanded to over 79,900 acres, making it the largest blaze in the state for the year. As of Saturday evening, the fire was only 10% contained and threatened approximately 50 structures, prompting evacuation orders in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. State and federal agencies are operating in a unified command to combat the fire, which has shown exponential growth due to weather and terrain conditions. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>A series of antisemitic attacks in Melbourne, Australia, has heightened fears within the local Jewish community and drawn widespread condemnation. The incidents included an arson attack on the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation while worshippers were inside and a violent raid on an Israeli-owned restaurant by masked extremists. While no one was injured in the synagogue fire, the events prompted calls from Australian and Israeli officials for the perpetrators to face the full force of the law. These attacks are part of what is described as a rising wave of antisemitism in the country.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains belonging to the seven people who were missing after a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident occurred at a facility operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, which destroyed several structures and ignited an 80-acre grass fire. Investigations revealed the warehouse was operating without the necessary local licenses on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is assisting Cal Fire in the ongoing investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>At least 47 people have died after catastrophic flash floods struck central Texas, with dozens more, including many children from a summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and prompting over 160 air rescues of people, some found clinging to trees. Officials have described it as a "mass casualty event," and Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a federal disaster declaration to provide state resources for the affected counties. The rapid and unexpected nature of the flood has left the region reeling as search and rescue operations continue.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter performed for a crowd of 65,000 at London's BST Festival, delivering a show that was noticeably tamer than her typically racy performances. The singer, known for her sexually confident brand, toned down some lyrics and choreography, opting to fire t-shirts into the crowd instead of performing a more suggestive routine for one song. This shift comes after recent criticism of her performances and album art for being too provocative. The article notes that despite the changes, Carpenter remained a charismatic and professional performer, showcasing her versatility and talent.</p>

WIG craft are designed to fly efficiently at high speeds just above the water's surface, making them useful for logistics, search and rescue, and potential military applications in littoral zones.

Experts advise young job seekers to highlight transferable skills from volunteering, sports, or other activities on their CVs. They also recommend keeping resumes concise, tailoring cover letters, and preparing thoroughly for interviews to stand out in a competitive market where fewer young people are employed while studying compared to previous decades.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Donald Trump is employing the "Madman Theory" in foreign policy, using his perceived unpredictability as a strategic asset to coerce adversaries and allies. This approach, characterized by contradictory statements and sudden policy shifts, has created uncertainty about U.S. commitments, such as its role in NATO. While this tactic has successfully pressured European allies to increase defense spending, its effectiveness against adversaries like Russia and Iran is questioned.

Critics, including financial experts and a parliamentary committee, argue the withdrawal penalty is unfair and the property price threshold needs updating, as these flaws deter potential savers.

          <p>Real Madrid secured a spot in the Club World Cup semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain after a 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund. The Spanish team appeared in control for most of the match, with goals from academy products Gonzalo García and Fran García. However, a chaotic stoppage time saw a spectacular acrobatic goal from Kylian Mbappé for Madrid's third, followed by a late surge from Dortmund and a red card for Madrid's defender Dean Huijsen. The win sets up a highly anticipated match for Mbappé against his former club.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing over how potential cuts to HIV research funding by the Trump administration could affect the significant progress made toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. For decades, federally funded research has been instrumental in developing treatments that have transformed HIV from a fatal diagnosis into a manageable chronic condition. Reductions in funding could stall advancements in prevention, treatment, and the search for a cure, potentially reversing years of gains in public health and impacting the lives of millions of people living with or at risk for HIV.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has officially announced his resignation from Congress, a move that will further shrink the narrow GOP majority in the House of Representatives. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on competing with the Chinese Communist Party. His departure reduces the Republican majority to 219-212, potentially creating more challenges for House Speaker Mike Johnson in passing legislation. Green's resignation will be effective July 20.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to curb China's dominance in the global drone market, but analysts suggest that China's established position makes this a difficult task. A recent executive order aims to limit the use of Chinese-made drones, reflecting ongoing concerns in Washington about security and economic competition. However, industry insiders note that there are few non-Chinese alternatives, and a ban could lead to increased costs for commercial users in the U.S. This highlights the challenge the U.S. faces in removing Chinese technology from critical supply chains without significant disruption.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending an email that critics call misleading, claiming a new spending bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. In reality, the bill provides a temporary tax deduction that phases out for higher earners, rather than eliminating the tax entirely. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the email as a "blatant political statement" and a "lie," noting that the agency has historically been apolitical in its communications with the public.
