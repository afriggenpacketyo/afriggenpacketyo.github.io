        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK High Court has approved a restructuring plan for fashion retailer River Island, allowing it to close 33 stores to prevent financial collapse. The company cited a significant shift in customer behavior towards online shopping, coupled with rising operational costs, as reasons for its multi-million pound losses. River Island had warned creditors that without this approval, it faced a potential cash shortfall by the end of August. The plan also includes rent reductions for an additional 71 branches, aiming to align the company's physical presence with current consumer needs.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has altered its controversial "Visit Rwanda" sponsorship deal following sustained criticism regarding Rwanda's alleged role in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The club announced the partnership will now focus on football development through its youth academy in Kigali, rather than commercial promotion. This change comes after a public letter from DR Congo's foreign minister and fan protests urged the club to sever ties with what was termed an "oppressor nation." The financial aspect of the deal, worth around €5 million annually, has been de-emphasized, though the contract's 2028 end date remains.</p>

          <p>A recipe for cacio e pepe published by the UK's Good Food website has caused significant anger in Italy for its deviation from the traditional Roman dish. The recipe listed parmesan and butter as key ingredients, whereas the authentic version uses only pecorino cheese, pasta, and pepper. Italian restaurant association Fiepet Confesercenti expressed astonishment at the alteration of a classic dish on a respected platform. In response, Good Food explained its recipe was adapted for home cooks using readily available UK ingredients and has invited the association to provide an authentic version for its site.</p>

The 67-year-old Hollywood icon shared that modeling is still a significant part of her professional life and she is grateful for the consistent work. This revelation comes after she previously disclosed losing her $18 million in savings following a major health scare in 2001, which forced her to rebuild her finances. Stone also noted the high cost of fame and the financial disparity in Hollywood, mentioning she was paid significantly less than her male co-star for her breakout role in "Basic Instinct."</p>

Five women, who were victims of grooming gangs, have accused officers of abuse, with one alleging she was sexually assaulted by a serving officer in a police car from the age of 12. Three former officers have been arrested in connection with the claims.</p>

          <p>Residents of Gaza City are living in fear following the Israeli government's announcement of a plan for its military to take complete control of the territory's largest city. Civilians expressed feelings of despair, stating that the pressure is on them, not on Hamas, whose leaders are abroad. Many fear another wave of forced displacement, with one resident calling the plan a "death sentence" for every Palestinian. The plan, aimed at disarming Hamas and freeing hostages, has drawn widespread international condemnation, with the UN warning of potential atrocity crimes and further massive suffering.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast has emerged between the U.S. approach to climate change and a recent unanimous opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ declared that states have a binding legal obligation to protect the climate, making failure to curb emissions an "internationally wrongful act." Conversely, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to rescind its 2009 "endangerment finding," the legal basis for nearly all federal regulations on greenhouse gases. This move places the U.S. in direct opposition to a growing global legal understanding that holds nations accountable for climate harm.</p>

          <p>A new proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding" could significantly shift the U.S. auto industry's approach to electric vehicles (EVs). This finding is the legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, and its removal would ease the pressure on manufacturers to produce EVs. While automakers have invested heavily in electric fleets to meet stricter standards, this deregulation would allow them more flexibility to align production with consumer demand, which has recently seen slower growth. Experts note that companies will likely continue to offer low-emissions products to remain globally competitive.</p>

          <p>In a BBC Sport campaign, Premier League fans have shared personal stories about why they support their chosen football clubs, revealing deep-rooted connections often tied to family, community, and childhood heroes. These narratives range from being captivated by players like Paul Gascoigne during Italia '90 to a grandfather's ashes being buried under the Kop at Anfield. A researcher on sport fandom notes that these allegiances provide a vital sense of kinship and community in an increasingly isolated world. The stories underscore that for many, supporting a club is a powerful, shared identity that links generations.</p>

According to national data, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is approximately 6.75%, while the 15-year equivalent is around 5.99%. Refinance rates are slightly higher, with a 30-year average at 6.88%. The article advises that prospective borrowers can secure better rates by strengthening their credit profiles, as the best offers are typically reserved for those with scores in the mid-to-high 700s. Shopping around and comparing lenders is also crucial to finding the most affordable loan options. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent constitutional amendment in Togo has allowed President Faure Gnassingbe to transition to a new, powerful role as President of the Council of Ministers, effectively enabling him to rule indefinitely without direct elections. This move, which critics label a "constitutional coup," has solidified his family's nearly 60-year grip on power. Observers fear this could become a blueprint for other African leaders seeking to bypass term limits and democratic accountability. The development is part of a worrying trend on the continent, where several leaders have altered constitutions to extend their rule, often suppressing opposition and shrinking civic space.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old who lost both of his lower legs after a drunk driving crash last year stated he will "never forgive" the driver responsible. The teenager, a promising footballer named Adam Golebiewski, was a passenger in a car driven by 19-year-old Arran Paterson, who admitted to dangerous driving and being over the legal alcohol limit. Golebiewski, who has undergone intensive rehabilitation, walked into court on prosthetic legs for the sentencing. He expressed his anger toward the driver for wrecking not only his life but also the lives of his family and friends, but remains determined to stay positive.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, scientists have discovered strong new evidence of a giant gas planet in Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. Located just over four light-years away, the potential planet is believed to be similar to Jupiter or Saturn and orbits a star much like our Sun. While the gas giant itself would be uninhabitable, astronomers are excited by the possibility that it could host moons capable of sustaining life. The planet was briefly detected last year before disappearing from view, and astronomers must now conduct follow-up observations to confirm its existence.</p>

          <p>A detailed account reveals the events leading up to the fatal stabbing of 15-year-old Harvey Willgoose at a Sheffield school. The day began with a tense but seemingly resolved social media dispute between Harvey and his killer, another 15-year-old pupil. However, the conflict escalated through minor confrontations during the school day, culminating in the attacker stabbing Harvey in the heart with a hunting knife he had brought to school. The narrative, pieced together from trial testimony, shows Harvey had expressed anxiety about knives at school just days before he was killed by a classmate he had once considered a friend.</p>

          <p>The English Football League's Championship is experiencing unprecedented managerial instability, with only one of the 18 returning teams starting the new season with the same manager they had a year ago. Portsmouth's John Mousinho is the sole survivor, highlighting what he calls a "really brutal league" where pressure for results is immense. This high turnover rate contrasts sharply with the Premier League, League One, and League Two, which all have significantly more managerial continuity. The constant changes reflect the high stakes and intense competition within England's second tier, as clubs relentlessly pursue promotion.</p>

          <p>An Ohio affiliate of Planned Parenthood has announced it will no longer accept Medicaid insurance due to financial uncertainty surrounding potential Trump administration policies. The decision stems from fear that if a court ruling protecting Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood is overturned, the government could attempt to "claw back" any payments made. The affiliate, which operates four clinics, stated the financial risk was too great to bear. This move highlights the ongoing pressure on abortion providers and the strategic decisions affiliates are making to ensure long-term sustainability amid a volatile legal and political landscape.</p>

          <p>A recent Emerson College poll reveals that a large portion of California voters remain undecided about the 2026 governor's race and a potential effort to redraw congressional districts. In the gubernatorial field, former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter leads with 18%, but 38% of voters are undecided. Regarding a proposed special election to redraw congressional maps—a Democratic strategy to counter GOP moves in other states—voters are split, with 42% unsure. These early numbers suggest that both the race for governor and the debate over redistricting are wide open, with candidates and campaigns yet to engage voters aggressively.</p>
