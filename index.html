          <p>Almost 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, amidst a bitter pay dispute that previously led to strikes. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has already criticized the offer, with the vote being considered crucial in determining potential future strike action. The government defends the pay rise, stating it will bring new starter nurses' salaries above Â£30,000 for the first time, but the RCN argues that nursing has faced over a decade of pay erosion, leading to increased resignations.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is initiating a nationwide strategy to arrest illegal immigrants after their asylum hearings, targeting those who have been in the U.S. for less than two years. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to have immigration cases dropped, allowing for expedited removal proceedings and quicker deportations. This initiative is likely to generate controversy, as it may deter migrants from attending hearings and involves arresting individuals without criminal histories beyond illegal entry. Some legal experts believe this is a ploy to quickly boost apprehension numbers.</p>

          <p>The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is urging 200,000 new blood donors to register, as supplies are critically low, requiring an increase in regular donors to over one million to maintain a reliable supply. The health service previously issued an "amber alert" due to low blood stocks and is now trying to avoid a "red alert," which would threaten public safety. There is a particular need for more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types needed to treat sickle cell disease. Only a small percentage of the population donates regularly, and efforts are being made to make donating more accessible.</p>

Price wars in the automotive industry and falling property prices have contributed to the downward pressure on consumer prices. Chinese policymakers are being urged to implement more forceful stimulus measures to boost consumption, as exports alone are insufficient to combat deflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Polish and allied planes were briefly scrambled in Polish airspace early Monday in response to Russian aerial strikes targeting Ukraine. The Polish armed forces launched all available resources, including fighter pairs and ground-based air defense systems, as a preventative measure. The Ukrainian air force had issued alerts about Russian drones targeting areas throughout much of Ukraine. After approximately three hours, the threat of Russian strikes diminished, and the Polish and allied warplanes returned to their usual activity.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, across English waters. The proposal aims to extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference and follows warnings about the damage bottom trawling causes to the seabed and marine life. A 12-week consultation will seek views from the marine and fishing industry.</p>
