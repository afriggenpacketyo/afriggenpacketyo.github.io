        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus as a presidential right to deport individuals without due process during a Senate hearing, leading to sharp criticism. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, stating habeas corpus is a foundational right distinguishing free societies from police states. The Department of Homeland Security defended Noem's remarks by referencing historical instances where presidents have suspended habeas corpus during crises. This incident occurred amidst ongoing debates about the legality of the agency's detention and deportation practices, especially in light of the White House's consideration of suspending habeas corpus for migrants, citing an 18th-century wartime law.</p>

          <p>China has voiced strong opposition to the Trump administration's plan to construct a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, asserting it would escalate the risk of an arms race and militarize space. Chinese officials stated that the U.S.'s pursuit of absolute security undermines global strategic balance and stability, urging the U.S. to abandon the project. Russia responded that the plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but largely deferred to the U.S.'s sovereign right to do so. This comes amid U.S. military warnings about China and Russia's development of advanced missile technologies.</p>

          <p>The Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has reversed its decision to means-test the winter fuel allowance, a policy initially intended to highlight the government's economic challenges. This reversal follows widespread criticism and poor local election results attributed to the policy. While some believe the policy was inherently flawed, others suggest the failure lay in neglecting to make a positive case for it. The move is seen as an effort to appease anxious Labour MPs amidst growing discontent over welfare cuts, although the government remains firm on broader welfare reforms.</p>

Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire. This discovery aligns with the virus's increasing prevalence in Europe due to climate change, which is pushing mosquito populations northward. While most infections result in minor or no symptoms, a small percentage can lead to severe neurological illnesses, and there are currently no specific treatments or vaccines available for humans.</p>

As a palliative care doctor argues, there is a need for greater transparency and planning for the worst-case scenarios when leaders face serious health challenges.

          <p>Chinese robotics developers are showcasing their products in an increasingly crowded market, reminiscent of the country's electric vehicle industry. Many firms at the Guangzhou International Intelligent Robot Exhibition plan to achieve large-scale production this year, encouraged by reduced U.S. tariffs. Companies like Li-Gong Industrial and Shenzhen DX Intech Technology are developing various types of robots, from bipedal humanoids to robotic receptionists, with plans to expand both domestically and internationally. The event attracted over 500 firms, highlighting the rapid growth and competitive landscape of China's robotics sector.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team from the PLA Air Force Early Warning Academy has assessed the U.S. military's tactical nuclear air strike capabilities and surprisingly concluded that the 70-year-old B-52 Stratofortress bomber poses a greater threat than advanced platforms like the F-35A and B-2 Spirit bombers. The study, published in Modern Defence Technology, simulated a U.S. Air Force penetrating counterair operation and found the B-52 to be the top threat across all combat phases. The researchers emphasized the destructive power of nuclear-armed platforms, highlighting their potential to cripple critical facilities.</p>

          <p>Large language models (LLMs) like GPT and Claude are becoming increasingly sophisticated, raising questions about how they work and what they "believe" about their users. Recent advancements in AI interpretability are allowing researchers to peek inside these "black boxes" and uncover the models' assumptions and stereotypes. Researchers are finding that LLMs make assumptions about users' gender, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics, which influence the model's responses. This raises concerns about potential biases and the need for greater transparency and control over how LLMs are used.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America," explores the pervasive influence of multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes on American work culture. The book reveals how corporations have adopted strategies similar to those used by MLM companies, such as hiring temporary workforces and pushing employees to think like entrepreneurs. It argues that the low quality of many legitimate jobs provides cover for shadier schemes, blurring the lines between legitimate employment and fraudulent practices. The author explains that MLM opportunities promise security, freedom, and dignity, but consistently fail to deliver, underscoring the need for greater stability and worker protections.</p>

          <p>Treasury yields moved higher on Wednesday as investors feared a new U.S. tax bill could worsen the country's deficit following a Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Investors are keeping an eye on discussions around U.S. President Donald Trump's budget bill as some Republicans said they wouldn't support the bill without larger deductions for state and local taxes. The bill could increase the U.S. government's deficit â€” which has become a cause for alarm in the past week. On Friday, Moody's downgraded the U.S. government's credit rating to the second-highest tier, putting it in line with all other major rating agencies, and highlighted the increasing burden of financing the government's ballooning budget deficit.
