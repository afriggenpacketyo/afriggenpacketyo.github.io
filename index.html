            <p>This article examines the potential consequences of President Trump's recently imposed tariffs on the US stock market and retirement savings. It notes that the stock market has already experienced significant losses since the announcement of the tariffs, impacting a large percentage of Americans who have investments in stocks through 401(k)s, IRAs, and pensions. Economists predict that the tariffs will lead to a decline in disposable income for the average US household and may force companies to cut costs by reducing their labor force. The article highlights that the market volatility is not just a concern for the wealthy, but also for regular Americans who rely on their investments for retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

This behavior is atypical, as investors usually flock to bonds during economic uncertainty, driving yields lower.

            <p>Despite concerns over rising tariffs on China, some US companies remain optimistic about doing business there. Ali Din, CEO of Premier NX, suggests that American firms can adapt by de-risking and rebalancing their operations, rather than relying on legislative changes. He notes that some businesses are evaluating how to share costs with Chinese partners, while others are considering "indirect routes" or "hybrid strategies" to navigate geopolitical challenges. Din emphasizes the importance of flexibility and consistency in policy to maintain good working terms for businesses in China.</p>
