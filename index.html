Stone's family highlighted his monumental influence on pop, funk, and rock music, noting his songs have left an indelible mark on the world. Stone recently completed a screenplay for his life story and released a memoir in 2023 titled "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)," detailing his revolutionary music style and struggles with addiction. Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson praised Stone for his musical innovation and for uplifting women in the music industry, a rare practice at the time.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations. Kennedy stated that a "clean sweep" is necessary to restore public confidence in vaccine science, but it is unclear who he will appoint to the new group. This move follows other changes Kennedy has made at HHS, including halting routine COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women and canceling pandemic prevention programs. Critics worry that this overhaul could lead to politicized recommendations that undermine trust in the CDC and public health experts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, stating that California Governor Gavin Newsom should be "happy" about the assistance. Trump implied that the situation in LA is improving due to the federal intervention, despite previously stating that National Guard deployments require a governor's request. He criticized Newsom as an "incompetent governor" who is "destroying one of our great states," justifying the federal intervention. Trump's comments follow protests in Los Angeles related to immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>A mother, Mary Schubart, discovered that mattress pads she purchased from Pottery Barn Teen, advertised as "crafted in the USA," were actually made in China. Schubart reported her findings to Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit watchdog group, leading to an investigation of false claims by Pottery Barn Teen. The investigation resulted in the largest "Made in the USA" civil penalty in history, with Williams Sonoma, the parent company, fined over $3 million. The FTC requires that products labeled "Made in the USA" be manufactured domestically with U.S.-sourced components, advising consumers to check labels carefully for qualifying language such as "Assembled in the USA" or "with imported parts."</p>

Israel's foreign ministry reported the activists are undergoing medical examinations and will be deported to their home countries. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) stated the Madleen aimed to bring a symbolic amount of aid to Gaza, defying an Israeli naval blockade. Israel defended its actions, stating the blockade prevents weapons from reaching Hamas fighters, while the FFC argues it is illegal.</p>

Sixty-one percent of women now identify as "pro-choice," compared to only 41% of men, marking the widest gap in decades. The gap is attributed to an increase in support among women since Roe's collapse, while men's support has declined.
