          <p>Families are paying tribute to a British couple, a theatre director and a drama lecturer, who were among 16 people killed in a funicular crash in Lisbon. The popular tourist attraction derailed and crashed into a building, with victims from several countries. The cause of the crash is currently unknown, and an independent investigation has been launched by the public transport operator. Portugal's Prime Minister has called the incident a major tragedy, and a national day of mourning has been declared.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the United States and Venezuela are escalating following a deadly US strike on a speedboat that departed from Venezuela. The White House labeled the deceased as "narco-terrorists," a claim disputed by some experts, while President Maduro has threatened to activate millions of militiamen in response. The incident is part of a broader "war on drugs" militarization by the Trump administration, which has also deployed warships to the Caribbean. Despite the heightened rhetoric and actions, some analysts believe a full-scale US intervention is unlikely due to potential consequences like a migration crisis.</p>

          <p>The controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's files has resurfaced as a central issue for the U.S. Congress upon its return from recess. Bipartisan efforts, led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, are pushing for the full release of documents using a parliamentary maneuver to bypass House leadership. House Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to manage the situation with a separate measure to formalize an investigation, a move critics call a political cover tactic. The issue is creating internal division within the Republican party, particularly concerning former President Trump's shifting stance on releasing the files.</p>

          <p>Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, has publicly called for President Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Adams argues that Kennedy's policies on vaccines and his disruptive changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are dangerous and put the nation's health at risk. This call follows recent turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director and the replacement of its immunization advisory committee. Adams co-authored an opinion piece with other former surgeons general expressing grave concern over the potential undermining of the CDC's integrity.</p>

The classic car, which still has its original matching-numbers engine, was gifted to its previous owner in the 1970s as a thank you for helping with a repair. He intended to restore the vehicle but never got around to it, leaving it untouched for three decades.

          <p>A long-standing conflict at California's Point Reyes National Seashore is entering a new phase as 12 organic dairy and cattle operations have accepted a multi-million dollar buyout to leave the land. This deal, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a massive five-year restoration effort aimed at reviving native ecosystems. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to control invasive plants.

          <p>Germany's pension system, founded on a "generational contract" where current workers fund retirees, is facing a severe crisis due to demographic shifts. A declining birth rate since the 1970s and an aging population mean that by 2039, a third of the current workforce will retire, with too few younger workers to support them. This strain is leading to proposals like a new tax on wealthier pensioners, as the government pumps over €100 billion annually into the system to keep it afloat. The situation contrasts with more stable systems in neighboring countries like Austria and the Netherlands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have discovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, a brutal clash during the American Revolution. The hastily buried remains include Continental soldiers, a British Highlander, and a Native American fighter. To identify these forgotten soldiers, a team is now using forensic genealogy, treating it as the "ultimate cold case." They have successfully built genetic profiles for two individuals and are asking potential descendants to submit DNA samples to help restore the names of these first American soldiers.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has clarified a key pledge to stop migrant boats within two weeks of his party winning power. He now states this two-week timeline would begin only after new legislation, the "Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill," is passed, a process that could take months. The proposed bill would bar asylum claims from anyone arriving on a small boat and disavow international treaties like the Refugee Convention. This adjustment came during a media interview where Farage was pressed on the practicalities of his initial, more definitive-sounding promise.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system for mobile phones on Sunday, September 7, around 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn the public about life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. During the test, compatible phones will emit a siren sound and vibrate for about 10 seconds. While the government recommends keeping the alerts enabled, users can opt out through their phone's settings. This test follows a previous one in 2023 that experienced some technical issues which officials say have been addressed.</p>

          <p>The recent gathering of leaders from Russia, China, and North Korea in Beijing is being interpreted as a clear demonstration of their strengthening alliance against the United States. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed how these adversaries are openly declaring their goal to dismantle the post-war, U.S.-led international order. The analysis highlighted a perceived contradiction in the Trump administration's foreign policy, which appears to be accommodating these rivals while simultaneously creating friction with traditional U.S. allies. The discussion framed the summit as a significant challenge to American global influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Salvadoran national Kilmar Ábrego García that he may be deported to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini. This is at least the fourth potential destination proposed for Ábrego García, who has no ties to the country and is at the center of a complex immigration dispute. He was previously deported to El Salvador by mistake and returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges, which he denies. The unusual plan to send him to Eswatini highlights the administration's use of agreements with third countries as part of its broader immigration crackdown.</p>

The interview comes as the court faces a request to reconsider the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, a topic on which public opinion is strongly in favor of upholding.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers were given a rare glimpse into the depths of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the U.S., via a live-streamed dive by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to showcase the lake's unique underwater ecosystem and raise awareness for its protection. The ROV, named Emmy, traveled over 1,500 feet below the surface, dispelling myths about mob bodies but highlighting the lake's ancient geological history. Experts used the opportunity to discuss the importance of the lakebed's health and ongoing efforts to remove trash and invasive species.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a $4 billion position in PepsiCo and is pushing for significant changes to boost the company's underperforming stock. In a detailed presentation, Elliott argues that strategic missteps, particularly in Pepsi's North American beverage business, have hampered growth. The firm's plan calls for refranchising the bottling network, optimizing the product portfolio by divesting weaker brands, and reinvesting in core brands such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Elliott believes these actions could unlock at least 50% upside for shareholders by improving focus and operational efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book is highlighting the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese émigré best known for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document the American jazz scene, capturing the inward emotions of musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, but the project was derailed due to McCarthy-era political suspicion. The collection of over 1,800 negatives reveals her unique ability to photograph the complex reality of jazz luminaries who, despite being cultural ambassadors for the U.S., faced racism and persecution at home.</p>
