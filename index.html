            <p>The legal battle over Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation continues, with the Trump administration and Garcia's defense presenting conflicting narratives. Garcia, accused of MS-13 ties, sits in an El Salvador prison, unable to speak for himself. His lawyers portray him as a family man wrongly targeted, while the administration releases documents alleging gang affiliation and domestic violence. The court's focus remains on due process, questioning whether the government can prove its claims in court before revoking his protected status. The case tests executive power versus judicial oversight in immigration matters.</p>

Government bonds, typically seen as safe investments, experienced a sell-off, causing interest rates to rise sharply. This suggests a loss of confidence in the US economy. The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with Liz Truss's mini-Budget. The uncertainty over tariffs has led investors to demand higher returns for lending the government money.

Trump's immigration policies build on Bukele's tactics, leveraging anti-establishment sentiment to justify authoritarian measures.

            <p>China's museums are being tasked with promoting ethnic unity and countering "wrong historical views," according to a top ethnic policy official. Museums should avoid portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational contexts with ethnic minorities. They are also instructed to tell the "China story" using archaeological findings. The aim is to cultivate a sense of community within the country and present China as a diverse but unified nation.</p>
