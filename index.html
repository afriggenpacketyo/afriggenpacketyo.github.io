            <p>The National Park Service restored a webpage about the Underground Railroad to its original state after removing Harriet Tubman's photo and quote. The changes, made in February, replaced Tubman with a collage of commemorative stamps and altered the text to focus on cooperation rather than resistance to enslavement. The NPS stated the changes were made without approval and the webpage was immediately restored. The incident sparked criticism, with civil rights advocates and public figures denouncing the removal as an attempt to erase history and diminish Tubman's legacy.</p>

            <p>The White House announced that a 104% tariff on goods imported from China will take effect on Wednesday, escalating trade tensions. This follows President Trump's threat to impose an additional 50% tariff in response to China's retaliatory 34% import fee on American products. The White House stated that these tariffs are designed to open negotiations with trade partners, while China asserted it would "fight to the end" if Trump did not retract his threat. Critics, including Wall Street figures, warn that the tariffs could stoke inflation and slow the U.S. economy.</p>

            <p>Apple's recent stock plunge has allowed Microsoft to reclaim its position as the world's most valuable public company. Apple's reliance on China has made it particularly vulnerable to the impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plan, leading to a significant drop in its market capitalization. While both Apple and Microsoft were previously valued at over $3 trillion, Microsoft's more insulated position amid tariff uncertainty has contributed to its resurgence. Microsoft also held the highest market capitalization earlier in the year before Apple regained the title.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of Peter Navarro, President Trump's trade advisor, as Tesla shares continue to decline. Musk criticized Navarro's views on trade and manufacturing, particularly Navarro's characterization of Tesla as merely a "car assembler." The feud highlights differing perspectives within the Trump administration regarding the tariff policies and their impact on businesses. Tesla's stock has suffered significant losses, partly attributed to the tariffs on materials and parts from foreign suppliers. Musk has previously advocated for a zero-tariff trade zone between Europe and North America.</p>

            <p>President Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson are urging House Republicans to support the Senate-passed budget resolution, which is crucial for extending Trump's tax cuts. However, several House Republicans oppose the resolution, arguing it doesn't cut enough spending. The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. The resolution sets relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts, while allowing for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending.</p>

Film executives are now less reliant on Chinese revenue when planning production budgets.

The legislation aims to reassert Congress' role in trade policy and provide lawmakers the ability to cancel tariffs with a joint resolution.

            <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is scrutinizing the use of magnetic tape for storing government records. This initiative draws a parallel to the Watergate scandal, where Nixon's secret recordings on magnetic tape played a crucial role in his downfall. The DOGE's focus on outdated technology reflects a broader effort to modernize and streamline government operations. The shift away from magnetic tape could have significant implications for transparency and accountability in government.</p>

            <p>A reverse mortgage can help boost the income of homeowners aged 62 and above. Reverse mortgages allow senior homeowners to convert a portion of their home equity into cash. These loans offer flexibility in disbursement, including lump-sum payments, lines of credit, or monthly installments. Repayment is typically managed through the sale of the home by the borrower or their heirs. Several companies offer reverse mortgages, each with different terms and benefits.

            <p>Colossal Biosciences, a biotech company, claims to have successfully de-extincted the dire wolf, a species that died off over 12,500 years ago.

The animals are being cared for on a preserve certified by the American Humane Society. Critics argue that the revived species may not fully replicate the ecological functions of the original dire wolf.</p>

Many fear they will have to raise prices or absorb the costs, leading to financial strain. Some businesses are reducing salaries and scaling back expansion plans. The tariffs could exacerbate existing economic challenges, including inflation and skittish consumer spending. The tariffs may incentivize domestic manufacturing, but the transition period could be perilous for small businesses.</p>
