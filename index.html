          <h2>Trump Criticizes Zelenskyy Amid Peace Plan Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 19:38:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for refusing to accept a US-backed peace plan that would cede Crimea to Russia, claiming Zelenskyy's stance prolongs the conflict. Trump stated a deal was "very close" but Zelenskyy's rejection of US terms "will do nothing but prolong" the conflict. This follows US Vice-President Vance's suggestion of freezing territorial lines, requiring both Ukraine and Russia to concede territory. Ukraine has consistently refused to relinquish Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, citing its constitution. Trump's administration has yet to offer specifics about what geographic concessions would have to be made.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned through 13,250 acres and is approximately 50% contained, prompting a state of emergency declaration. Evacuations have been lifted for 5,000 residents after threatening 1,300 homes, with one business destroyed but no injuries or deaths reported. Fire officials attribute the fire's rapid spread to dry conditions and anticipate the acreage to increase as they continue burnout operations. Smoke from the wildfire has prompted an Air Quality Health Advisory for New York City, with officials expecting full containment by the weekend if precipitation arrives as forecasted.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that if the U.S. fails to reach trade agreements with other countries within the next few weeks, he will impose tariffs.

          <p>The CEOs of Walmart and Target have privately cautioned President Trump that his tariff policies could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves. The warnings came during a closed-door meeting at the White House, also attended by the CEO of Home Depot. Both retailers have publicly stated that Trump's tariffs could result in higher prices for consumers. The Trump administration has imposed significant tariffs on Chinese goods and other countries, sparking concerns about rising consumer prices and economic slowdown.

          <p>A coalition of states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the legality of recently imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states contend that the tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy. Arizona's Attorney General described Trump's tariff scheme as "economically reckless and illegal," arguing that the tariffs amount to a tax on consumers.</p>

          <p>A study by Dartmouth College researchers estimates that emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies caused $28 trillion in climate damage between 1991 and 2020. The study presents a peer-reviewed method for linking emissions to specific climate harms, aiming to hold companies liable for the costs of extreme weather. About a third of the total cost is attributed to five companies: Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP. The researchers used computer simulations to translate emissions into changes in global average surface temperature.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government is liable to the state of North Dakota for nearly $28 million in costs incurred during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 and 2017. The state had sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, alleging the agency failed to follow mandatory procedures, leading to the protests and associated policing expenses. The protests, which drew international attention, centered on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's opposition to the pipeline's Missouri River crossing.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that nearly half of Americans still live with unhealthy air pollution, despite decades of improvements in air quality. The report highlights that 156 million people live in areas with high levels of smog or soot pollution, which harms lungs, hearts, and brains. The report comes as the Trump administration considers rolling back key air quality regulations. People of color are disproportionately affected, being twice as likely to live in areas with high pollution levels.</p>
