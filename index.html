            <h2>Trump's Tariffs Open Door for China to Join CPTPP</h2>

            <p>President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on numerous countries, styled as America's “Liberation Day,” has triggered market instability and recession fears. Analysts suggest this move could inadvertently pave the way for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As countries seek to counter American trade threats, they may close ranks, potentially aiding China's long-standing application to the trade agreement, which includes nations like Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have reached an agreement allowing ICE to access taxpayer information to locate undocumented immigrants subject to deportation. This memorandum of understanding (MOU) aims to streamline law enforcement efforts against criminal undocumented immigrants who have remained in the United States for over 90 days after a judge's removal order. Treasury Department officials emphasize the MOU includes safeguards to protect the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers while enabling the pursuit of criminal violations, although some IRS officials have voiced concerns that this could hinder tax collection from undocumented immigrants.</p>

            <p>Amid Sino-European relations that have been dominated by turmoil, the level of engagement between Europe and China has only increased. Some argue that these tariffs are nothing more than a strategic ploy, aimed at pushing countries to the negotiating table to get the best deal and potentially create a “ Mar-a-Lago Accord ” to devalue the US dollar. The reciprocal tariffs also go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade between countries.</p>

            <p>The Dodgers lost to the Nationals due to defensive miscues, highlighting a growing trend of fundamental struggles. Errors by key players like Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas contributed to unearned runs. Shohei Ohtani had a strong offensive performance, but the team's defensive shortcomings overshadowed his efforts. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the need for cleaner baseball, emphasizing that the team's high standards require improvement in all aspects of the game.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has issued a 5-4 decision in Trump v. J.G.G., largely along party lines, that tosses out a closely watched district court decision, which blocked President Donald Trump’s attempt to use a 227-year-old law — the Alien Enemies Act — to deport many individuals without due process. The Court does not express an opinion on whether the Alien Enemies Act actually permits Trump to deport anyone. It also rules that, before anyone is deported under this law, that person must be given “notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States will hold direct talks with Iran on its nuclear program, starting Saturday. The meeting will be at 'almost the highest level,' Trump said. Trump offered few details about the upcoming talks. The announcement was made as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office. During his first term, Trump withdrew from the 2015 landmark nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by then-President Barack Obama.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump may continue using a 1798 law to deport alleged gang members to Venezuela, with certain limits. The court granted the Trump administration’s request to lift a Washington DC-based judge’s order temporarily blocking the deportations. The court did not immediately address whether the administration improperly utilized the act, writing in its order instead that such a determination must be made in Texas court.</p>

            <p>China has vowed to take countermeasures against any move by the United States to further raise tariffs and pledged to take firm action to stabilise the markets, after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap another 50 per cent duty on Chinese imports. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would “provide relending support if necessary to resolutely defend the stability of the capital market”, as officials rushed to contain the fallout from an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.</p>

However, observers caution that diplomatic talk aside, there appears to have been few actual gains on contentious sticking points, with core disputes lingering over enforcement mechanisms, geographic scope, legal status and the role of external powers.</p>
