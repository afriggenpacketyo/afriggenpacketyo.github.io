        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants, by freezing a lower court's decision that deemed the termination illegal. This ruling permits the administration to proceed with revoking legal protections, asserting that allowing these migrants to remain in the U.S. strains local resources and contradicts national interest. The Solicitor General argued that lower courts could not review Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision, which she deemed necessary for national security and public safety. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, sharply criticizing the high court's use of its emergency docket to disrupt so many lives quickly. This contentious decision marks the second instance where the Supreme Court has supported the administration's efforts to roll back these protections for Venezuelans.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has been sentenced to 50 months in prison and five years of supervised release for two prostitution-related offenses, along with a maximum fine of $500,000. District Judge Arun Subramanian acknowledged Combs's significant business success and impact on the Black community, and his efforts to get sober, but emphasized that a history of good works could not erase the record of abuse. The judge highlighted that Combs used his power to orchestrate "freak-offs" and hotel nights over a decade, which drove victims like Cassie Ventura and "Jane" to contemplate ending their lives. Combs will receive credit for 12 months already served in prison.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has extended into its second week as both Republican and Democratic spending proposals failed to reach the required 60-vote threshold in the Senate. The core disagreement centers on healthcare, with Democrats aiming to secure health insurance subsidies and reverse Trump administration cuts to Medicaid, while Republicans accuse them of seeking healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The White House, blaming Democrats, warned of potential mass layoffs to maintain essential services if the shutdown persists. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the economic consequences are mounting daily, with an estimated $15 billion in GDP potentially lost each week as unemployment rises.</p>

The suspect, Jihad Al-Shamie (35), a British citizen of Syrian descent, was shot dead by police at the scene. Tragically, one of the victims, Adrian Daulby, was hit by police gunfire as officers engaged the attacker. Worshippers demonstrated immediate bravery by holding the entrance doors shut, preventing the attacker from entering the building. Three others sustained serious injuries in the incident, which is being treated as a terror attack.</p>

          <p>Amazon is closing four additional Fresh supermarkets in Southern California, indicating a continued strategic pivot towards its Whole Foods brand and online delivery services. These closures, which follow previous shutdowns in other U.S. states and the U.K., are a result of assessments determining that certain locations are not performing optimally. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed they are working to relocate affected employees within the company. Despite these physical store reductions, Amazon emphasizes its ongoing commitment to innovating and investing in grocery shopping, maintaining 500 Whole Foods locations and expanding its "daily shop" mini-stores and same-day fresh food delivery options.</p>

          <p>Ronald Exantus, 42, convicted in the 2015 killing of 6-year-old Logan Tipton in Kentucky, has been released on parole after serving less than half of his 20-year sentence. Exantus was found guilty of second-degree assault after breaking into the Tipton home, fatally stabbing Logan, and attacking his father and sisters. He was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity, according to reports. Logan's father, Dean Tipton, expressed profound anger and despair over the early release, stating his family gave up on life after the tragedy. Exantus is now on mandatory reentry supervision until June next year.</p>

While Netflix has not commented, analysts believe Musk's call, similar to past boycotts against other companies like Bud Light, is unlikely to significantly impact the streaming giant's robust subscriber numbers or $490 billion market cap.

          <p>Portland, Oregon, residents are actively countering President Trump's depiction of their city as a "war zone" by showcasing its vibrant daily life, natural beauty, and thriving cultural scene. Despite Trump's claims of widespread unrest and his order for military deployment, local officials and residents emphasize that minor protests do not reflect the city's overall tranquility. Through social media campaigns and planned events like an "Emergency Naked Bike Ride," Portlanders are pushing back against what they call Trump's "100% false" narrative, fearing negative impacts on local businesses and community morale. They assert that any disturbances are minimal and often provoked by right-wing agitators.</p>

          <p>The federal government shutdown has postponed the release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report, typically a key economic indicator. Despite the delay, external high-frequency data from sources like Indeed and the Chicago Federal Reserve suggest the labor market remained relatively stable in September, with anemic but continued employment growth. Economists forecast around 51,000 nonfarm payroll additions and a steady unemployment rate of 4.3%. Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee noted that while employment growth continues to be anemic, the labor market overall isn't capsizing. The article highlights the challenge of assessing economic health without official data, especially during a period of transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has caused the postponement of critical economic reports, including the monthly jobs report and potentially the upcoming September inflation report. Economists emphasize the heightened value of accurate data during economic transitions, likening the situation to driving in fog without headlights. While alternative data sources exist, they cannot fully substitute the comprehensive reach of federal government surveys, which capture tens of millions of employees. This delay creates significant uncertainty for businesses and policymakers trying to understand the economy's direction, with past shutdowns having caused delays for up to two months.

          <p>Apple has removed the ICEBlock app, which allowed users to crowdsource and report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, from its App Store. The developer attributed the removal to "pressure from the Trump Admin.," while Apple cited "objectionable content" and information from law enforcement about safety risks. The Department of Justice confirmed it requested the app's removal, arguing it endangered ICE agents and crossed an "intolerable red line." This action highlights the contentious debate between free speech, public safety, and immigration enforcement, particularly amid the Trump administration's increased deportation activities and the potential for apps to be used for ambushes.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fired Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a top official at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who blew the whistle on internal clashes over vaccine research during the early Trump administration. Marrazzo, who previously alleged she was silenced for pushing back against officials questioning childhood flu vaccines, stated her termination demonstrates a lack of commitment to scientific integrity and public health. Her attorney claims the firing is further "retaliation for her protected whistleblower activity," raising significant concerns about political interference in scientific research and the protection of whistleblowers within federal health agencies.</p>
