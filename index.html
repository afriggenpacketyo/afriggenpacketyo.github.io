The zoo is hosting a week of farewell events for fans before she departs, a move intended to support conservation breeding efforts for pygmy hippos, which number less than 2,500 in the wild.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has issued an order to dismantle Washington, D.C.'s sanctuary city policies, stripping power from the local police chief and appointing the head of the DEA as an "emergency police commissioner." The directive rescinds orders that limited cooperation between the Metropolitan Police Department and federal immigration authorities, coming as part of a broader federal crime crackdown in the capital initiated by President Trump. This move intensifies the federal government's control over local law enforcement, citing a crime emergency to justify the changes.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates significantly reduced its exposure to Chinese equities in the second quarter, selling off its stakes in major U.S.-listed firms like Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com. This move signals a notable retreat from the Chinese market by the fund, founded by longtime China advocate Ray Dalio, amid growing geopolitical tensions and concerns over China's economic outlook. The divestment comes as the U.S. and China navigate a fragile tariff truce, reflecting broader investor uncertainty about the region's financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>International talks in Geneva aimed at creating a legally binding treaty to combat plastic pollution have ended in a stalemate, failing to produce an agreement. The primary point of contention was a deep division between nations advocating for caps on plastic production and oil-producing states focused on recycling and waste management. Despite extending negotiations, delegates from over 100 countries could not bridge the gap, marking another setback in the global effort to address the environmental and health crises caused by escalating plastic waste.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow his party to appoint peers to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is democratically imbalanced, as his party lacks representation despite securing over four million votes in the last general election. He pointed out that parties with fewer votes and MPs, such as the Green Party and Plaid Cymru, have members in the Lords, calling the situation a "democratic disparity" that needs to be addressed.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is intensifying over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become the season's first hurricane, with maximum sustained winds nearing 74 mph. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will develop into a large and formidable major hurricane as it moves west-northwest. While not an immediate threat to the United States, the storm's path is projected to pass near or north of the Leeward Islands over the weekend. The storm has already caused significant flooding and fatalities in the Cabo Verde islands.</p>

          <h2>Homeless Individuals in D.C. Face Displacement Amid Federal 'Safe and Beautiful' Initiative</h2>

          <p>President Trump's initiative to make Washington, D.C., "Safe and Beautiful" is resulting in the clearing of homeless encampments across the city, causing distress and uncertainty for those affected. As federal and local law enforcement agencies dismantle makeshift shelters, many homeless individuals are being forced to pack their belongings and relocate without a clear destination. While the administration frames the operation as a crackdown on crime and grime, critics and those targeted describe it as a dehumanizing action that treats people like eyesores rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as retail sales and industrial output grew at a slower pace than anticipated, indicating persistent weak domestic demand. Retail sales rose 3.7% year-over-year, missing forecasts, while industrial production increased by 5.7%, its weakest performance since last November. The slowdown is attributed to a challenging external environment, extreme weather events that disrupted operations, and government efforts to curb excess industrial capacity, raising concerns about achieving the full-year growth target without additional policy support.

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after the removal of 177 World War II-era practice bombs that were buried just beneath the surface. The devices were discovered by a contractor in January while installing new play equipment, leading to a large-scale ordnance disposal operation. The bombs, which were not live but contained a charge, were found carefully stacked in rows. It is believed they were buried on the site of a former military ordnance depot after the war, remaining undetected for decades as generations of children played above them.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The military base was chosen for its security capabilities and availability during the busy tourist season for the hastily arranged summit. The choice of Alaska, a territory purchased by the U.S. from Russia in 1867, adds historical resonance to the talks. This meeting follows unsuccessful negotiation rounds and aims to find a path toward a ceasefire, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend.</p>

          <p>A federal building in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated following the discovery of an unknown white powder in the mailroom. The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly, and the FBI reported that the powder was found in five separate letters. At least two people were exposed, but authorities stated there was no remaining threat to the public or employees. The substance is being tested, and the building has been the site of recent protests regarding the treatment of immigrants.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association has issued new guidelines for managing hypertension, recommending that Americans limit both alcohol and sodium consumption. The updated advice suggests men consume no more than two alcoholic drinks per day and women no more than one, while also reinforcing the need to reduce daily sodium intake. A significant change is the recommendation for doctors to advise lifestyle modifications for individuals with stage 1 hypertension, an earlier intervention than previously prescribed. This proactive approach aims to better combat heart disease, which remains the leading cause of death in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Leaders in Washington, D.C., are pushing back against the Trump administration's move to assert federal control over the city's police force, calling the action unlawful. Attorney General Pam Bondi had named the head of the DEA as an "emergency police commissioner," effectively sidelining the local police chief. However, D.C.'s Attorney General argued that federal law does not grant the administration the authority to replace the chief or alter the police department's chain of command. This sets up a potential legal and jurisdictional clash between the local government and the federal administration's ongoing crime crackdown.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding forecasts despite facing tariff pressures from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by resilient exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, the economy grew by 1%, more than double what economists had predicted. However, analysts caution that a slowdown may be on the horizon, as corporate investment is expected to soften and the full impact of U.S. tariffs could dampen future growth.
