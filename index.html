        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has submitted a second criminal referral to the Department of Justice concerning Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The new allegations focus on potential misrepresentations in government ethics filings regarding a condominium in Massachusetts, which was declared as a 'Second Home' on a mortgage application but later as an 'investment/rental property'. This action follows an earlier referral about other properties and comes as Cook is suing President Trump to prevent her removal from the Fed's board. The referral intensifies the conflict between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber achieved a rare feat in baseball by hitting four home runs in a single game against Atlanta. This performance makes him the 21st player in MLB history and the fourth Phillie to accomplish this, with Mike Schmidt being the last in 1976. Schwarber's historic night included a team-record nine RBIs, propelling him to the top of the National League home run leaderboard with 49 for the season. His exceptional game was a key factor in the Phillies' dominant 19-4 victory.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is poised to deliver a verdict on Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who faces removal from office over alleged ethical breaches. The case centers on a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen, where her comments were perceived as undermining the Thai military amid border tensions that led to deadly clashes. A ruling against Paetongtarn, who has been in power for just a year, could leave a leadership vacuum and trigger significant political instability. This situation highlights the ongoing power struggles between the Shinawatra dynasty, the military, and the royalist establishment.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to order Trump administration officials to cease making inflammatory and prejudicial public comments about their client. They argue that statements from officials, including President Trump calling Abrego Garcia an "animal" and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem branding him a criminal, are tainting the jury pool and violating a previous court order against extrajudicial comments. Abrego Garcia, who was deported and then returned to the U.S. to face charges, is at the center of a high-profile immigration and legal battle. His attorneys contend that the government's public campaign jeopardizes his right to a fair trial.</p>

          <p>Investigators have revealed that the individual who attacked a church in Minneapolis, killing two children and injuring 18 others, was motivated by a deep-seated hatred and an obsession with killing children. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara stated that the attacker, Robin Westman, did not appear to have a specific target but expressed animosity towards many groups. The victims were identified as 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski. Officials also noted that the shooter, who had previously attended the church's school, left behind hateful writings but a definitive motive remains elusive.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the DNA of an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, known as the Druids Oak, to uncover the genetic secrets of its remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to understand how ancient oaks survive threats like climate change and disease. By analyzing the genomes of about 50 ancient oaks across the UK, scientists hope to identify key genetic traits. This knowledge could be vital for selecting the most robust trees for future planting, helping to restore Britain's woodlands and support the diverse ecosystems they host.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a network of spammers, primarily based in Pakistan, who are creating and posting AI-generated images of the Holocaust on Facebook to profit from the platform's content monetization program. These fabricated images and stories, often referred to as 'AI slop,' attract high engagement, which translates into payments for the creators. Holocaust memorial organizations have condemned the practice, stating it distresses survivors, disrespects victims, and distorts history. The report highlights how Meta's system inadvertently rewards the creation of emotionally manipulative and historically inaccurate content.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, and a catch-up program is planned for older children. Previously, parents had to pay for the vaccine privately. Health officials hope the program will protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has overruled a board-approved plan to display Israeli flags on school campuses during Jewish American Heritage Month, citing student safety concerns. The 3-2 board vote had been contentious, with supporters viewing it as a stand against antisemitism and opponents arguing it was an inappropriate political statement for a public school. Superintendent Alex Cherniss used his executive authority to halt the display, stating that until further notice, only U.S. and California state flags will be permitted on campuses to avoid potential risks.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before initiating a major reorganization to merge local councils in England, a BBC investigation found. Instead, the ministry relied on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN), which initially projected £2.9 billion in savings. However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the mergers could result in no savings and might even incur significant costs, potentially up to £850 million over five years. Critics argue that embarking on such a large-scale restructuring without independent financial assessment is irresponsible.</p>

The bombardment, one of the largest on the capital in months, also destroyed a residential building and drew strong condemnation from the UK and US.

While officials defend the law as a national security measure, opponents, including community leaders and the ACLU, argue it is discriminatory and evokes historical anti-immigrant legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Act. The law has created uncertainty and fear within immigrant communities and has prompted a legal challenge, though an initial lawsuit was dismissed.

The sterile female fish weighed 26 kilograms and measured over 1.2 meters long, one of the largest specimens ever processed by Canadian authorities. Grass carp are known for their voracious appetite, consuming up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, which can destroy fish habitats and harm water quality. Officials are urging the public to report any sightings of the invasive fish and not to release them back into the water.</p>
