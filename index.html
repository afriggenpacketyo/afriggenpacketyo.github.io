        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House terminated CDC Director Susan Monarez after she refused to resign, citing her misalignment with the president's agenda. Her lawyers claimed she was targeted for resisting "unscientific, reckless directives" and firing health experts, accusing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of "weaponizing public health." This dismissal triggered resignations from at least three senior CDC leaders, who expressed concerns about vaccine misinformation and budget cuts under Kennedy's leadership, a known vaccine skeptic. The move follows recent layoffs of 600 CDC employees and comes after a gunman, believing he was harmed by COVID vaccines, attacked the CDC headquarters, killing one police officer.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian drone and missile attack struck Kyiv, killing at least 14 people, including three children, and wounding dozens. President Zelenskyy condemned the "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians," urging a strong international response and new sanctions, as peace efforts led by the U.S. struggle to advance. Ukraine's Air Force reported shooting down most of the 598 drones and 31 missiles, but dozens of civilian buildings, including the EU Delegation office, were hit. This major attack comes weeks after President Trump met with Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war, with Western leaders accusing Putin of avoiding serious negotiations.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is replacing his principal private secretary, Nin Pandit, after just ten months, marking the third senior staff change in his Downing Street office this year. Pandit, who will transition to a new policy delivery role, follows the earlier departures of chief of staff Sue Gray and communications director Matthew Doyle. Reports suggested concerns over Pandit's effectiveness, though Downing Street allies maintain confidence in her. This internal reshuffle highlights a period of significant change within Starmer's top team and comes ahead of an anticipated wider cabinet reshuffle, signaling potential shifts in government strategy and personnel.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's four-decade-long contentious relationship with the NFL is under scrutiny, spanning failed team bids, a major anti-trust lawsuit, and highly publicized debates over player protests. Despite a recent appearance with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, their history includes Trump's past ownership of the USFL's New Jersey Generals, a lawsuit against the NFL, and multiple unsuccessful attempts to acquire an NFL franchise. His political career intersected with the league through criticism of Colin Kaepernick's anthem protests and controversies over White House visits by championship teams. As a new season approaches, Trump's ongoing influence, including potential blocks on a stadium deal or an ESPN partnership, indicates the complex dynamic persists.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister summoned the top U.S. diplomat after reports alleged that at least three individuals connected to President Donald Trump conducted covert influence operations in Greenland. The U.S. State Department confirmed the meeting, denying control over private citizens' actions while reaffirming strong ties with both Denmark and Greenland. Trump has previously expressed interest in acquiring the strategically vital, mineral-rich Arctic territory, which Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated is not for sale. Danish and Greenlandic security services suspect foreign actors are attempting to exploit internal disagreements to weaken relations within the Kingdom of Denmark.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, postponed a trip to Washington, as Tokyo pressures the Trump administration for quicker implementation of a tariffs deal. The agreement, initially announced in July, aimed to set a 15% import tax on most Japanese goods, but Japanese officials discovered it would be an *additional* 15% on top of existing tariffs. While the U.S. acknowledged the error and agreed to refund excess duties, this has not yet occurred. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary emphasized the need for prompt action to amend the presidential order and lower tariffs, highlighting the deal's importance for both nations' economic security.</p>

Rights experts have voiced concerns that these deportations could violate international law by sending individuals to countries where they risk torture or abuse.

          <p>Sales of British-made cars to the U.S. increased by 6.8% in July, reversing a three-month decline, following a new UK-U.S. tariff deal.

While the U.S. remains the largest single national market for British cars, overall UK car manufacturing continues to struggle due to higher labor costs, increased competition, and Brexit.

He proposes adding "Back the Blue" as an option, asserting it would help repair the league's relationship with police, which he believes was damaged by Colin Kaepernick's protests and Commissioner Roger Goodell's endorsement of them. Travis contends that the "Defund the Police" movement coincided with a rise in murder rates, and that supporting police is crucial for public safety.

EU leaders condemned the "deliberate" and "indiscriminate" attacks on civilian infrastructure, urging Russia to cease hostilities and engage in peace negotiations. Zelenskyy, expressing frustration, accused Russia of choosing "ballistics instead of the negotiating table" and called for new, tough sanctions to hold Moscow accountable for every strike. Ukrainian officials also reported shooting down numerous drones over Russian territory in a retaliatory move.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting, which killed two children and injured 17, as an act of domestic terrorism and an anti-Catholic hate crime. The shooter, Robin Westman, 23, who died by suicide, had legally purchased the firearms. Authorities found writings and videos referencing past mass shooters and church schematics, with court records indicating Westman's name change in 2020 to reflect a female identity. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back against hatred directed towards the transgender community in the wake of the attack, as federal officials offered condolences and assistance.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodation, which currently require properties to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower business rates. The new proposals would allow for an average of 182 days let over several years and count up to 14 charity days towards the target, with changes intended for April 2026. While the government claims to have listened to feedback, industry groups like PASC UK Cymru criticize the changes as a "token gesture" that fails to address the "real crisis" in Welsh tourism, advocating for a significant reduction in the 182-day threshold.</p>

While acknowledging the honor of a royal invitation, Davey emphasized the need for political leaders to act on the crisis.

          <p>Rangers manager Russell Martin faces intense scrutiny after his team's humiliating 6-0 defeat in the Champions League, exposing what critics call his "mess." Despite Martin's pre-match optimism, the team's performance, coupled with recent domestic struggles, has led to widespread fan fury and calls for his sacking after just 10 games. The article highlights the team's defensive weaknesses and poor decision-making, with new signings failing to perform. While the club's new owners appear to be exercising patience, the growing "venom and toxicity" from the fanbase suggests a deeply unstable situation for the manager, particularly ahead of a crucial Old Firm game.</p>

Internal ICO emails also show concerns about why no fine was issued to the MoD, despite a smaller Afghan data breach in 2023 resulting in a £350,000 penalty.

CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the accelerating AI race, projecting significant AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end, with Nvidia at the core of this expansion. The company, which briefly became the world's first $4 trillion entity, faces ongoing geopolitical hurdles, including U.S. export restrictions that are inadvertently fueling domestic chipmaking in China.

          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement sparked an outpouring of intense fan reactions online, highlighting the phenomenon of "parasocial relationships" where individuals develop one-sided emotional connections with celebrities. Psychologist Sonia Jaeger describes these as "my friend who doesn't know me," fueled by extensive access to celebrities' private lives through social media. While such relationships can offer a sense of connection and community, particularly during times of isolation, experts caution they cannot replace reciprocal, real-life friendships. Harvard professor Arthur C. Brooks likens them to "fast food," tasting good but lacking "nutritional content" for genuine human connection.</p>
