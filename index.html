          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with US President Donald Trump, where he will address the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The discussion will likely focus on advancing a ceasefire and hostage release deal, following the recent halt in negotiations. Starmer's government is also working with Jordan on aid airdrops and accelerating the evacuation of critically ill children from the region. The meeting occurs amidst increasing international pressure on Israel to allow more substantial aid into Gaza, where aid agencies have issued stark warnings about mass starvation and a rising death toll from malnutrition.</p>

          <p>An attack on a Catholic church in the Democratic Republic of Congo has resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people, including nine children. The assault, which took place in the town of Komanda, is attributed to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel group affiliated with the "Islamic State." The attackers also set fire to nearby homes and shops, marking a violent end to a period of relative calm in the Ituri province. The UN peacekeeping mission and the Congolese army have condemned the massacre, highlighting the ongoing violence in eastern Congo, a region plagued by numerous armed groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a framework deal on trade, averting a larger conflict just before US-China tariff talks. The agreement sets a 15% US tariff on many European goods, a compromise from the threatened 30% but still a significant increase. While the Trump administration hails it as a major win, the EU managed to secure this lower rate for key exports like pharmaceuticals and cars. In return, the EU will reportedly open its markets to American exports and increase investments in US energy and military equipment, rebalancing a trade relationship that the US has long criticized.

          <p>Following their dramatic Euro 2025 victory against Spain, the England women's football team, the Lionesses, will be honored with a reception at Downing Street. Fans will also have a chance to celebrate during a parade in central London, but the government has indicated that an extra bank holiday will not be granted to mark the occasion. This decision aligns with the precedent set after their previous Euro win in 2022, likely considering the economic cost of a national day off. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who attended the final, praised the team as "history makers" who have once again captured the nation's pride with their tense penalty shootout win.</p>

German industrial groups have expressed disappointment, warning of the negative impact of the 15% tariff rate on the country's export-driven economy.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced the success of "Operation Grayskull," an investigation that shut down four major dark web sites dedicated to sharing child sexual abuse material. The network had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. The operation has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or utilized the sites, including a key administrator sentenced to life in prison. Officials described the defendants as part of a sophisticated and sadistic online community, calling the takedown one of the most successful of its kind and a major victory for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>In response to rising violence in prisons, the UK government is launching a trial to equip specially trained staff in men's prisons with Tasers. The move comes as new figures show over £20 million has been paid in compensation for assaults in jails over the past five years. The pilot will involve a specialist national unit that responds to serious incidents like riots or hostage situations. While the Prison Officers' Association has welcomed the measure as long overdue, others express caution about a wider rollout, citing the risk of the weapons being taken by inmates. The trial aims to provide staff with better tools to ensure their safety.</p>

          <h2>Economic Simulator Forecasts Significant Drop in Global Exports to US Following EU Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>An economic tariff simulator from The Observatory of Economic Complexity projects a dramatic shift in global trade patterns due to the new US-EU tariff agreement. The model forecasts that global exports to the US could drop by over 46% by 2027 compared to recent averages, while US exports could rise by 12%. This suggests that countries will rewire their trade relationships away from the US to avoid the new 15% tariff. The simulation predicts the largest decreases in imports will come from China, Canada, and Mexico, while China, in turn, is expected to increase its imports from countries like Russia and Vietnam instead of the US.

          <p>Chinese swimming sensation Yu Zidi, at just 12 years old, is making waves at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. She is set to compete in the 200m individual medley final and could become the youngest person to win a medal at a major international swimming event in nearly 90 years. Having burst onto the national scene in 2024, Yu quickly ranked among the world's fastest in multiple events, including the 400m medley, which is considered her strongest. Regardless of the result, her presence at the world championships marks a remarkable achievement for the young athlete, who is being tutored by a former Olympic champion.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's southern technology hub, have introduced new rules mandating leniency for researchers and companies whose state-funded innovation projects fail. The policy states that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, and reasonable corrective actions are taken, the innovators should not be punished or have their future funding applications hindered. This applies to projects that stall due to technical hurdles or market changes. The move is designed to encourage researchers to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and foster a culture that is more tolerant of the risks inherent in scientific advancement.</p>

          <p>Japan's normally stable political landscape has been shaken by the surge of the far-right Sanseito party, which increased its parliamentary seats from one to fifteen in recent elections. Running on a "Japanese First" slogan reminiscent of Donald Trump's rhetoric, the party has capitalized on public frustration with inflation, stagnant wages, and a sluggish economy. Sanseito has also focused on anti-immigration and anti-tourist sentiment, blaming foreigners for social issues and a perceived decline in public order. This populist rise presents a serious challenge to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, signaling a significant shift in a country long considered immune to such political movements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House budget director Russell Vought, a key author of Project 2025, has indicated that President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not the sweeping overhaul detailed in the conservative blueprint. When asked about the Project 2025 chapter on the Fed, Vought stated, "I don't even know what that chapter says." He framed the administration's pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a response to other countries lowering rates and alleged fiscal mismanagement at the Fed. This comes as Trump has intensified his attacks on Powell over monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intra-party tensions are rising as Rep. Thomas Massie warns that blocking a House vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein could become a political liability for the GOP. House Speaker Mike Johnson has called the push "reckless," citing concerns for victim protection, an argument Massie refutes as a "straw man," insisting the bill includes redactions for victims' names. Massie and his Democratic co-sponsor are criticizing leadership for sending the House into recess early, seemingly to avoid the vote. Massie suggests that failing to keep their promise on this issue could alienate voters and cost Republicans their majority.</p>
