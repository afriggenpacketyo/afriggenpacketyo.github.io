          <p>Authorities in Arkansas are searching for Grant Hardin, a former police chief who escaped from a high-security prison where he was serving time for first-degree murder and sexual assault. Hardin, 56, was discovered missing during a routine inmate count and is considered extremely dangerous. He was last seen wearing a makeshift law enforcement uniform, and officials believe he may attempt to steal a vehicle or take hostages. The search is being hampered by heavy rain, which is making it difficult for tracking dogs and drones to locate him. Roadblocks have been set up between Stone and Izard counties, and officials are urging residents not to approach Hardin if they see him.</p>

This restructuring, characterized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as radical downsizing, involves dismissing a substantial portion of the National Security Council staff.

          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned Scott Howard Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of taking over $75,000 in bribes. Jenkins was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy, honest services fraud, and bribery related to auxiliary deputy appointments. Trump asserted that Jenkins was a victim of a "corrupt and Weaponized Biden" Justice Department, claiming the judge unfairly restricted exculpatory evidence. Federal prosecutors alleged Jenkins accepted bribes from several individuals, including undercover FBI agents, in exchange for law enforcement positions without proper training or vetting.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of spaceflight, particularly the sonic booms produced by SpaceX rockets, to understand their impact on communities. As rocket launches become more frequent, the noise they generate is increasingly disruptive, shaking windows and disturbing residents. Researchers like Kent Gee at Brigham Young University are investigating the unique three-part sonic boom created by Falcon 9 boosters as they return to Earth, aiming to identify ways to mitigate these disturbances. SpaceX is also testing Starship, the largest rocket ever, which will likely be the loudest, so gathering data now is crucial to addressing potential noise problems before they become widespread.</p>

The visit includes delivering the Speech from the Throne, outlining the government's agenda, a rare occurrence last seen in 1977. Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to King Charles is seen as a strategic move to highlight Canada's distinct identity and relationship with the Crown, particularly in light of President Trump's suggestions of annexation.

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel represented Harlem in Congress for decades, advocating for his constituents and playing a significant role in shaping national policy. While his career was marked by accomplishments, it was also marred by an ethics violation that led to his censure and relinquishment of his chairmanship. Despite these challenges, Rangel remained a respected and influential figure, remembered for his wit, political acumen, and dedication to his community.</p>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla have arrived in Canada for a two-day visit that is widely interpreted as a reinforcement of Canadian sovereignty in the face of recent remarks by President Trump. The visit, which includes a speech from the throne by the King, underscores Canada's distinct identity and relationship with the Crown. Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has been critical of Trump, invited Charles to formally open Canada's 45th session of parliament, a move seen as a strategic message to the world.</p>

          <p>Following Russia's largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Trump called Vladimir Putin "absolutely crazy." Despite these remarks, Trump continues to resist joining European allies in imposing new sanctions on Russia or providing additional support to Ukraine. The Kremlin dismissed Trump's comments as an "emotional reaction," highlighting the continued tensions between the U.S. and Russia amidst the ongoing conflict.</p>
