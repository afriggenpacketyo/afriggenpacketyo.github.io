            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has strongly condemned President Trump's threat of additional tariffs, stating it will take countermeasures to protect its interests. This response follows Trump's announcement that he would impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China if Beijing doesn't withdraw its retaliatory tariffs. China views the U.S. actions as a mistake and has stated it will never accept such pressure. The escalating trade tensions could significantly impact China's economy, potentially reducing its growth by 1.5 to 2 percentage points. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The author discusses the increasing engagement between Europe and China, particularly since the US President Donald Trump began instigating a global trade war. The author argues that increased European engagement with China could offer a contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship. The author also notes that reciprocal tariffs go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade between countries. The author concludes that we live in an era where political strategy eats economics for breakfast.</p>

            <p>Defensive miscues and missed opportunities cost the Dodgers in their 6-4 loss to the Washington Nationals, highlighting an early-season theme of struggling with the fundamentals. Errors by Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas contributed to unearned runs for the Nationals, while stellar defense from Washington prevented potential rallies by the Dodgers. Despite a strong offensive performance from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' inability to play clean baseball led to their third loss in four games.</p>

The Court does not express an opinion on whether the Alien Enemies Act actually permits Trump to deport anyone. It also rules that, before anyone is deported under this law, that person must be given “notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”</p>
