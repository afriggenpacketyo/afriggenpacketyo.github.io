          <p>A pilot for a Chinese airline tragically died by suicide following a dispute with superiors over a failed performance evaluation.

An internal report indicated he lacked understanding of key procedures, such as communication failure protocols.

This article details the various party factions, including deficit hawks and Medicaid guardians, whose resistance created a late-night stalemate, threatening the bill's passage before the July 4th deadline.</p>
