          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but faced immediate challenges as both sides were accused of violating the agreement shortly after it was intended to take effect. Despite the accusations, Trump defended the deal and said he intervened, including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to try to sustain the ceasefire. Israel stated they launched strikes on Tehran before the ceasefire took effect, hitting regime targets, while Iran launched missiles into Israeli territory, resulting in casualties. The US Embassy in Jerusalem reopened, but travel restrictions remained for government employees. </p>

          <p>A dangerous heat wave is impacting a large portion of the United States, with temperatures expected to soar to record highs in many areas, particularly in the Northeast. Heat indexes, which factor in humidity, could reach as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit, posing a significant risk to those without adequate cooling or hydration. The heat wave is caused by a heat dome, an area of high pressure that traps heat and humidity, leading to stagnant air and poor air quality. Officials are urging residents to stay indoors, use air conditioning, and take precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses.</p>

The People's Bank of China is planning a digital yuan internationalization center in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. China has been developing a network of offshore yuan clearing banks and promoting the cross-border interbank payment system, as well as bilateral trade settlement in yuan. Despite these efforts, the U.S. dollar remains the predominant currency for global payments and China's capital controls present an obstacle. (not investment advice)</p>

Paola, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. as a child, is facing deportation due to a prior deportation order her mother received. Despite enlisting in the Marine Corps being promoted as a way to gain "protection from deportation" for family members, the Clouatre family has found this to be untrue.

          <p>McDowell County, West Virginia, already struggling with economic decline and poverty, is facing additional challenges after a devastating flood. The flood exacerbated existing issues, including population loss, high poverty rates, and the closure of essential services like the local Walmart. Despite federal relief efforts, the aid is insufficient to cover the cleanup and rebuilding costs, leading to frustration with the government and low voter turnout. The average life expectancy in the county is 12 years less than the rest of the U.S., and it has the highest drug overdose rate in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A report on thimerosal in vaccines, slated for presentation to the CDC, cites a study that the listed author says does not exist. The report references a Neurotoxicology study co-authored by Robert Berman, who stated that the report misrepresents his research. The meeting has become controversial after the US health secretary replaced all members of the expert panel with new members, some of whom have advocated against vaccines. The presentation contrasts with a separate CDC report that finds no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.</p>
