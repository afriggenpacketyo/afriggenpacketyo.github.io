          <p>Phil Salt's impressive 89 runs led England to a four-wicket victory over Ireland in the opening T20 match of a three-game series in Dublin.  Despite Salt's near-century and Jacob Bethell's captaincy debut, Ireland's competitive score, featuring half-centuries from Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker, made for a close contest. England's emphatic start to their reply eventually secured the win, marking their first T20 victory over Ireland. The two teams will face off again on Friday and Sunday.</p>

          <p>StubHub CEO Eric Baker anticipates a temporary revenue decrease due to new federal regulations mandating transparent, all-in ticket pricing.  This change, already implemented in some states, is expected to cause a 10% initial drop in sales before returning to normal levels.  The company, which recently went public, believes the long-term effect will be positive, creating a level playing field with competitors.  Baker had previously advocated for all-in pricing, viewing it as a market improvement.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have plummeted to a three-year low of 6.13%, prompting increased mortgage applications and refinancing activity. This significant drop from rates exceeding 7% over the past two years is largely attributed to market anticipation of an upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate cut.  This presents a renewed opportunity for homebuyers and homeowners to secure more favorable loan terms.  Experts advise comparing lenders, checking credit scores, and considering refinancing options to maximize potential savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Biffle also highlighted Frontier's plans for future profitability, contrasting this with Spirit Airlines' recent bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle formed in the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season.  Current forecasts predict the storm will remain over open water, posing no immediate land threat, though it may strengthen into a hurricane over the weekend.  The storm's projected path will take it north of the Caribbean, potentially reaching Bermuda later next week.
