          <p>Best Buy has lowered its full-year sales and profit forecast, citing the impact of higher tariffs on consumer electronics. CEO Corie Barry mentioned that the company has already increased prices on some items to offset these costs, although she didn't specify which ones for competitive reasons. The retailer's fiscal first-quarter earnings also revealed a drop in net income and revenue compared to the previous year, with comparable sales declining due to decreased purchases of home theaters, appliances, and drones. Best Buy is adjusting its import mix and encouraging vendors to manufacture in multiple countries to mitigate tariff effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, as part of a series of clemency actions. Hoover, who is serving six life sentences on conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, still faces a 200-year jail term in Illinois for murder. While Trump's commutation applies to the federal sentence, it does not affect the state-level sentence. Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, but authorities allege he remains involved in promoting the Gangster Disciples.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reacted defensively to the "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," a term coined by a Financial Times columnist to criticize his tariff policies. The meme suggests that Trump repeatedly backs down from his initial tariff demands, allowing investors to profit. Trump, visibly agitated, defended his decision to slash tariffs on China and push back deadlines for tariffs on European Union countries. He called the reporter's question "nasty" and defended his trade policies as beneficial to China.</p>

The lower court had struck down Trump's global tariffs, finding that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not give him the authority to levy tariffs unilaterally.</p>

Frustrated by Putin's reluctance to agree to a cease-fire in Ukraine and disturbed by new images of violence, Trump has expressed rare public anger towards the Russian leader. Trump is reportedly considering new sanctions to pressure Moscow to negotiate, feeling "tapped along" by Putin. This shift comes after Trump repeatedly praised Putin and sought a summit to end the war, potentially seeking a Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are taxes on goods bought from other countries, typically a percentage of the product's value, and President Trump has implemented a series of them with the stated goal of boosting American manufacturing and protecting jobs. The move has created global economic chaos, with critics arguing that tariffs will increase prices for U.S. consumers. A U.S. trade court initially ruled that Trump lacked the authority to impose these sweeping import taxes, but an appeals court allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the case is litigated. The tariffs cover goods from the European Union, China, and other countries.</p>

          <p>The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has filed a lawsuit against the White House for failing to provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters at press briefings. The lawsuit alleges that the White House abruptly stopped providing ASL interpreters when President Trump returned to office, violating the Rehabilitation Act, the First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. The NAD argues that closed captioning is insufficient for many deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals who primarily communicate in ASL. The lawsuit seeks to require ASL interpreters at White House briefings and to make video of them available to viewers.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure in the Trump administration, lasting 129 days, was marked by significant changes and controversies within the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's primary mission was to cut federal spending, resulting in claimed savings of $175 billion through various measures. His presence also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to his business ventures, and his policies led to significant cuts in US foreign aid. Furthermore, Musk's promotion of conspiracy theories and misinformation was also a notable aspect of his time in the White House.</p>
