          <p>A significant explosion occurred at the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, southern Iran, resulting in at least five fatalities and over 700 injuries, according to Iranian state media. While the cause of the blast remains unclear, officials have suggested it may have been triggered by containers of chemicals catching fire, creating large plumes of smoke. An investigation, overseen by the country's interior minister, is underway to determine the exact circumstances of the incident, as President Pezeshkian expressed his condolences.</p>

Favre, drafted in the second round himself, emphasized that the draft position is less important than what a player does once they get a chance. He recalled his own experience of being drafted by a team that didn't initially want him, highlighting the importance of making the most of any opportunity. Sanders, once considered a potential first-overall pick, now faces the challenge of proving himself after falling to Day 3 of the draft.</p>
