          <h2>Senator Rand Paul States Motive in Trump Assassination Attempt May Remain Unknown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 17:03:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Senator Rand Paul stated that the shooter's motive might never be definitively known. Paul, who chairs the Senate committee that investigated the incident, believes the government has tried its best but has not found a clear motive. The committee's final report heavily criticized the Secret Service for "inexcusable negligence" and systemic failures, noting that multiple requests for enhanced security during the 2024 campaign were denied. The report highlights that the gunman was spotted long before the shooting, yet no action was taken to move Trump from the stage, pointing to severe security lapses.</p>

          <p>An Amazon delivery driver has tragically died after a train struck their van at a level crossing in Teynham, Kent. The collision occurred around 12:45 BST, and despite the immediate response from police and emergency services, the driver was pronounced dead at the scene. No one else was injured in the incident, and passengers from the train were safely transferred. Both Amazon and Southeastern, the train operator, expressed deep sadness and offered condolences to the driver's family, confirming they will cooperate fully with the Rail Accident Investigation Branch's investigation into the crash.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The discontent arose after a Justice Department memo stated there was no "incriminating client list" or evidence of blackmail, contrary to public expectations fueled by Bondi's previous statements. Prominent conservative figures have voiced their frustration, creating a visible rift within Trump's base. Trump urged his supporters to let Bondi work and to stop focusing on Epstein, a stance that some allies believe shows he is out of touch with his base's concerns about the case.</p>

          <p>In a brutal Texas Death Match at AEW's All In: Texas event, "Hangman" Adam Page defeated Jon Moxley to become the new AEW World Champion. The violent encounter featured numerous foreign objects, including a fork and glass, leading to both competitors bleeding profusely. The match saw interference from Moxley's Death Riders faction, which was countered by support for Page from Will Ospreay, a returning Bryan Danielson, and Darby Allin. After a chaotic series of events including run-ins from the Young Bucks and Swerve Strickland, Page ultimately forced Moxley to submit by using a chain, capturing the championship for the second time in his career.</p>

          <p>A new wave of heavy rain has forced a temporary halt to the search for victims of the catastrophic flooding in Texas, which has already claimed at least 129 lives. Officials in Kerr County, where over 160 people may still be missing, issued new alerts and went door-to-door to warn residents of the renewed flash flood risk. The National Weather Service has issued multiple flash flood warnings for the Texas Hill Country, urging residents to seek higher ground. The Ingram fire department ordered search crews to evacuate the Guadalupe River corridor due to the high potential for another dangerous surge of water.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise 21-track album titled "Swag," marking a return to his R&B roots in a similar vein to his previous projects "Journals" and "Changes." The album comes after a period of personal tumult, including health issues and a break with his longtime manager. The music is described as raw and improvisatory, with murky production and luscious crooning over spacey, '80s-inspired beats, reflecting a messier, more authentic period of his life. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee and Dijon, the album embraces an idiosyncratic vibe that aligns with modern pop trends, showcasing a more instinctual and vulnerable side of the artist.</p>

Macron emphasized the need for France to be powerful in order to be feared, pointing to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and uncertainty from the United States as key dangers.

The hospital confirmed it has seen a surge in seriously unwell children with the highly contagious virus but did not comment on the individual case. This is believed to be the second child death from measles in England in five years, highlighting a growing public health concern. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to falling uptake of the MMR vaccine, with vaccination rates in the region well below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish forward Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting for a fee of €73.5 million (£63.5 million). Sources indicate that a club-to-club agreement is in place, with only minor details remaining to be resolved within the next 24 hours. The 27-year-old has already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract with the Premier League club. The signing is expected to be completed in time for Gyokeres to join the Gunners on their pre-season tour in Asia, marking a significant move for Arsenal after they shifted focus from RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has emphasized that enhancing the nation's weather forecasting systems is a crucial federal responsibility. The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, stated that providing accurate and timely warnings is a national system shared with local responders, not a community-by-community effort. She plans to send President Trump a letter with bipartisan recommendations to upgrade forecasting infrastructure, including Doppler radar and ocean buoys. Cantwell warned that proposed budget cuts and privatization at NOAA could undermine the scientific mission needed to prevent future tragedies by giving people more time to evacuate.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the Trump administration is looking into its authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that the president can do so "if there's cause." The comments come amid escalating criticism from the administration, which is targeting a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters as a potential justification for removal. This suggests the White House may be laying the groundwork to oust Powell, a frequent target of President Trump's complaints about interest rates, before his term expires next spring.

Homan is also managing fallout from his own comments that seemed to confirm racial profiling by ICE agents, which he later walked back by stating physical description cannot be the sole factor for a stop. He did, however, admit that U.S. citizens have been caught up in raids as "collateral arrests." Homan continues to champion the administration's hardline policies, including raids on farms, asserting they are necessary to combat the hiring of undocumented workers.</p>

The president and others reportedly escaped through an emergency shaft after the strikes cut off exits and power.

          <p>While President Trump has focused his immigration rhetoric on deporting dangerous criminals, government data reveals a different reality. According to the latest ICE statistics, the majority of detainees—over 71%—have no criminal convictions. Of those who do have a record, very few have been convicted of the high-level violent crimes Trump frequently highlights. Critics and policy experts argue there is a significant disconnect between the administration's claims and its actual enforcement actions, which appear to target a much broader group of immigrants. The administration maintains its focus is on dangerous individuals, including gang members and those with pending charges.</p>
