          <p>Several major Israeli defense firms, including Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), had their stands blocked off at the Paris Air Show, allegedly by order of the French government. Israel's Defense Ministry condemned the decision as unprecedented and politically motivated, suggesting it was a move to exclude Israeli offensive weapons that compete with French industries. The ministry stated that organizers erected black walls overnight to block the pavilions after Israel rejected a demand to remove offensive weapons systems. CNBC has reached out to the Paris Air Show organizers and the French government for comment regarding the situation. The incident highlights tensions and disputes surrounding the display of military hardware at international exhibitions.</p>

          <p>Chinese Wi-fi router manufacturer TP-Link has laid off a significant portion of its employees at its Shanghai-based chip development unit due to setbacks in chip development. The layoffs primarily affected those working on the front-end module of Wi-fi chipsets, including roles in algorithms and verification.

Dozens of Labour MPs have voiced concerns, but Starmer insists the reforms are necessary, stating that the current system is not working for those needing support or for taxpayers. The government plans to scrap the work capability assessment in 2028 and tighten Pip eligibility, potentially affecting up to 1.3 million people in England and Wales.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the ongoing debate over energy efficiency standards for appliances in the United States, highlighting the shift from routine tightening of standards to a more political plane. The Biden administration's push for stricter standards, including those for gas stoves and microwaves, faced pushback from manufacturers and ultimately led to compromises. Under Donald Trump, the Energy Department is rescinding numerous energy-efficiency rules, arguing that market-driven innovation leads to better products. While some argue that overly strict standards harm performance, others emphasize the significant cost savings and environmental benefits of energy efficiency programs like Energy Star.</p>

Negotiators agreed on a framework to implement the consensus reached in Geneva and during a recent call between the two state leaders. The talks addressed rare earths, Chinese student visas, and US exports of jet engine parts to China, with both sides expressing positive sentiments. Experts suggest this progress could pave the way for discussions on military communications, security, climate, and fentanyl cooperation, as well as the restoration of important dialogue mechanisms.</p>

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City has significantly reduced traffic in lower Manhattan, improving commutes and raising funds for public transit. Since January, a $9 toll for entering lower Manhattan has resulted in 70,000 fewer vehicles daily and faster bus routes. The policy aims to generate $500 million annually for transit upgrades, with early data showing positive environmental and economic impacts. Despite initial opposition, public sentiment has improved, though the program faces ongoing legal challenges and potential threats from the Trump administration, which seeks to revoke federal approval.</p>

          <p>The Asian needle ant, an insect with a potent bite, continues to spread across the United States, prompting entomologists to raise public awareness about the risks it poses. Unlike fire ants, Asian needle ants are not aggressive, but their stings can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals. The ants often colonize in undisturbed forest areas and can also be found near homes and businesses under mulch and other objects. While difficult to control, they are not especially dangerous, though they can disrupt natural ecosystems due to their invasive nature.</p>

          <p>Richard Ellmann's biography of James Joyce, published in 1959, played a crucial role in establishing Joyce as a literary icon, blending detailed life events with subtle psychological portrayals and critical interpretations. Ellmann's work made Joyce accessible to a broader audience and influenced the field of literary studies, though his approach has been critiqued for downplaying Joyce's political interests. Zachary Leader's recent biography of Ellmann explores the creation and impact of Ellmann's work, highlighting a moment in American cultural history when such a comprehensive literary biography could appeal both inside and outside academia. The article reflects on the evolving landscape of literary studies and the enduring power of Ellmann's portrait of Joyce.</p>

          <p>Teenage romance is evolving, with less in-person interaction and more online communication, leading to a shift in how young people connect and form relationships. The "talking stage," a nebulous period of online communication without clear boundaries, has become a dominant aspect of Gen Z's dating experience. Despite this shift, young people still desire genuine connection and intimacy, but often struggle with confusing rules and a reluctance to commit. The pandemic has further shaped social development, with teenagers spending more time online and becoming more emotionally risk-averse, making it harder to form real-life connections.</p>

          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to drop containers of live mosquitoes in remote forests to combat avian malaria and save endangered honeycreepers. The mosquitoes are male and contain a strain of bacteria called wolbachia, which prevents their eggs from hatching when they mate with local females. The goal is to reduce the population of malaria-carrying mosquitoes without harming the local ecosystem, as mosquitoes are not native to Hawaii. This approach, known as the incompatible insect technique (IIT), has shown promise in other parts of the world for controlling mosquito populations and stemming the spread of human diseases.</p>
