        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Moody's, coupled with concerns about rising government debt due to proposed tax cuts, has unsettled financial markets. The downgrade means the U.S. no longer holds a top credit rating from any of the major agencies, leading to worries about the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds. The proposed bill in Congress to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent could add trillions to the federal debt, exacerbating the situation. This has caused stock futures to decline, the dollar to weaken, and gold prices to rise, with analysts suggesting it could impact fiscal spending and interest rates globally.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump is reportedly seeking a comprehensive agreement with South Korea that combines trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing, referred to as "one-stop shopping." This approach involves leveraging the presence of U.S. troops in South Korea to negotiate more favorable trade terms and increased defense payments. While South Korean officials have expressed reservations about defense payments, Trump is likely to bring up the issue during trade talks. Some analysts suggest South Korea could increase its investment in its own forces and purchase more U.S. military equipment to meet Trump's demands.</p>

Activists say criminal gangs specifically target children, often abducting them from neighboring countries with false promises of employment.

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, has faced criticism after stating that he does not need to buy rice because he receives an abundance of it from supporters, at a time when soaring rice prices are impacting households. His comments were made as the ministry explores measures to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. Public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising rice prices is high, with a recent survey revealing that 87% of respondents are dissatisfied. Eto has since expressed regret for his remarks.</p>

          <p>Republicans advanced their tax cut and border security package out of a key House committee after deficit hawks, who initially blocked the measure, cited progress in negotiations on spending cuts. The bill permanently extends existing income tax cuts from Trump's first term and adds temporary new ones, along with increased spending for border security and defense. However, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade. Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the measure, while some Republicans seek steeper reductions and changes to Medicaid work requirements.</p>

The drone attacks killed a woman and injured several others. The barrage came after Trump announced he would speak with Putin and Zelensky, who has agreed to an unconditional cease-fire. Ukrainian officials argue that the ongoing bombardments demonstrate Putin's lack of interest in peace. The article states that a former American ambassador to Ukraine resigned because she could not “in good faith” carry out a policy that “put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia.”</p>
