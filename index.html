          <p>The NJ Transit strike ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen approved a deal, with train service resuming on Tuesday. The three-day strike, the first in decades, impacted hundreds of thousands of commuters traveling to New York City and Philadelphia. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy hailed the agreement as fair and fiscally responsible, though specifics were not disclosed. The union had been seeking pay parity with neighboring transit agencies and cost of living increases, while NJ Transit expressed concerns about budget implications. Trains may not be operational until Tuesday due to the need to inspect train cars and tracks, and commuters are encouraged to work from home on Monday to facilitate the return to full service.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones. The diagnosis, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, was revealed in a statement from his office, prompting an immediate review of treatment options. Despite the severity, the cancer is reportedly hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective management. Support and well wishes poured in from across the political spectrum, including from President Trump, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Barack Obama, all expressing hopes for Biden's swift recovery. Biden had previously launched a "cancer moonshot" program during his vice presidency.</p>

          <p>Gary Lineker, the host of Match of the Day, is expected to leave the BBC, with an announcement anticipated soon, possibly after presenting his final show next weekend. This follows recent controversy over a social media post containing an antisemitic image, for which Lineker apologized. He was previously suspended in March 2023 for impartiality issues related to tweets about a government asylum policy. Lineker had announced his departure from Match of the Day in November 2024 but was slated to continue with FA Cup and World Cup coverage.

Bartkus, who is believed to have died in the explosion, reportedly harbored nihilistic ideations and specifically targeted the in vitro fertilization facility.

The Labour manifesto serves as a guide for the government's objectives, including improving trade relations, removing barriers to trade, and establishing a veterinary agreement. The EU is particularly interested in a youth mobility scheme, which the UK government is now acknowledging and considering, despite initial reservations.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are intensifying due to climate change, with predictions indicating a doubling of wildfire risk by 2100 due to increasing droughts and reduced rainfall. A recent report highlights that approximately 60,000 forest fires occur annually in the EU, resulting in significant economic losses. Factors such as climate change, land use practices, and urbanization contribute to the increased fire danger. Experts emphasize the need for preventative measures, ecosystem restoration, and public education to mitigate the impact of wildfires.

          <p>Dr. Marc Siegel, a Fox News medical analyst, characterized former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer as an "aggressive form" with bone metastasis, indicating an advanced stage. He noted the cancer's Gleason score of 9 and Grade Group 5, suggesting a higher risk of spread. The presence of urinary symptoms further suggests the cancer's progression, as early stages are often asymptomatic. Treatment options likely include hormone therapy, radiation, or prostate removal, with potential side effects like fatigue and bone pain. Early detection, while the cancer is still localized, offers the best chance of a cure, but this diagnosis indicates the cancer has already spread.</p>

          <p>A new initiative in Brooklyn is aiming to reshape inclusion in Jewish matchmaking, focusing on connecting people with physical disabilities. Therapist Eli Portal, founder of Imo Anochi, is partnering with matchmaker Rivkah Fox of BlindFate to organize events that help individuals with physical challenges find love and start families. The initiative seeks to move beyond traditional matchmaking approaches and connect people on a deeper level, looking past physical appearance. Chaim Lebowitz, who has worked with a traditional matchmaker, hopes to meet someone at the upcoming event in Brooklyn.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was diagnosed on Friday with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office said in a statement on Sunday. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a “small nodule” on his prostate. Mr. Biden’s cancer is “characterized by a Gleason score of 9” with “metastasis to the bone,” the statement said. The Gleason score is used to describe how prostate cancers look under a microscope; 9 and 10 are the most aggressive. The cancer is Stage 4, which means it has spread.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen reached an agreement to end the three-day statewide transit strike, with train service scheduled to resume on Tuesday morning.

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone bombardment on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, a day before President Trump was expected to speak with President Putin. The attack, involving an estimated 273 drones, resulted in casualties and injuries. This occurred as Trump has been pushing Russia to accept a cease-fire deal, and it is seen as a show of force ahead of the call. President Zelensky met with Vice President JD Vance in Rome to discuss negotiations for a cease-fire and lasting peace. The article suggests escalating aerial bombardments by Russia are intended to exhaust Ukraine’s air defenses.</p>

Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers' president of baseball operations, acknowledged the challenges and emphasized the organization's focus on finding solutions to protect the pitching staff.

Her family says she joined art classes later in life and realized she still had a talent for it. The exhibit at The Waters of Eden Prairie runs through May 22.</p>

With nearly complete electoral data, Dan secured 54.19% of the vote, while Simion trailed at 45.81%. This closely watched election was viewed as a choice between East or West, and the higher voter turnout played a key role in Dan's victory. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Dan and noted that Romanians "turned out massively" to vote, choosing the promise of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe.</p>
