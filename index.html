          <p>President Donald Trump's tariff policy is proving ineffective and potentially counterproductive in addressing the US supply chain's challenges related to China's expanding manufacturing dominance, according to testimony at a US-China Economic and Security Review Commission hearing, according to a South China Morning Post article. Witnesses called for comprehensive and structural responses, including rebuilding US industrial capacity in sectors like defense and chips and ensuring China is not part of critical supply chains. Economist Adam Wolfe noted that China's efforts to strengthen high-tech manufacturing are driven by US sanctions and tariffs, making domestic production a priority for Beijing.
