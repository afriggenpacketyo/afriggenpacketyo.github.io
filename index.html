          <p>CBS News has launched a price tracker to monitor the increasing costs of essential household expenses like food, gas, utilities, and housing. This tool utilizes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index and average price data, focusing on items that significantly impact household budgets or have seen substantial changes since 2022. It aims to help consumers understand the ongoing cost-of-living pressures and the potential effects of tariffs on their daily expenditures. The tracker provides a clear overview of how quickly prices are rising across various categories.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the murder of Charlie Kirk, arguing that the country is ill-prepared for the profound threat to democracy posed by such political violence. The article suggests that the assassination underscores a deeper societal vulnerability, extending beyond the immediate tragedy. It calls for a critical examination of how political discourse contributes to a climate where such acts can occur. The author implies that the incident should prompt urgent introspection and a reevaluation of national readiness to confront escalating political tensions.</p>

          <p>Ireland's national broadcaster, RTÉ, has announced it will not participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel is allowed to compete. Citing the "ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza," RTÉ views continued participation as unconscionable. This stance aligns with similar considerations from Slovenia and Spain, and follows earlier calls from over 70 former Eurovision contestants for Israel's ban from the 2025 event. RTÉ awaits the European Broadcasting Union's final decision before confirming its withdrawal.</p>

          <p>As of September 2, 2025, the national average savings interest rate is 0.39%, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher returns, ranging from 4.15% to 4.35%. Financial experts recommend these accounts for emergency funds due to their safety and interest-earning potential, which helps money grow faster than traditional options. Online banks often provide the best rates by having lower overhead costs, making them accessible even with minimal initial deposits. Comparing different online accounts is crucial to secure the most favorable terms and maximize savings growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure investment option, with current top rates exceeding the inflation rate. As of September 9, 2025, national average CD yields vary by term, but leading online banks offer competitive rates, such as 4.45% APY for 6-month CDs. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer higher rates than longer terms, suggesting strategies like CD laddering. These FDIC or NCUA-insured investments up to $250,000 provide a safe way to lock in returns (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Newcastle United Football Club has canceled 45 Champions League tickets purchased by the High School of Dundee for an upcoming match against Barcelona. The tickets were acquired days after 110,000 fans queued online, and it's understood they originated from unauthorized reselling by fans whose season tickets have now been revoked. The school stated it bought the tickets in good faith, but Newcastle confirmed they would be re-released through official channels. This incident highlights ongoing issues with ticket touting and the frustration among loyal supporters struggling to obtain seats for high-profile games.</p>

He was instrumental in rallying youth support for Trump's 2024 campaign and amassed a large social media following for his daily podcast and TV appearances. Kirk's death has been widely mourned across the political spectrum, with many acknowledging his significant impact on the conservative movement.</p>

Kirk was fatally shot at Utah Valley University, prompting Utah Governor Spencer Cox to label it a "political assassination" and vow justice. The FBI Director Kash Patel faced criticism for prematurely announcing a suspect's custody on social media before retracting the statement. Authorities are processing multiple crime scenes, and the university has canceled classes for the remainder of the week, as the investigation remains active.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the recent Beijing military parade, marking victory against the Japanese invasion, was a missed diplomatic opportunity for the EU and China. While the parade showcased China's military might and expanding influence, the conspicuous absence of most European leaders underscored political fractures. The author contends that instead of merely criticizing Beijing's embrace of Russia and North Korea, EU leaders could have used the occasion to engage with Putin on Ukraine and present a unified plan, thereby asserting strategic autonomy. This refusal ceded the diplomatic stage to China, reinforcing divisions and highlighting a pattern of failed diplomacy.</p>

Reports suggested Ballmer invested in a third-party company, Aspiration, which then signed superstar Kawhi Leonard to a sponsorship deal requiring minimal obligations, allegedly to pay Leonard off-book. Lasry, citing his long-standing relationship with Ballmer and Dennis Wong, vouched for their integrity, stating NBA rules are well-known and strictly followed. While the NBA is investigating, Lasry believes the claims are "a lot of smoke, but I don't think there's much there."</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of Charlie Kirk's death, politicians from both sides of the aisle condemned the assassination of the conservative activist. Trump, while mourning Kirk, controversially blamed the "radical left" for the violence. In Congress, an attempt to hold a moment of silence devolved into shouting, with Democrats calling for gun law action amid a separate Colorado school shooting. Despite bipartisan calls to de-escalate political rhetoric, deep divisions persist on how to address political violence. Many, including former Presidents Biden and Obama, emphasized that such acts have no place in democracy.</p>

It is characterized by declaring emergencies to justify interventions, making threats to coerce private actors, and demanding tribute. The piece critiques the erratic nature of his economic policies, particularly tariffs, which have failed to achieve stated goals like boosting manufacturing. This personalist style of politics, the article argues, thrusts America back to a Gilded Age level of corruption, where policy is often for sale.</p>

          <p>The article explores the cultural shift away from teenagers babysitting, a role increasingly filled by professional adults. Once a common rite of passage, teen babysitting provided valuable "independence challenges" and social skills, fostering responsibility and financial literacy. Experts note that today's teens are busier, and increased safety concerns combined with intensive parenting expectations have professionalized childcare. This decline also reflects a broader weakening of community ties, suggesting that reinvigorating the practice could strengthen interfamily bonds and provide unique developmental benefits for both sitters and younger children.</p>
