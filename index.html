          <p>A recent Commerce Department report indicates that U.S. inflation slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% year-over-year, down from 2.3% in March. Core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 2.5%, also a decrease from March. Despite rising incomes, American spending slowed, potentially reflecting consumer caution in response to higher goods prices. The report suggests that President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted prices, although some economists anticipate a reversal in the inflation trend later in the year as companies pass along tariff costs to consumers.

Musk vowed that his departure was "not the end" of DOGE and expressed confidence in achieving $1 trillion in savings.

          <p>Governor Newsom's office has requested the Trump administration to remove California from its list of sanctuary jurisdictions that obstruct federal immigration law enforcement. The state contends that federal court rulings have rejected the argument that California law unlawfully obstructs the enforcement of federal immigration laws. The Trump administration's list could lead to the suspension or termination of federal funding to sanctuary cities, counties, and states. California's sanctuary policies limit local law enforcement coordination with immigration authorities, aiming to balance preventing the rounding up of law-abiding immigrants with allowing federal enforcement within the state.</p>

          <p>A columnist asserts that President Trump's attacks on judges, particularly those ruling against his policies, are undermining Americans' faith in the judicial system. The author notes that threats against federal judges have risen drastically since Trump took office. The piece also highlights the increasing use of pardons for political allies and the president's recent rage toward a three-judge panel that ruled against his tariff orders. The columnist argues that Trump's actions require courage from judges to uphold the law.</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Eric Schmitt and John Cornyn will co-chair a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing next month to investigate former President Joe Biden's cognitive abilities while in office. The senators claim the issue was covered up by the media and want to determine who was running the country during Biden's alleged decline. They cite Biden's use of autopen and his diagnosis with late-stage aggressive prostate cancer as reasons for concern. The White House has dismissed these concerns, and Democrats have largely avoided defending Biden on the issue.</p>

Business owners express frustration over the uncertainty created by shifting trade rules, making it difficult to predict import costs. The tariffs, announced in April, added a 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods and higher tariffs on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican imports. The shifting trade landscape creates headaches for businesses beyond the direct costs of the tariffs.</p>
