The numbers are 8, 23, 25, 40, 53, with a Powerball of 5. It is unclear if there were any jackpot winners. The jackpot rose after nobody won Saturday night's $1 billion drawing, though nine tickets matched all five white balls to win $1 million. The next drawing is scheduled for Wednesday. </p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has created a compact, detergent-free washing machine for astronauts that uses mist and ozone. The cube-shaped device, developed at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre, weighs 12kg and is slightly larger than a carry-on suitcase. It cleans up to 800 grams of clothing using only 400ml of water per cycle. The machine uses ultrasonic atomization to deliver the water as an ultra-fine mist and utilizes ultraviolet light to produce ozone for sterilization. </p>

          <h2>SNAP Benefit Cuts Trigger Historic Change in Grocery Shopping</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New policies included in President Trump's tax law have begun to reduce Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, impacting low-income Americans' grocery purchasing power. Experts predict that discount grocers like Walmart may benefit as consumers seek ways to save money. Independent stores are expected to feel the most pain, with some already experiencing significant sales decreases. The changes may also lead to a shift towards less nutritious food choices.

          <p>The Justice Secretary will now have the power to veto any new sentencing guidelines proposed by the Sentencing Council, an independent public body.

The move follows a dispute over pre-sentence reports for offenders from minority groups. The Justice Department asserts that this does not interfere with judicial independence in sentencing decisions. </p>

          <p>President Trump warned that $15 trillion in planned investment in the U.S. would be "immediately cancelled" if courts strike down his tariff policies. He claimed that the loss of these tariffs would devastate the American economy. This statement follows a U.S. appeals court ruling that deemed his administration's broad use of tariffs unconstitutional. The court's ruling focuses on executive authority rather than the economic merits of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
