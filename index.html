          <p>Four Russian nationals are on trial in Hamburg, Germany, accused of supporting the extremist group "Islamic State" (IS). The suspects allegedly used social networks to collect around ‚Ç¨174,000 to send to IS members held in camps in Syria. While far-right violence has become a bigger threat in Germany, the risk posed by religious extremists remains high, according to Konstantin von Notz, chair of the Parliamentary Oversight Panel. The trial highlights ongoing concerns about terrorism financing and extremism in Germany, with authorities closely monitoring such activities. Optimism is low given the nature of the charges and the potential threat to national security.</p>

Robertson founded Duck Commander in 1973, eventually leading to the ‚ÄúDuck Dynasty‚Äù series, which ran for 11 seasons and revolved around the family's business and Christian faith.

          <p>Businesses are leveraging a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the factory to a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. The first sale rule gained renewed attention during the Trump administration's tariff regime, and requires that there be at least two sales involved, the sales must be carried out at arm's length by independent parties, there must be proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and there must be documentation of the first sale price. Companies are using this rule to reduce costs, especially in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products. </p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world‚Äôs first ship dedicated to salmon farming, the Su Hai No. 1, in June, marking a significant step in the country's efforts to enhance its seafood supply through offshore aquaculture. Built by Huangpu Wenchong Shipyard, the vessel is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually, reducing China's reliance on imported salmon. Unlike traditional offshore net-pen systems, the ship can relocate to avoid adverse conditions and includes an onboard processing facility for quick delivery to domestic markets. This initiative reflects China's emphasis on developing its ocean economy and strengthening food security amid global challenges.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, loyal to Nicol√°s Maduro, claimed his party won a sweeping victory in regional and legislative elections, despite sparsely populated polling places. The results, announced on state television without evidence, stripped the opposition of key positions, including the governor's seat of Zulia. The electoral council claimed a turnout higher than 40 percent, though no independent observers were present to verify this assertion. The announcement comes less than a year after Maduro claimed victory in a presidential election, despite evidence showing he lost to Edmundo Gonz√°lez, signaling a continuation of contested electoral processes in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The recent shift in tone from leaders in the UK and EU, condemning Israel's actions in Gaza as "morally unjustifiable," marks a break from previous statements, yet it remains disconnected from concrete action. Despite increasing global outrage and condemnation, international organizations and courts have been unable to translate findings into effective measures. The author argues that Israel draws strength from condemnation, reinforcing its sense of isolation and the need to persevere. Meaningful change requires overturning long-held beliefs and assumptions about Israel's role as a stabilizing ally and implementing tangible measures such as embargoes and sanctions to enforce accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism reveals that sleep facilitates the brain's repair mode by flushing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research deciphers how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative slumber. This breakthrough solves a long-standing mystery of why sleep is biologically essential and opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

Trump also mentioned the possibility of increasing U.S. sanctions on Russia in response. However, Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, stating that Zelensky's comments were "causing problems." Trump has previously stated he could end the war quickly, but now seems to be distancing himself from the conflict's resolution.</p>

          <p>North Korea has arrested a fourth official, Ri Hyong Son, the vice department director of the Munitions Industry Department, following the failed launch of a new navy warship. The accident on Wednesday resulted in damage to the bottom of the 5,000-ton destroyer, and Kim Jong Un has condemned the incident as a "criminal act caused by absolute carelessness." The detention of the officials and the damage to the warship represent an embarrassing setback for North Korea's efforts to strengthen its naval forces.

          <p>As South Korea prepares for its upcoming election, many women feel their priorities are being sidelined, despite their active role in past protests. Women face significant gender-based discrimination, including lower pay and online sexual abuse, but these issues are not being adequately addressed by the leading candidates. With the economy struggling, young men often feel victimized by reverse discrimination, making feminist agendas politically sensitive. As a result, neither of the major candidates is prioritizing women's issues, leaving many women feeling they have no clear choice.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated the sale of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring prices and achieve a target of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move is designed to address public criticism of the government's handling of rising rice prices, which have doubled due to a poor harvest. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system. This is part of a broader effort to stabilize food prices and alleviate pressure on household budgets.</p>
