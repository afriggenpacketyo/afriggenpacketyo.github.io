        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, wealthy Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their capital away from the US real estate market. According to property agents, demand for homes costing over US$5 million has shifted towards markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. This trend marks a significant decline in Chinese investment in US homes, which has dropped more than 50 per cent since its peak in 2017, as buyers seek more welcoming alternatives. Geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals are cited as key factors discouraging Chinese investment in the US.</p>

          <p>Several British newspapers are focusing on the repercussions of Prince Harry's recent BBC interview, particularly concerning his security arrangements in the UK. The Sunday People suggests the interview has strained relations with the King, while the Mail on Sunday reports government rejection of Harry's call for an investigation into his security downgrade. The Sunday Times highlights King Charles's concerns about leaked conversations with his son. Reform UK's ambitious plans, including declaring a national emergency on illegal immigration and "remoralizing" young people, also feature prominently in the press, promising a transformative agenda exceeding even Margaret Thatcher's. Reform also seeks to erect statues of British historical figures and combat 'woke' ideology in schools.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise to provide school choice for Texas families. The program allows parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning programs, with families receiving $10,000 per year and children with disabilities qualifying for up to $30,000. Supporters argue it offers parents more options, while critics claim it will drain resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. Starting next school year, up to 90,000 students can participate in the program, which could cost up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein of The New York Times argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president was a key indicator of the structure of Trump's second term. Unlike potential candidates like Marco Rubio and Doug Burgum, Vance was deeply embedded in the MAGA movement and advocated for fewer constraints on Trump's actions. Klein suggests that Trump's first term was characterized by uneasy alliances and checks on his impulses, but his second term would be defined by loyalty and a lack of dissent. This shift, Klein contends, removes the guardrails and enables a presidency marked by ferocity and recklessness.</p>

Tisdall criticizes the UN's paralysis, under-resourcing, and the inability of international courts to sanction states or punish war criminals, and the author also points to the fact that people in wealthier countries are becoming overwhelmed by the scale of global breakdown and are 'switching off' from the news.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, ending the practice of selling EU citizenship in exchange for investments. The court found that the policy made nationality a "mere commercial transaction" and undermined solidarity between EU member states. While Malta's Prime Minister Abela defended the program, stating it had raised millions for charitable causes, the country will now have to rework the system. However, "golden visa" programs, which offer residence permits for real estate purchases or other major investments, remain in place in many EU countries, raising concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption risks.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a ruling that would have allowed Voice of America (VOA) employees to return to work, throwing the broadcaster's future into disarray. The ruling effectively halts the network's operations after it was silenced in March by an executive order from US President Donald Trump. The appeals court determined that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to order the VOA employees to return to their positions. A dissenting judge warned that the network may cease to exist in any meaningful form by the time the case is fully adjudicated.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is reducing 35 flights per day from Newark Liberty International Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing issues. The decision follows continued delays and cancellations, with over 800 delays and 150 cancellations reported since Tuesday. The FAA attributed the problems to equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia, where the traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is located. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to revamp the air traffic control system, but the project is expected to take three to four years, leaving travelers frustrated in the meantime.</p>

The tour includes a visit to a quake memorial museum and a disaster-hit local railway. The tour is primarily aimed at domestic tourists, but translation services may be considered if there is sufficient interest from overseas visitors.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30 percent of people in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that this rate is even higher among people in their 20s, with over 60 percent of that group willing to switch to legal marriage if separate surnames were allowed. Common-law couples lack access to benefits available to legally married couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights. While the main opposition party supports the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move.</p>

The article details how, after Catina was murdered by her boyfriend, Steven Burns, her family embarked on a decades-long journey to keep her killer behind bars, and in the process helped change laws to support the rights of victims and their families. Harriet Salarno started Crime Victims United, which has changed hundreds of laws. Before Harriet Salarno, victims in California weren't allowed to give impact statements at sentencing, and now they are. Parents – even if witnesses – can now attend the trial, and children must now be accompanied by a support person when testifying.</p>

While the market is expanding, Starbucks' market share has declined significantly, from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, as domestic and international chains introduce new business models and flavors.

          <p>Millions of workers in China, particularly in the tech sector, fear the "curse of 35," a term describing the risk of being laid off once they reach that age. This trend reflects growing age discrimination in a tight job market, with many job listings explicitly stating age limits. The phenomenon is attributed to a perception that older workers are less adaptable and innovative, leading companies to favor younger, less expensive employees.
