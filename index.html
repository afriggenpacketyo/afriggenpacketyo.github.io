        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is under curfew for a second night following nearly a week of unrest sparked by US immigration raids. Hundreds have been arrested, including undocumented migrants and individuals charged with assault, with federal prosecutors charging two men for throwing Molotov cocktails at police. Thousands of National Guard troops and Marines have been deployed to quell the unrest, authorized to detain people until police arrive. Mayor Karen Bass attributes the demonstrations to President Trump's immigration raids, accusing him of provoking residents and instigating a power grab from local government. The situation has escalated into a political row between the president and state officials, with Trump vowing to "liberate" the city and California Governor Newsom accusing him of an "assault" on democracy.</p>

          <p>China's PLA Daily calls for large-scale and centralized deployment of unmanned combat forces at key locations to maximize their potential in future conflicts. The article highlights the "decisive and dominant" role of unmanned systems, including close-range precision strikes, driven by autonomous systems and advanced networks. It urges moving beyond traditional use of unmanned systems as auxiliary forces and developing a new operational theory centered on their mass deployment. Citing efforts by Russia, Ukraine, and the US, the PLA Daily argues that mass deployment of unmanned systems has become a "consensus" in military modernization, with the next phase of competition focusing on rapid concentration of systems and personnel.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has outlined his ambition for France to manufacture cutting-edge chips, positioning the country as a critical tech hub in Europe. Macron's comments arose after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that Nvidia's first GPU was manufactured in France. Macron aims for France to produce semiconductors in the 2-10 nanometer range, requiring TSMC or Samsung to establish local factories. He also touted a deal between Thales, Radiall, and Foxconn to explore setting up a semiconductor assembly and test facility in France, while also highlighting Nvidia's partnership with Mistral to build an "AI cloud."</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States are scheduled to hold a sixth round of negotiations in Oman this Sunday regarding Tehran's nuclear program. This announcement, made by Oman's Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, comes amid heightened regional tensions and a partial drawdown of US embassy staff in the Middle East. The talks aim to reach an agreement that could see the US lift economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limitations on uranium enrichment. Failure to reach a deal could further escalate tensions in the Middle East, potentially leading to economic instability in Iran or military action against Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>China's launch of mass production for high-performance photonic chips is expected to drive significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has begun producing 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, which use light instead of electrical signals. While Europe and the US are established in this field, China's pilot production line is already showing technical gains by overcoming limits for high-speed optical links. TFLN's ultra-fast electro-optic effect, high bandwidth, and low power consumption make it a promising material for photonic chips.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are engaged in a race to fill the ranking member position on the House Oversight Committee following the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly. Four Democratsâ€”Stephen Lynch, Jasmine Crockett, Robert Garcia, and Kweisi Mfumeâ€”are vying for the role, which offers a significant platform and potential future chairmanship. Democrats are considering factors such as public communication skills, support for lawmakers in battleground districts, and the ability to challenge President Trump and his administration. The vote for the ranking member is scheduled for June 24, with candidates presenting their platforms to various caucuses.</p>

Former staff at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites claimed they worked closely with touts, and court documents showed staff bought tickets for touts. Touts trading large volumes of tickets were allegedly offered financial incentives by resale sites, and one tout was reportedly offered a meeting with a top Ticketmaster lawyer to brainstorm ways the company could assist them. Ticketmaster has stated that these allegations refer to events from over a decade ago and have no relevance to today's ticketing landscape.</p>

The lack of key manufacturing equipment, particularly from the Netherlands' ASML, poses a significant challenge, as does the need for advanced memory components, where South Korea's SK Hynix leads.</p>

Lord Brittan was falsely accused of being part of a paedophile ring in Westminster by Carl Beech, who was later jailed for perverting the course of justice.
