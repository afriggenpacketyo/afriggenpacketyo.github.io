          <p>Conservative MP George Freeman has voluntarily referred himself to the parliamentary standards commissioner following allegations that a company he advised helped him write questions for the government. The Sunday Times reported that Freeman, a former science minister, asked an environmental monitoring firm for input on parliamentary questions, despite being warned against lobbying on its behalf. Freeman denies any wrongdoing but stated he would accept the commissioner's judgment, while opposition parties have called for his suspension pending the inquiry.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, activist and writer V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on the challenge of resisting despair in a climate of growing authoritarianism and political violence. She argues that survival depends on embracing dualityâ€”feeling pain without being immobilized by it and directing rage into purposeful action. Drawing inspiration from Congolese activists and American community organizers, she posits that building local networks of care and participating in public demonstrations are essential acts of resistance that strengthen communal bonds and reaffirm shared humanity against encroaching fascism.</p>

          <p>A Catholic school in a New Orleans suburb has fired a long-serving music teacher, Mark Richards, after a parent discovered from his late husband's obituary that he was married to a man. The dismissal was based on a morality clause prohibiting conduct contrary to Catholic teachings, which do not recognize same-sex marriage. The incident has sparked outrage and a petition from parents who support Richards, calling his termination unjust and highlighting a conflict between the archdiocese's policies and community values.</p>

          <p>A leadership void at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has effectively placed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in direct control of the agency. With no confirmed or acting director, Kennedy, a known anti-vaccine activist, has the authority to approve or reject vaccine recommendations, a power he has already exercised. This situation, compounded by his recent replacement of 17 expert vaccine advisers with less qualified individuals, has created significant concern and potential legal vulnerabilities for the nation's public health agency.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that the Lone Star tick, known for causing a severe red meat allergy called alpha-gal syndrome, is rapidly expanding its territory across the eastern United States due to rising temperatures from the climate crisis. The number of alpha-gal cases has surged from a few dozen in 2009 to potentially 450,000, with researchers predicting millions could eventually be affected. The ticks are described as unusually aggressive, and the delayed, sometimes life-threatening allergic reactions create significant challenges for those diagnosed with the condition.</p>

This sanitized version of history persists today, even in progressive spaces, preventing a true understanding of the state's foundations and ongoing Indigenous struggles.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities reflects what can be described as President Trump's "One-and-Done Doctrine" for military force. This approach favors discrete, high-impact strikes over sustained campaigns, a pattern seen in his first term with actions like the Soleimani drone strike and his push to end "forever wars." While Trump has surrounded himself with advisers less likely to challenge his instincts, his preference for a single, decisive action is evident. It remains uncertain, however, if one attack will be sufficient to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions permanently.</p>

          <p>The recent military strikes against Iran by Israel and the U.S. have revealed the fragility of the informal alliance between Iran, China, and Russia. Despite their shared antagonism toward the West, both Beijing and Moscow offered only muted diplomatic responses and no material support to Tehran during the crisis. This cautious approach suggests that when global stability is at risk, preserving economic ties with the West outweighs their commitment to backing Iran. The incident exposes the limits of an alliance built solely on anti-Americanism, indicating their partnership is not as firm as often portrayed.</p>

The phrase is used to label the behavior of celebrities and everyday social media users alike, often framed as a necessary form of catharsis in a high-stress world. While some see it as a way to find validation and cope with overwhelming feelings, mental health professionals express concern that the trend may glorify emotional dysregulation and discourage the development of healthier coping skills.</p>

          <p>One hundred years after a devastating earthquake destroyed downtown Santa Barbara, experts reflect on the lessons it offers for California's seismic preparedness. The 1925 quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, yet it took decades and further tragedies for many cities to mandate retrofits, a problem that persists in some areas today. The event also reshaped Santa Barbara's architectural identity, prompting a city-wide adoption of the Spanish Colonial Revival style, but its historical significance in seismic science was initially downplayed by business interests.</p>
