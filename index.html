          <p>Due to escalating cartel violence in Culiacan, Mexico, the Ostok Sanctuary is relocating its 700 animals, including lions and elephants, to Mazatlan. The sanctuary's director, Ernesto Zazueta, cited unprecedented levels of violence, armed attacks, and threats as reasons for the move. The staff have faced challenges reaching the sanctuary, leading to food shortages and animal distress. The violence stems from a power struggle between rival Sinaloa Cartel factions, impacting daily life and prompting concerns about the safety of both humans and animals in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to urge support for a budget package containing his legislative priorities. The bill faces opposition from both conservative and moderate factions within the party, threatening its passage. Conservatives seek steeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose cuts to state and local tax deductions. Trump emphasized the importance of the bill and warned against defections, but it remains unclear whether he swayed enough members to secure its approval.</p>

          <p>The FDA announced it will restrict access to seasonal COVID-19 boosters for healthy Americans under 65 without clear evidence of clinical benefit. The agency will make boosters available for Americans over 65 and for adults and children above 6 months with at least one condition that increases their risk of severe COVID-19. Manufacturers will have to conduct randomized, controlled clinical trials before updated vaccines receive approval for healthier people. Critics say the new guidelines will limit access for people who want the booster, including parents and their children.</p>

          <p>The FDA will allow Covid vaccines for adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions this fall, but requires further research before approving shots for healthy Americans under 65. Agency leaders suggest the additional doses offer uncertain benefits to younger people already vaccinated or with prior Covid infections. Before approving Covid vaccines for broader use, the FDA anticipates the need for new clinical trials. The new rules mark a departure from the previous policy of offering annual Covid shots to everyone 6 months and older.</p>
