          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a weaker opening, mirroring significant losses on Wall Street driven by escalating fears in the U.S. banking sector and intensifying trade tensions. Shares of regional banks and investment firm Jefferies plummeted after concerns arose about potential problematic loans within the American financial system. This broader economic downturn occurred despite Singapore's non-oil domestic exports posting an unexpected 6.9% rebound in September, defying earlier predictions and reversing a previous fall. The global economic landscape remains fraught with uncertainty, prompting a cautious approach among investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public discussion about sweating is losing its taboo status, influenced by celebrities like Alan Carr openly addressing their perspiration issues. This shift is also driven by the rise of wellness trends, such as sauna business meetings, and a beauty industry embracing a "sweaty hot girl aesthetic." Historically, sweat was a source of fear and shame, exploited by hygiene brands, but a new cultural acceptance is emerging. However, some critics argue the trend is being co-opted for commercial gain, even as climate change predicts increased future perspiration.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court panel has denied the Trump administration's request to lift an order blocking the president from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel found the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to states, and saw "scant evidence of a rebellion" in Chicago protests. The court noted that political opposition does not constitute rebellion and that federal officers' ability to enforce immigration laws was not significantly impeded. This decision maintains the temporary restraining order against federalizing Guard troops within Illinois.</p>

          <p>Alaska has commenced one of its largest airlifts in history, evacuating hundreds from coastal villages ravaged by record flooding and strong winds from Typhoon Halong's remnants. The storm washed away homes, with one occupied residence leading to one rescue and two missing persons. Remote communities, accessible primarily by air or water, face immense challenges in relief and restoration efforts, exacerbated by impending winter. This disaster, compared to Hurricane Katrina for its scale and remoteness, highlights the long-term recovery needed and raises questions about past federal grant cuts for disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>Sol Bashirian, owner of the decades-old Italian restaurant Sunday Gravy in Inglewood, California, reports the business is "barely breaking even" due to the significant impact of tariffs and inflation. Despite a 30% sales increase, the rising cost of imported ingredients is eroding profits. Financial analysts note that eateries catering to lower and middle-income consumers, and their customers, are particularly vulnerable to these pressures. To cope, Sunday Gravy has added a 5% surcharge, but owners fear further price hikes could deter customers. The National Restaurant Association advocates for tariff exemptions to support the struggling industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venezuelan fishermen are increasingly fearful for their lives following multiple U.S. military strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean Sea.

While the exact scope remains unclear, former intelligence officials suggest methodologies developed in the "global war on terror" could be applied to criminal networks.

          <p>Indiana University has ordered its student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (IDS), to stop printing news content and fired Jim Rodenbush, the director of student media and paper's adviser. Students and the Student Press Law Center criticize these actions as unlawful censorship and a breach of editorial independence. Rodenbush confirmed his termination was due to his resistance to censoring student media. While the university claims it's shifting resources to a digital-first model and addressing financial deficits, critics argue it's a blatant attack on First Amendment rights, raising concerns about free expression on campus.</p>

          <p>Nick Mackenzie, CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, views cafes and delivery apps as new significant rivals, impacting traditional pub leisure time. With over 14,000 cafes now in the UK and a growing number of non-drinkers, pubs must adapt to evolving consumer habits. Mackenzie emphasizes the pub's community role and highlights efforts to offer non-alcoholic options and improved food. The industry is shifting towards "food-led gastro pubs" and "competitive socialising" venues with games, reflecting a broader trend to create more diverse and comfortable environments to attract modern customers.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans "targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges" in next month's Budget, potentially including cuts to VAT on energy bills or regulatory levies.

While facing a projected £22bn gap, she reaffirmed commitments against raising income tax, VAT, or National Insurance. Reeves also announced a new "concierge" scheme to attract financial firms to the UK and addressed concerns about China's trade actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that recent events, including a Supreme Court move to weaken voting rights, racist remarks by Young Republicans, and the Trump administration's proposed refugee policies, reveal a powerful and pervasive tide of racism in American life.

The piece criticizes the defense of such rhetoric as "edgy jokes," noting that these views are increasingly making their way into government positions and policies, impacting various aspects of American society.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that growing concerns over sour bank loans, which recently rattled Wall Street, could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner. He views credit losses as a definitive sign of an economy heading south, motivating the Fed to act faster without excessive inflation worries. Recent bankruptcies in the auto industry and reported bank losses signal widespread credit issues. Cramer believes these contained credit problems, while hurting banks, might not harm the broader market and could facilitate rate cuts, which would generally stimulate the economy and help prevent defaults.

His lawyer argues the six-day gap between the fires creates too many variables to definitively link them, and that the government has yet to provide evidence.</p>

          <p>China has introduced sweeping new curbs on rare earth exports, intensifying the trade war with the U.S. and highlighting Beijing's significant leverage over these critical minerals. Foreign companies now require Chinese government approval to export products containing rare earths and must declare their intended use. In response, President Trump threatened additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. Experts suggest these restrictions, which target vulnerabilities in American supply chains, give China the upper hand in upcoming trade talks. China's near-monopoly in rare earth processing means the U.S. and its allies are years away from developing alternative supplies. (not investment advice)</p>
