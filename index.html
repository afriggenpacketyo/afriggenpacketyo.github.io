          <p>Former President Donald Trump has threatened to permit a "major lawsuit" against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, citing the high cost of renovations at the Fed's headquarters. This move is widely seen as an escalation of his public pressure campaign to compel the central bank to lower interest rates immediately. Trump criticized Powell on social media, blaming his former Treasury Secretary for the appointment and claiming the renovation costs were vastly inflated. The Federal Reserve has previously defended the project's expenses, providing detailed reasons for the cost increases.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Monica Seles has publicly shared that she was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease, three years ago. The nine-time Grand Slam champion decided to raise awareness about the condition, which affects muscle strength and can cause symptoms like double vision and fatigue. Seles described how simple tasks became difficult, leading to her diagnosis after consulting a neurologist. While there is no cure for the disease, various treatments are available to manage its symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party came to power in July of last year. This milestone has intensified the political debate, with the Conservative opposition criticizing the government's failure to 'smash the gangs.' In response, a Labour minister acknowledged the unacceptable numbers but defended the government's new 'one in, one out' returns deal with France. The report comes as French authorities confirmed a woman died while attempting to make the crossing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.7% in the 12 months ending in July, a figure slightly lower than the 2.8% forecast by economists. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.2%, driven largely by shelter costs, while food prices remained flat and energy costs fell. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, saw its largest monthly increase since January, rising 0.3%. The report suggests that while tariffs are having some effect, their impact is not yet causing major alarm, keeping a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September on the table.

The popular brand, which has been gaining market share, now anticipates sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs for the year. This strong performance comes even as the company raised prices to offset new tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam, a move that has not appeared to slow consumer demand.

She admits regret over her handling of the transgender rights debate, particularly the case of a double sexual assaulter, and describes the controversy as a time of "rancour and division." The book also delves into her fractured relationship with her predecessor Alex Salmond, the emotional toll of leading during the pandemic, and personal struggles including a miscarriage and her recent separation from her husband.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated new malware delivery method dubbed "ClickFix" is tricking internet users with fake CAPTCHA verification screens. Instead of prompting a file download, the scam secretly copies a malicious script to the user's clipboard when they click to verify they are human. The user is then socially engineered into pasting and running this command, giving attackers control over their system to steal passwords, files, and other sensitive data. This stealthy, widespread campaign, labeled "CAPTCHAgeddon" by researchers, is found on compromised blogs, Reddit, and phishing sites.</p>

In the current market, some suggest buyers can negotiate with sellers to help buy down their mortgage rate into the 5% range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a woman from Wisconsin, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder in a UK court for a failed assassination attempt in 2019. Betro was hired to kill a man as part of a family feud, but her gun jammed when she tried to shoot him at point-blank range. She later fired shots at the family's home before fleeing the country. After a multi-year, international investigation involving the FBI, Betro was eventually captured in Armenia and extradited to the UK to face trial.</p>

          <p>The European team for the 2025 Ryder Cup is shaping up to be remarkably similar to the victorious 2023 squad, a continuity that is seen as a significant advantage. With stalwarts like Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, and Tommy Fleetwood already qualified, and others like Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry likely to follow, captain Luke Donald can rely on a cohesive and experienced group. This settled scenario contrasts with the U.S. side, which faces more uncertainty and profound decisions regarding its team composition for the showdown at Bethpage.</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review has identified the top colleges for financial aid, where generous need-based scholarships significantly lower the sticker price for students. The list, based on institutional data and surveys of 170,000 students, highlights schools that meet a high percentage of a student's financial need. Washington and Lee University topped the list, followed by Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering and Washington University in St. Louis, all of which substantially reduce out-of-pocket costs for families through their aid packages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. saw prices rise 2.7% in July compared to the previous year, as the effects of President Trump's international tariffs began to reach consumers. While the overall inflation rate held steady from June, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, increased at a faster pace. Economists note that while some retailers had stocked up to delay price hikes, the data suggests that companies are now starting to pass the costs of tariffs on to their customers, contributing to the rising cost of living.
