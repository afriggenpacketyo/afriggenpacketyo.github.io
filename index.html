          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, stocks experienced a notable rise, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all showing gains. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers. However, the existing 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports from Britain will remain on some products, generating revenue for the United States. Despite the positive market reaction, analysts anticipate continued volatility due to ongoing trade negotiations with other countries, including China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key Senate vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, is uncertain due to a loss of support from several Democratic senators. These senators, led by Sen. Ruben Gallego, expressed concerns about the bill's provisions regarding anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, and national security. The bill requires 60 votes to proceed to the Senate floor, and the withdrawal of support from these Democrats has put its future in doubt, highlighting the challenges of achieving bipartisan consensus on cryptocurrency regulation.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by optimism surrounding the U.S.-U.K. trade deal announcement and its perceived status as a safe haven asset. The cryptocurrency's rise coincided with gains in stocks and other risk assets, as investors reacted positively to the trade news. Some analysts suggest that recent market uncertainty has bolstered Bitcoin's appeal as investors question the stability of the U.S. dollar. Despite potential volatility stemming from geopolitical tensions and Federal Reserve policies, Bitcoin's resilience is expected to be tested further.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight decline after the company released mixed first-quarter results and provided conservative guidance for the upcoming period, with gross profit and revenue growth projections slightly below analyst expectations. The company acknowledged the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, particularly after the expiration of a duty-free trade loophole. While Shopify anticipates a limited near-term impact, the company is closely monitoring the situation and is prepared to adapt to any changes. Shopify believes its higher-income customer base provides some insulation from pricing fluctuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an age of increasingly loud egos and declining well-being, adopting a "quiet ego" can be a countercultural strategy for happiness. Psychologists define quiet ego as a self-identity that is neither excessively self-focused nor excessively other-focused, incorporating virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope. Research indicates that cultivating a quiet ego is associated with better mood balance, greater life satisfaction, and a stronger sense of life's meaning. The article provides practical strategies for developing a quiet ego, such as questioning conventional wisdom and focusing on contributing to others.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that 28 major U.S. cities are sinking, threatening infrastructure due to groundwater extraction. The study, published in Nature Cities, used satellite-based radar measurements to visualize land movement, finding that at least 20% of urban areas in each city are sinking. Cities with the most widespread sinking include Chicago, Dallas, and New York. Researchers warn that even slight downward shifts can compromise the structural integrity of buildings, roads, and dams.</p>

          <p>This article explores bankruptcy as a debt relief option, highlighting that no type of bankruptcy eliminates every debt. Chapter 7 bankruptcy comes closest to a full financial reset, eliminating many unsecured debts like credit card balances and medical bills, but has income-based qualifications. Chapter 13 bankruptcy creates a structured repayment plan over three to five years, suitable for those with higher incomes or wanting to protect more assets. Alternatives like debt consolidation, debt management, and debt settlement are also discussed.</p>
