          <p>China's CATL has announced a new EV battery technology that it claims surpasses BYD's recent advancements in superfast charging. The second-generation Shenxing battery can add 323 miles of driving range with only five minutes of charging, potentially alleviating consumer concerns about EV range and convenience. This technology, if scalable, would place CATL ahead of Western competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in charging speeds. The announcement underscores the intensifying competition in the EV battery market, with Chinese companies leading the way in innovation.</p>

          <p>Chinese-funded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein plan to increase prices for US customers due to increased operating costs from changes in global trade rules and tariffs. Both companies announced price adjustments starting April 25, without specifying the magnitude of the increases. These changes follow President Trump's tariff imposition on Chinese goods and the cancellation of a tax exemption for items under $800. The companies have been under pressure from Western retailers for offering extremely low prices and aggressive advertising campaigns, and this price hike could impact their competitive edge.</p>

Hamas has signaled a readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity, showing "unprecedented flexibility." Talks are scheduled in Cairo, but Prime Minister Netanyahu insists on destroying Hamas before ending the war.</p>

Automated checkouts, AI chatbots, and apps are taking over, displacing workers and isolating vulnerable populations.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian demonstrator detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was denied temporary release to meet his newborn son. Khalil's lawyers requested a furlough, citing his wife's early labor, but the request was denied. An immigration judge ruled that Khalil is removable after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a section of the law deeming him deportable due to potential adverse consequences on foreign policy. Khalil was arrested at his Columbia University housing in March for protesting the war in Gaza.</p>
