        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A high-ranking UN official, Miroslav Jenča, has cautioned the UN Security Council about the dire humanitarian impact of a potential full-scale Israeli reoccupation of the Gaza Strip. This warning follows reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering such a plan, which has caused alarm over the safety of both Palestinian civilians and the remaining Israeli hostages. The proposal is divisive within Israel, with some seeing it as a negotiating tactic, while the UN emphasizes that Gaza must remain part of a future Palestinian state under international law. The official also highlighted the severe restrictions on aid and the unfolding famine in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision follows a significant 50-basis-point cut in June, after which the RBI shifted its stance from "accommodative" to "neutral." While recent low inflation figures might support a rate cut, the economy showed stronger-than-expected growth of 7.4% in the March quarter. The central bank's cautious approach comes as India faces potential economic pressure from the U.S. over its trade relationship with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has levied a 41% tariff on Syria, the highest rate applied to any country, just months after lifting long-standing sanctions. While direct trade between the U.S. and Syria is minimal, analysts argue the move is symbolically damaging and undermines the nation's fragile recovery after 13 years of civil war. Experts suggest the tariff acts as a political "leash" on Syria's new transitional government, potentially to pressure it on issues like relations with Israel. This policy is seen as counterproductive to reconstruction efforts, which depend heavily on foreign investment and aid.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks extended their winning streak, securing a 100-91 victory over the Indiana Fever, who were playing without their injured star player, Caitlin Clark. Despite Clark's vocal presence from the bench, the Fever's five-game winning streak came to an end. The Sparks, now enjoying a fully healthy roster for the first time in over a year, were led by strong offensive performances from Rickea Jackson, Kelsey Plum, Dearica Hamby, and Azurá Stevens. The win strengthens the Sparks' position as they move closer to securing a playoff berth in the league.</p>

          <p>Italy's cabinet has passed a draft law that would impose stricter regulations on gender-affirming medical treatments, such as puberty blockers and hormones, for individuals under 18. The legislation, which requires parliamentary approval, aims to "protect the health of minors" by mandating that such medications be dispensed only under protocols established by the health ministry or with approval from a national ethics committee. The bill also proposes a national registry to monitor these treatments. This move by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government has been met with protests from transgender rights advocates who view it as a restrictive measure.</p>

The facility, which currently houses nearly 3,000 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will see its population and workers transferred to other locations.

While cyclones and starfish outbreaks have also contributed, scientists warn the reef is facing a volatile future and may be approaching a tipping point where it cannot recover between catastrophic events.

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to create a plan for disarming the militant group Hezbollah, aiming for a proposal by the end of August and implementation by the end of the year. This move, which would restrict all weapons to state institutions, follows significant US pressure and is part of the implementation of a 2024 ceasefire agreement with Israel. Hezbollah, the only faction to retain its arms after the country's civil war, has stated it will not disarm while facing Israeli aggression. The decision highlights the deep internal and external pressures on Lebanon to assert state control over its territory.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced second-quarter financial results that missed Wall Street's earnings expectations but surpassed revenue projections. The company reported a 32% increase in overall sales year-over-year, driven by strong performance in its Client and Gaming segment. However, its AI business revenue declined due to U.S. export controls restricting sales to China. For the upcoming quarter, AMD provided a sales forecast that is above analysts' expectations, signaling potential growth despite the ongoing challenges posed by geopolitical trade restrictions and competition in the AI chip market.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to redirect over $4 billion in FEMA disaster mitigation funding. The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge ruled that the states demonstrated that reallocating the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to communities needing the money for projects like flood protection. The ruling temporarily halts the transfer of funds while the court further considers the legality of the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expanding its detention capacity by securing 1,000 beds at the Miami correctional center, a state-run prison in Indiana. This partnership is part of a broader expansion of immigration detention fueled by increased federal funding for the agency. The Department of Homeland Security has dubbed the new facility the "Speedway Slammer," echoing the controversial naming of a similar facility in Florida. Civil liberties groups have previously raised alarms about poor conditions at the Indiana prison, and critics express concern over the increasing use of state prisons for immigration detention.</p>

          <p>A source close to Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team has reportedly confirmed that the rapper has been in contact with Donald Trump regarding a potential presidential pardon. Combs was recently convicted on prostitution-related charges and is awaiting sentencing in October. When asked about the matter, President Trump acknowledged that he had been approached but expressed doubt about granting the request, citing Combs' past political hostility toward him. The White House has declined to comment on any specific clemency requests, leaving the possibility of a pardon for the former music mogul uncertain.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by a state-owned Chinese company, is showing significant progress toward starting operations this year after being stalled for 17 years. The Mes Aynak mine, holding one of the world's largest copper deposits, was delayed by security issues, archaeological concerns, and a lack of infrastructure. The Taliban government's decision to switch to underground mining is seen as a key step, as it is less destructive to ancient Buddhist relics at the site. This development signals a potential economic boost for Afghanistan and a major strategic gain for China's resource ambitions.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, known colloquially as "Stratus" or XFG, has been spreading in the U.S., accounting for an estimated 14% of cases by late June. The variant, a combination of two other strains, was first detected in Southeast Asia and has since been identified in 38 countries. While its mutations may help it evade some immune responses, the World Health Organization has assessed its global public health risk as "low." Health officials have stated that there is no evidence it causes more severe disease or different symptoms than previous Omicron variants, and current vaccines are expected to remain effective.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible in 2023 was a "preventable" tragedy caused by multiple failures and negligence by OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush. The scathing 300-page report cites an inadequate design using cheaper carbon fiber, a lack of proper certification and inspection, and a disregard for safety warnings. Investigators stated that Rush, who was among the five killed, would likely have faced criminal charges had he survived. The findings echo testimony from former employees who described a corporate culture that prioritized profits over the safety of its passengers.</p>
