          <p>The United States and China have announced an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies. The agreement involves suspending reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to allow for further negotiations, with the US reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China lowering import duties on American goods to 10% from 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that both sides share an interest in avoiding a decoupling of their economies, while U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer noted the importance of mutual understanding and respect during negotiations.

          <p>An annual study of global perceptions of democracy indicates that views of the United States have deteriorated over the past year, falling below those of China. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, founder of the Alliance of Democracies Foundation, attributes the decline to President Trump's trade war policies and strained relationships with allies. The survey, conducted across 100 countries, revealed a negative perception of Trump in 82 of them, while China's net perception rating rose to +14%. The report was published ahead of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, adding context to the discussions on global democratic values.</p>

          <p>Legislators in Suffolk County, New York, have strengthened an animal cruelty law by making it a Class A misdemeanor for convicted animal abusers to own pets. The new law, signed by County Executive Ed Romaine, carries penalties of up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine. This expands on a 2010 law that created an animal abuse registry, requiring convicted abusers to register their information. The expanded law was enacted shortly after dozens of dead cats were discovered in a Long Island home, underscoring the need for stronger penalties.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy is considered a favorite to win the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, a course where he has achieved multiple victories. McIlroy's familiarity with the course, combined with recent wins, positions him as a strong contender. The course setup is expected to be more challenging than usual, with longer rough and softened slopes on the greens. Weather forecasts predict a stormy build-up, potentially favoring McIlroy's powerful driving game. Victory this week would move McIlroy alongside Sir Nick Faldo's six majors, tying the record for any European in the modern era.</p>

The legislation includes new work and eligibility requirements, which Democrats warn will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. The cuts aim to generate savings by rooting out "waste, fraud, and abuse," according to Republicans, while Democrats criticize the plan as an attempt to repeal Obamacare.</p>

          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has raised $2 million to build Bloom Money, a fintech app catering to traditional money-saving methods used by immigrant communities. Bloom Money supports collaborative savings, known as "money circles," in the U.K. The app addresses the gap in mainstream banking services for immigrant communities, who often face discrimination and rely on informal pooling systems. Mohanty aims to provide a secure and regulated platform for these savings practices, which are often flagged as suspicious by traditional banks.</p>

          <p>Landmark China-US trade talks in Geneva are seen as carrying economic and political significance for both sides, kick-starting a long process toward substantive deals addressing tariffs and other trade barriers. The agreement to establish a "trade consultation mechanism" provides interim political relief without appearing weak. China views negotiations as a strategic process to manage bilateral competition and economic resilience, while the US is under political pressure to show wins. This suggests a game plan rooted in strategic patience and economic self-preservation.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a plan that would cause millions of poor Americans to lose Medicaid health coverage and millions more to pay higher fees when they go to the doctor. The proposal, which is part of a larger bill to enact President Trump's domestic agenda, aims to cut $880 billion over a decade. While it omits some of the deepest cuts to the program, it includes policies that would add work requirements, increase paperwork, and raise co-payments for Medicaid beneficiaries.
