The Republican-drawn map is seen by opponents as a partisan effort to dilute Democratic voting power, particularly in Kansas City. Despite legal challenges from state officials, volunteers are racing to gather enough signatures to place the issue on the 2026 ballot, allowing voters to decide the future of their representation.</p>

          <h2>Pew Research Finds Two-Thirds of Divorced Americans Remarry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with approximately two-thirds marrying again. The study shows that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and that remarried individuals often have a higher median household wealth compared to those who remain divorced. Experts note that while remarriage is frequent, second marriages also face a higher rate of divorce, particularly among older adults in what are termed "gray divorces." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As millions prepare for "No Kings" protests, this article argues that the earnest, and sometimes mocked, idealism of the anti-Trump Resistance is its most potent weapon against political cynicism. While critics dismissed the movement's first-term aesthetics as "cringe," its on-the-ground organizing led to tangible victories like the 2018 midterm blue wave. The analysis suggests that in an era of authoritarianism, sincere belief in democratic principles, however uncool it may seem, is essential for countering the nihilism that allows such regimes to thrive.</p>

          <p>President Trump has described the idea of a rail tunnel under the Bering Strait connecting Russia and the United States as "interesting." The concept was raised by Russia's investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, who claimed a feasibility study began six months ago and suggested Elon Musk's Boring Company could potentially construct the 70-mile link. When asked for his opinion during a joint press conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated, "I'm not happy with this idea," which drew laughter from the American delegation.</p>
