          <p>Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching a massive aerial bombardment as the United States reduces its diplomatic efforts and military assistance to Kyiv. According to Ukrainian officials, Russia has launched at least 1,390 drones and 94 missiles at targets across Ukraine in the past week, resulting in numerous civilian casualties. Analysts suggest that Russia perceives an opportunity due to the decreased U.S. support, which has historically played a significant role in shaping the conflict. While President Trump has criticized Putin's actions, he has not indicated a willingness to increase military aid to Ukraine or change U.S. policy, leading to concerns about Ukraine's ability to defend itself. </p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in Congress for 46 years, representing Harlem and becoming a mainstay of the Democratic old guard. His career was marked by both significant achievements, such as his role in Hillary Clinton's entry into electoral politics, and controversies, including a censure for ethics violations that led to his relinquishing the Ways and Means chairmanship. Despite the ethics allegations, Rangel remained a popular figure in his district, known for his political agility and commitment to his constituents. </p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on the Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City, which was housing displaced families, has reportedly killed at least 35 Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that they targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command center in the area, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. Witnesses reported that the strike caused large fires, with many victims, including children, severely burned. Separately, a strike on a house in Jabalia resulted in 19 fatalities, and a recent strike on the home of a Palestinian doctor killed nine of her ten children. </p>

Bongino stated that he has requested weekly updates on these cases and that progress is being made. The original investigations into the pipe bombings and the Dobbs leak were inconclusive, while the Secret Service closed the cocaine investigation without identifying a suspect due to a lack of forensic evidence.

He claims that Harvard's delay is intentional and that the university is being protected by a favorable judge. The accusation follows a move by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard's certification to enroll foreign students, citing the university's failure to comply with requests for information and its alleged tolerance of antisemitism.

Despite the criticism, Trump has not taken action to impose new financial sanctions on Russia or provide additional military assistance to Ukraine. This approach has created a strategic void, where Trump complains about Russian aggression but remains unwilling to make Putin pay a price. Experts suggest that Trump's pattern of behavior signals a withdrawal from the conflict, while episodically considering sanctions, resulting in continued violence and instability in Ukraine. </p>

          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates a significant discrepancy between the official unemployment rate and the "true rate" of unemployment. While the official rate stands at 4.2%, LISEP's measure, which includes unemployed workers, those seeking full-time employment, and individuals in poverty-wage jobs, is at 24.3%. This suggests that a substantial portion of the workforce is "functionally unemployed" and struggling to make ends meet. The report also reveals disparities among racial and gender groups, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers facing higher rates of functional unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter Magyar, Hungary's opposition leader, walked from Budapest to northwestern Romania to gain support from ethnic Hungarians, a key voter group in Hungarian elections. He accuses Prime Minister Viktor Orban of corruption and denounces the poor state of public infrastructure, appealing to those tired of Orban's long rule. Magyar's efforts are amplified by Orban's backing of a pro-Russian candidate in Romania's presidential election, which alienated the Hungarian minority. Magyar aims to portray Orban as prioritizing political interests over the welfare of Hungarian communities abroad. </p>

The move came after Trump initially called for the tariffs, accusing the EU of being "very difficult to deal with," but later agreed to the delay following a call from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest he envisions a world in which the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their own sphere of influence. This approach includes efforts to expand U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere, formalize Russian control over parts of Ukraine, and potentially reduce the U.S. military presence in Europe and Asia. While some analysts caution against interpreting Trump's actions as strategic, others see a pattern of seeking to establish spheres of influence reminiscent of 19th-century imperial rule. The concept faces challenges in the post-imperial age, as seen in resistance from Canada and Greenland. </p>
