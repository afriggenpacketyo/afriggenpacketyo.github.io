          <p>A perilous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy resulted in the deaths of at least three migrants, including two young children aged 3 and 4, according to the German aid organization RESQSHIP. The migrants were aboard a frail boat that experienced engine failure shortly after departing from western Libya, leaving them adrift for an extended period. RESQSHIP rescued 59 survivors, many of whom suffered critical injuries, including chemical burns from salt water and fuel, underscoring the increasing dangers faced by migrants attempting this route to reach Europe. Almost 25,000 migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean since 2014.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States held a fourth round of talks in Muscat, Oman, regarding Iran’s nuclear program. Both sides aim to resolve their dispute over Iran’s nuclear activities through diplomacy, with Tehran seeking the lifting of U.S. sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear program. However, disagreements persist on critical issues, with the U.S. aiming to dismantle Iran’s nuclear facilities. The talks occur as President Trump prepares to travel to the Middle East, threatening military action if negotiations fail.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited Israel and stated that the conflict in Gaza cannot be resolved through military actions. Wadephul emphasized Germany's commitment to Israel's security but noted that there is still room for criticism among friends, adding that this must not lead to antisemitism. He expressed doubts over Israel's conduct in the Gaza war and questioned whether it serves Israel's long-term security. The German government's priority is returning the hostages home, and Wadephul advocated for a political solution for the reconstruction of Gaza without Hamas.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of Elizabeth Holmes, has reportedly raised millions of dollars to start a new blood-testing company, Haemanthus, with similarities to Theranos. Haemanthus's technology will use a laser to scan blood, saliva or urine from pets and “analyze the samples on a molecular level”. The company was incorporated in February 2024, and it has indicated that it was set to begin running tests for animals before conducting testing on humans. Evans met Holmes in 2017 amid the fraud investigation that resulted in her imprisonment.</p>

Though AI will eventually transform the workplace, that day is still years away, and businesses should avoid prematurely laying off employees based on the current state of AI.</p>
