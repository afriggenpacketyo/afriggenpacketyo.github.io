          <p>DW reports that the German economy saw an unexpected 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, attributed to a surge in exports ahead of potential US tariffs. This growth provides a positive outlook for Europe's leading economy, despite ongoing global trade uncertainties. The article also mentions that the German government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in foreign missions. This economic resilience and continued international engagement are key factors in Germany's role on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Fox News reports that Bryan Kohberger's defense team is exploring the possibility of "alternate perpetrators" in the Idaho student murders, a strategy aimed at creating reasonable doubt. This legal approach has been used in other high-profile cases, such as those involving O.J. Simpson, Scott Peterson, and Casey Anthony. The defense hopes to raise questions about who committed the crime. The judge has requested more evidence supporting the alternate suspect theory before allowing it to be presented during the trial.</p>

          <p>DW reports that the Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling foreign students, citing concerns over antisemitism and alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. This decision forces current international students to transfer or leave the country. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it provides records on foreign students involved in protests or dangerous activity. Harvard has rejected the government's allegations and vowed to support its international students, while China has criticized the "politicization" of education in the US.</p>

          <p>Lydia Polgreen writes in The New York Times about President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, which was overshadowed by Trump's focus on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide. Instead of engaging in serious discussions about issues like tariffs and aid cuts, Trump presented misleading information about land seizures and violence against white farmers. Polgreen argues that Trump was not interested in a deal but in creating a spectacle to appeal to his base. The meeting highlighted the vast differences in their approaches to diplomacy and global leadership.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that the Trump administration's decision to potentially block Harvard from enrolling international students is seen in China as a blow to one of the last admired American institutions. The move could significantly impact Chinese students, who form the largest group of international students at Harvard. This action may reshape the broader relationship between the two countries by diminishing the appeal of American universities. Some Chinese commentators view this as an opportunity for China to attract talent and revenue, while others express concern and outrage over the escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that energy bills in the UK will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year, according to energy regulator Ofgem. This reduction will lower the typical annual bill by £129, impacting 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. While this is welcome news, many people still struggle with energy costs, owing about £4bn to suppliers. The decrease reflects a fall in wholesale gas prices, but prices remain high compared to previous years, and charities are calling for more targeted support for those hardest hit.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that the Trump administration has accused Columbia University of violating civil rights law by showing “deliberate indifference” towards harassment against Jewish students. This accusation follows previous federal funding cuts to the university. Columbia has stated it will continue to work with the government to combat antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination. The Trump administration has been attempting to change the culture of American higher education by withholding federal funding from schools it deems as bastions of antisemitism and ideological indoctrination.</p>

Despite initially calling the incident "serious," North Korea now claims the damage is "not serious" and will take only 10 days to repair.

          <p>Sky News reports that the US Mint is set to cease production of pennies following a decree by President Trump, who deems the coin "so wasteful." The US Treasury expects annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny has been a staple since 1792, with around 114 billion currently in circulation. Advocates cite high production costs and limited utility, while others point to its usefulness in charity drives and cheaper production compared to the nickel. Jay Zagorsky, professor of markets, public policy, and law at Boston University, said he supports the move to end penny production but warned that US Congress must legislate that prices be rounded up in order to eliminate demand for the coin.</p>
