          <p>China's recent stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have not boosted the stock market as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. According to analysts, the market had already factored in these policies, and worries about the economic impact of the trade war are overshadowing any optimism. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this package is more targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector for a meaningful market rally.</p>

          <p>Wide receiver George Pickens has been traded from the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Dallas Cowboys. Pickens said he learned about the trade through social media and is excited about joining the Cowboys, appreciating the team's culture and winning mentality. Despite rumors of wanting a trade, Pickens claims he did not request one. The Steelers' coach Mike Tomlin had previously called Pickens out for unsportsmanlike conduct, suggesting a need for him to mature.

While the use of AI garnered both support and criticism, raising concerns about manipulation in legal proceedings, it ultimately left a favorable impression on the judge, who sentenced Horcasitas to the maximum prison term.

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C. Pirro, a long-time ally of Trump, replaces Ed Martin, who was removed after facing opposition from Republican Senator Thom Tillis. Martin will now serve as director of the "weaponization working group" within the Justice Department. Pirro's appointment has raised concerns, particularly given her history of making false statements about the 2020 election. This appointment is considered controversial because it circumvents the traditional Senate confirmation process.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the US and UK has been reached, but analysts suggest its substantive benefits for America will be limited. The deal maintains the 10% import tax on most UK goods announced previously. While the White House claims changes will expand sales of American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK, the actual negotiated items are considered narrow. Experts note the agreement may primarily serve as a political victory for Trump, with limited impact on the broader economy. American carmakers have expressed concern that the plans make UK-made cars less expensive to import than those made by their companies in Mexico and Canada.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump wants to create a new top income bracket for individuals making over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6%. The move would partially reverse the tax cuts enacted in 2017. Republicans are facing political and budgetary challenges in completing the fiscal legislation, including the need to offset the cost of tax cuts with spending cuts to Medicaid.</p>

          <p>India is considering a trade deal with the U.S. that would involve zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, up to a certain quantity. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner. Experts suggest that a trade deal would benefit logistics companies. The U.K. signed a bilateral trade agreement with India on Tuesday, under which India will gradually lower taxes on imports from the U.K., with the vast majority of goods traded becoming "fully tariff-free within a decade," according to the U.K. government.</p>

A recent survey showed that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% want the option to wear shorts.
