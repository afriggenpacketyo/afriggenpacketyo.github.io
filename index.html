          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under President Trump is scaling back enforcement of regulations classifying Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers as credit card issuers, reversing a rule established during the Biden administration. This decision relieves fintech lenders from stringent consumer protection requirements, including standardized disclosures and formal dispute investigations. The CFPB is considering rescinding the rule entirely, citing a need to focus on pressing threats to consumers, particularly service members and small businesses. This move follows opposition from BNPL firms like Affirm, which argued the regulations create compliance challenges and confusing outcomes for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are likely to raise prices on flowers ahead of Mother's Day, as about 80% of flowers bought in the United States are imported. A 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect, impacting small growers who import bulbs and florists who source flowers from Colombia and Ecuador. Some florists are trying to avoid passing on costs to customers by sourcing more local flowers or substituting flower types. Consumers may need to be more flexible about their flower choices, but florists are working to create quality bouquets despite the tariffs.</p>

While most healthy people are not at risk, those with compromised immune systems, asthma, or who are elderly face a higher risk of severe infection.

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that targets divisions housing climate change offices and the Energy Star program. The proposed changes include vast alterations to the Office of Air and Radiation, where these programs are currently located. Critics fear the restructuring could compromise critical programs within the division, such as efforts to monitor air pollution and provide energy resources to state governments. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claims the restructuring will streamline the agency and save $300 million a year by 2026.</p>
