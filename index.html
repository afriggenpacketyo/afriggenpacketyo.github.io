          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents, were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving over 35 years. The resentencing follows a recommendation from the former Los Angeles County District Attorney, citing their rehabilitation in prison and the abuse they suffered. While the defense argued for their immediate release, prosecutors maintained that the brothers have not fully admitted the extent of their crimes and cover-ups. The article details the emotional testimonies, legal arguments, and the ongoing debate surrounding their potential release, including a risk assessment indicating a moderate risk to the community. The article also mentions the brothers' clemency bid, which is separate from the resentencing path.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, a program that allowed over 8,000 Afghans to work and avoid deportation due to unsafe conditions in their home country. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Afghanistan's security situation and economy have improved, justifying the end of TPS. This decision has drawn criticism from advocates who argue it will have long-lasting negative effects, especially considering the ongoing humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses since the Taliban's takeover in 2021. The article notes that this is separate from the special immigrant visas for Afghans who worked with the U.S. military.</p>

The article details the circumstances of Rose's ban for betting on baseball and Jackson's involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider the candidacies of these players, though some argue that their past actions should disqualify them based on character and integrity.</p>

          <p>BBC research reveals deep divisions among family doctors in England regarding proposed legislation to legalize assisted dying for terminally ill individuals. While some GPs view the bill as "long overdue" and a "basic human right", others consider it "appalling" and "highly dangerous." Concerns include terminally ill patients feeling pressured to choose assisted dying and potential coercion. The Royal College of Psychiatrists remains neutral but expresses concerns about unmet patient needs and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests, while proponents emphasize patient choice and dignified death.</p>

          <p>New research suggests the expiration date for the universe is now sooner than experts previously thought, but it's still trillions of years in the future. Researchers at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, have new calculations suggesting the universe is decaying much faster than previously thought. Their findings, published May 12 in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, put the universe's end at 10 to the power of 78 years.</p>

The film features original VHS footage taken by Selena’s older sister, Suzette, and is interspersed with present-day interviews with family and friends. The documentary surfaces footage from performances in which Selena subverts the idea of the well-manicured image that the Quintanilla family has constantly put out of the singer in the 30 years since her death. It also captures, in real time, the evolution of a bold new identity growing among Latino youth in the 1980s, encapsulated in Los Dinos’ cultural hybridity.</p>

The plan entails the establishment of a three-country nuclear consortium in which Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade, beneath that needed for nuclear weapons, and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use.</p>

          <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Office said Tuesday that President Trump’s tariff policies will reduce state revenues in California by $16 billion through next year. Despite personal income tax and corporate tax receipts in the state coming in $6.8 billion above projections through April, the Newsom administration is predicting that overall revenues will be lower than they could have been from January 2025 through June 2026 because of the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs. Trump implemented a series of tariffs on all imported goods, higher taxes on products from goods from Mexico, Canada and China, and specific levies on products and materials such as autos and aluminum, in April.</p>
