          <p>A new mural honoring the late Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela has been unveiled at Dodger Stadium, nine months after his death. Created by artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his iconic pitching motion and is intended to symbolize unity within the Latino community. The tribute has been met with emotional responses from fans, who remember "Fernandomania" as a pivotal moment that connected the local Latino population with the team and demonstrated that anything was possible.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have announced that only three people remain missing following the catastrophic July 4th floods, a significant decrease from nearly 100 initially unaccounted for. The flash floods claimed at least 135 lives across the state, with most fatalities occurring along the Guadalupe River. As the search for victims enters its third week, local authorities face scrutiny over the adequacy of their warning systems in a region known as "flash flood alley."</p>

          <p>Despite a resurgent offensive effort that included 10 hits and seven runs, the Los Angeles Dodgers lost 8-7 to the Milwaukee Brewers. The Dodgers' lineup showed signs of breaking its slump with home runs from Shohei Ohtani, Tommy Edman, and Miguel Rojas. However, a poor start from pitcher Emmet Sheehan and a failure to capitalize on key scoring opportunities ultimately led to their ninth loss in eleven games and another series defeat to the Brewers.</p>

The article argues that without a return to universal ethical principles, public arguments devolve into polarization, leaving coercion and manipulation as the primary tools of statecraft.</p>
