          <p>New Jersey Representative LaMonica McIver has been charged by the Department of Justice for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers during a protest outside an ICE detention facility. The U.S. Attorney, Alina Habba, stated that McIver assaulted, impeded, and interfered with law enforcement, which cannot be overlooked. McIver responded that the charges are politically motivated and mischaracterize her actions. Top House Democrats released a joint statement defending McIver, vowing to respond vigorously to what they say is an illegitimate abuse of power.</p>

McGovern stated that Republicans are deliberately hiding the contents of the bill from the American public, accusing them of pushing a "big, beautiful scam" that benefits billionaires at the expense of vulnerable citizens.</p>

The 1-year loan prime rate was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced their deposit rates to protect their net interest margin.

          <p>The Justice Department charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a protest outside a Newark immigration detention center, while dropping a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said McIver was charged for "assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement." McIver claimed that ICE agents instigated the clash and that the charges are politically motivated. Democratic leaders have criticized the charges as lacking any basis in law or fact.</p>

          <p>Chinese defence firms showcased AI’s potential to improve combat decisions at an annual military expo in Beijing last week, giving a glimpse of what could be available to the armed forces. Vendors at the China (Beijing) Military Intelligent Technology Expo also showed how artificial intelligence could be applied to daily training, intelligence gathering, and even physical training for soldiers. One start-up presented an AI-assisted military training model with a flight map of an area near the Taiwan Strait, appearing to show how the technology could be used to refine drills around Taiwan.</p>

          <p>A new EU deal is a reminder of the UK's uneasy relationship with its nearest neighbours, existing as members of the European Union and it continues as non-members. The government calls it a "reset" but in reality resetting, in one direction or another, is probably permanent or semi-permanent. The trajectory of the current government, within its own guardrails, is towards a closer relationship. The trajectory of its successors may be different. Some Brexiteers say not only is it in parts thin and oversold, but has also crossed a crucial rubicon: the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" in some areas.</p>
