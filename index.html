          <p>Government borrowing in the UK for the financial year ending in March was higher than anticipated, reaching £151.9 billion, a £20.7 billion increase from the previous year.

          <p>Elon Musk will reduce his involvement in the Donald Trump administration following a significant drop in Tesla's profits and revenues. The company reported a 20% decrease in automotive revenue and a 70% drop in profits during the first quarter of 2025, attributing it to declining sales and a backlash against Musk's political activities. Musk's role in Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) initiative has drawn criticism and boycotts, leading him to decrease his time allocation to government matters.

This reading comes as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, with cost-of-living pressures being a key concern for voters.

          <p>The Shanghai auto show highlights the rise of Chinese electric vehicles amid industry uncertainty over the U.S.-China trade war and stricter scrutiny of smart-driving features. Tariffs imposed by President Trump are pushing global growth forecasts lower, forcing automakers to confront new risks. Chinese regulators are cracking down on marketing terms like "smart driving" after a fatal accident involving Xiaomi's SU7 EV. Despite the trade war, car demand in China has held up so far this year, but analysts expect pressure on Chinese automakers due to weaker demand or pressure from Washington.</p>

The report also indicated a record-low number of teenage births and an increase in births among women aged 40-44.

A White House memo calling for a review of U.S. investments in Chinese entities and renewed scrutiny of publicly traded Chinese companies has heightened these fears. Experts suggest that regulators could use a fiscal reporting period ending April 2025 as year one for compliance, potentially leading to faster delisting. Despite these concerns, China's securities regulator has sought to increase its oversight of domestic companies listing overseas.</p>
