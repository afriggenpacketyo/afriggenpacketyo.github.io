          <p>George Legere, 77, has died in a Connecticut correctional facility just days after being charged with a murder from 1973. Legere, who was already imprisoned for a separate kidnapping and sexual assault case, confessed to fatally stabbing 21-year-old Janet Couture in her apartment during a robbery attempt. The confession was initially written and given to another inmate with instructions for it to be released only after Legere's death, but the inmate shared the information with police sooner. Authorities expressed hope that the resolution of the decades-old case would provide some measure of peace for the victim's family.</p>

The market reaction was severe, with BMW's stock dropping over 8% after the company also issued a separate profit warning related to the tariffs and slowing growth in other global markets.

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry is intensifying over the central Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Thursday. As the tenth named storm of the season, Jerry is currently located far from land but is moving on a path that could bring it near the northern Leeward Islands by late this week. A tropical storm watch has been issued for several islands, including Antigua, Barbuda, and St. Martin, with warnings of potential flash flooding and life-threatening surf conditions. The storm follows a relatively quiet hurricane season, though recent systems like Humberto and Imelda caused some coastal damage in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A driver involved in a 130mph police chase in south Wales, which resulted in the serious injury and leg amputation of a road worker, was caught after Ring doorbell footage disproved his cover-up story. Anthony Tregonning initially reported his modified Mitsubishi Evo supercar stolen and tried to blame his ex-partner for the incident. However, video evidence showed him leaving his home in the vehicle shortly before the crash. Tregonning admitted to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice, receiving a sentence of three years and four months in prison.</p>

          <p>According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first player in the sport's history to achieve a net worth of over one billion dollars. The financial data firm's valuation, which measures the Al-Nassr striker's wealth for the first time, places his net worth at approximately $1.4 billion. This comprehensive figure accounts for his career salary earnings, which exceeded $550 million between 2002 and 2023, as well as his numerous investments and high-value endorsement deals.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has urged Europe to bolster its defenses against what she termed a deliberate "hybrid warfare" campaign. In a speech, she cited a pattern of escalating incidents including air incursions, cyberattacks, and damage to undersea cables, arguing they are a targeted effort to destabilize the region and weaken support for Ukraine. While not explicitly blaming Russia for every incident, she stated Moscow's clear aim is to sow division. The EU is now developing plans for joint defense projects, including anti-drone systems, as leaders prepare to discuss a roadmap to counter these threats.</p>

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, is set to appear in a Virginia court to face charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The indictment, brought forth by the Department of Justice, relates to testimony he gave to Congress in 2020 concerning his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. The charges were filed shortly after former President Donald Trump publicly called for Comey's prosecution, raising concerns about political influence over the Justice Department. Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017 while leading the Russia probe, maintains his innocence and intends to fight the charges.</p>

Richman reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information to the media anonymously and, on at least two occasions, instructed him not to.

          <p>For centuries, King George III has been portrayed as a tyrannical and foolish monarch responsible for losing the American colonies. However, a modern reassessment, aided by the opening of his personal papers, reveals a more complex and capable ruler. He was a shrewd, pious, and deeply engaged monarch who saw the American rebellion as a threat to the constitutional order and the stability of the British empire. While his stubbornness and misjudgment of the American temperament were critical factors in the conflict, the caricature of him as a simple-minded despot or a foppish clown is inaccurate. His infamous "madness" is now believed to have been a severe bipolar disorder.</p>

This article explores how the town's distinct geology shaped its development and contributed to these two historical roles. Millennia ago, glacial processes created a fertile landscape with lush meadows and a strategic river system that attracted both Native peoples and early English colonists. This setting fostered a strong, self-governing community prepared to defend its autonomy in 1775. Later, the same natural beauty, particularly Walden Pond, provided the inspiration for the philosophical and literary work of Emerson and Thoreau.</p>

The production team had to rely on written sources, historical paintings, and the North American landscape itself to bring the 18th-century world to life. They meticulously created over 100 new, accurate maps to reflect the geography of the era and worked closely with historical reenactors to capture the physical reality of soldiering and civilian life. The process underscored how much the war's outcome was shaped not just by human actions but also by unpredictable weather, disease, and the vast, challenging terrain.</p>

The conflict escalated to the point of violent arguments, William's imprisonment by Patriot forces, and Franklin's refusal to intervene on his behalf.

          <p>During the American Revolution, thousands of enslaved people, such as Harry Washington from Mount Vernon, escaped to fight for the British in exchange for their freedom. Lord Dunmore's 1775 proclamation created the Ethiopian Regiment, the British empire's first Black regiment, which fought under the motto "Liberty for Slaves." After the British defeat, these Black Loyalists faced an uncertain future, with many evacuating to places like Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone to avoid being returned to slavery. Their story reveals a complex chapter of the Revolution, where the fight for liberty led many Black Americans to side with the Crown against the American Patriots.</p>

          <h2>Literary Scholars Continue to Debate Jane Austen's Views on Slavery in 'Mansfield Park'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The question of Jane Austen's perspective on slavery and the British Empire, particularly within her novel *Mansfield Park*, remains a subject of intense scholarly debate. The book is her only work to explicitly mention the slave trade, as the wealth of the central Bertram family comes from a sugar plantation in Antigua. Some critics, like Edward Said, argued that the novel's "dead silence" on the topic reflects a societal inability to confront the cruelty of empire. More recent scholarship suggests Austen may have embedded subtle anti-slavery critiques, parodying the new slave-owning aristocracy. Another theory posits she held a common centrist view of her time: opposing the slave trade but not slavery itself.</p>

          <p>The seventh edition of the Hammer Museum's "Made in L.A." biennial showcases the work of 28 artists with deep connections to Los Angeles, exploring the city's built environment and cultural soul. Unlike previous iterations, this year's exhibition has no overarching title or theme, instead allowing the artworks themselves to reveal the interconnections within the city's diverse art community. Curators Essence Harden and Paulina Pobocha have staged the exhibition to create a dialogue between different artists and historical references, challenging the notion of L.A. as a fractured and lonely place. The show features a wide range of media, from sculpture and painting to film and interactive installations.</p>

          <p>Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, is facing criticism for her response to a house fire that seriously injured the family of a South Carolina judge. The judge, Diane Goodstein, had recently ruled against the Trump administration and had received death threats, raising concerns the fire may have been politically motivated. Instead of expressing sympathy or calling for a thorough investigation, Dhillon engaged in social media arguments, trolling a political adversary who raised concerns about incendiary rhetoric. This reaction is being cited as an example of the administration's pattern of treating political opponents with hostility rather than professional decorum.</p>

          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla is highlighting the imminent threat of soaring healthcare premiums as a key issue in the ongoing federal government shutdown. He warns that if Congress fails to maintain Obama-era subsidies, millions of low- and middle-income Americans will face drastically higher costs during the current open enrollment period. The shutdown is entangled with partisan debates over immigration and government spending, with Republicans blaming Democrats over funding for undocumented immigrants. Padilla, a prominent Latino politician and son of immigrants, is pushing back against these narratives while advocating for immediate action to protect affordable healthcare access for citizens.</p>

          <p>Craftsman-style homes have been a beloved feature of Southern California for over a century, with Pasadena serving as a particular hub for the architectural movement. This enduring popularity is being highlighted by Pasadena Heritage's Craftsman Week, which has been expanded from a weekend to a full week to accommodate high demand for its tours and events. The style, which emphasizes handcraft, natural materials, and unified design, emerged as a reaction against the mass production of the Industrial Revolution. Today, its appeal is surging again as people seek well-made, warm, and nature-connected homes in contrast to a fast-paced, digital world.</p>

          <p>Footage has emerged of California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter becoming irritated during a CBS interview and threatening to end it, sparking criticism. The exchange occurred after reporter Julie Watts questioned Porter about her strategy for winning over voters who had supported Donald Trump. Porter grew testy with the follow-up questions, stating the interview was becoming "unnecessarily argumentative" and telling the reporter, "I don’t want this all on camera." Political strategists criticized the moment, with one noting that a governor must represent all constituents, though also acknowledging that even good candidates can have a bad interview.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law, Assembly Bill 628, that will mandate landlords to include a working refrigerator and stove in all rental units. Authored by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, the bill reclassifies these appliances from amenities to necessities required for a unit to be considered legally habitable, similar to heating and running water. The law is intended to ease the financial burden on new tenants, who often face significant upfront costs for rent, security deposits, and essential appliances when moving. The requirement will apply to all new leases starting on January 1, 2026.</p>

          <p>The Catalina Island Conservancy has introduced a new plan to eliminate the island's entire non-native mule deer population, citing their role in increasing wildfire risk by destroying native vegetation. This proposal involves using professional hunters on the ground, a shift from a previous, highly controversial plan to use aerial sharpshooters in helicopters. Despite the change in method, the plan is facing renewed opposition from some community members and L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who called it an inhumane approach. The conservancy argues that removing the estimated 2,165 deer is essential for restoring the island's fragile ecosystem and protecting it from devastating fires.</p>

          <p>The investigation into last week's massive explosion at Chevron's El Segundo oil refinery is now centered on the Isomax unit, which processes jet fuel. While Chevron has not detailed the cause, the unit remains shut down as the probe continues, though the refinery is still producing fuel from other sections. Industry experts suggest the scale of the fire points to a significant failure, possibly related to faulty equipment or oil sensors that allowed hot oil and gas to escape and find an ignition source. Multiple agencies, including Cal/OSHA and the South Coast Air Quality Management District, have opened investigations into the incident.</p>
