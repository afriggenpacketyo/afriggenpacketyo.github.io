          <p>Shares for SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high following the company's announcement of fiscal first-quarter profits that significantly surpassed expectations. The Japanese investment giant reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, far exceeding the 127.6 billion yen forecast, marking its second consecutive profitable quarter. This growth was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021, attributed to successful investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. Several of SoftBank's portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also preparing for initial public offerings, which further boosts investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million, accusing him of large-scale narco-trafficking. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new amount, which doubles the previous $25 million reward, citing Maduro's alleged collaboration with cartels to distribute fentanyl-laced cocaine in the U.S. This action follows a 2020 indictment against Maduro for narco-terrorism. In response, Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yvan Gil dismissed the move as a "pathetic" and "crude political propaganda operation," intended to distract from domestic issues in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an increased federal law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C., to address a recent spike in violent crime. The operation, part of the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force," involves agencies like the FBI and DEA and will initially last for seven days, focusing on high-traffic tourist areas and crime hotspots. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated there would be "no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C." The executive order also calls for reviewing prosecutorial policies on pretrial detention and maximizing enforcement of federal immigration laws to enhance public safety in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton secured the most significant title of his career by winning the Canadian Open. The 22-year-old defeated Russia's Karen Khachanov in a tight three-set final with a score of 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3). After losing the first set, Shelton demonstrated resilience, overcoming a mid-match technical delay and saving four break points to win the second set. He ultimately triumphed in a decisive third-set tiebreak, becoming the youngest American man to win a Masters 1000 tournament since Andy Roddick in 2004, capping a week of impressive victories.</p>

          <p>A violent incident in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, left a woman and her attacker dead, and two state troopers seriously wounded. Police reported that 61-year-old Carmine Faino shot and killed his 57-year-old neighbor, Lori Wasko, before ambushing the responding troopers from a position of tactical advantage. The troopers, Joseph Perechinsky and William Jenkins, were both shot but are in stable condition. Officials praised Perechinsky for providing first aid to his partner and securing the scene despite his injuries. The attacker, who fired dozens of rounds and shot down a police drone, was later killed by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen parents. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman certified a class action covering all children affected by the order, stating the plaintiffs were highly likely to win their case on the grounds that the policy violates the 14th Amendment. The ruling ensures the policy remains on hold as legal challenges continue to proceed through the courts.</p>

The 44-year-old politician, who is in custody awaiting sentencing, quit moments before a parliamentary vote to expel him was scheduled to take place. Ward had previously launched an unsuccessful legal challenge to prevent his removal from office, arguing it was an "affront to democracy." His resignation triggers a by-election for his seat and stops his parliamentary salary.

          <p>A new study confirms that California's fire season is beginning significantly earlier and lasting longer due to human-caused climate change. Researchers found that, on average, the season now starts about 46 days earlier in the Cascade Range and 24 days earlier in the Sierra Nevada compared to the early 1990s. The primary drivers are earlier snowmelt and increased drying of vegetation from rising temperatures, not an increase in human-ignited fires. This year is already on pace to exceed the five-year average for burned acreage, underscoring the growing and near-constant threat of wildfires throughout the state.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has started detaining dozens of migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new deportation agreement with France. Under the pilot scheme, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one approved asylum seeker from France via a safe route. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed that transfers to removal centers are underway and the first returns could happen within weeks. The government aims to deter illegal crossings by ensuring those who arrive on small boats are eligible for immediate detention and return, while critics question the plan's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Instagram's launch of a new map feature has triggered a significant user backlash due to privacy concerns. The tool, similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, allows users to share their location with friends, but many users expressed alarm, fearing their location was being exposed without their consent. Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded by stating that location sharing is an opt-in feature and is off by default, requiring explicit confirmation. However, some users claimed their location was being shared despite having phone-level location services for the app turned off, raising questions about the feature's implementation and transparency.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral GLP-1 medication, orforglipron, successfully promoted weight loss in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Adults with obesity who took the pill lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with efficacy comparable to injectable drugs like Zepbound. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting, causing about 10% of participants on the highest dose to discontinue. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval later this year, potentially making a more convenient and accessible pill-based treatment available by 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK government is developing legislation to impose stricter geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders upon their release from prison. The new system would confine offenders to a specific, pre-defined zone rather than just excluding them from certain areas, such as a victim's neighborhood. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, this measure aims to provide victims with greater peace of mind and the freedom to travel without fear of encountering their attacker. However, probation officers have raised concerns that the plan will increase their already heavy workload, despite government promises of more staff and technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order that could pave the way for alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs the Labor Department to review and potentially rewrite regulations governing qualified retirement investments.

Proponents argue it provides more investment choices, while critics worry about exposing workers' savings to higher-risk, more volatile assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is demanding regulatory and legislative action following State Farm's announcement of an average 27% increase in homeowners insurance rates in the state. The governor expressed deep concern, suggesting the insurer is unfairly shifting out-of-state catastrophe costs onto Illinois homeowners, a claim he says is inconsistent with state analysis. State Farm attributed the hike to rising profitability pressures and an increase in severe weather events, noting that Illinois had the second-highest number of hail damage claims in 2024. The significant rate increase highlights the growing financial strain on homeowners from climate-related risks. (not investment advice)</p>

However, earnings per share missed expectations as high beef prices squeezed margins, a headwind expected to worsen in the next quarter.

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's ban on "roving patrols" used by immigration agents in Southern California. A federal judge had restricted the tactic, finding that agents were stopping individuals based on factors like race and language, likely violating the 4th Amendment. The administration argues the injunction harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous judicial district. This legal challenge comes as the administration continues its push for mass deportations, and civil rights groups fear the Supreme Court could grant the government free rein in its enforcement actions.</p>
