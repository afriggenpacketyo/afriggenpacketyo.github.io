        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.1% in July, slightly down from June but still higher than economists' forecasts. This marks the lowest rate since March, largely attributed to the easing of previously skyrocketing rice prices. Despite the slowdown, the "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the Bank of Japan that also excludes energy, remained steady at 3.4%. The figures arrive after Japan's central bank recently upgraded its inflation forecasts for the fiscal year, signaling persistent price pressures even as the economy shows signs of slowing export growth.

          <p>President Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Washington D.C. to thank federal officers and National Guard members involved in his administration's anti-crime surge. He distributed food and promised improvements to the city's infrastructure, while touting the initiative's success with hundreds of arrests. The deployment has drawn criticism from local officials, who argue it is an unnecessary federal overreach, citing police data that shows a decline in violent crime. Trump has dismissed these statistics as "phony numbers" and asserted that his actions have made the city safer.</p>

          <p>A seasonal park ranger in Colorado, Callum Heskett, has been arrested and charged with multiple felonies after allegedly faking an on-duty stabbing incident. His report of being attacked by an assailant triggered a large-scale emergency response, including a manhunt with drones, a public safety alert, and lockdowns at several local schools. Investigators from the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office noted inconsistencies in his story, which ultimately unraveled. Heskett now faces charges that include attempting to influence a public servant and false reporting to authorities.</p>

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, Chad Raines, has successfully pivoted from traditional agriculture to a practice known as solar grazing. Facing significant financial losses from farming cotton, he now rents out his flock of sheep to graze on vegetation at large-scale solar energy facilities, effectively acting as natural lawnmowers. This innovative business model has proven highly profitable, turning a potential six-figure loss into a substantial profit in a single year. The trend reflects a broader struggle for small farms and offers a sustainable solution that benefits both agriculture and the green energy sector.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coastline. Although a direct landfall in the U.S. is not expected, the hurricane brought tropical storm conditions, significant coastal flooding, and storm surge to the state's Outer Banks, prompting evacuation orders. The National Hurricane Center continues to warn of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast for the coming days. The storm is forecast to weaken gradually and become post-tropical over the weekend as it passes south of Atlantic Canada.</p>

          <p>Following a push from President Trump, Missouri is poised to become the next Republican-led state to redraw its congressional map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The proposed changes are expected to create a 7-1 Republican majority in the state's U.S. House delegation by targeting the district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. This move is part of a broader, escalating partisan battle over redistricting, with states like Texas and California also pursuing mid-decade map changes. State GOP leaders appear supportive of the plan, which could be addressed in an upcoming legislative session.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court delivered a highly complex and fragmented decision regarding the Trump administration's cancellation of thousands of National Institutes of Health research grants. The ruling creates a confusing jurisdictional split, suggesting plaintiffs must argue the illegality of the overall policy in a district court but seek monetary restitution in the Court of Federal Claims. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a partial dissent, sharply criticized the outcome as "Calvinball jurisprudence," designed to make legal challenges difficult. The practical effect of the decision is expected to significantly delay or derail vital research.</p>

          <p>Florida's Department of Transportation has removed a rainbow-colored crosswalk in Orlando that served as part of a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. The state agency painted over the crosswalk with standard white lines, an act Orlando's mayor called "cruel" and a state senator labeled "vandalism." Governor Ron DeSantis defended the action on social media, stating state roads will not be "commandeered for political purposes." The removal is part of a broader state policy prohibiting pavement art associated with social or political messages on state-maintained roads.</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has approved a measure for a November special election where voters will decide whether to redraw the state's congressional districts to favor Democrats. This move, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas, escalating a national battle over electoral maps. If approved, the new lines could significantly reduce the number of Republican representatives from California in the U.S. House. The decision marks a major departure from the state's use of an independent commission to draw district lines.</p>

          <p>Ahn Hak-sop, a 95-year-old former North Korean prisoner of war, made an unsuccessful attempt to cross the border from South to North Korea. After being captured in 1953 and spending over 42 years in a South Korean prison for refusing to renounce his communist ideology, he wishes to be buried in his homeland. His journey to the border was a symbolic act, as South Korean authorities had not made arrangements for his passage. Mr. Ahn's story reflects the enduring division of the Korean peninsula and his unwavering belief in the North Korean regime.</p>

          <p>In a speech in Georgia, Vice President JD Vance promoted President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," framing it as the largest tax cut for families in U.S. history. He highlighted provisions such as an increased child tax credit and the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, which have specific income caps and limitations. The event served as a preview of the Republican campaign strategy for the 2026 midterm elections, particularly in the upcoming senate race against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Vance also defended the administration's federalization of policing and cuts to Medicaid.</p>

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb the destructive price wars plaguing several industries, including the solar panel sector. The revision targets what is known locally as "involution" or "neijuan," a form of hyper-competition where companies aggressively slash prices to the point of selling at a loss, leading to industry-wide instability. The move comes after calls from authorities to restore order in markets suffering from severe oversupply and homogenization of products. The draft amendment aims to create a more sustainable and regulated competitive environment for businesses.</p>

          <p>Several major news publications, including Wired and Business Insider, have removed articles after discovering they were written by a fake freelance journalist whose work appears to have been generated by artificial intelligence. The articles, published under the name "Margaux Blanchard," were taken down when the author's identity and the stories' sources could not be verified. One of the fabricated stories involved a "digital celebrant" who officiated weddings in the video game Minecraft. The incident highlights the growing challenge newsrooms face in detecting sophisticated AI-generated content and the need for robust verification protocols.</p>

          <p>In his first six months as Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has actively implemented his "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) platform. His initiatives include negotiating with food companies to remove synthetic dyes, challenging pediatricians over COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children, and pledging a complete overhaul of U.S. dietary guidelines. While some public health experts fear his actions on vaccination will weaken the system, he has achieved some success through "handshake agreements" with corporations. The article notes that Republican-led states are rapidly adopting similar policies, raising questions about their execution and impact.</p>

          <p>In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has allowed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to temporarily stop paying out approximately $783 million in research grants that the Trump administration had moved to terminate. The grants were canceled as part of a policy re-evaluating projects related to DEI, gender identity, and COVID-19. A lower court had ordered the payments to continue, but the Supreme Court's emergency ruling puts that order on hold while the case proceeds. The decision allows the administration to pause the funding, which affects research in areas like heart disease and Alzheimer's.</p>

The unusual offer comes after Mihailović requested a trade to Toronto FC for personal reasons, a move that surprised the club and its supporters. To celebrate the arrival of their new record-signing, Paxten Aaronson, the team will give fans a new jersey, either blank or with Aaronson's name. The program is a gesture of goodwill to the community and marks a fresh chapter for the club after the unexpected exit of a key player.</p>

          <p>Workday, a provider of finance and HR software, reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, but its stock slipped after issuing guidance that was merely in line with forecasts. CEO Carl Eschenbach warned of challenges in its state and local government business due to uncertainty over funding. He also noted that the U.S. higher education sector is facing pressure, partly due to President Trump's executive order to shut down the Department of Education. Despite the headwinds in specific sectors, the company's overall revenue grew 13% year-over-year. (not investment advice)</p>
