        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has announced that consumers should expect to see price increases on certain items due to tariffs, despite recent temporary tariff reductions on Chinese imports. CFO John David Rainey explained that the company will absorb some costs but shoppers will likely see increases starting late May, with more significant markups expected in the fiscal second quarter. CEO Doug McMillon mentioned that tariffs on countries like Costa Rica and Colombia have already impacted prices on items like bananas, avocados, and coffee, and that Walmart is exploring alternative materials and sourcing locations to mitigate the tariff impact. Walmart believes its value proposition could attract more shoppers during times of higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to limit birthright citizenship and the legality of nationwide injunctions issued by district court judges. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued against the use of nationwide injunctions, stating they create an unfair legal playing field for the government and impede the percolation of legal questions. Justices like Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed skepticism, raising concerns about the potential for unlawful policies to remain in effect too long if nationwide injunctions are restricted. Kelsi Corkran, representing plaintiffs, argued the executive order is unlawful and nationwide orders are necessary to protect fundamental constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Ukraine will send a delegation led by the defense minister to Turkey for peace talks with Russia, though President Zelensky criticized the "low-level" Russian representation. US diplomat Marco Rubio suggested a breakthrough requires direct interaction between Presidents Trump and Putin, echoing Trump's sentiment that progress is unlikely without their involvement. Zelensky accused Moscow of disrespecting Trump and Erdogan due to the Russian delegation's lack of seniority, while Russia views the talks as a continuation of failed negotiations from 2022. The aim of the talks is to establish long-term peace by eliminating the root causes of the conflict.</p>

          <p>New York University is withholding a student's diploma after he used his graduation speech to condemn Israel's actions in Gaza, stating that the ongoing "genocide" is supported by the United States. The university administration released a statement denouncing the student's remarks as a misuse of his role and a violation of university rules. Following the speech, the student's profile on the NYU Gallatin website was removed, and the university is pursuing disciplinary actions. This incident follows previous controversies at NYU, including updated student conduct guidelines that include "code words, like 'Zionist'" as examples of discriminatory speech.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration announced it will work to remove fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing potential health risks such as alterations to the gut microbiome and possible links to lower I.Q., despite limited rigorous research supporting these claims. This decision coincides with several states restricting fluoride use in public water supplies. Experts argue that the move is not based on strong evidence and that fluoride supplements provide a valuable level of protection against tooth decay for children in areas without fluoridated water. The FDA plans to review the safety of ingestible fluoride products by October 31.</p>

McGee contends that China wouldn't be where it is today without Apple's investment and training, but that Xi Jinping's consolidation of power has made this relationship increasingly problematic.

          <p>Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism toward the Trump administration's effort to restrict birthright citizenship and limit the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions. The justices questioned how the administration's policy could be implemented amid ongoing legal challenges and how hospitals and states would handle newborns. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that nationwide injunctions should be limited, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that the executive order violates Supreme Court precedent. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson raised concerns about creating a "catch me if you can" system of justice.</p>

          <p>A report from Healthy Babies, Bright Futures reveals that 100% of rice samples purchased across the U.S. contained arsenic, with one in four exceeding the federal limit for infant rice cereal. The report highlights the lack of limits for rice itself, despite its widespread consumption by infants and toddlers. The study tested 105 brands from 20 metro areas and found varying levels of heavy metals, including cadmium, lead, and mercury. The USA Rice Federation responded, stating they don't agree there is a public health safety issue.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a legal theory that would have limited lawsuits against police officers for using deadly force, ruling that courts must consider all relevant circumstances, not just the "moment of threat." The case stemmed from the fatal shooting of Ashtian Barnes during a traffic stop. Justice Elena Kagan stated that courts must consider facts and events leading up to the climactic moment. Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that the officer might still prevail under the broader standard, with Justices Thomas, Alito, and Barrett joining his opinion.</p>

The legal team isn‚Äôt asking the supreme court to rule on whether his policy is constitutional, and very little of the arguments focused on the immigration issues at heart of Trump‚Äôs order.

The development could involve engines from the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, and would require a redesign of the F-35 airframe.
