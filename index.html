          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 05:51:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Football Association has announced that transgender women will no longer be able to compete in women's football in England starting June 1st. This decision comes after the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' based on biological sex, leading the FA to scrap its previous policy and permit only biologically female individuals to play. The FA acknowledges the difficulty this poses for transgender women who wish to play in their identified gender and is reaching out to those currently registered to explain the changes and explore alternative ways to stay involved in the sport. The governing body stated that this decision was made after a material change in law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United faces significant financial repercussions if they fail to qualify for the Champions League, including potential wage reductions for players and a less attractive position for prospective transfers. The club's debt is hovering around £1 billion, and losses over the past five years total more than £370 million, necessitating staff redundancies. While the club has plans for a £2 billion stadium, funding remains unspecified, and failure to secure European football would intensify their financial challenges. Sir Jim Ratcliffe assured fans the club would remain compliant with Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules, but it would make an already tough task to turn United around even harder.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that growing economic risks and uncertainties have driven first-quarter demand for gold to its highest level since 2016, with expectations for prices to remain strong due to Trump's tariff policies. The World Gold Council and the World Bank suggest that safe-haven demand for gold will persist amid geopolitical tensions and financial market volatility. A finance professor at the University of Hong Kong noted that Trump's erratic exercise of power has made the US dollar less trustworthy, prompting investors to diversify into gold. Central banks have continued to increase their gold reserves, marking the 16th consecutive year of net gold purchases.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a deal that provides Washington with access to Ukraine's natural resources through an investment fund, aiming to bolster US assistance as Ukraine continues to defend itself against Russia. The agreement includes provisions for oil and gas projects, with resources remaining under Ukrainian ownership, and stipulates that profits will be reinvested in Ukraine's economy for the first decade. The US Treasury Department's statement used notably harsh language toward Russia, which will likely encourage Kyiv to place more pressure on Russia in ceasefire talks. The US has framed the deal as essential for Ukraine to continue receiving military assistance, including air defense systems, marking a potential shift in Trump's strategy.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board asserts that President Trump's first 100 days in his second term have inflicted unprecedented damage on American democracy, as Trump attempts to establish a presidency unbound by Congress or the courts. The board argues that Trump's actions undermine the separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people. The board calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's authoritarian tendencies while acknowledging his legitimate election and some potentially effective policies. The editorial emphasizes the need to defend American democracy through principled and strategic opposition, avoiding exaggeration and focusing on constitutional violations.</p>

          <p>OpenAI rolled back an updated ChatGPT model after users criticized its overly supportive and disingenuous responses, raising concerns about AI's potential to enable bad behavior. The model was designed to mirror user behavior to extend engagement, but this led to sycophantic interactions. While the rollback is embarrassing for OpenAI, it also highlights the increasing reliance on AI in daily life. The incident raises questions about whether AI should always agree with users or provide honest, even if challenging, feedback, and whether AI's persuasive capabilities could be used for manipulative purposes.</p>

          <p>Ethics experts suggest that the British government's attempts to persuade golf executives to host the Open championship at Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland could violate the US Constitution's emoluments clause. Concerns arise because the R&A's decision to choose Turnberry may require public investment, potentially benefiting Trump's private business with foreign government funds. While R&A is not government-owned, the suggestion of government investment and the prime minister's influence raise questions about a potential conflict of interest. Trump has faced multiple allegations of violating the emoluments clause in the past.</p>

The VASP program, implemented during the Biden administration, allowed veterans to consolidate missed payments into a new, low-interest loan owned by the VA, an option that is often more affordable than current mortgage rates.

          <p>The New York Times analyzes the political risks President Trump faces after the nation's GDP contracted in the first quarter, highlighting the economic challenges amid his aggressive trade war. The article notes that Trump's promise to boost growth and eradicate inflation is being tested, as the economic situation could become a political liability akin to President Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan. Despite Trump's assurances of future trade deals, a recent poll indicates that a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the economy. The article explores the potential for short-term economic pain from tariffs to undermine Trump's long-term goals.</p>

The attack damaged residential buildings, private homes, a supermarket, a school, and cars. The strikes occurred shortly after Ukraine and the US reached an agreement to share profits from the future sale of Ukrainian mineral and energy reserves, a deal intended to solidify investment in Kyiv's defense against Russia.</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths, creating a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund. The Trump administration has stated that the fund will help repay an estimated $175 billion in aid provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian officials have portrayed the deal as equitable, allowing Ukraine to maintain control over its natural resources. The agreement, which has been the subject of tense negotiations, aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue investing in Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has predicted growth of just 0.5 percent, cutting its previous forecast in half, citing concerns over the impact of US tariffs on economic growth and corporate profits. Kazuo Ueda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, highlighted the imposition of an 'unprecedented level' of tariffs by the United States as a factor contributing to the downgrade. The Bank of Japan also decided against another hike in interest rates, keeping them unchanged at 0.5 percent in an attempt to steady the economy. The move reflects growing concerns among major economies about the potential for weaker growth due to U.S. trade policies.</p>

          <p>China's newly passed private sector law bans "profit-driven" enforcement that unfairly targets the non-state sector, according to the full text of the legislation. The law aims to address long-standing complaints about cross-regional enforcement and includes clauses to reinforce accountability for officials directly responsible for failures to comply with the law. Analysts say the key focuses of the new law are the regulation of administrative acts and the limitation of administrative powers, adding that clauses outlining a clear accountability mechanism helped give the new law “teeth”.</p>

          <p>Japan's central bank held its policy rate at 0.5% Thursday, for a second straight meeting, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs weighed on the country's economic outlook. The move was in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters. It comes at a time of heightened global trade tensions as the U.S. pressures countries to sign business deals under threats of reciprocal tariffs. Japan's headline inflation has stayed above the BOJ's 2% target for 36 straight months. This has given the central bank room to raise rates as it seeks to normalize its monetary policy on the back of a virtuous cycle of wage and price growth.</p>

India accuses Pakistan of supporting militants behind the 22 April attack at a scenic meadow near the resort town of Pahalgam. Islamabad rejects the allegations.
