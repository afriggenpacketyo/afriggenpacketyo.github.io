            <p>The global economy is caught in the crossfire of an escalating trade war and policy shifts driven by the US administration, introducing severe volatility into global markets and undermining the foundations of trade. The lack of a clear international response to provocative remarks and trade aggression is concerning, raising questions about fear, complacency, or a lack of options. Tariffs impose significant costs, disrupt global supply chains, raise business expenses, and ultimately harm consumers. Another possibility is that the United States is trying to reverse decades of globalisation by returning manufacturing jobs to American soil, but this would require enormous investment, escalate production costs and lead to significant inflation.

            <p>Reform UK and the Green Party are aiming for significant gains in upcoming mayoral contests, capitalizing on voter disenchantment with Labour and the Conservatives. Voters appear to be in a restless mood as Labour faces its first electoral test since its landslide general election victory. In Hull and East Yorkshire, Reform UK has selected Olympic champion Luke Campbell as its candidate, hoping to echo Donald Trump's success. In the West of England, the Green Party is also seeing increased support. Optimism score is set at 50, reflecting the potential for political shifts and new leadership.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, following a U.S. Trade Representative investigation that found China's acts, policies, and practices were unreasonable and burdened U.S. commerce. The fees will be charged based on the net tonnage of the vessel and will increase incrementally over the next few years. Vessel owners can be eligible for a remission of the fees if they provide proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order. The move aims to reverse Chinese dominance in shipbuilding and address threats to the U.S. supply chain. Optimism score is set at 45, reflecting the potential economic impact and trade tensions.</p>

One fire service stated that the 50% shortfall is equivalent to the cost of a fully-staffed fire engine.
