          <h2>Over 100 Aid Organizations Warn of Mass Starvation in Gaza</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 07:02:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations has issued a severe warning about impending mass starvation in Gaza, directly attributing the crisis to the Israeli government's siege. In a joint statement, groups including Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders described a catastrophic food shortage, with some aid workers now forced to wait in food lines themselves. The statement accuses Israel of creating chaos and death by imposing restrictions and delays on aid delivery. Citing reports from doctors on the ground, the organizations also highlight record rates of acute malnutrition, particularly affecting children and the elderly, painting a grim picture of the humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Oregon have identified two women who died after their group of inner tubers was swept over the dangerous Dillon Falls on the Deschutes River. The victims were Amanda Lloyd, 40, and Lindsay Bashan, 33. The accident occurred when their group of six, floating on tied-together tubes, went over the 15-foot falls; three survivors managed to reach the shore. A search operation is still underway for one person who remains missing and is presumed dead due to the hazardous conditions of the rapids. Officials have urged the public to avoid the area, which is known for its treacherous waters despite warning signs.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgages in the U.S. showed minimal movement last week, with total application volume rising by a mere 0.8% as interest rates climbed to a four-week high. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.84%, deterring potential borrowers. Applications to refinance a home loan fell by 3%, while purchase applications saw a modest 3% rise. An economist from the Mortgage Bankers Association noted that the average purchase loan amount has decreased to its lowest level since January 2025, indicating that persistently high rates are continuing to suppress significant activity in the housing market.

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges related to online posts he made following last year's assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The judge ruled that his posts, which included dark humor about the event, were clearly recognizable as satire and did not intend to disturb public order, despite being in bad taste. Prosecutors had argued the statements constituted a "hate crime" and sought a €6,000 fine, claiming satirists are not above the law. The verdict is being viewed as a significant moment for freedom of speech and satire in Germany's liberal democracy.</p>

The identification was made possible through a combination of community-led research and scientific analysis, including dendrochronology, which dated its timbers to mid-18th-century England. Originally HMS Hind, the ship served in the British Royal Navy before being sold and repurposed for whaling. It ultimately wrecked off the island of Sanday in 1788, though all 56 crew members survived, adding to what one archaeologist called its story as a "lucky ship."</p>

This designation would grant the regulator power to enforce changes to address concerns about their dominance in mobile operating systems, app stores, and browsers. The probe examines whether the companies create barriers for competitors, favor their own services, or impose unfair terms on developers.

          <p>Tensions are high as European Union leaders prepare for a summit in Beijing, with prospects for a trade breakthrough appearing slim after China shortened the talks from two days to one. The EU's primary grievance is its €400 billion trade deficit, which it attributes to China's restrictive market access and massive subsidies for domestic industries, leading to the dumping of cheap goods like electric vehicles. Further complicating relations are China's export curbs on crucial rare earth minerals and its tacit support for Russia's war in Ukraine. Analysts believe the summit is unlikely to resolve these deep-seated issues, viewing it more as an attempt to manage barriers rather than foster deeper engagement.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives aims to expand access to private investments, which are typically reserved for the wealthy. The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act would direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create a test that individuals could pass to qualify as an "accredited investor," regardless of their income or net worth. Currently, accreditation is based on strict financial thresholds. The bill's sponsor argues that financial knowledge is a better determinant of a person's suitability for such investments than wealth alone, potentially democratizing access to assets like private equity and venture capital.

          <p>A woman hiking on a popular trail in Alaska's Chugach Mountains was attacked and mauled by a brown bear. The hiker was able to call 911 and, despite being unable to walk, communicated with officials for an hour while they located her using drones. She was evacuated by helicopter to a hospital with injuries that are not considered life-threatening. After the attack, the bear ran off, and officials from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game are now searching for it. Authorities are advising all hikers in the region to be prepared and carry bear spray for their safety.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article explains how China achieved its near-monopoly on the refining of rare earth elements, which are vital for modern electronics and defense systems. Initially, the U.S. controlled the market, but China strategically learned the technology and leveraged its advantages to dominate the industry. The process involved a chaotic period of unregulated mining, which caused severe environmental damage, followed by a ruthless state-led consolidation campaign. This campaign winnowed the industry down to six state-owned giants, giving Beijing a powerful chokehold on the global supply chain and significant geopolitical leverage in trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Heathrow Airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, has admitted it was "frustrating" that he slept through emergency notifications during a fire in March that led to a massive power outage and the cancellation of 1,300 flights. A report found that Woldbye missed multiple calls because his phone was in silent mode. While he stated that the organization's crisis management procedures functioned correctly without him, he acknowledged the failure on his part. The incident, caused by a known fault at a National Grid substation, is expected to cost millions and has led Heathrow to consider legal action against the power company.</p>

          <p>A Chinese analysis of popular GLP-1 anti-obesity medications like Ozempic has reinforced evidence that users are likely to experience significant weight rebound after they stop the treatment. Researchers at Peking University People's Hospital found that patients regained a substantial amount of weight within eight weeks of discontinuing the drugs, a trend that continued after 20 weeks. The study, published in BMC Medicine, concludes that weight regain is a common challenge across various weight-loss strategies. This suggests that long-term treatment plans are necessary for patients to maintain weight loss, similar to the challenges faced with more traditional methods.</p>

The funds have been distributed to numerous non-profits providing direct cash, food, shelter, and mental health services to displaced residents and those who lost homes and jobs. A review of the grants shows a thoughtful process that prioritized immediate needs and is now shifting toward long-term recovery, such as navigating insurance and rebuilding permits. However, grant recipients emphasize that despite the significant aid, the scale of the damage means the community's needs will require investment for years to come.</p>

Critics are concerned that the panel's composition and direction could lead to policies that prevent pregnant women from accessing necessary mental healthcare.

If Southern California Edison is found liable for the fire, which killed 19 people and destroyed 9,000 homes, the resulting claims may be substantial enough to wipe out the entire fund. Concerns are also rising that the utility has little incentive to keep settlement costs low, as the fund would reimburse most of the expenses. This situation has prompted discussions among state leaders about how to shore up the fund, possibly by extending a surcharge on customer electricity bills. (not investment advice)</p>
