          <p>A New York Times article reports that India and Pakistan have extended their cease-fire, signaling a return to normalcy with reopened airports and rising stock markets. Military leaders from both sides engaged in talks aimed at preventing further aggressive actions and reducing troop presence along the borders. President Trump claimed that U.S. diplomacy played a crucial role in brokering the truce, even suggesting he threatened both nations with trade restrictions. However, India has downplayed American involvement, emphasizing the bilateral nature of the agreement, potentially to maintain Prime Minister Modi's image of strength and independence on the international stage. Despite the cease-fire, tensions remain high, with thousands displaced and reports of drone sightings in Kashmir, and residents express a deep sense of fear and loss.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, has been released following negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas. The International Committee of the Red Cross facilitated Alexander's transfer from Gaza to Israeli authorities, with a temporary pause in combat operations during the release. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his role in securing Alexander's release, attributing it to military and political pressure on Hamas. Alexander, originally from New Jersey, was serving in the IDF when captured, and his release is viewed as a potential opening to jumpstart broader conflict talks. Fifty-seven hostages remain in Gaza, including 20 believed to be alive, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged Netanyahu to negotiate a comprehensive agreement for their release.</p>

          <p>A group of White South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration, according to CBS News. U.S. officials greeted the group, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau citing "egregious discrimination" faced by the group in South Africa, though the South African government denies these claims. President Trump directed his government to resettle South Africans of European descent, particularly Afrikaners, who allege discrimination by the post-apartheid government, including through land seizure laws. The South African government maintains that its land laws respect private property rights and target unused land for public interest.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article details how Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant flight delays due to a shortage of air traffic control staff. The FAA issued an advisory about delays of over an hour and 40 minutes for incoming flights from various U.S. and Canadian airports. This issue compounds recent radar and radio communication malfunctions at the airport. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the Biden administration for the move of the air traffic control facility to Philadelphia, while the FAA has convened a task force to address the problems and implement software updates to prevent future outages, while emphasizing the safety of flying at the airport. The delays are having cascading effects on flights globally, impacting one of the nation's busiest airports and a major hub for United Airlines.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the recent trade agreement with China signifies a step towards the U.S. reducing its dependence on Chinese products, according to CNBC. Bessent clarified that the U.S. aims for strategic decoupling, particularly in sectors vital to national interests, as opposed to a complete separation from China. The agreement, a 90-day pause involving reciprocal tariff suspensions, will maintain a 10% duty and a 20% charge related to fentanyl. Bessent expressed optimism regarding China's commitment to assisting the U.S. in curbing the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs, with further trade talks anticipated in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>New images from the James Webb Space Telescope reveal Jupiter's auroras are hundreds of times brighter than those on Earth, according to CBS News. High-energy particles colliding with atmospheric gases near Jupiter's magnetic poles cause these intense dancing lights. Scientists analyzing the photos taken in 2023 found the auroral region to be rapidly changing, with light variations occurring within seconds. Comparison with Hubble Space Telescope images has raised new questions about the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere, specifically regarding the presence of high quantities of low-energy particles, opening doors to new questions about the universe.</p>

The screwworm, a parasite larva that can be fatal to warm-blooded animals, was recently confirmed in a human case in Chiapas, Mexico, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture cited an "unacceptable northward advancement" of the pest, necessitating further action.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article details how former Governor Andrew Cuomo was denied over $600,000 in public matching funds after the New York City Campaign Finance Board determined he likely coordinated with a super PAC. The board found that Cuomo's campaign website posting detailed spending instructions, later mirrored by the super PAC's ad, constituted illicit coordination. While this penalty has little practical effect on Cuomo's campaign, given the super PAC's support, it marks another setback for a candidate emphasizing competence.

          <p>A New York Times article details the events leading up to the truce between India and Pakistan, highlighting the rapid escalation of conflict following a terrorist attack in Kashmir. India launched airstrikes across the border, leading to retaliatory actions from Pakistan, with both sides striking deeper into each other's territory. While both countries claimed victory, the clashes involved significant losses of aircraft and heavy civilian casualties, leading to concerns about potential all-out war. The article notes the role of U.S. mediation in securing the cease-fire and emphasizes the shift towards noncontact warfare and the potential for escalation with new technologies.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that tariffs against China would be "substantially higher" than 145% if a trade deal is not reached, according to ABC News. The statement was made as Trump embarked on an official visit to the Middle East. The U.S. and China had issued a joint statement announcing an agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, a move that U.S. markets appeared to favor, with stock futures climbing on the news.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article discusses how the United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs in an effort to de-escalate their trade war. The move reflects a recognition of the economic costs of the conflict, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent and China lowering import duties on American goods to 10 percent. Despite the reduction, many tariffs remain in place, and the talks aim to "open up" China to American businesses. The agreement breaks an impasse that had halted much trade between the two countries, though some analysts remain skeptical about the long-term commitment to easing tensions.</p>

          <p>Sharpe James, the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, passed away at the age of 89, according to The New York Times. James served as mayor for 20 years, overseeing a downtown resurgence but was later convicted of corruption for conspiring to sell city-owned properties at reduced prices. Despite his achievements in revitalizing Newark, including the construction of a performing arts center and new housing, the city continued to face challenges such as high poverty rates. James's tenure was marked by a mix of progress and controversy, with his legacy including both redevelopment and ethical lapses.</p>

          <p>President Trump dismissed ethical concerns regarding the potential acceptance of a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar, stating that it would be "stupid" to decline such an offer, according to The New York Times. Trump emphasized that the gift would be to the U.S. Department of Defense, not him personally, and would eventually be transferred to his presidential library. The arrangement has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause, with Trump growing visibly angry when questioned about the matter.</p>
