          <p>President Trump commenced his second term with a visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, aiming to secure deals exceeding $1 trillion, according to the New York Times article. Greeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, Trump's visit underscores the strengthened relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, contrasting with President Biden's previous visit. The deals are expected to encompass investments in artificial intelligence, energy production, and significant arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers, and the trip is closely scrutinized for potential conflicts of interest involving the Trump family's business ventures in the region.</p>

Piker, a US citizen, stated that officials inquired whether he supported Hamas and considered them a resistance group. While a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson denied that Piker's political beliefs triggered the screening, civil liberties organizations have expressed concern that border officials are abusing their power by interrogating political commentators.

          <p>The German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has banned the far-right "Kingdom of Germany" group, accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state" within Germany. Police conducted raids in seven German states, arresting key members, including Peter Fitzek, the self-declared monarch. Dobrindt stated the group undermined the rule of law and used antisemitic conspiracy narratives. The group, reportedly with around 6,000 members, denies the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic, and security authorities have been increasingly concerned about its violent potential following a 2022 plot to overthrow the government.</p>

          <p>Job vacancies in the UK have fallen to a seven-year low outside of the pandemic, as employers freeze hiring in response to tax increases and minimum wage jumps. The number of advertised jobs fell to 761,000 in the three months to April, the lowest since January 2017. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.5% and the number of payrolled employees fell by 33,000 in April. Experts suggest that uncertainty from trade wars and reforms to workers' rights are further pressuring employers.</p>

Impeachment would bar Duterte from public office and end her ambition to replace Marcos at the next election.
