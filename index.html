          <p>Robinhood has launched tokenized shares of private firms OpenAI and SpaceX for its European Union customers, marking a significant expansion of its crypto services. This move, which makes equity in unlisted companies accessible to a broader audience, is facilitated by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. The announcement caused Robinhood's stock to surge to an all-time high, although similar offerings are not expected in the U.S. soon due to stricter regulations. The company is also giving away tokens to new EU users to promote the launch.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded after being shot while responding to a wildfire in Kootenai County, Idaho.

Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris stated that the firefighters "did not have a chance" in the deliberate attack. The incident prompted a massive law enforcement response and a temporary shelter-in-place order for the area as the fire continued to burn.</p>

          <p>Lululemon has initiated a lawsuit against Costco, accusing the warehouse retailer of selling apparel that illegally copies its signature designs, including its "Scuba" hoodies and "Define" jackets. The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, claims that Costco's products are "confusingly similar" and constitute "trade dress" infringement, misleading consumers. Lululemon is seeking damages for lost profits and an order for Costco to stop selling the alleged "knockoff" products, which have gained popularity on social media as "dupes."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a "vote-a-rama," involving numerous back-to-back votes on amendments to a massive spending bill central to President Trump's second-term agenda. Republicans are aiming to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, navigating a narrow majority and some internal opposition. Democrats are using the process to force politically difficult votes on controversial provisions, such as cuts to healthcare programs. The bill, which the CBO estimates will increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion, faces an uncertain future in the House even if it passes the Senate.</p>

          <p>The jury has begun deliberations in the federal trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faces charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. After seven weeks of testimony, which included graphic details and video evidence, the jurors will decide Combs' fate, with a conviction on the most severe charges carrying a potential life sentence. Prosecutors argued that Combs used his power and violence to exploit victims, while the defense contended the case is about money and that all sexual encounters were consensual.

          <p>The U.S. dollar has recorded its most significant first-half decline in over five decades, falling more than 10% against a basket of other major currencies since the start of 2025. This downturn is attributed to investor concerns over President Trump's economic policies, including tariffs and a budget bill expected to increase the national debt, which threaten the dollar's safe-haven status. Rising expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts have also contributed to the currency's weakness, pulling the dollar index to its lowest level since March 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

Detentions of individuals facing only civil immigration charges rose by over 250% from early May to early June, reversing a previous trend. While the Trump administration states it prioritizes deporting criminals, the data shows that only about 8% of all detainees since January 20 had convictions for violent crimes.

This potential policy shift aims to balance the administration's hardline immigration stance with the economic needs of key industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor, a move that comes amid a broader ramp-up of deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted of the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in her home in 1967, solving one of the United Kingdom's longest-running cold cases. The case was cracked after 58 years when new forensic testing of DNA found on the victim's skirt linked Headley to the crime. Investigators also matched a palm print from the scene to Headley, whose DNA was added to a national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident. He will be sentenced on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a plan to cut off access to a key satellite data program used by forecasters for hurricane prediction. The decision to suspend access to the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data had alarmed scientists, who warned it could set forecasting back decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced the delay after a request from NASA. The administration has cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the planned decommissioning of the data ingest system.</p>

Data shows wide disparities in how different police forces record the offense, and many have not implemented recommended risk-assessment tools or training.
