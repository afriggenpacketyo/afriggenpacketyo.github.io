        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is exploring further measures to enhance online safety for children, building upon the existing Online Safety Act. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander confirmed that Technology Secretary Peter Kyle is examining new actions, including ways to address addictive online habits among young people. These considerations follow the implementation of stricter age-verification rules and algorithm changes for children's feeds, which are set to be enforced by the media regulator Ofcom starting later this month. Ofcom's head has vowed rigorous enforcement but acknowledged that new legislation might be needed to address advancements in AI.</p>

          <h2>German Parliament President Orders Removal of Rainbow Flags from Offices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 07:51:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The President of Germany's Bundestag, Julia Klöckner of the conservative CDU party, has mandated the removal of rainbow flags from parliamentary offices, citing house rules that prohibit signs on windows visible from the outside. This decision has sparked controversy, with opposition members from the Left and Green parties criticizing it as a "bigoted understanding" of neutrality, especially amid rising hostility towards LGBTQ+ communities. Klöckner also refused to fly the Pride flag over the Bundestag for Christopher Street Day, a tradition since 2022, further fueling debate over political symbols and neutrality within the German legislature.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, has spoken about the team's process of grieving the death of player Diogo Jota and his brother, who died in a car crash. Slot encouraged his players to be true to their emotions, whether it be to laugh or cry, as they navigate their first pre-season friendly since the tragedy. The club has planned several tributes, including retiring Jota's number 20 shirt, and a large delegation from the team attended the funeral. The manager emphasized that the best way to honor Jota is for everyone to be themselves, just as Jota always was.</p>

          <p>The recent designation of the bald eagle as the official bird of the United States is being celebrated with particular pride within many Native American communities. For numerous tribes, the eagle is a sacred messenger to the Creator, and its feathers are bestowed to honor significant life achievements. Community leaders, like Jim Thunder Hawk of the Prairie Island Indian Community, express hope that this official recognition will foster greater respect for the bird and perhaps promote national unity. The move also highlights the eagle's central role in Indigenous spiritual beliefs and traditions across North America.</p>

Located in the Ordos basin of Inner Mongolia, this project utilizes a new mining technique that avoids tunnels and toxic waste, which state media describes as "green, safe, intelligent and efficient." This development marks a shift from China's traditional reliance on volcanic and granite deposits in the south to the vast sandstone-type uranium deposits discovered in the country's north.

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd sparked global protests, this opinion piece argues that the movement's demands for systemic transformation have been largely unmet. The authors contend that initial corporate and political gestures, like DEI initiatives and symbolic acts, served to co-opt the movement rather than address its root causes of poverty, racism, and police violence. They assert that the response from the establishment, including both Democratic and Republican administrations, has been to increase police budgets and suppress dissent.

          <p>Following deadly flash floods in Texas Hill Country, this article critiques the state's political approach to disaster management, describing it as a pattern of offering condolences without implementing preventative measures. It highlights how a bill to improve statewide emergency alerts failed just months before the tragedy due to cost concerns in the state senate. This "Texas way," characterized by a preference for rugged individualism and disdain for government action, is linked to insufficient responses to past events like the 2021 winter storm. Experts argue this resistance to preparation is especially dangerous for Texas, the nation's most disaster-prone state.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, this analysis explores the event's profound and lasting impact on the U.S. political landscape. The article details how Trump's survival and defiant reaction were framed as divine intervention by his supporters, fueling a zealous self-belief that has characterized his presidency. It also connects the shooting to the subsequent withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 race, an event that left the Democratic party in disarray. The shooting is presented as a pivotal moment that solidified Trump's base and intensified a culture of political violence.</p>

          <p>A recent dispute over the succession plan for the 14th Dalai Lama is straining the recent thaw in relations between China and India. The friction was sparked by comments from a senior Indian minister, who stated that only the Dalai Lama and his institution could identify his successor, followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to the exiled spiritual leader. Beijing responded with criticism, lodging a formal protest and insisting that the succession must follow Chinese law and tradition. Observers note that the issue is highly sensitive but unlikely to completely derail improving ties.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech's Dabiri Lab are creating "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectric controllers into living jellyfish, allowing them to be remotely controlled. The goal is to dispatch these cyborg jellyfish as a low-cost, scalable swarm to collect environmental data from the ocean's depths. Jellyfish are ideal candidates as they lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, and can heal quickly. By stimulating the jellyfish's muscles, scientists can guide their movement, turning the animals into efficient data-gathering devices that could make ocean research more accessible to a wider range of institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To address its severe housing and homelessness crisis, California is creating a new state agency dedicated exclusively to these issues. The move splits the current Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency, elevating housing to a cabinet-level priority for the first time. Supporters hope this reorganization will streamline the state's complex and fragmented network of affordable housing financing programs, which are currently spread across multiple departments. While seen as a crucial first step, experts caution that simply reorganizing the bureaucracy will not solve the state's deep-seated housing challenges without further systemic changes.

          <p>The job market for recent college graduates in 2025 is proving to be exceptionally difficult, with many struggling to find work in their desired fields. Economists note that while overall unemployment is low, cautious employers and government downsizing have reduced the number of available entry-level positions. This has led to a competitive environment where many graduates are settling for jobs outside their field and for lower pay than expected. Experts advise graduates to be flexible, viewing their first job as a potential stepping stone for future career opportunities.</p>

          <p>The death toll from the devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country has risen to 129, with search and recovery operations ongoing for missing individuals. A team of over 30 active and former Navy SEALs has volunteered to assist, using their expertise to navigate the difficult, debris-filled terrain along the Guadalupe River. In an exclusive report, the SEALs described the immense violence of the flood. When questioned about the effectiveness of the state's warning systems, President Donald Trump defended the response as "heroism" and dismissed the question as being from "a very evil person."</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting is scheduled to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The strike is over a pay dispute, with the BMA rejecting the government's 5.4% increase, arguing it doesn't address the real-terms pay decline since 2008. While the government insists it cannot improve the pay offer, sources suggest the secretary is open to discussing improvements to working conditions. Public support for the strikes has reportedly fallen significantly since last year.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reaffirmed his country's "unconditional support" for Russia's actions regarding the war in Ukraine, according to state media. The pledge was made during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the port city of Wonsan. This meeting is the latest in a series of high-level visits deepening the military and political ties between Moscow and Pyongyang. South Korea's intelligence service reports that North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia's Kursk region and has supplied Moscow with over 10 million artillery rounds.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, also known as the Shiller P/E, is approaching a historically high valuation, signaling potential trouble for the stock market. This metric, which has a perfect track record of preceding major market downturns when it surpasses a multiple of 30, currently sits at 38.26. In the five previous instances it has sustained this level, the market eventually experienced a significant plunge. While not a timing tool, the indicator suggests valuations are extended, but the article notes that bear markets are historically short-lived, presenting buying opportunities.
