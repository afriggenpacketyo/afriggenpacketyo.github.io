          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the Trump administration's increasing disregard for ethical norms and legal guardrails concerning public service. It cites examples such as the acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar, the involvement of Trump's family in overseas business deals, and the auctioning off of access to the president through a meme cryptocurrency. The article suggests that the administration is emboldened by Supreme Court rulings and Trump's hold on the Republican Party, leading to a culture where personal benefits are openly accrued through his position. The piece draws parallels to past instances of political impropriety but emphasizes the unprecedented openness of the current situation.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that the "de minimis" tariff rate on low-value parcels from China will be reduced from 120% to 54% following an agreement with Beijing. This move comes after President Trump's earlier decision to eliminate the low-value parcel exemption, leading to tariffs of up to 145% on packages from China worth $800 or less. The end of the exemption had disrupted the business models of e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu, with Temu now relying on domestic sellers to fulfill U.S.-based orders.</p>

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, potentially limiting his ability to unilaterally impose import taxes. The lawsuit argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the president to issue sweeping duties. Five domestic businesses claim they rely on imported goods and that the "national emergency" declared by Trump is unfounded. The Department of Justice argues that IEEPA does authorize the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Ramaco Resources, a coal miner, unexpectedly discovered a major trove of rare earth elements at a Wyoming coal mine. The Brook Mine is estimated to contain as much as 1.7 million tons of rare earth oxides, potentially helping the U.S. break its dependence on China for these crucial materials. This discovery could make Ramaco the first new rare earth facility in the U.S. in more than seven decades. The U.S. relies heavily on foreign countries, especially China, for rare earths used in national defense.</p>
