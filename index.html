          <p>A new aid center in Gaza, supported by Israel, experienced chaotic scenes as desperate Palestinians surged toward it amid looming starvation. The distribution site, intended to circumvent Hamas, faced overwhelming crowds, leading to the suspension of operations by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Footage showed people running toward the center, climbing over sand berms, and fleeing gunfire, highlighting the dire humanitarian situation caused by an Israeli blockade. The foundation acknowledged the challenges and the overwhelming needs, while the Israeli military stated warning shots were fired in the area. The situation underscores concerns about aid access, displacement, and the potential for further contact between civilians and Israeli soldiers. Optimism surrounding the aid effort is low due to the continued conflict and widespread hunger.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A surge in homelessness among older Americans is attributed to the loss of parental support for late baby boomers, who have faced economic challenges throughout their lives. Anthony Forrest's story exemplifies this trend, becoming homeless after his mother's move to a nursing home. Factors such as fierce competition for housing and jobs, recessions, and the crack epidemic have left this generation vulnerable. The death of parents in their 80s and beyond has further exacerbated the issue, leaving many without a safety net. Despite these challenges, Forrest maintains a resilient spirit, highlighting the struggle of a generation shaped by economic inequality and inner-city distress.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Republicans in Congress are advocating for increased sanctions against Russia due to its aggression in Ukraine, a stance that contrasts with President Trump's more conciliatory approach. This shift has intensified following Russia's recent aggressive attacks. Senator Lindsey Graham is leading a bipartisan effort to pass legislation imposing sweeping sanctions on Moscow, reflecting a growing frustration with Russia's intransigence. While Trump has hinted at a possible change in posture, it remains unclear whether this signals a broader shift in his view of the conflict. The increasing pressure from Congress suggests a potential clash with the president over Russia policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. Judge Richard Leon issued a scathing opinion, emphasizing the importance of an independent judiciary and bar. The order, which criticized WilmerHale for hiring Robert Mueller, sought to suspend security clearances and terminate government contracts. The law firm sued, calling the order an unprecedented assault on the judicial system's foundations. The court's decision affirms foundational constitutional rights and those of WilmerHale's clients.</p>

          <p>The State Department has temporarily suspended scheduling new student visa appointments as the Trump administration prepares to expand social media screenings for applicants. This pause is due to the planned expansion of required social media screening and vetting, potentially affecting all student visa applicants. The move is part of a broader effort to control international students, including screening for antisemitic activity on social media. This has faced pushback from the court system, raising concerns about First Amendment rights and the targeting of students based on activism.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO stands out due to a peculiar characteristic: existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself. This mirrors Facebook's 2012 IPO, where a significant portion of shares came from stakeholders. While Circle did not provide a reason, the move likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. The company is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, but private investors are eager for exits to distribute funds back to their investors. This situation reflects a multiyear drought in IPOs and a strong desire for early investors to gain liquidity.</p>

Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, warned Trump about escalating tensions to the point of World War III. Trump's apparent frustration suggests a shift in his perception of Putin, who painted himself into a corner with laughable claims that he could end the war before he even took office, or on day one.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to withdraw from a court order aimed at reforming the Minneapolis Police Department, marking the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death. This decision signals a broader effort to end federal injunctions targeting abusive and discriminatory police departments. Critics argue that this move will undermine a crucial tool for police reform, potentially leading to increased violations of rights and police violence, particularly against individuals of color. The withdrawal is viewed as a step back from meaningful efforts to address systemic issues within policing.</p>

          <p>Police Scotland's national child abuse investigation unit employs a "soft knock" approach when arresting suspected paedophiles, contrasting with typical drug raids. This tactic aims to minimize disruption and trauma to families and neighbors. Detectives describe the process as akin to delivering a death message, revealing a suspect's true nature to their loved ones. The unit has observed a surge in online offending since the COVID-19 pandemic, with offenders making direct contact with children within seconds of trying.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers have passed a bill that simplifies the process for parents to opt out of vaccinating their children, despite a current measles outbreak in West Texas. The bill, HB 1586, would allow parents to download and fill out a form online to exempt their children from required vaccinations. Republicans argue it streamlines the process and saves money, while Democrats express concerns about reduced immunity, especially during the ongoing outbreak. The bill now awaits Governor Greg Abbott's signature to become law.</p>

          <p>Recent college graduates are experiencing increased difficulty finding employment, with unemployment rates nearing 6%, surpassing the national average. A report from Oxford Economics attributes this trend to a mismatch between the supply of graduates and waning demand in certain industries, particularly the tech sector. Automation and advancements in artificial intelligence are also contributing factors. Economic uncertainty, driven by Trump's tariff agenda, is further slowing hiring, potentially exacerbating the unemployment rate among recent graduates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to permit the swift deportation of migrants to countries other than their own, despite a federal judge's ruling requiring a meaningful opportunity to object. The solicitor general argued that the judge's order hinders the government's ability to remove criminal aliens. The judge has said that the administration violated an order he entered last month in the cases of several men who were loaded on a plane after they were told they were being sent to South Sudan, a violence-plagued African country where most of them are not from. The Supreme Court issued a ruling last week insisting on due process for immigrants the administration seeks to deport under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely invoked, 18th-century wartime law.</p>

The study, involving nearly 200,000 mothers, found a sharp decrease in the percentage reporting excellent mental health and an increase in those reporting poor mental health. Factors contributing to this decline may include high costs of housing, child care, and food, as well as the continued lack of national paid parental leave. While the findings are concerning, experts suggest they may also reflect increased openness about mental health struggles among mothers.</p>
