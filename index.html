          <p>The Supreme Court has declined a request from Learning Resources and hand2mind, two family-owned toy companies, to fast-track their legal challenge against President Trump's tariffs on products imported from China. The companies argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the authority to impose these tariffs. The court's decision means the Trump administration will have the standard 30-day period to respond to the challenge, prolonging the legal battle over the tariffs' legality and economic impact on small businesses. This ruling delays any potential resolution and keeps the tariffs in place for the foreseeable future. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention while his immigration proceedings continue. Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled that Khalil, a green card holder detained in March, does not pose a flight risk or a threat to the community, describing his detention as "highly unusual." The Department of Homeland Security had detained Khalil based on allegations of omitted details from his green card application after Secretary of State Marco Rubio's declaration was deemed insufficient justification for detention. The judge emphasized the lack of evidence of violence or incitement, suggesting the immigration charge was being used to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel speech. </p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates a significant rise in hypertension-related deaths linked to excessive alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report reveals that hypertension deaths from excessive alcohol use were approximately 51.6% higher between 2020 and 2021 compared to 2016 and 2017, amounting to an increase from 13,941 to 21,137 deaths annually. The study also found that over 60% of these deaths occurred among women, and excessive alcohol use accounted for 1 in 5 hypertension deaths among females during the specified period. This report is among the last to be published from the CDC's Division of Population Health team that studied alcohol mortality before layoffs amid sweeping cuts by the Trump administration. </p>

          <p>Tesla has signed its first deal to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, a project expected to be the largest of its kind in the country. The plant, worth 4 billion yuan ($556 million), is a collaboration between Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and China Kangfu International Leasing. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems are vital for balancing electricity supply and demand, especially with intermittent renewable energy sources. Tesla's Shanghai factory produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter of the year, and the new power station will help solve urban power supply pressures. </p>

          <p>Shubman Gill, in his debut as India captain, and Yashasvi Jaiswal both scored centuries as India reached 359-3 on the first day of the Test match against England at Headingley. Following the retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, India's young batting lineup demonstrated their potential. England's decision to field first after winning the toss is under scrutiny, as their bowlers struggled to exploit the conditions. Gill's partnership with Rishabh Pant is currently at 138, placing India in a strong position. </p>

          <p>The film *Materialists* explores modern dating through the eyes of Lucy, a matchmaker who sees romance as a marketplace, valuing a suitor’s net worth above all else. Lucy finds herself in a love triangle, torn between a wealthy partner and a former flame, representing her struggle between idealism and pragmatism. However, the film struggles to convincingly mesh its critique of modern dating with its romantic storyline, resulting in a shallow and tonally inconsistent narrative. Ultimately, the movie fails to offer substantial insights into the complexities of modern love and connection. </p>

          <p>A contributor argues that the increasing practice of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks undermines their authority and endangers public safety. The author contends that masking contradicts Homeland Security regulations, potentially violates civil rights, and intimidates the public. The piece highlights instances of masked agents at protests and arrests, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. The author calls for Congress to ban the use of masks by immigration agents, asserting that the public's need for accountability outweighs any rationale for anonymity. </p>

          <p>President Trump is seeking to delay oral arguments in his appeal of the $83 million defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll. Trump's legal team and the Justice Department have jointly requested the delay, arguing that Trump should be allowed to appeal the court's rejection of the government substituting for him in the case. DOJ lawyers argue that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, thus the Justice Department should defend him. The 2nd Circuit previously upheld a separate $5 million damage award to Carroll. </p>
