            <p>The Trump administration announced reciprocal tariffs on imports from approximately 90 nations, effective April 9th. These tariffs, described as "Liberation Day" by the president, aim to address the trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries. Some nations face a baseline 10% tariff, while others, like China, face significantly higher rates. Economists predict these tariffs could reignite inflation and prompt retaliatory measures, potentially leading to serious recessions in the U.S. and other countries. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A pro-Israel group, StopAntisemitism, is calling on the US attorney general to investigate Ms. Rachel, a children's entertainer, for allegedly operating as a foreign agent after sharing content sympathetic to children in Gaza. The group claims her posts could constitute undisclosed work for foreign entities. Ms. Rachel has previously faced criticism for her advocacy on various social issues and her support for children in conflict zones. The Department of Justice has not commented on whether it will pursue an investigation.</p>

            <p>Prince Harry is appealing a decision to downgrade his police protection in the UK. His legal team argues that his life is at stake and that he has been given a security process that is "manifestly inferior." The government argues that Harry's decision to step back from royal duties resulted in a "unique set of circumstances." The court is considering whether the committee that decides security levels followed its own procedures in downgrading Harry's protection.</p>

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's focus is on Main Street businesses and consumers, even as tariffs threaten to cause a recession. He said the administration aims to de-leverage the government sector and re-leverage the private sector. Bessent's comments come as recession fears have climbed due to the Trump tariffs, which are causing uncertainty over economic growth and corporate profits. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon believes the U.S. economy is likely headed for recession. (not investment advice)</p>
