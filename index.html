        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is imposing a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating a trade dispute. President Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs and the flow of fentanyl as primary reasons for the new levy, warning that the rate could increase if Canada continues its countermeasures. This move adds to existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos, further straining trade relations ahead of a July 21 negotiation deadline. The administration has indicated it may raise tariffs on other trade partners as well. (not investment advice)</p>

He personally advocates for simple strategies like daily meditation and using exercise as a form of mental escape to maintain focus and resilience in the demanding entrepreneurial journey.</p>

          <p>Research from Princeton University reveals that threats and harassment against local school officials have surged by 170% since the COVID-19 pandemic. The study indicates that conflicts, initially centered on public health mandates like masking, have evolved to encompass cultural issues such as diversity initiatives and LGBTQ+ policies. Officials from across the political spectrum report receiving vitriolic messages and even death threats, fueled in part by misinformation on social media. Despite the hostile environment, some board members remain committed to public service.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the upper Yangtze. This action aims to restore the natural habitat for numerous rare and endemic fish species that have been severely impacted by decades of river fragmentation. The dams had blocked migratory routes, reduced water flow, and degraded spawning grounds, leading to a drastic decline in biodiversity. The project is considered a critical step toward reviving the ecological health of the region.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a key student negotiator during pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, has filed a $20 million administrative claim against the Trump administration. Khalil, who was detained by ICE for over three months, alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. His legal team argues his detention was a retaliatory act for his constitutionally protected speech. The Department of Homeland Security defended its actions, stating Khalil's rhetoric terrorized Jewish students, a claim his lawyers reject. He would reportedly accept an official apology in lieu of payment.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. The California Board of Parole Hearings ruled that the 74-year-old, who now goes by Anthony D’Amato, will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., were responsible for the murders of 12 women in the 1970s, often impersonating police officers to lure their victims. Buono died in prison in 2002, while Bianchi is serving his sentence in Washington state.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite named NWA 16788, with an expected sale price of up to $4 million. The 54-pound rock was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, constituting only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on Earth. This specific piece represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

          <p>Despite diplomatic meetings in Washington between Israeli and U.S. leaders, a ceasefire agreement for Gaza remained elusive as Israeli military operations against Hamas continued. In central Gaza, a strike near a health clinic run by the U.S. charity Project HOPE reportedly killed 15 civilians, including 10 children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" involved in the October 7 attack and said it was investigating the incident.

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science made a rare and unexpected discovery: a dinosaur fossil found deep beneath its own parking lot. The hockey-puck-shaped vertebra, believed to be from a plant-eating dinosaur from 67.5 million years ago, was found in a core sample drilled over 750 feet deep during a geothermal energy study. Museum officials described the find as incredibly unlikely, comparing it to a "hole in one from the moon." While not a large specimen, the fossil is now on display, marking Denver's deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery to date.</p>

These restrictions have significantly impacted Nvidia's sales to the Chinese market. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post. (not investment advice)</p>

After analyzing 20,000 campaign messages, he argues that eight specific words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, together—serve as powerful "emotional shortcuts" that resonate across cultures. While not a guarantee of victory, these words act as building blocks for messages that connect with voters' core emotions. The analysis suggests that these eight words offer timeless appeal in political communication.</p>

The piece questions when the international community will move beyond being inert spectators to suffering and take meaningful action to prevent such tragedies.
