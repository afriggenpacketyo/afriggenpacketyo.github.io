          <p>A man drove his vehicle into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, during a Sunday service, killing one person and injuring nine others. The 40-year-old suspect also deliberately set the church on fire, causing significant structural damage, before he was killed in a gunfight with responding officers. Authorities are investigating the motive, with sources noting a potential connection to the recent death of the church's worldwide president, Russell M. Nelson, which occurred the day before the attack.</p>

          <p>Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart made a significant impression in his first NFL start for the New York Giants, leading the team to an early touchdown against the Los Angeles Chargers. On his opening drive, the former Ole Miss standout demonstrated confidence and skill, completing both of his passes and rushing for a 15-yard touchdown. The decision to start Dart came after veteran Russell Wilson's struggles, with the team hoping the rookie can provide a much-needed offensive spark and bring a new level of energy to the field.</p>

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation into the Los Angeles Clippers and owner Steve Ballmer concerning allegations of salary cap circumvention. The probe centers on a $21 million payment made to star player Kawhi Leonard by Aspiration Partners, a sustainability firm in which Ballmer was an investor. At issue is whether the team orchestrated this endorsement deal as a way to provide Leonard with extra compensation beyond what league rules allow, a violation the NBA commissioner has termed a "cardinal sin."</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has urged the Labour Party to engage in an honest debate about its direction and strategy for competing with the rising Reform UK party. Speaking at the party's conference, Burnham criticized what he described as a "climate of fear" within Labour and warned against underestimating the political threat posed by Reform, especially with key elections approaching. His comments have been interpreted as a continuing critique of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, though Starmer has downplayed the significance of such commentary.</p>

          <p>Merseyside Police arrested several demonstrators at a protest outside the Labour Party conference in Liverpool for showing support for Palestine Action, a group proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protesters were silently holding signs that read, "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action," intentionally risking arrest to challenge the UK government's ban on the organization. The protest organizers, Defend Our Juries, stated the action was a direct disobedience of what they consider an unjust ban and a call for Labour to end its complicity.</p>

          <p>The European Union's steel industry is facing increased uncertainty as the United States considers expanding its list of "derivative" products subject to steep tariffs. This ad hoc process could subject a growing number of goods containing steel, such as furniture or window frames, to the punitive duties originally aimed at Chinese imports. Business leaders and politicians express concern that this unpredictable expansion of tariffs is creating a turbulent trade relationship and harming numerous European manufacturing sectors that rely on steel components.

          <p>China is implementing a new industrial manufacturing model, known as a "pull system," to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency of car manufacturing. This approach reverses traditional aerospace production by having final assembly lines pull components from suppliers only when needed, which aims to reduce delays, lower costs, and improve quality consistency. As global space activity is projected to increase dramatically, mastering this scalable production method could position China to dominate the future of the space industry.</p>
