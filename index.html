          <p>Facing increasing tariffs from the United States, Chinese e-commerce companies like Alibaba are helping their sellers find new markets beyond America, signaling a shift in strategy. Alibaba hosted a conference in Hangzhou, reassuring small business owners and emphasizing resilience and adaptability. The company is assisting with customs procedures and investing millions to help exporters advertise domestically. Despite concerns, many business owners are determined to continue, even if it means passing the tariff costs onto consumers, while others are focusing on personalized products and expanding into Europe to mitigate potential revenue losses. Optimism remains, fueled by a resolve to do business regardless of challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's military is accelerating the deployment of low-cost, AI-powered drones, including a micro drone designed for infantry units. The micro drone features a coaxial dual-rotor system, enabling it to carry twice its weight and support reconnaissance and attack missions. Equipped with AI-powered targeting, one operator can manage multiple drones simultaneously. This expansion is part of a "phased leap" towards autonomous unmanned combat teams, crucial for defining future battlefield rules and gaining an edge in intelligent warfare, according to the PLA Daily.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured a victory in the recent federal election, a surprising outcome influenced by U.S. President Trump's annexation threats and tariffs. The election was closely contested between Liberal Party leader Mark Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, with Trump's policies impacting voters' decisions. While domestic issues like affordability and immigration remained significant, Trump's intervention dominated the campaign, with voters expressing concerns about Canadian sovereignty and economic stability. Trump continued to insert himself into the election by suggesting Canada become the 51st state, a notion strongly rejected by Poilievre.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a previous order withholding his removal due to gang persecution risks. Homan asserted that Abrego Garcia is now a "terrorist" because of his alleged MS-13 affiliation, a claim disputed by Abrego Garcia's attorneys. The Trump administration designated certain gangs, including MS-13, as terrorist organizations, leading to this classification. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has refused to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., while a federal judge has paused orders requiring updates on efforts to facilitate his return.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days back in office have been eventful, marked by his "America First" policy, a second state visit to the UK, and the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk. Protests have erupted across the country in response to his policies, which include expanding ICE, withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, and imposing tariffs. Trump's administration has also taken a firm stance on gender, recognizing only male and female, and has been critical of judges who rule against his policies. Key issues include trade wars with China, efforts to ramp up fossil fuel extraction, and attempts to dismantle DEI programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, providing automakers with more time to relocate production to the United States. Tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some of the cost of tariffs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of the value of a new car in the first year, phased out over two years. Automakers have welcomed the change.</p>

          <p>A pro-Palestinian demonstration took place in Brooklyn to condemn the verbal and physical assault on a woman by pro-Israel counterprotesters in Crown Heights. The protest was heavily monitored by police, who prevented the group from reaching the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters, the site of the initial incident. The protest was motivated by the attack on the woman, who said she was kicked, had objects thrown at her, and was subjected to sexist, racist, and anti-Arab abuse after wandering onto the scene of dueling protests triggered by a visit from Israeli official Itamar Ben-Gvir. The police are investigating the assault.</p>

Recognizing that weak domestic demand is a major drag on economic growth, Beijing has implemented countercyclical policies to boost consumption. Trump’s tariffs have further motivated China to become a large consumer market, utilizing fiscal and monetary policies, including a debt swap plan to help local governments manage debt and reduce interest rates.
