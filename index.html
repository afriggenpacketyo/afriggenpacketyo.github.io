          <p>The US government shutdown has entered its second week, with the Senate repeatedly failing to pass funding bills proposed by both Democrats and Republicans. Neither side secured the necessary 60 votes, exacerbating the political stalemate over federal spending. President Trump attributed the ongoing impasse to Democrats, while the White House cautioned about imminent layoffs for federal employees if a resolution is not found. This situation underscores deep divisions concerning healthcare provisions and overall budget allocations, leaving numerous federal workers in a state of financial uncertainty.</p>

The plan, gaining momentum with indirect talks, aims to end the war and secure releases, including those deceased, providing closure for families.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' lawyers have asked a judge to recommend his placement at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey, to serve his four-year, two-month sentence. The legal team cited the facility's residential drug treatment program as crucial for Combs to address substance abuse issues and maximize rehabilitative efforts. Combs was convicted of two prostitution-related charges, with his sentencing capping a federal case that exposed aspects of his private life. He has expressed a commitment to remaining drug-free and non-violent during his incarceration.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law requiring streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime to regulate commercial audio levels, preventing sudden volume spikes during ad breaks. This legislation extends existing federal regulations, which have applied to traditional television broadcasters since 2010, to the previously exempt streaming platforms. The bill, inspired by a legislative aide's experience with disturbing loud ads, aims to bring "peace and quiet" to households. Given California's influence, this state law could potentially set a national standard for streaming ad volumes.</p>

          <p>Indirect talks concerning a US-backed peace plan to end the Gaza war are set to continue in Egypt, with officials focusing on "creating the field conditions" for a hostage-prisoner exchange. President Trump expressed strong optimism, stating there's a "really good chance" for a lasting deal. The 20-point plan proposes an immediate ceasefire, release of 48 Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and significant aid, though Hamas's full disarmament and future governance role remain key sticking points.

          <h2>Nigerian State of Kano Implements Sweeping Ban on Chainsaw Usage to Combat Deforestation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nigerian state of Kano has enacted a law banning chainsaw usage for cutting or trimming trees, aiming to conserve natural resources and combat deforestation. State Commissioner Dahir Muhammad Hashim announced fines of 250,000 Nigerian naira ($168), potentially rising to 500,000 naira and imprisonment for repeat offenses. Enforcement will involve security agencies and community monitors. Commercial operators can apply for annual permits after inspections, with a requirement to plant two to three saplings for every tree removed. This initiative addresses the large-scale impact of deforestation on air quality and habitats.</p>

          <p>Pharmacists in England are encountering "major issues" with angry and frustrated patients due to tightened Covid booster eligibility criteria this year. Only individuals aged 75 and older or those with weakened immune systems are now offered free boosters, leading to a third to half of booked patients being turned away. Community Pharmacy England described the situation as "unacceptable," reporting instances of abuse towards staff. The NHS has since clarified website wording, but many patients, like 71-year-old Paul Williamson, express disappointment and feel it is a cost-cutting measure, considering private payment options.</p>

          <p>New research published in Environmental Research suggests a link between long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, a pollutant from mining fossil fuels, and an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study was prompted by a higher incidence of ALS patients in New Brunswick, Canada. Researchers compared ALS patients to healthy individuals, analyzing pollution levels at their residences and finding a 23% higher chance of ALS diagnosis for those exposed. While indicating association, not causation, the article emphasizes the need for further studies and improved regulatory intervention on air pollution.</p>

          <p>Phoney modelling agencies are increasingly targeting older individuals with scams, charging hundreds for fake portfolios and non-existent jobs. Judy Corker, 79, was tricked into paying £500 for professional images and was offered a fictitious cruise company job, illustrating how these schemes operate. Scammers often exploit the fashion industry's embrace of diverse looks and instruct victims to use payment options like PayPal's "friends and family," which lack buyer protection. Consumer protection advice emphasizes using "goods and services" options for all purchases to ensure refunds in case of fraud.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed bullish sentiment on Take-Two Interactive, forecasting a stock increase due to its "scarcity value" in the video game industry. With major competitors Activision and EA going private, Take-Two is now the sole publicly-traded American pure-play video game company. Cramer highlighted the anticipated May 2026 release of "Grand Theft Auto VI," expected to be a massive success, and the strong performance of other franchises like NBA 2K. He suggested any stock dips due to potential delays in GTA VI's release should be seen as buying opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Internet-famous librarian Mychal Threets is hosting the reboot of "Reading Rainbow," hoping his Latino heritage will shine on the show. Threets, who is Black, Mexican, and white, shared his background after audience requests for a Latino lead.

The reboot, which premiered last Saturday, retains its core mission of fostering a love for reading and features celebrity guests.

          <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has instructed its members to continue working during the US government shutdown, warning that job actions could lead to termination. This directive comes as some air traffic controllers are calling in sick, leading to slight increases in sick leave. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the potential for delays due to reduced staffing and expressed concern about worker morale from working unpaid. As essential workers, controllers are guaranteed back pay, but the situation highlights the significant stress and uncertainty faced by federal employees during the ongoing impasse.</p>

          <p>Parking in Los Angeles is set to become more expensive, with city leaders approving a 50-cent per hour increase across 35,000 metered spaces, effective by late October. Additionally, paid parking hours will be extended, with meters active until midnight in nightlife areas and until 8 p.m. elsewhere, including Sundays. City transportation officials argue these changes will encourage vehicle turnover, benefiting businesses by improving parking availability. The rate hikes and extended hours are also expected to generate $14.4 million for the city, which faces a nearly $1 billion budget shortfall.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized US District Judge Karin Immergut, his own appointee, after she temporarily blocked his deployment of federalized troops in Portland, Oregon. This incident highlights a growing tension as the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reviews multiple challenges to the president's authority to deploy the National Guard in US cities. Legal experts suggest Immergut's conservative ruling indicates limits to presidential deference, especially when actions appear "divorced from reality." Governors, including California's Gavin Newsom, are also pushing back, accusing the administration of infringing on state sovereignty and using military force for political ends.</p>

          <p>US District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment of 200 California National Guard members to Portland, Oregon. The Pentagon had reassigned these troops to support federal personnel, but Judge Immergut found no evidence that recent protests necessitated federalized military presence. She questioned whether this deployment circumvented her earlier decision denying Oregon's National Guard deployment, which she ruled risked state sovereignty and inflamed tensions. The Trump administration, through Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, called the ruling an "egregious violation of constitutional order" and plans to appeal.</p>
