          <p>After 23 years of roadworks and a Â£2 billion upgrade, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened. The 28-mile improvement project, initiated in 2002, aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while also planting 285,000 trees to offset its environmental impact. While some residents and officials laud the improved travel times and safety, others criticize the project's cost and delays, with the Welsh government planning to pay over Â£40m a year for 30 years to finance the final stretch of road.</p>

          <p>A sperm donor in Europe, used in at least 67 pregnancies, carried a rare cancer-causing mutation (TP53) linked to Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Ten of the conceived children have been diagnosed with cancer, including leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The European Sperm Bank confirmed the presence of the variant, stating it was undetectable by standard screening methods in 2008 and that the donor is currently healthy. Dr. Edwige Kasper suggests a European limit on births per donor, while the sperm bank advocates for an internationally binding family limit and has implemented its own limit of 75 families per donor.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that the world's population may be significantly higher than the United Nations' estimate of 8.2 billion, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions. The study found that UN estimates undercount the number of people living in rural areas by more than 50% due to incomplete census data in the global south. While some express concerns about overpopulation and its impact on resources, the article argues that anxieties about population growth often reflect power struggles over resource allocation and whose lives are valued. The article concludes that compromise and sharing are essential for managing the Earth's resources and ensuring a sustainable future.</p>

Participants strategize, build alliances, and vote each other off for the chance to win bragging rights.

          <p>Meta plans to automate up to 90% of its privacy and integrity reviews, replacing human evaluators with AI-driven systems. This shift aims to expedite product development but raises concerns about potential risks to user privacy and safety, including issues related to AI safety, youth risk, and the spread of falsehoods. While Meta claims that human expertise will still be used for complex issues, critics worry that engineers may lack the expertise to adequately assess privacy risks. The changes follow other recent decisions at Meta, such as ending its fact-checking program and loosening hate speech policies, reflecting a shift towards less restrained speech and faster app updates.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are raising concerns about the validity of President Trump's agreements with law firms, suggesting they resemble deals made under duress. These agreements, where firms commit to pro bono services in exchange for maintaining access to federal buildings and curtailing investigations, are being scrutinized for lacking a genuine meeting of the minds. Critics argue that the executive orders targeting these firms are unconstitutional and that the pro bono commitments lack clarity and specificity.

Leader Kim Jong Un has ordered the ship to be repaired swiftly, calling the incident a "criminal act." The damage to the ship, which was intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, has prompted a scramble to salvage the vessel and punish those deemed responsible.</p>

Ito-Yokado Co. and Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first retailers to offer the rice, setting a price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5-kilogram bag. The move aims to alleviate the impact of soaring rice prices on households, with the government releasing 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 through direct contracts with retailers. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this measure will effectively curb rice prices.</p>
