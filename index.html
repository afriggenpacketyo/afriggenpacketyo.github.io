          <p>Hundreds, including former President Joe Biden, gathered at Minneapolis' Basilica of St. Mary for the funeral of Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. They were tragically killed in their home in what is believed to be a politically motivated attack. Eulogies from Governor Tim Walz and friends remembered the couple for their dedication to public service, kindness, and the positive impact they had on Minnesota. The service honored their legacy of fierce but respectful engagement in politics and community life, urging others to follow their example of living with joy and purpose.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern over the increasing use of heated and dangerous rhetoric from politicians aimed at judges. Speaking at a judicial conference, he highlighted that such language can lead to serious threats and violence against members of the judiciary simply for performing their duties. Without naming individuals, he referenced past instances where he felt compelled to speak out against remarks from both Republican and Democratic leaders. Roberts urged political figures on both sides to be mindful of the potential consequences of their words on the safety of judges and the integrity of the judicial process.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are participating in a "virtual athletes' village," living together in close quarters while competing in domestic championships. This approach is designed to acclimate them to the unfamiliar and often challenging environments of an Olympic village, fostering resilience and teamwork. Officials and athletes, including medalist Tomoyuki Matsushita, noted the exercise was successful in building team morale and testing their ability to perform well under less-than-ideal conditions.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has renewed his strong opposition to President Trump's major tax and spending legislation, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" that would harm the nation. In a series of posts on X, Musk argued the bill would "destroy millions of jobs" by favoring outdated industries while damaging future-focused ones, calling it "political suicide" for Republicans. This reignites a conflict between Musk, who recently left an administrative role, and the Trump administration he previously supported with large donations. The criticism adds pressure on Senate Republicans as they struggle to pass the bill before a presidential deadline.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Belgrade, Serbia, clashing with police as they demanded an early election and the end of President Aleksandar Vucic's rule. The student-led demonstrations, the largest in recent months, saw riot police use tear gas and stun grenades, leading to dozens of arrests. The protests, which have been ongoing for months, were sparked by a deadly railway station roof collapse that critics attribute to government corruption. President Vucic has condemned the protests as a foreign plot to destabilize the country and has so far refused calls for a snap election.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As heatwaves become more common, urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than the surrounding countryside due to the "urban heat island" effect. This phenomenon occurs because dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, while cities have less cooling vegetation and water. This retained heat is slowly released, making cities several degrees warmer, especially at night, and exacerbating the health risks of extreme heat. With global populations increasingly concentrated in urban centers, this effect makes city dwellers particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and rising global temperatures.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez in Venice was met with protests by hundreds of local residents. Demonstrators marched through the city, arguing that the extravagant event highlights the exploitation of Venice, a city already struggling with the negative impacts of overtourism, high living costs, and environmental fragility. Critics view the spectacle as an affront to ordinary Venetians, and a donation by Bezos to local environmental groups was dismissed by some as an attempt to "clear his conscience." The protests contrasted sharply with the star-studded affair, reflecting deep-seated tensions over the city's future.</p>

The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, educates students on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen correctly. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life, and cases are projected to rise. The program, supported by the charity Melanoma Fund, aims to instill lifelong habits and empower children to take responsibility for their own skin protection from an early age.</p>

The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate, is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket.

The government had attempted to ban the march using a controversial "Child Protection" law, but the city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, enabled it to proceed. Many attendees, including those from the broader community beyond LGBTQ+ individuals, were reportedly motivated to join specifically because of the attempted ban.

Many Iranians fear the government is taking revenge on its own people, with security forces heavily patrolling streets. The crackdown includes new surveillance measures, creating what activists describe as a terrifying atmosphere of repression and a "systematic and rigid form of repression."</p>

          <p>An audio diary from Hanya Aljamal, a 28-year-old former teacher in Gaza, provides a poignant account of life during the ongoing war. Displaced multiple times and now living with her family in a tiny apartment, she describes the psychological toll of losing her identity, purpose, and control over her own life. Her diary captures the daily "psychological torture" of buzzing drones, the constant fear of explosions, and the profound malnourishment affecting the population. Amid the horror, she finds small acts of resistance and beauty, like a neighbor tending his garden or kites flying in the sky.</p>

The ceremony was the first major public funeral for the high-ranking officials killed in the conflict, which Iran claims was an Israeli campaign to destroy its nuclear program.

Although his workload is still limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, his performance was a major positive for the team. The outing demonstrated that his arm is responding well to the recovery process and that he could be an impactful pitcher for the remainder of the season.</p>

He highlighted that while the chip gap is substantial, Chinese companies like DeepSeek are achieving comparable results to top US firms with far less computing power. This suggests China is making significant strides by focusing on breakthroughs in algorithm engineering to overcome hardware constraints. (not investment advice)</p>
