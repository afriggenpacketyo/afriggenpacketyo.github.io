          <p>Millie Bright, a key defender for England's Lionesses, has announced her retirement from international football after a nine-year career with 88 caps. She was instrumental in the team's Euro 2022 victory and captained them to the World Cup final in 2023. Her decision reflects a transition period for the team, as younger defenders are emerging and securing spots. Bright will continue her club career, captaining Chelsea in domestic and international competitions.</p>

Obama emphasized that while taking a stand can be uncomfortable, it is essential for maintaining integrity and resisting being bullied into policy changes.</p>

          <p>In the contentious New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill has doubled down on her claim that her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, is "complicit" in thousands of opioid-related deaths. The accusation stems from Ciattarelli's past business ties to pharmaceutical-backed programs. Ciattarelli's campaign has vehemently denied the allegations, labeling them as defamatory and has pledged to file a lawsuit, calling the attack a desperate move in a high-stakes election.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House this week to discuss the ongoing war with Russia. The meeting follows recent phone conversations between the two leaders, where they reportedly discussed the potential U.S. approval for transferring Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. This move would significantly enhance Ukraine's ability to conduct counterattacks and is intended to increase pressure on Russia to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A significant step in the Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump was achieved as Hamas released all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. This development follows a ceasefire and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops, allowing more humanitarian aid to enter the territory after two years of war. World leaders are meeting in Egypt to discuss the fragile next steps, which include complex negotiations on Gaza's future governance and the disarmament of Hamas.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law that bans the sale of new Glock handguns in the state, citing concerns over their design which allows for easy modification into fully automatic weapons using a small device known as a "Glock Switch." The legislation does not prohibit the possession of currently owned Glocks or the resale of used ones. Proponents hope the law will compel Glock to redesign its firearms to prevent such modifications, though opponents argue it unfairly targets a popular manufacturer.</p>

          <p>While the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza is a significant first step, experts note that its vague language leaves many critical issues unresolved and open to interpretation. The plan lacks clear timelines and definitions for key elements such as the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops, the composition and authority of a proposed international stabilization force, and the specifics of Hamas's demilitarization. This ambiguity, while necessary to get both sides to agree, could lead to future breakdowns in negotiations and a potential return to conflict.</p>

          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 or older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, and they can generally remain in their home for the rest of their lives. The loan only becomes due when the borrower moves out permanently, sells the home, or passes away. However, homeowners must continue to live in the house as their primary residence and remain current on property taxes, homeowners insurance, and property maintenance to avoid triggering an early repayment.</p>

          <p>Detroit Lions defensive back Brian Branch is facing a possible suspension after striking Kansas City Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster in the face mask immediately after their game ended. Branch stated he was frustrated by what he felt was an uncalled illegal block during the game but admitted his post-game actions were "childish" and unacceptable. Detroit's head coach Dan Campbell condemned the behavior, apologized to the Chiefs, and confirmed it would not be tolerated by the team.</p>
