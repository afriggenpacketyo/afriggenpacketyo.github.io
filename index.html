          <p>A British-flagged luxury superyacht, the Bayesian, was successfully lifted from the seabed off Sicily after sinking in August 2024, resulting in the deaths of seven people, including British tech magnate Mike Lynch. The complex operation, led by TMC Marine, involved pumping seawater from the hull and securing it with steel lifting straps. The yacht, which was lying at a depth of 50 meters, was transported to Termini Imerese for further investigation into the cause of the sinking. Italian authorities are continuing their criminal investigation into the incident, which occurred during a violent storm as Lynch celebrated his acquittal on fraud charges. The upper decks of the Bayesian appeared badly damaged, and the blue hull was covered in mud after its time on the seabed. The captain and most of the crew survived the sinking, but the chef was among those who perished.</p>

          <p>Jobe Bellingham scored on his first start for Borussia Dortmund in a Club World Cup match, drawing inevitable comparisons to his brother Jude, who also scored in his debut for the club. The 19-year-old's goal came 45 minutes into the game against Mamelodi Sundowns, slightly later than Jude's debut goal in 2020. Jobe's goal showcased his anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness, as he timed his run perfectly and fired past the goalkeeper with a slight deflection. Despite the goal, Dortmund lost the match 4-3; however, Jobe's performance on his full debut demonstrated the skill he has been working on. His contribution and the comparison to his brother are sure to continue.</p>

          <p>At least three people died in North Dakota after severe weather, including tornadoes, swept across the region. The Cass County Sheriff's Office responded to a report of tornado damage in rural Enderlin, where storm chasers had already located two deceased individuals. A third deceased person was later found at another location. North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong declared a statewide disaster and activated the State Emergency Operations Plan. A long-lived destructive thunderstorm event, known as a "derecho," brought wind gusts up to 106 mph, with nine tornadoes reported and baseball-sized hail observed across the region.</p>

          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war saw further strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility in Isfahan, with Israel claiming to have destroyed centrifuge production sites. Iran's foreign minister warned against U.S. military intervention, while President Trump considers whether to get involved, setting a two-week timeframe for a decision. The conflict, which began on June 13, has resulted in hundreds of casualties on both sides, with Israel targeting nuclear and military sites and Iran retaliating with missile and drone attacks. The U.S. State Department confirmed that several U.S. citizens were lightly wounded in an Iranian missile strike, and B-2 stealth bombers are being moved to Guam.

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year, reaching 33.2C in Charlwood, as a Met Office yellow warning for thunderstorms came into effect. The humid weather has created unstable atmospheric conditions, raising the risk of localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert issued by the UK Health Security Agency remains in force until Monday, with research suggesting nearly 600 heat-related deaths could occur in England and Wales over the next four days. Passengers were evacuated from a train in south London due to a fault amid the high temperatures, and the National Fire Chiefs Council is urging caution with barbecues and flammable materials.</p>

          <p>A hot air balloon caught fire and crashed in Brazil's Santa Catarina state, resulting in at least eight fatalities and thirteen injuries. Two people were seen falling from the burning balloon in a video shared on social media. The company responsible for the balloon, Sobrevoar, stated that it complied with all regulations and had a clean accident record. According to the pilot, a fire started inside the basket, prompting him to lower the balloon and order passengers to jump, though some were unable to do so before the crash. The accident occurred in Praia Grande, a popular destination for hot air ballooning during June festivities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling struck down a policy change that could have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding, particularly in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The judge deemed the change arbitrary and capricious, arguing it was contrary to law. The policy change would have capped indirect costs for NSF awards to universities at 15%, a move that the University of California estimated would cost it nearly $100 million annually.</p>

          <p>Sen. Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rebuke of his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, calling it "shocking" and suggesting it was politically motivated. Reed argued that Trump's dismissal of Gabbard's assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon may be related to potential military action against Iran. He noted that if Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony, it should have been corrected immediately, rather than in response to Israeli actions. The senator is concerned about the politicization of intelligence assessments.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the Trump administration believes the National Guard is still necessary in Los Angeles, alleging that protests could re-emerge. During a visit, Vance also accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violence during protests related to immigration enforcement. He referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "JosÃ© Padilla," a move criticized as disrespectful by Bass and Newsom. The administration's stance on the National Guard deployment and Vance's misnaming of the senator have sparked controversy.</p>
