          <p>India's foreign ministry has defended its increasing imports of Russian oil, stating the purchases began only after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Responding to tariff threats from Donald Trump, India asserted it is being unfairly targeted, pointing out that both the U.S. and the EU continue to engage in significant trade with Russia. New Delhi emphasized that its oil imports are a matter of national interest to ensure affordable energy for its citizens and were previously encouraged by the U.S. to maintain global market stability.</p>

The company is maintaining its dividend policy, a key point of interest for investors, and its income is expected to be boosted by increased output as OPEC+ cuts are unwound.

          <p>A massive wildfire, known as the Gifford fire, is raging through California's Los Padres National Forest, having scorched over 72,000 acres and threatening at least 450 structures. As of Monday evening, the blaze was only 5% contained, with over 1,000 firefighters battling the flames in extremely challenging terrain. Hot, dry weather and potential "sundowner" winds are expected to exacerbate fire conditions, posing a significant threat to coastal communities in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. This significant legal step acts on long-standing claims by Donald Trump and his allies that the probe was a politically motivated conspiracy to undermine his campaign and presidency. The move follows a referral from the Director of National Intelligence and is expected to further inflame partisan divisions over the controversial investigation.</p>

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated dramatically as Governor Greg Abbott ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a GOP-backed redistricting plan. The move authorizes law enforcement to locate and return the absent members to the Capitol to establish a legislative quorum. While Texas authorities have no jurisdiction out of state, the order represents an unprecedented step in the high-stakes battle over congressional maps.</p>

          <p>Glass House Brands, a major California cannabis company, has announced a radical overhaul of its labor practices following a massive ICE raid last month that resulted in one worker's death and over 360 detentions. The company has terminated its relationship with the farm labor contractors who supplied its workforce and has hired a consulting firm led by a former ICE director to improve its employment eligibility verification. The raid had sent shockwaves through the state's legal cannabis industry, which operates in a gray area under federal law.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous and medical waste. The investigation found that corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials from UPS facilities were sent to landfills not equipped to handle them. As part of the settlement, which officials said UPS was cooperative in reaching, the company has implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California locations.</p>

          <h2>Nationwide Shortage of Volunteer Firefighters Threatens Community Safety</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the United States is creating a public safety crisis, particularly in smaller communities. Volunteers make up nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews and save taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually. However, their numbers have declined by over 20% since 1985 while emergency call volumes have tripled, leading to burnout and strained resources. Without new recruits, more towns may be forced to transition to fully paid departments, a move that would significantly increase costs for local taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Donald Trump praised the retailer's controversial advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump called the ad the "HOTTEST" out there and encouraged his followers to buy the jeans, contrasting the campaign with what he termed "woke" advertising by other brands. The presidential endorsement fueled a meme-driven rally for the financially challenged company, whose ad had previously drawn online criticism. (not investment advice)</p>
