          <p>SpaceX launched its Starship spacecraft on its ninth unmanned test flight from Starbase, Texas, achieving a suborbital trajectory. However, attitude control was lost several minutes into the mission, causing the spacecraft to spin due to a suspected propellant leak. Despite continuing with reentry, the vehicle's uncontrolled return led to expectations it would burn up, with potential debris landing in the Indian Ocean. This test was a crucial step in Elon Musk's vision to send humans to Mars, requiring Starship to demonstrate safe and reliable flight and return capabilities. The article notes that previous test flights also faced failures, with investigations leading to modifications for this launch.</p>

          <p>Investigators discovered seventeen bodies at an abandoned house in Irapuato, Guanajuato, a Mexican state plagued by cartel violence. The discovery was made using ground-penetrating radar and cadaver dogs, with knives, machetes, pickaxes, and shovels found at the scene. Five of the victims have been identified as missing persons, and their families are being informed. Guanajuato, an industrial hub and tourist destination, is also Mexico's deadliest state due to conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the Jalisco New Generation cartel.

Lau seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of her dignity and privacy, as well as continuous injuries and anxiety.

          <p>Six Flags Entertainment Corp. is laying off 135 employees across its California parks, including the presidents of Knott’s Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain, as part of a major restructuring. The company, which operates 42 amusement parks across North America, plans to reduce its staff by 10% following its $8-billion merger with Cedar Fair. These cuts come during a challenging period for Six Flags, which posted a net loss of $220 million in the first quarter, citing weather variability and economic uncertainty. The changes reflect a move toward a regional operating structure, rather than individual parks having their own presidents, with some park presidents being absorbed into other roles at the company.</p>

          <p>Nitrous oxide, commonly known as "laughing gas," is increasingly misused, leading to addiction and health risks. The rise of vaping has created a perfect delivery vehicle for the gas, exacerbating the problem. A report from America's Poison Centers found a 58% increase in reports of intentional exposure to nitrous oxide between 2023-2024. While possession of nitrous oxide has been criminalized in the UK, it remains legal to sell as a culinary product in many US states, contributing to its misuse, particularly among young people.</p>

The U.N. has called the GHF's work a "distraction" from the need to reopen crossings into Gaza and end Israeli restrictions on aid.

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a substantial decline in self-reported mental health among mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. Only about a fourth of moms report having "excellent" physical and mental health, with declines observed across all socioeconomic subgroups. Single female parents, those with lower educational attainment, and those with publicly insured children experienced significantly lower mental and physical health status. The study findings align with documented increases in depression and anxiety among pregnant and reproductive-aged women, suggesting maternal mortality may be a broader indicator of women's health.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced he would remove the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children and pregnant women, though the CDC has not yet updated its immunization schedule to reflect this. Kennedy's decision appears to shortcut the agency's advisory process and goes further than what the advisory panel had been considering. Experts warn that access to COVID-19 shots for children and pregnant women could become more difficult once Kennedy's changes are official. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists voiced frustration with Kennedy's move, warning that COVID infections during pregnancy "can be catastrophic."</p>

Groundwater is disappearing 2.4 times faster than surface water, with most losses occurring in the Lower Colorado River basin. Overpumping, largely for agriculture, is the main cause of groundwater depletion, and the effects of the climate crisis are expected to worsen the region's water shortages. The depletion of water storage in the Colorado River basin has sped up in the past decade, driven mostly by groundwater depletion in Arizona.</p>
