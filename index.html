          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 00:05:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CDC data indicates a marginal 1% increase in US births for 2024, totaling around 3.6 million, amidst a longer period of decline since the 2008 recession. Demographers urge caution in interpreting this as a trend reversal, pointing to ongoing economic challenges for families regarding housing and childcare costs. The report highlights shifts in birth rates among different demographics, with Hispanic and Asian women showing increases, while rates declined for Black, American Indian, and White women. The Trump administration is reportedly considering policies to encourage married heterosexual couples to have children, but experts doubt modest proposals will significantly impact fertility rates.</p>

          <p>Netflix's 'Stranger Things: The First Shadow' has officially premiered on Broadway, offering a prequel story set in 1959 Hawkins, before the events of the popular series. The production combines stage dynamism with cinematic fluidity, impressing with visual effects and technological prowess. However, the plot is criticized for being overstuffed, akin to squeezing an entire season into a single play, with gaps in narrative logic. Despite the script's shortcomings, the cast and design team create a mind-blowing funhouse experience, though a script doctor is needed to refine the narrative.</p>

          <p>The use of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services is growing among travelers to finance flights, hotels, and cruises, with companies like Klarna and Affirm reporting significant increases in travel bookings. A NerdWallet report indicates that nearly one in five American travelers plan to use BNPL for summer vacations. While BNPL can offer convenience, especially for last-minute deals, experts caution against overspending and accumulating debt, as missed payments can lead to late fees and credit score damage. Some BNPL companies, like Affirm, do not charge late fees and vet potential customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is urged to increase punishment for academic misconduct, which is seen as a significant threat to the nation's innovation efforts, according to an opinion piece in the People's Daily. Despite efforts to improve research integrity, misconduct remains frequent due to weak penalties. Academic dishonesty wastes resources, undermines fair competition, and damages China's international scientific reputation. The call for stricter measures comes as China accelerates its hi-tech drive amid increasing competition with the United States.</p>

          <p>Gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists visiting Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, resulting in multiple fatalities. The attack, described as unusually large-scale, has been condemned by world leaders, including President Trump and Prime Minister Modi, who vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. The region has been under a long-running insurgency, but attacks targeting tourists are rare. Security measures have been heightened, and investigations are underway.</p>

          <p>Campaigners argue that Instagram still presents significant risks to children, even with the introduction of Teen Accounts designed to provide greater protection. Researchers were able to create fake accounts with false birthdays and were subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. The 5Rights Foundation report highlights concerns about age verification, algorithms promoting harmful content, and the addictive nature of the app. Meta maintains that Teen Accounts have built-in protections to keep teens safe online.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing a challenging outlook due to the escalating US-China trade war and weaker government support. Producers are projected to trim capital expenditure, potentially shrinking the expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). The sector is also grappling with a price war caused by overproduction, leading to a decline in export prices. BESS are crucial for storing energy from renewable sources, with China and the US accounting for a significant portion of installed capacity.</p>
