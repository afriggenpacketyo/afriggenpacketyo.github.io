          <p>Marks & Spencer has announced that its online services will experience disruptions until July following a sophisticated cyberattack that occurred over the Easter weekend, impacting click-and-collect and contactless payments. The retailer estimates the attack will reduce profits by around £300 million this year. Despite the disruption, M&S CEO Stuart Machin stated there is no change to the company's long-term strategy to reshape M&S for growth, and the incident allows them to accelerate the pace of change. The cyberattack is believed to be the work of Scattered Spider, using illicit tools from DragonForce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer to encourage residents to use air conditioning without worrying about costs amid increasingly extreme heat. A supplementary budget bill of 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) will be submitted to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly to cover the costs. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that the measure aims to protect residents' lives and daily living, given declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving around 5,000 yen on their water bills over the four months.</p>

          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq has become the first author writing in the Kannada language to win the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp'. The collection features 12 short stories that capture the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India. Mushtaq shared the £50,000 prize with Deepa Bhasthi, who translated the stories into English. Mushtaq's work mirrors many of the challenges faced by the women in her stories, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society. She hopes her win will encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.</p>

          <p>Leanne Lucas, a survivor of the Southport stabbings that killed three children, is advocating for the use of blunt-tipped knives to reduce the risk of serious injuries. Lucas, a yoga instructor, said she experienced discomfort around knives in her own kitchen following the attack, inspiring her to launch the Let's Be Blunt campaign. She hopes to drive a cultural shift towards safer alternatives, comparing it to the ban on indoor smoking. The campaign aims to raise awareness and promote the use of blunt-tipped knives, which are considered just as effective for everyday cooking as traditional pointed knives.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House to address strained relations between the two countries.

Ramaphosa aims to correct Trump's misperceptions about race relations and policies in South Africa, while also safeguarding a vital free trade agreement. The meeting is viewed with anxiety in South Africa, but there is hope that Ramaphosa's diplomatic skills will help bridge the divide.</p>

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses operating in China report growing challenges due to regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and perceived depreciation of foreign firms in China’s evolving industrial policy. Despite these issues, British firms continue to demonstrate substantial engagement with, and commitment to, the Chinese market, according to the British Chamber of Commerce in China.

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage with a remark that he had never bought rice, the nation’s staple grain, because supporters gave him plenty. The comment highlighted the government’s inability to resolve a rice shortage that has driven up prices, frustrating urban voters ahead of parliamentary elections. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto’s resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister to contain the political fallout. The shortage has been attributed to policies protecting small-time farmers and blocking newcomers from buying agricultural land.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall “mega tsunami” could potentially devastate parts of America if a strong earthquake hits the Cascadia subduction zone, a fault stretching from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino, California. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, which could sink coastal land by as much as 6.5 feet. The most severe effects would be felt in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California, while Alaska and Hawaii are also vulnerable due to their seismic and volcanic profiles.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking controversy with a comment about not needing to buy rice because he receives it from supporters. The remark came as the public faces record-high rice prices, causing political trouble for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Eto apologized for the inappropriate comment and said it was not appropriate for him to stay in his position while officials work to lower rice prices. He was replaced by Shinjiro Koizumi. Ishiba acknowledged the rice price surge is likely a structural problem.</p>

          <p>Farm minister Taku Eto resigned after facing criticism for a remark about not buying rice, which struck a nerve with the public suffering from soaring rice prices, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ahead of a parliamentary election. Ishiba replaced Eto with Shinjiro Koizumi. Eto's departure comes as Ishiba prepares for a House of Councillors election, which is crucial for the ruling coalition. The controversy arose shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices.</p>

          <p>A pest control expert has warned that large numbers of rats are thriving on Queen's Quay, a popular riverfront walkway in Londonderry. The rats are enjoying a "five-star all-inclusive holiday" due to available food, water, and shelter. Derry City and Strabane District Council has implemented measures to disrupt the rats' transit routes, including removing some planters. Experts urge the public and businesses to avoid leaving food behind and to ensure bins are not overfilled to help control the infestation.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered seven shutout innings, but the Dodgers needed a 10th-inning rally to secure a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth, and Corbin Carroll's two-run homer in the 10th put the Dodgers on the brink of a fifth straight loss. However, the Dodgers rallied with an RBI double by Tommy Edman, intentional walks, and a hit by pitch, culminating in Max Muncy's sacrifice fly to win the game.

          <p>A new study reveals that high doses of radiation therapy, while used to target and destroy cancer cells, can paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre discovered that high doses of radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even when those tumors had not directly received radiation therapy. The research highlights the potential double-edged sword of radiotherapy and the need for further investigation.</p>

The test, developed by Fujirebio Holdings, will initially be available at research institutes and hospitals specializing in Alzheimer’s disease. The test detects amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, and offers a quicker and less expensive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests.

          <p>The world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate last year, with wildfires overtaking land clearances from agriculture as the main cause. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of pristine forests were lost, releasing 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases. The Amazon fared particularly badly amid record drought, raising concerns about its resilience and potential irreversible decline. However, South East Asia bucked the trend due to government policies enforcing "no burning" laws, demonstrating that concerted efforts can reduce forest loss.</p>
