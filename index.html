          <p>President Trump has escalated trade tensions by suggesting a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union due to stalled trade talks. This announcement marks a significant escalation in Trump's trade war with the EU, which currently has a 10% tariff on all goods being brought into America. The article also mentions a potential 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in the United States, impacting Apple and potentially increasing consumer costs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are adopting the concept of 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal time and interests over career advancement. This shift marks a departure from the traditional Japanese work ethic of long hours and unwavering company loyalty, with many younger employees now choosing to do the bare minimum required by their jobs. A study indicates that nearly half of Japanese workers are 'quiet quitters,' motivated by a desire for more 'me time' and a better work-life balance. This trend also reflects a disillusionment with the sacrifices made by previous generations, who often prioritized work at the expense of their personal lives.</p>

          <p>Left-leaning advocacy groups are lobbying against a Republican bill that proposes significant cuts to food and health benefits for low-income Americans to fund new Trump programs and extend tax cuts for the wealthy. The bill, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” faces opposition due to its controversial provisions, including cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would cut billions from Medicaid and food assistance while increasing the national debt. Critics argue that these cuts will disproportionately harm the poorest Americans and lead to devastating consequences.</p>

          <p>OpenAI employees are reportedly facing difficulties in donating their equity to charity despite the company's soaring valuation, which has turned many into paper millionaires. The company has allegedly deprioritized the issue, citing the need to maintain tight control over its shareholder base, which is complicated by its origins as a nonprofit. This has led to frustration among employees who wish to leverage their equity for philanthropic purposes, as donating equity can provide greater tax benefits compared to donating cash. While OpenAI has partnered with a donor-advised fund, the opportunities for equity donation have been limited and infrequent, causing discontent among its staff.</p>

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening strike action following a 4% pay rise offer, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems insufficient to address historical pay freezes. The National Education Union (NEU) also expressed potential dispute if the government doesn't fully fund the 4% pay rise for teachers. The BMA argues that doctors' pay remains significantly lower than it was years ago when adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, health unions reacted angrily after a smaller rise of 3.6% was announced for other NHS staff, including nurses, midwives and other front-line workers.</p>

Despite states and cities enacting new policies aimed at improving policing, data suggests that these changes have had limited impact on accountability or the number of killings by police officers. Killings by police officers have actually risen since Floyd's death, and racial disparities in police killings persist. Experts cite a lack of comprehensive reforms and a shift in public sentiment towards prioritizing crime reduction as reasons for the limited progress.</p>
