          <p>Authorities in Oregon have successfully apprehended a murder suspect who was mistakenly released from a Multnomah County jail, triggering a multi-day manhunt. The suspect, Ty Anthony Sage, was facing charges of second-degree murder and was denied bail, but was accidentally released due to a clerical error regarding a $5,000 bail amount. The local sheriff acknowledged the severe mistake, stating the victim's family deserved better and that a full review is underway to prevent future incidents. The recapture occurred at a gas station without incident, bringing a resolution to the search that had put the community and the victim's family on high alert.</p>

          <p>During an event at the White House, former President Donald Trump directed sharp criticism at Democratic Representatives Jasmine Crockett and Ilhan Omar. He referred to Rep. Crockett as a "very low IQ person" and questioned her fitness for Congress. Trump also recounted a joke he made to the leader of Somalia about "taking back" Rep. Omar, who was born in Mogadishu. These remarks were made while signing executive orders, diverting from the policy agenda to target members of the progressive "Squad." The comments represent a continuation of his often personal and inflammatory rhetoric against political opponents.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered an exceptionally rare and large gathering of hundreds of high-ranking U.S. military generals and admirals at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. The purpose of the last-minute meeting has not been disclosed, causing speculation among officials. This event follows Hegseth's recent directives to reduce the number of four-star officers by 20% and his removal of 15 senior military leaders. The unusual size and scope of the meeting, which includes commanders from the one-star level and higher, have raised questions about its connection to the ongoing restructuring of military leadership.</p>

          <p>As China formulates its 15th five-year plan, analysts anticipate a major focus on strengthening its supply chain resilience and addressing vulnerabilities in high-technology sectors. Despite its dominant manufacturing ecosystem, exemplified by its crucial role in producing components for products like Apple's iPhone, China faces chokepoints in key tech areas. The new development blueprint is expected to prioritize moving up the value chain and securing greater self-sufficiency. This strategy aims to solidify its global manufacturing leadership amidst ongoing domestic economic shifts and external pressures like trade tensions with the U.S.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has compared the economic proposals of Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss, calling them a potential "disaster for working people." Burnham, who is seen as a potential leadership challenger, suggested a 50p top income tax rate and tax cuts for lower earners, fueling speculation about his ambitions.

          <p>In a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, several shale oil executives anonymously expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's policies are harming the industry. They argue that his push for lower crude oil prices, combined with tariffs that increase costs, creates uncertainty and discourages investment. One executive stated the "U.S. shale business is broken," citing a conflict between the administration's desire for cheap oil and the economic realities of production. This sentiment contrasts with Trump's public pro-fossil fuel stance and his administration's claims of reducing regulatory burdens. (not investment advice)</p>

Even President Trump has endorsed shooting down Russian aircraft that violate allied territory.

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating pressure in government funding negotiations by directing federal agencies to prepare for large-scale firings in the event of a shutdown. An Office of Management and Budget memo instructed agencies to plan for a "reduction in force," a more severe step than the typical furloughs of non-essential workers. This move, which Democrats have labeled an intimidation tactic, raises the stakes in the partisan dispute over a short-term spending bill. The conflict centers on Democratic demands to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies, which Republicans want to handle separately from the funding bill.</p>

Officials indicated that the outage was caused by an accidental fiber cut and that there was no evidence of a malicious attack.

Analysts suggest that President Trump's tariff announcements and the looming expiration of federal EV tax credits have prompted many buyers to purchase vehicles sooner than planned. This pull-ahead effect has boosted sales for major automakers like General Motors and Toyota so far this year. However, the sales pace is expected to slow in the fourth quarter as these incentives disappear and tariff costs are integrated into vehicle pricing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of used-car retailer CarMax plummeted 20% on Thursday after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The stock closed at its lowest point since March 2020. The company's CEO described the quarter as "challenging," citing difficult market conditions, a pull-ahead in sales due to tariff fears, and depreciation of its vehicle inventory. The disappointing results from CarMax, often seen as an industry barometer, also led to a drop in the stock prices of other major auto retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has announced a major overhaul that includes closing an unspecified number of underperforming stores and eliminating 900 non-retail jobs, costing the company $1 billion. The plan is part of a strategy to revitalize the coffee chain as it faces slowing sales and increased competition. The closures will target locations where the company cannot create its desired customer environment or achieve financial targets, resulting in a net 1% decrease in its North American store count. Among the closures is the prominent Capitol Hill Roastery in Seattle, though five other global Roasteries will remain open.</p>

Authorities found notes at the residence of the suspect, Joshua Jahn, indicating a high degree of planning and a desire to "maximize lethality against ICE personnel." The suspect legally purchased the rifle used in the attack and used a ladder to access a rooftop vantage point. Officials stated that while his rhetoric was definitively anti-ICE, there is no evidence linking him to any specific organized group.</p>

          <p>The White House has released new architectural renderings providing a more detailed look at the 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently under construction in the East Wing. The project, announced by the Trump administration in July, will have a seated capacity for 650 guests, making it significantly larger than the main White House building. The administration has stated that the construction will be funded by private donors and the president himself, with nearly $200 million already pledged by various corporate and individual donors.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has fallen to 7.88%, a significant drop in just one week. With U.S. homeowners holding a record $17.8 trillion in collective home equity, this makes HELOCs an increasingly affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are positioned to become even cheaper if the Fed continues to cut rates as expected later this year. This provides homeowners with a flexible and cost-effective way to access funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis warns that U.S. health-care providers could lose over $32 billion in revenue if the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits are allowed to expire at the end of the year. The report also projects an additional $7.7 billion in uncompensated care costs from newly uninsured patients. These subsidies, which lower insurance costs for millions, are a central point of contention in the current government shutdown fight, with Democrats insisting on their extension. If the credits lapse, average premiums could rise by 75%, leading to widespread coverage losses and significant financial strain on the healthcare system. (not investment advice)</p>
