          <p>During commemorations for the 35th anniversary of German reunification, top European leaders warned that liberal democracy is under attack from both internal and external forces. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that "new alliances of autocracies are forming against us," while President Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed concern over the declining support for the political center, especially in eastern Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron echoed these sentiments, calling for a European "resurgence" to defend democratic values against extremism and conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>The German government's plan to increase deportations of rejected asylum-seekers is facing significant obstacles, with thousands of flights being canceled. According to Federal Police Chief Dieter Romann, approximately 33,600 deportations were aborted last year because individuals went into hiding or provided last-minute medical excuses before they could be detained. Romann identified a severe lack of detention centers as a major impediment, noting there are fewer than 800 spots for over 226,000 people required to leave the country.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has urged a calm and sober response to recent drone sightings over airports, stating they have not posed a concrete threat so far. He emphasized that while drone defense is improving, the Bundeswehr cannot be deployed everywhere, and police forces must build their own capabilities. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has proposed a joint drone defense unit to address what he calls an "arms race," highlighting that many drone incidents, potentially linked to Russia, are provocations rather than direct threats.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to give police forces broader authority to manage and place conditions on recurring protests. Under the new powers, senior officers can consider the "cumulative impact" of previous demonstrations, potentially redirecting events if a location has been repeatedly targeted. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood clarified that this is not a ban but a measure to balance the right to protest with community safety, particularly citing recent concerns within the Jewish community about feeling intimidated.</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains in Nepal have triggered devastating landslides, lightning, and flash floods, resulting in the deaths of at least 22 people with 12 others still missing. The eastern Ilam district was the most affected, where 18 fatalities occurred after entire villages were swept away. Rescue efforts are being hampered by continuous rainfall and blocked roads, while major highways connecting the capital, Kathmandu, have been shut down.

          <p>Syrians are participating in the first parliamentary elections since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, though the process is not a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat People's Assembly will be chosen by electoral colleges, with the remaining third appointed directly by the interim president. The interim authorities cited the impossibility of creating an accurate voter registry due to mass displacement from the civil war as the reason for this system.

          <p>Despite recent sales growth, the United States remains a laggard in the global electric vehicle market compared to Europe and China. Analysts attribute this slower adoption to weaker government support, higher average costs for EVs, and the recent expiration of a significant $7,500 tax credit. While automakers like GM and Ford reported record EV sales, they now anticipate a sharp decline in demand without the subsidy. The situation is compounded by high tariffs that have kept more affordable Chinese EV models out of the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Support Grows for Civil Commitment to Address Homelessness and Mental Illness</h2>

          <p>A policy idea championed by President Trump, which involves using civil commitment to force homeless individuals with severe mental illness or addiction into medical care, is gaining traction among some Democrats. States like Oregon, California, and New York have moved to expand the use of this legal process, reflecting a growing public frustration with the homelessness crisis. While advocates argue it can be a crucial intervention for people unable to help themselves, critics and civil liberties groups express alarm at the potential for over-institutionalization and removing personal freedoms.</p>

          <p>The White House is sending senior envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to Egypt to help finalize details for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. The diplomatic push comes as President Trump stated "we are very close" to an agreement and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope of bringing all hostages home in the coming days. Hamas has reportedly accepted key parts of Trump's peace proposal, though further negotiations are required on critical issues like disarmament, and Israeli strikes in Gaza have continued despite the talks.</p>
