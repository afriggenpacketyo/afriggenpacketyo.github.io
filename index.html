          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face a significant challenge in finding qualified money managers. The article highlights that trust is a key criterion for family offices, often overshadowing other qualifications. This talent crunch is exacerbated by competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds, along with a reluctance from younger employees due to the perceived lack of structure and career progression. Family offices are responding by offering higher compensation packages and incentives to attract and retain talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government's plan to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers is raising concerns among businesses about potential labor shortages, particularly in sectors like health and social care. The proposals include stricter English-language requirements and higher skill thresholds for work visas. Business leaders fear that British workers may not be able or willing to fill the gap, as these sectors are heavily reliant on migrant staff. The government aims to link migration policy with skills to boost economic growth and end the "failed experiment in open borders."</p>

          <p>Iranian officials have proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The plan involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from multiple countries providing oversight. While the U.S. has denied that the proposal was discussed, Iranian officials claim it would be a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced their first monthly decline since October 2024, falling to an average of $5.12 per dozen in April, down from a record $6.23 in March.

Despite the recent decrease, egg prices are still 79% higher than they were a year ago. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing to combat bird flu, and the U.S. has increased egg imports from other countries.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has defended his decision to accept a $400 million jumbo Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar, citing delays in Boeing's production of the new Air Force One fleet. Trump argues that the U.S. should accept the gift, especially since the plane is offered to the Department of Defense for defending Qatar for many years. He states the current Air Force One is nearly 40 years old and less impressive compared to planes in other countries. Trump intends to retire the plane to the presidential library once the new Air Force One fleet is delivered.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Uganda have observed wild chimpanzees using medicinal plants to treat open wounds and other injuries, both on themselves and occasionally on each other. Researchers from the University of Oxford, working with a local team in the Budongo Forest, documented the animals dabbing plants on wounds or chewing them and applying the material to injuries. The study builds on previous findings that chimps self-medicate by eating certain plants. This research adds to the growing evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild, suggesting a capacity for empathy among chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>A UNICEF report indicates that children in Japan continue to suffer from poor mental health, ranking 32nd among 43 developed and emerging nations due to high suicide rates. While Japan improved from 37th in 2020, the suicide rate among Japanese youth remains the fourth highest among wealthy states surveyed. In contrast, Japan ranks first in physical health and 12th in academic and social skills. Experts suggest there is a lack of awareness about children's mental health issues in Japan, and government measures have been ineffective.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding after recent fighting, with weapons from China playing a crucial role in Pakistan's defenses. China is Pakistan's biggest weapons supplier, accounting for 81% of its arms imports from 2020 to 2024. Key Chinese weapons used by Pakistan's military include the Chengdu J-10C Vigorous Dragon fighter jet, considered the most upgraded version of the J-10 series, equipped with advanced radar and compatible with advanced Chinese munitions.</p>

          <p>Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg suggested that Joe Biden running for a second term as president was "maybe" a mistake. Speaking after a town hall in Iowa, Buttigieg acknowledged that "with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that is the case." Buttigieg's comments follow Biden's decision to drop out of the race after a poor debate performance against President Trump. Buttigieg also addressed speculation about his own potential presidential run in 2028, remaining coy about his future plans.</p>

          <p>As President Trump reduces funding for American research institutions and restricts research topics, other countries are actively seeking to attract displaced or disenchanted talent. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has described this as a “once-in-a-century brain gain opportunity.” The European Union announced it would spend an additional 500 million euros to attract researchers, with France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Britain, Canada, Portugal, Austria, and Australia also offering incentives to lure American researchers. These countries are touting academic freedom, social security, and quality of life as key selling points.</p>

The U.S. messaging, which equated India and Pakistan and offered to mediate on bilateral issues, has made Indian political leaders vulnerable, leading to questions about India's closer relationship with the U.S.</p>
