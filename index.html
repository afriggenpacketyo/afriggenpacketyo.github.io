          <p>YouTube's popular child educator Rachel Accurso, known as Ms. Rachel, and her husband Aron have released a new book titled "Ms. Rachel and Bean and the Bedtime Routine." Drawing from their own parenting experiences, the book aims to provide families with tools and models to establish effective nighttime routines. The couple emphasizes that routines help children feel safe and secure, admitting that while they strive to implement these strategies with their own kids, they sometimes face the same struggles as any other parent. The book incorporates ideas they found helpful, such as using a visual checklist.</p>

          <p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly responded to claims from David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, that the company promotes a 'woke' agenda and engages in regulatory capture. Amodei stated that Anthropic's policy goals, such as ensuring AI benefits Americans and maintaining a U.S. lead in the field, are aligned with the Trump administration. He clarified that the company prefers a uniform federal approach to AI regulation over a patchwork of state laws, pushing back against Sacks' criticism that Anthropic was backdooring regulations through states like California. The dispute highlights the ongoing political debate surrounding AI development and safety.</p>

          <p>Lord Bracadale has resigned as the chairperson of the public inquiry into the 2015 death of Sheku Bayoh, who died after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy, Fife. The resignation follows a judicial review motion from the Scottish Police Federation (SPF), which questioned his impartiality due to private meetings held with Mr. Bayoh's family. Lord Bracadale stated that it became clear many core participants had lost confidence in his leadership, which he felt would damage public trust in the inquiry's final report. He expressed hope that a new chair could be appointed swiftly to restore confidence.</p>

          <p>Following a bold daylight robbery of French crown jewels from the Louvre museum, a criminology expert predicts that authorities will likely apprehend the suspects but probably never recover the priceless artifacts. The thieves left behind significant DNA evidence, including on a crown they dropped during their escape, which could lead to their identification. However, experts believe the historically significant jewels, worth millions, will be broken up and sold on the black market. The incident has been labeled a national embarrassment, highlighting major security vulnerabilities at the world-renowned museum, including a lack of camera coverage in many rooms.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested 66-year-old Joseph Sunday in connection with a deadly hit-and-run that occurred at a child's birthday party in Bladensburg, Maryland. The suspect allegedly reversed his car into a party tent set up on a front lawn, killing 31-year-old Ashley Hernandez Gutierrez and injuring 13 others, including eight children. After fleeing the scene on foot, Sunday later surrendered to authorities and now faces charges of negligent manslaughter and leaving the scene of a fatal accident. An investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the crash, including whether impairment was a factor.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has ruled that top officials, including Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, can be deposed regarding the use of chemical agents during immigration enforcement operations. The decision came after agents deployed tear gas during two incidents, which may have violated a temporary restraining order the judge had previously issued against using such crowd control devices on non-threatening individuals. The judge expressed concern over a lack of oversight and accountability within the agencies, as no agents had been disciplined for potential use-of-force violations during the enforcement campaign known as "Operation Midway Blitz."</p>

Research from sociologist Jennifer Glass shows that factors like partnership, income, and education significantly improve happiness for parents. The article suggests that the struggles of all parents, regardless of income, point to the need for more robust, family-friendly social policies rather than a simple conclusion about which group has it harder.</p>

          <h2>Americans Worry About Rising Health Insurance Costs if ACA Subsidies Expire</h2>

          <p>With enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies set to expire at the end of 2025, some Americans are expressing deep concern about their ability to afford health insurance. The subsidies, which were expanded during the pandemic, significantly lower monthly premiums for those on the marketplace. A recent analysis found that premium payments could more than double if the credits are not extended, forcing families to choose between less comprehensive plans or forgoing insurance altogether. The issue has become a sticking point in government shutdown negotiations, leaving many feeling anxious and unable to budget for their future healthcare needs.</p>

          <p>Nashville Police have arrested an 18-year-old in connection with the fatal shooting of 16-year-old Justin Robinson at Madison Park in June 2024. The suspect, who was 17 at the time of the incident, is being charged in juvenile court with criminal homicide. Police believe the shooting stemmed from an argument between two rival groups from a local high school. The arrest was made at the same park where the shooting occurred, and the suspect was found to be armed at the time. Robinson's death was one of several teen killings that prompted the creation of Nashville's Office of Youth Safety.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates, with adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share on $12.41 billion in revenue. Despite the strong financial results, which caused shares to climb, the company noted that consumer demand remains soft but is showing signs of improvement. Unit case volume rose by 1% globally, but was flat in key markets like North America and Latin America, with executives pointing to pinched spending among low-income consumers. The company reiterated its full-year forecast, expecting continued organic revenue growth and a slight rise in earnings per share.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat have skyrocketed, surging 47% on Tuesday after a massive 127% jump on Monday. The rally was triggered after the stock was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a significant short squeeze, as over 63% of the company's float had been sold short. A new deal to expand distribution with Walmart also contributed to the momentum. The dramatic turnaround for the former penny stock, which had been underperforming for years, is seen by some as a potential sign of a frothy, speculative market.</p>
