          <p>An investigation into lead poisoning at a kindergarten in China's Gansu province has been escalated to the national level. The State Council, the country's cabinet, will now oversee the probe alongside provincial leaders and experts from national health and environmental ministries. The case gained prominence after it was discovered that local tests failed to identify the issue, with the kindergarten's staff suspected of using inedible, lead-based paint to color food. Eight people, including the principal, have been detained.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland recording their warmest days so far. Amber heat health alerts are active for several regions in England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The extreme heat has prompted hosepipe bans for millions and led to wildfire warnings, with active blazes in Surrey and Perth. While temperatures are expected to cool and bring rain early next week, the event highlights the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves linked to climate change.</p>

          <p>A new study offers initial evidence that China's large dams on the Brahmaputra river in Tibet may not cause the droughts in India that were previously feared. By analyzing data from two existing dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that downstream water flow during the dry season has actually increased. Specifically, low flows in February were observed to be up by more than 50%, suggesting the dams help regulate the river by storing water during wet seasons and releasing it during dry periods. This finding provides a new perspective on the potential transboundary water impacts of China's dam projects.</p>

The goal is to produce a vegan alternative that more closely mimics the taste and texture of traditional cheese, addressing a common criticism of current plant-based options. However, these companies face significant hurdles, including high initial production costs, regulatory approval processes for "novel foods," and a recent decline in the plant-based market. Success will depend on their ability to scale production, lower prices, and convince consumers to try their innovative products.</p>

          <p>After learning from her dying father about a brother given up for adoption decades earlier, a Norfolk woman successfully tracked him down in Australia. The siblings, who discovered they shared many similarities and that their parents had married on his birthday, connected emotionally over FaceTime. Their reunion took on a new urgency when, just a month after their first contact, the brother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. This prompted his sister to travel to Australia to support him through his treatment, allowing them to make precious memories together after a lifetime apart.</p>

          <p>Two individuals who were wrongly arrested and publicly accused of felling the iconic Sycamore Gap tree have spoken out about the intense harassment and scrutiny they faced. A former lumberjack, Walter Renwick, and a 16-year-old boy were subjected to online trolling and media attention after their arrests, despite having no connection to the crime. The case highlights the dangers of trial by social media, as amateur sleuths quickly spread their names and photos online. Both were eventually cleared, and two other men have since been convicted for the act of vandalism.</p>

          <p>A music festival in southern Italy is drawing widespread criticism for inviting Russian conductor Valery Gergiev to perform, marking a potential return to European stages for the artist. Gergiev, a known ally of Vladimir Putin, has been largely barred from performing in Europe since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine due to his refusal to condemn the war. While the regional leader defended the invitation by stating culture should be separate from politics, a European Parliament vice-president and Ukrainian activists have condemned the move, calling Gergiev a "cultural mouthpiece for Putin." The controversy highlights the ongoing debate over the role of pro-Kremlin artists in the international cultural scene.</p>

          <p>Britain's remaining steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are grappling with a precarious future as the industry faces decline, plant closures, and the threat of US tariffs. The potential for a 25% tariff on UK steel exports to the US adds to the anxiety in communities that have historically relied on steelmaking for their identity and employment. While some former workers have transitioned to new careers, there is widespread concern about the loss of skilled, well-paying jobs. The situation has sparked a debate about whether to invest in reviving a greener steel industry or pivot these towns toward new sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the vital Rubaya coltan mine in eastern DR Congo, which has been under the control of M23 rebels since April of last year. The mine, a key source for a mineral essential in mobile phones, employs thousands of local miners who work in difficult conditions for low pay. An M23-appointed supervisor claimed the rebel group has brought security and organization to the site, which is a major source of revenue for them through taxation. The visit comes amid a fragile peace process, with the US showing interest in the region's mineral rights as a component of the negotiations.</p>

This shift in consumption habits allows viewers to keep up with the drama without committing to the daily hour-long episodes.

As search efforts for the dozens still missing continue, officials are facing scrutiny over the timeliness and effectiveness of their emergency warnings to residents and camps in the flood-prone area.

The announcement is part of a broader, aggressive trade strategy that has seen the administration issue new tariff conditions on numerous countries, disrupting long-standing global trade norms.
