          <p>General Motors has adjusted its 2025 financial guidance, projecting a decrease in net income and adjusted automotive free cash flow due to potential tariff exposure of up to $5 billion. Despite this adjustment, GM CEO Mary Barra emphasized the company's underlying strength and ongoing efforts to adapt to the changing trade policy environment. GM is working to strengthen its supply base and enhance EV profitability, Barra noted a 27% increase in U.S. sourced parts, indicating a shift towards domestic production. The company is also planning to leverage existing U.S. assembly plants to efficiently add capacity and reinvest in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Millions of American households are burdened by credit card debt, with total balances exceeding $1.21 trillion. Experts recommend several steps to avoid defaulting, including contacting credit card issuers to negotiate payment plans or hardship programs. It is also crucial to stop using the card to prevent further debt accumulation and create a simple personal budget to track expenses and payment deadlines. Credit counseling and debt consolidation loans can provide additional support for managing overwhelming debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported first-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed expectations, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes medications, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mounjaro revenue increased by 113% to $3.84 billion, while Zepbound sales reached $2.31 billion. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges associated with its acquisition of an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks noted the company is already investing in U.S. manufacturing in response to potential tariffs, and supports permanent lower tax rates for domestic production.</p>

          <p>Local elections in England are set to provide the first major gauge of the political landscape since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party gained power.

The main opposition Conservative Party, led by Kemi Badenoch, also faces challenges in regaining lost ground. Voters will elect over 1,600 council members and six regional mayors, with results expected to reveal the extent of voter discontent and the potential rise of smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.</p>

Biden's attorneys withdrew as counsel a month prior, and the Justice Department had been investigating Biden for tax crimes before the whistleblowers came forward. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in September 2024, admitting to failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes, and was later granted a sweeping pardon by his father, President Joe Biden.</p>

          <p>A spring heatwave in the UK is expected to significantly affect plant life, both indoors and outdoors.

Outdoor plants will need more frequent watering, especially newly planted ones, while trees face potential stress due to soil moisture deficits.

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has implemented several policies that favor the U.S. meat industry, often at the expense of the environment, animal welfare, and worker safety. These include speeding up slaughter lines, rolling back food safety measures, and gutting animal welfare research. While tariffs have negatively impacted exports, the administration has also increased poultry industry bailouts and restricted language about agricultural pollution. These actions align with a broader trend of anti-regulation conservatism, raising concerns about the social and environmental costs of meat production.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda stated that the central bank remains committed to additional interest rate hikes, despite economic uncertainties stemming from U.S. tariffs. The BOJ revised down its growth and inflation outlooks, factoring in the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. While acknowledging the difficulty in fully reflecting tariff effects in projections, Ueda emphasized that potential shifts in U.S. trade policy could influence the timing of the next rate hike. The BOJ maintained its short-term policy interest rate at around 0.5 percent.</p>

          <p>A 10-foot great white shark stranded in shallow water off the coast of Ardrossan, South Australia, was rescued by three local men, aided by an 11-year-old boy and his father. The rescuers used crab rakes to move the distressed shark into deeper water, where it hopefully swam away. Wildlife scientists suggest shark strandings, though uncommon, are becoming more visible through social media. Authorities advise prioritizing human safety and contacting environmental authorities if such incidents occur.</p>

Tesla chair Robyn Denholm stated the report was "absolutely false" and that the board has confidence in Musk's ability to execute the company's growth plan.

The lack of regulation and the speculative nature of crypto make it vulnerable to manipulation and scams, potentially leading to a financial crisis similar to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis.</p>
