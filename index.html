          <h2>Trump to Issue Executive Order on National Standards for College Athlete Compensation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 23:07:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is planning to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows a House subcommittee's advancement of a bill intended to supersede the patchwork of state laws currently governing student-athlete compensation. The action addresses the massive financial shift in college sports since 2021, when the NCAA began allowing athletes to profit from endorsements after facing significant legal and political pressure. The executive order aims to bring federal oversight to this rapidly evolving and lucrative landscape.</p>

          <p>The nomination of self-proclaimed Democratic socialist Zorhan Mamdani for New York City mayor is causing significant friction within the Democratic Party. Moderate Democrats in key swing districts fear his progressive platform could alienate voters, while Republicans see an opportunity to brand the entire party as radical. The situation highlights the ongoing ideological struggle within the party, as prominent leaders have yet to endorse Mamdani while facing pressure from the party's left wing. This internal conflict could significantly impact crucial House races in New York.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia, which he states includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports into the U.S. and tariff-free access for American goods into Indonesia. The deal also reportedly includes commitments for Indonesia to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as Boeing aircraft. However, the Indonesian government has not yet officially confirmed these terms, creating some uncertainty around the finality of the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of individuals convicted of violent crimes, including murder and sexual assault, to the African nation of Eswatini. The deportees, originally from countries like Cuba and Vietnam, were sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to accept their return. This action is part of a broader, controversial administration policy of using third-party countries for deportations, a practice that has faced significant legal and humanitarian challenges. The move was facilitated by a recent Supreme Court decision that expedites such deportations.</p>

          <p>President Trump successfully intervened after a group of 13 House Republicans unexpectedly joined Democrats to block a procedural vote on several cryptocurrency regulation bills. Following a meeting at the White House, Trump announced that the holdouts had agreed to reverse their position and would now support the legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation. This quick turnaround highlights the president's significant influence over the Republican conference, and the initial failure of the vote had caused a temporary dip in crypto-linked stocks.

          <p>Central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are increasingly buying gold directly from local mines rather than on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. It is also often cheaper and supports the domestic mining industry. This trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire to hedge against geopolitical and financial risks.

          <p>On his show, Jim Cramer highlighted the unpredictable nature of the stock market during corporate earnings season, describing the experience as "terrifying" for investors. He pointed to the recent performance of several major companies to illustrate his point. Cramer celebrated correctly anticipating a surge in Nvidia's stock following positive news but expressed disappointment with the market's negative reaction to earnings reports from BlackRock and Wells Fargo. He cautioned that even with strong fundamentals, investor sentiment during earnings season can lead to unexpected and immediate stock movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having a strong alibi and evidence suggesting his innocence, including shaky witness testimony. His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022. The settlement resolves his civil lawsuit, which alleged that sheriff's detectives had failed to disclose evidence pointing to another suspect.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education, an expert from a conservative-leaning think tank weighed in on the impacts. Michael Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute noted that while the department will likely be smaller, it won't be eliminated entirely by the president. He argued that the most significant cuts have targeted the Office for Civil Rights and the Financial Aid Office, which could impact discrimination complaint processing. However, he believes most students and teachers will not feel the effects directly.</p>

          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be retitled as "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid safety concerns, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. While patient advocates welcome the clarity, the British Medical Association argues the review should have gone further.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the iron structure, and carefully relocating 1,300 tropical plants. A key goal of the project is to make the building net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. The renovation is necessary due to the toll the building's hot, humid internal climate has taken on its Victorian-era structure.</p>

The ASA also found a claim about "0g added sugar" to be inaccurate. The company has been ordered not to run the ad again and to cease making claims that its drinks can treat disease.</p>

Smith accused Cameron of treating the fundamental constitutional question like "some sort of Eton game" and said it was "unforgivable" not to have a clear plan for either outcome. He argued that the failure to foresee major issues, such as the Northern Ireland border, led to years of political disaster and polarization. The comments reflect ongoing internal Conservative party tensions over the legacy and consequences of the decision to leave the European Union.</p>

The retrial, granted based on evidence of torture during the original investigation, re-examines a pivotal and deeply polarizing moment in the nation's history.

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, claiming the California Democrat misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper home loan. Schiff vehemently denied the allegation, calling it a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and an effort to distract from the controversy over the Epstein files. A spokesperson for Schiff stated that he has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and the Washington D.C. area and has followed all laws. This represents a significant escalation in the long-running political feud between Trump and one of his most prominent critics.</p>
