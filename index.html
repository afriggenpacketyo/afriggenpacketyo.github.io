          <h2>Report Alleges Treasury Secretary Bessent Made Mortgage Claims Similar to Those Used Against Fed's Cook</h2>

          <p>A report from Bloomberg indicates that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once designated two different properties as his "principal residence" on the same day in 2007. This situation draws parallels to the allegations of mortgage fraud President Trump cited in his attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. While mortgage experts suggest no wrongdoing by Bessent, as the lender was aware of the properties' status, the report highlights the political context surrounding the Trump administration's scrutiny of Fed officials. Bessent's lawyer has dismissed the report as nonsensical.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts suggest that opening a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) could still be an advantageous move for savers. Although rates on savings products are expected to decline, locking in a current high-rate, long-term CD can protect against potential future rate cuts and guarantee returns in an unpredictable economy. For example, a $10,000 investment in a multi-year CD could still yield over a thousand dollars in interest, providing a stable earning opportunity amidst economic uncertainty.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has reduced its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, marking the first rate cut of the year and during President Trump's second term. The decision aims to address a slowing labor market, despite a recent uptick in inflation, creating a challenging economic situation often referred to as "stagflation." The move follows a prolonged pressure campaign from President Trump for the central bank to lower borrowing costs, and comes amid his efforts to reshape the Fed's board, including the recent confirmation of adviser Stephen Miran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut is expected to have a mixed effect on household finances, offering relief to some borrowers while potentially reducing returns for savers. Consumers with variable-rate products like credit cards may see their interest payments decrease, though rates will remain historically high. While the cut has been priced into mortgage rates, a series of future cuts could lead to more significant reductions, whereas rates on high-yield savings accounts and CDs are likely to fall.

          <p>A 29-year-old hiker sustained serious, but not life-threatening, injuries to his chest and arm after being attacked by a bear on the Turbid Lake trail in Yellowstone National Park. The man reportedly deployed bear spray during the encounter, which occurred approximately 2.5 miles into the backcountry. Park officials have closed the trail but stated the bear will not be sought or euthanized, as the attack appears to have been a surprise encounter and not the result of unnatural behavior. This is the first bear attack in the park to cause significant injury since 2021.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to nearly two human cocktails by eating naturally fermented fruit. Scientists from UC Berkeley measured the ethanol content in figs and plum-like fruits favored by the primates, finding it to be around 0.3% by weight. While the low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, the steady consumption supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of our primate ancestors.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to a potential safety hazard. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), trim pieces on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is moving. This could create a road hazard for other drivers and increase the risk of a crash. Chrysler has reported numerous warranty claims related to the issue but no accidents or injuries, and dealers will replace the trim free of charge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis argues that key U.S. government economic statistics are growing increasingly unreliable, despite the digitization of the economy providing more data than ever. Declining response rates for crucial surveys, such as the Current Population Survey, are skewing results for metrics like household income and employment figures. This issue is compounded by chronic underfunding of statistical agencies and significant lags in data reporting, which can hinder effective policymaking. The article suggests the government should supplement its methods by incorporating reliable, real-time private-sector data.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged nearly 80% since early 2024, rising from around $2,060 to over $3,670 per ounce, and some analysts believe it could soon break the $4,000 mark. Several factors are contributing to this potential rise, including the expectation of further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which can make gold a more attractive investment. Additionally, rising inflation and general market uncertainty are driving investors toward safe-haven assets like gold, which has historically served as a hedge against economic instability.

The documentary is described as an intimate and moving portrait of the Black Sabbath frontman's determination. The original broadcast was delayed out of respect for the family's wishes.</p>

          <p>Following a major cyber attack that has halted production, workers in the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) supply chain are allegedly being laid off with reduced or no pay and told to apply for universal credit, according to the Unite union. The union is calling on the UK government to establish a furlough scheme to protect the jobs of thousands of workers affected by the production shutdown. The hack, which occurred over two weeks ago, has forced JLR to shut down its IT systems, with disruption potentially lasting until November.</p>
