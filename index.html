          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a prolonged voting session on President Trump's extensive budget bill, a nearly 1,000-page document central to his agenda. The legislation proposes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by significant cuts to healthcare and food assistance programs. Its passage is uncertain due to deep divisions within the Republican party over the scale of welfare cuts needed to finance the extension of major tax breaks. The bill, which is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt, now faces a critical series of amendment votes before a potential final passage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully dismantled a series of healthcare fraud schemes aiming to defraud the government of $14.6 billion, marking the largest such initiative in its history. The nationwide operation resulted in criminal charges against 324 individuals, including 93 medical professionals, and the seizure of over $245 million in assets. Some of the complex operations were orchestrated by transnational criminal organizations, which used stolen American identities to submit billions in fraudulent claims to programs like Medicare, highlighting a sophisticated threat to the U.S. healthcare system.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials. The center, located at a remote airport, is designed to house up to 5,000 individuals for processing and deportation.

Heat exhaustion is characterized by symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and cool skin, and requires moving to a cool place and rehydrating. Heat stroke is a life-threatening emergency where the body loses its ability to cool down, leading to a rapid temperature rise, and requires immediate medical attention and aggressive cooling measures. The best prevention is to avoid prolonged sun exposure and stay well-hydrated during hot weather.</p>

Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was penned in 1932 as the Weimar Republic was collapsing and captures a sense of impending doom while retaining youthful hope. The manuscript was discovered by the author's son after his death in 1999 but was only recently published, offering a rare glimpse into Haffner's early literary talent before he fled Nazi Germany and became a renowned historical writer.</p>

With the traditional U.S.-anchored global order seen as collapsing, Canada is being compelled to rethink its economic, military, and political independence. This has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism rooted not in cultural aspiration but in the practical necessity of survival, prompting actions like boycotts of U.S. goods and a strategic pivot towards Europe for defense.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has officially ceased operations, with its remaining functions being absorbed by the State Department. This move is a direct result of the Trump administration's "America First" policy, which has significantly cut foreign assistance budgets. A recent study estimated that USAID's programs have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades, and experts project its closure could lead to millions of preventable deaths by 2030 due to cuts in global health and development initiatives.</p>

          <p>A viral image circulating on social media platform X falsely claims to show the aftermath of an Iranian missile strike on Israel's Weizmann Institute. A DW fact-check reveals the satellite image actually depicts an Iranian missile facility in Tabriz that was damaged during Israeli attacks on Iran. By using reverse image search and comparing geographical features on Google Maps, the report confirms the misattribution. The incident is an example of the ongoing disinformation battle accompanying the military conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is experiencing a brutal stretch of severe weather, including an unusual number of tornadoes and intense flash floods, at a time when the National Weather Service is critically understaffed due to budget cuts. These reductions have forced some forecast offices to curtail services, such as ending 24/7 operations and reducing weather balloon launches, a key source of forecasting data. Experts and former NWS directors warn that attempting to forecast with less data during a period of climate-change-fueled extreme weather could lead to needless loss of life.</p>

          <p>This article argues that one of the most crucial functions of political protest is to break the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where people mistakenly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. Public demonstrations, from climate change rallies to abortion rights marches, serve as a visible signal of collective opinion, correcting misperceptions about what society truly believes. By making dissent public, protests can build common knowledge and prevent unpopular policies or regimes from persisting due to a public that is merely muted, not in agreement.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread confusion and fear among doctors, several Republican-led states are passing legislation to "clarify" when abortions are legally permissible to save a patient's life. These bills aim to provide more specific examples of medical emergencies, though critics from abortion rights groups argue they fail to resolve the underlying legal risks for physicians and may introduce problematic ideological language. The debate highlights the deep tension between the complexities of medical practice and the rigid, often vague, language of the new wave of restrictive abortion laws.</p>

          <h2>University of California Considers Systemwide Switch to Semesters</h2>

          <p>The University of California is studying a potential switch from its historical quarter system to a semester calendar for all its undergraduate campuses. Proponents argue a common calendar would improve systemwide collaboration, streamline transfers, and align UC with the vast majority of U.S. universities, potentially benefiting students applying for internships and jobs. However, the move faces opposition due to the massive estimated cost of over $288 million, potential for increased faculty workload, and concerns about disrupting student learning during a time of tight budgets.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Shuts Down Key Federal Climate Change Research Website</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken down globalchange.gov, the official website for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, removing public access to congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment reports and other critical research. Scientists have condemned the move as "scientific censorship," arguing it will hinder the ability of citizens, businesses, and local governments to make informed decisions and prepare for climate-related risks like droughts and floods. This action follows other administration moves to cut funding and dismiss scientists involved in federal climate research.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo is in a precarious state following a contentious split with its longtime nonprofit fundraising partner, the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. (GLAZA). The city is suing GLAZA over control of a nearly $50-million endowment, which funds much of the zoo's capital improvements. The conflict comes as the zoo struggles with dilapidated, closed exhibits, declining attendance, and warnings from regulators about a critical lack of funding for basic repairs, leaving its future uncertain as its primary partnership contract expires.</p>
