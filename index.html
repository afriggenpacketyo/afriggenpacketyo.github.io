          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the United States and China have a significant opportunity to reach a substantial agreement on trade issues, emphasizing the mutual benefits of rebalancing their economic relationship. Bessent also criticized the World Bank for continuing to lend to economically advanced nations like China, suggesting that the bank should prioritize lending to countries with more pressing developmental needs and allow private markets to flourish. He argued that treating China, the world's second-largest economy, as a developing country is no longer justifiable and that China should embrace a role commensurate with its global importance.

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, a former paddleboard firm owner and ex-police officer, received a 10-year and six-month jail sentence after four individuals died during a paddleboarding excursion on the Western Cleddau river in Wales back in October 2021. The court determined that Lloyd, along with a co-instructor, lacked the necessary qualifications to lead such a tour, and that there was an "abysmal" disregard for health and safety. The incident occurred in hazardous river conditions, with the group attempting to navigate a dangerous weir, resulting in the deaths of Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley.</p>

          <p>Several companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Apple, Chobani, and others, have announced plans to expand their manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. since the start of President Trump's second term, as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs take effect. These investments, involving hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, are expected to create jobs and support domestic production. While not all companies cite tariffs as the primary motivator, the White House has promoted these moves as contributing to Trump's goal of bolstering job creation on home soil.</p>

          <p>The European Union has levied substantial fines on Apple and Meta, totaling €700 million, for breaches of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), marking the first fines issued under this legislation aimed at curbing the power of big tech.

Both companies have expressed strong opposition to the fines, with Meta accusing the EU of attempting to disadvantage American businesses, and Apple stating it is being unfairly targeted and forced to provide its technology for free.</p>

It argues that the movement's agenda extends beyond simply increasing the birth rate and aims to enforce right-wing social values and transform women's roles in American life. The article criticizes the lack of attention to issues such as paid family leave and affordable childcare, suggesting that the movement is primarily interested in promoting white births and enforcing regressive gender roles.</p>
