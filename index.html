        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawmakers in the UK are debating and voting on proposed legislation that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England, Wales, the Isle of Man, and Jersey. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, outlines specific criteria for eligibility, including a six-month life expectancy and mental capacity to make the decision. The bill has undergone revisions, such as replacing High Court judge approval with a three-person panel and clarifying palliative care options and healthcare workers' rights to opt out. Assisted dying is defined as a terminally ill person receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves, while assisted suicide involves intentionally helping another person end their life, and euthanasia involves a physician administering a lethal drug to relieve suffering.</p>

          <p>Amidst ongoing missile attacks from Iran, Israelis are experiencing a mix of fear and resilience, with many questioning the conflict's impact on the war in Gaza and the fate of hostages. Tel Aviv residents are adjusting to the rhythm of air raid sirens and alerts from the Home Front Command, seeking shelter in underground bunkers. While defense systems intercept most missiles, some have struck buildings in Holon, Ramat Gan, and Beer Sheba, causing damage and prompting evacuations. Despite the fear, many Israelis emphasize the need for life to continue, even as they grapple with the unsettling reality of the conflict, with some analysts suggesting Netanyahu seeks to reestablish himself as a guarantor of Israeli security.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, with sales volumes falling by 2.7%, the largest monthly decline since December 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics. The decline was attributed to a "dismal" month for supermarkets, with reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco, while clothing and household goods stores also reported slow trading. Separate figures revealed that government borrowing rose to Â£17.7 billion, the second-highest level for May since 1993, consumers are cutting back, and the ONS said retailers noted inflation was prompting consumers to cut back.</p>

The government plans to tighten the criteria for personal independence payments and reduce the sickness-related element of universal credit. The government estimates the changes will save Â£5 billion a year by 2030, while critics argue they could push 250,000 people into poverty.</p>

          <p>Right-wing populists are increasingly expressing animosity towards cities, citing their liberal elites, immigrants, and progressive policies as provocations. Figures like Donald Trump have targeted cities like Los Angeles, criticizing their social and political landscapes. This animosity stems from cities often representing a future that clashes with the populist emphasis on tradition and national identity. Cities, with their diverse populations and complex politics, challenge the simplistic narratives favored by populist movements.</p>

Many regions are expected to meet the criteria for a heatwave, and firefighters have responded to a significant increase in wildfires.
