          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest, alleging he masterminded a coup plot to stay in power after his 2022 election loss. The decision cites Bolsonaro's violation of precautionary measures by using his sons' social media to address supporters. This legal battle is unfolding amid a trade dispute with the U.S., where the Trump administration has condemned the court's order and sanctioned the justice involved, escalating diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, has left thousands of homes in Scotland without power and caused significant travel disruptions. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) is working to restore power to 22,000 properties, but some outages may last until Thursday. The storm brought 90mph winds, leading to widespread cancellations of trains and flights and damage from falling trees.

          <p>A small Tuscan olive oil producer, Olio Piro, exemplifies the challenges European businesses face due to new U.S. tariffs, which are set at 15% for olive oil. The company, which found initial success in the high-demand American market, is now diversifying its exports to countries like Canada and Japan to mitigate the financial uncertainty. Since the U.S. imports about 95% of its olive oil, the tariffs are expected to raise consumer prices and impact a food source that has become essential in American kitchens.</p>

The author finds that while the chatbot can offer surprisingly insightful and objective feedback, it also has limitations, such as inherent biases from its training data and a tendency to flatter the user. The experiment highlights the complexities of relying on AI for nuanced human interactions, concluding that while it can be a useful tool, it cannot replace the empathy and direct work required in a real relationship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is launching a 12-month pilot program requiring some visitors to pay bonds of up to $15,000 to enter the country. The program targets business and leisure travelers with B-1 or B-2 visas from countries with high rates of visa overstays. The bond amounts, set at $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, will be determined by consular officers based on the traveler's circumstances. This latest move by the Trump administration aims to test the feasibility of the bond system and compel visitors to comply with their visa terms.</p>

          <p>This opinion article urges the Trump administration, specifically Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and new USFWS Director Brian Nesvik, to overhaul the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The author argues the US Fish and Wildlife Service has overstepped its authority by using metrics like "decline in the historic range" to list species, which he claims stifles development and infringes on private property rights. The piece calls for an executive order to delist many species, reform permitting processes to expedite infrastructure projects, and create nationwide permits for activities like fire prevention and energy development.</p>

          <p>President Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, has sparked warnings from experts about the politicization of U.S. economic data. The firing came after Trump accused the agency of "faking" recent jobs figures, which were lower than expected. Specialists fear this move could damage the credibility of U.S. statistics, drawing parallels to countries like Argentina and Greece where government interference with data led to economic instability and loss of international trust. The action is seen as part of a broader effort to weaken civil service protections for officials in policy-influencing roles.</p>

          <p>A new Republican-passed budget law, reflecting President Trump's priorities, is expected to cause widespread health insurance losses, impacting not only states that expanded Medicaid but also the 10 states that resisted the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The law imposes new administrative hurdles on ACA marketplace enrollees and cuts funding for enrollment assistance, which will disproportionately affect non-expansion states like Florida and Texas where more residents rely on these plans. These changes, combined with the potential expiration of enhanced subsidies, could lead to millions losing coverage and place a severe strain on patients and hospitals nationwide.</p>

The 2005 storm exposed a deeply flawed system, leaving thousands of inmates lost without records or legal representation. In the aftermath, a small group of dedicated lawyers rebuilt the office from the ground up, transforming it from a part-time, underfunded operation into a well-resourced institution with full-time staff, investigators, and social workers. This evolution culminated in a 2020 city council vote to grant the office funding parity with the district attorney, fundamentally reshaping criminal justice in New Orleans.</p>

Opposing them are plastic-producing countries and oil producers, who advocate for focusing on waste management and recycling rather than production caps.

          <p>The Chinese military has indicated it is on "high alert" after the Philippines and India conducted their first joint naval patrol in the South China Sea. The two-day maritime cooperative activity involved three Indian naval vessels and two Philippine warships, including a newly commissioned frigate. The patrol took place in strategic waters near Scarborough Shoal, a frequent point of confrontation between Beijing and Manila. The Philippine military reported being shadowed by Chinese vessels during the exercise but noted no untoward incidents occurred.</p>

          <p>A judge has again denied bail for hip-hop mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who remains in custody following his conviction on prostitution-related charges. The judge ruled that Combs failed to provide sufficient evidence that he is not a flight risk and cited the rapper's own admissions of past violence during his trial. Combs was found guilty in July of two counts of transportation for prostitution but was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex-trafficking charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced on October 3 and faces a potential prison term of up to 20 years.</p>

The world's largest oil company is also set to boost its output as OPEC+ members unwind voluntary production cuts through September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are investigating the connection between psychological stress and the physical aging process at a cellular level, focusing on a new hypothesis involving "zombie-like" cells. Research over the past few decades has shown that stress can induce changes in DNA that mirror molecular aging. This article discusses the latest scientific understanding of how the brain might manage the aging process. It also touches upon the potential for future scientific interventions to mitigate the negative effects of stress on our bodies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia collusion investigation. This legal step will explore allegations that political opponents of Donald Trump may have conspired to falsely accuse his campaign of working with Russia. The move follows the declassification of an appendix from the Durham report, which cited an intelligence memo suggesting a plan by Hillary Clinton's campaign to smear Trump. It remains unclear what specific charges could be brought or who might be targeted in the proceedings.</p>
