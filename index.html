          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are actively planning for a potential visit by Donald Trump to his golf resorts later this month, although official confirmation is still pending. The visit is expected to focus on his properties in Aberdeenshire and Ayrshire and would not include a private meeting with King Charles. This would be Trump's first trip to Scotland since his 2024 election, with his last visit in 2018 prompting a major security operation and widespread protests. A full state visit to the UK is also anticipated later in the year.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly told Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives to "Shut up" on the social media platform X. The rebuke followed Ives' recommendation that Tesla's board should curb Musk's political activities, particularly his formation of a new "America Party," which coincided with a drop in Tesla's stock. Ives also suggested a new pay package for Musk to ensure his focus remains on Tesla, especially given its recent struggles and the importance of its autonomous driving and robotics initiatives. Musk's political engagements have previously drawn backlash and negatively impacted the Tesla brand.</p>

          <p>A contentious debate is raging across Europe over the conservation status of wolves, which were recently downgraded from their "strictly protected" status by the European Parliament. The move, championed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after her pony was killed by a wolf, has been criticized by environmentalists as a political maneuver to win support from farmers. While apex predators like wolves are crucial for ecosystem health, their return has caused conflict with rural communities, despite data showing livestock predation remains minimal. Conservation groups are now challenging the decision in court.</p>

          <p>Mondelēz Global LLC has issued a recall for several carton sizes of its Ritz Peanut Butter Cracker Sandwiches due to a significant labeling error. The recall affects products sold across the United States where some individually wrapped peanut butter sandwich packs were incorrectly labeled as the cheese variety. This poses a serious or life-threatening risk to individuals with peanut allergies, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. While no illnesses have been reported, consumers with peanut allergies are urged to discard the affected products immediately.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially ended its long-standing policy requiring travelers in standard security lines to remove their shoes. The rule, implemented in 2006 after a failed shoe-bomb attempt, has been phased out due to advancements in screening technology. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that as of Tuesday, all passengers at domestic airports can keep their shoes on, a change expected to streamline security and reduce wait times. Previously, only members of the TSA PreCheck program were exempt from the requirement.</p>

          <p>Beyond broad country-specific levies, the Trump administration is increasingly using sector-specific tariffs that could have a more direct economic impact. President Trump announced plans for a 50% tariff on copper imports and high rates on pharmaceuticals, following earlier 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. These levies, justified under the 1962 Trade Expansion Act for national security reasons, are squeezing U.S. businesses and consumers by raising the cost of essential materials for goods like cars and electronics. This strategy adds another layer of complexity for businesses navigating the volatile global trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

One baseless claim suggested deportees were being thrown from planes into the ocean, which a leading flight-tracking expert confirmed has no factual basis. Another viral video used out-of-context images from unrelated migrant tragedies in Libya and Bangladesh to falsely depict U.S. deportations.

          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" eliminates federal taxes on Social Security, the legislation does not actually change how benefits are taxed. Instead, the law introduces a new, temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below $75,000, or $12,000 for couples below $150,000. While this provides some relief, policy experts clarify it is not a repeal of the tax on benefits and will not help low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax. The move could also add pressure to Social Security's long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's new budget reveals a massive expansion of funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), positioning it to become the largest domestic police force in the United States. The budget allocates $45 billion for immigrant detention over four years and funds the hiring of 10,000 new ICE agents, bringing the total to 30,000. Critics argue this buildup, combined with over $45 billion for the border wall, creates a powerful federal police force with a jurisdiction that could extend far beyond immigration, raising concerns about the creation of a "personal Gestapo."</p>
