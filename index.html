          <p>The Trump administration has fired hundreds of journalists at Voice of America (VOA), effectively shutting down the US-funded news outlet. Among those terminated were Persian-language reporters who were recalled to work after Israel attacked Iran. The administration claims the layoffs are due to "dysfunction, bias, and waste," while critics argue it undermines independent journalism. Kari Lake, appointed by Trump to run VOA, stated that 639 employees were laid off, with only 50 remaining across VOA and related entities, eliminating over 85% of the agency's staff since March.</p>

          <p>Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island criticized President Trump's rejection of his intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggested Trump's stance might be politically motivated, especially as he contemplates potential military action against Iran. He noted that National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified weeks ago that the intelligence community believes Iran has not authorized a nuclear weapons program since 2003. Reed emphasized that if Gabbard's testimony was false, it should be corrected immediately, regardless of Israeli actions.</p>

          <p>Speculation about regime change in Iran increases as Israel's attacks continue, but history suggests such interventions have disastrous consequences. Foreign-imposed regime change violates international law and often leads to instability. Examples from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya illustrate the potential for violence and failed governance. Experts doubt that regime change can be achieved from the outside, requiring ground forces and local support. Aerial bombardment alone is unlikely to succeed, and there is no strong rebel movement within Iran to topple the current regime.</p>

          <p>Sen. Mike Lee's social media posts about the Minnesota shootings, particularly those blaming Marxists, drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. His colleagues, including Sen. Tina Smith and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, confronted him about the posts, leading to their deletion. Sen. Kevin Cramer called the posts "insensitive" and "inappropriate." Lee's online activity has been prolific, but this incident prompted reflection on civility in Congress. The uproar came at a tense time for the Senate, prompting calls for lowered tensions and better communication.</p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to impact the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts for over 140 million Americans, with potential daily record highs forecast for parts of the Rockies, Plains, mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. The heat wave is expected to shift into the Midwest and Ohio Valley by the end of the weekend, and arrive in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday through the first half of next week. Staying indoors with air conditioning and staying hydrated are the best ways to stay safe.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon played an outsized role in President Trump's decision to delay a potential attack on Iran's nuclear facility, advising against trusting Israeli intelligence and questioning the effectiveness of the "bunker-buster" bomb. This influence is notable given Bannon's lack of official role in the military or State Department. Other conservatives, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, advocate for supporting Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has shifted toward a noninterventionist stance, mindful of the political repercussions of a direct attack on Iran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say US sunscreens may be less effective than those available abroad, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences are cited as a key reason, with the FDA's approval process for new UV filters being lengthy. Other countries have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. Despite this, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on cloudy days.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms, citing its unconstitutionality.

The case is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, testing the issue of religion and government. The ruling is a victory for civil liberties.</p>

While oil prices have increased modestly, they remain below $80 per barrel. The risk of a supply disruption and price spike grows as the conflict continues. Israel's campaign could trigger regime change from within, potentially leading to higher oil prices. Past instances of regime change in oil-producing countries have resulted in significant price spikes and economic disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>
