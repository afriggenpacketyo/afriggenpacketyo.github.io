          <p>An opinion article in the New York Times argues that the U.S. military, despite possessing advanced equipment, lacks sufficient personnel and resources to sustain a major war against adversaries like China or Russia. The authors, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk, point to the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen as examples of modern warfare's demands, highlighting the military's reliance on small quantities of expensive weapons over producing enough firepower for a prolonged fight. The article emphasizes the need for increased investment in active service members, ammunition, new ships, and aircraft to address the simultaneous challenges posed by various global threats. The authors contend that the current defense spending is inadequate to meet these challenges and that the U.S. must prioritize building a more durable and larger military force to maintain its global power.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech in San Francisco criticizing President Trump's administration, focusing on his tariffs, government cuts, and overall direction of the country. Speaking at the 20th-anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization supporting Democratic women in politics, Harris accused Trump of abandoning America's highest ideals and instilling fear. She specifically targeted Trump's tariffs, calling them reckless and harmful to workers, families, and businesses, and labeled the situation as a 'high-velocity event' designed to shrink government and favor the wealthy. Harris emphasized the importance of courage and collective action to safeguard the country's values and hinted at a potential return to politics, possibly in the California gubernatorial race or a future presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>In Washington County, Florida, a woman escaped from a storage container where she was being held after allegedly being sexually assaulted and brutally beaten by David Earl Gipson. The woman reported that Gipson attacked her at her residence, bound, gagged, and sexually assaulted her, and threatened her life before taking her to his residence and confining her in a storage container. The sheriff's office reported that the woman was able to free herself and flag down a passerby, who called 911. Authorities also found the woman's mother-in-law dead in her home, and Gipson is now facing murder charges in addition to charges of sexual battery, aggravated battery, and false imprisonment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced an agreement with Ukraine to share future revenues from the country's mineral reserves, establishing a joint investment fund between the two nations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the deal demonstrates the administration's commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine while addressing concerns about unchecked U.S. aid. The agreement, which came after months of tense negotiations, intends to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's fate. While the specifics of the deal were not immediately disclosed, it is expected to open opportunities for U.S. companies in mining, oil, and natural gas, and to direct reconstruction efforts to American firms if a cease-fire is achieved.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths, creating the US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund. According to the Trump administration, this deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the U.S. to continue investing in Ukraine's defense and reconstruction efforts. The agreement establishes a fund that will be split 50-50 between the U.S. and Ukraine, giving each side equal voting rights, while ensuring Ukraine maintains control over its natural resources. The deal has faced criticism, with some suggesting it is an attempt by the White House to take advantage of Ukraine's reliance on American aid.</p>

          <p>Eleven students involved in an alleged hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team turned themselves in after facing potential kidnapping charges. The incident involved older players allegedly luring younger teammates to an isolated location, where accomplices in masks and black clothing simulated an abduction, tying up one student and placing him in the trunk of a car. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick condemned the act as criminal activity and hazing on steroids, while an attorney for the students expressed regret for their involvement. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are considering prosecuting the case in family court to avoid criminal records for the students.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has significantly lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The BOJ now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a sharp decrease from the 1.1 percent projected earlier, and decided to hold interest rates steady at 0.5 percent. This decision reflects concerns that tariffs could undermine the country's fragile economic recovery and complicate efforts to normalize monetary policy. The BOJ also projected that core prices, excluding fresh food, would rise by around 2.2 percent this fiscal year, a slight decrease from the previous forecast of 2.4 percent.</p>

Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal meal but declined, is the first witness in the trial where Erin Patterson is charged with the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of another. The case centers on a beef wellington lunch in July 2023 that contained death cap mushrooms, leading to the deaths of three guests. The prosecution alleges Patterson invited the group under the pretense of having been diagnosed with cancer, while the defense argues she panicked after unintentionally serving poison to family members she loved.</p>

          <p>An analysis in the New York Times reflects on the changing dynamics in Asia, fifty years after the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam, noting the growing influence of China and the perceived withdrawal of American aid and democratic ideals. The article highlights instances where China has stepped in to provide assistance, such as after an earthquake in Myanmar, while the U.S. has been slower or has even cut aid. Despite this, American ideals and images continue to resonate in the region, and some officials express concern about China's intentions and a desire for continued American engagement. The author reflects on a conversation with a Vietnamese colleague of his father's, who noted that despite his years of loyal spying, Uncle An may have been tainted by his long association with Americans.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee has amended a controversial bill aimed at ending solar credits for rooftop solar system owners, now limiting its impact to only those who sell their homes. Assembly Bill 942, proposed by Lisa Calderon, initially targeted long-standing programs providing energy credits to Californians who installed solar panels before April 15, 2025. The original bill would have reduced the program's benefits to 10 years, but the amendment removes that provision. The bill has faced opposition from rooftop solar owners, schools, businesses, and environmental groups, who argue that the changes would undermine investments in green energy and raise legal concerns.</p>

The decision aligns with economists' expectations and occurs amid global trade tensions driven by the U.S. The BOJ highlighted its intention to continue raising its policy rate if economic and price forecasts are realized, but also acknowledged the likelihood of moderate growth due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The central bank expects inflation to range between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025 and 1.5 to 2% in fiscal year 2026.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on the Ukrainian city of Odesa resulted in at least two deaths and five injuries, with significant damage to civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings. The attack occurred as the U.S. signed a deal with Ukraine to jointly exploit its energy and mineral resources, a move seen as a show of solidarity from the Trump administration. The attack comes amid a temporary ceasefire announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine, coinciding with victory celebrations marking the end of World War Two.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has demonstrated resilience to President Trump's tariffs, with minimal direct impact on its earnings. During Microsoft's earnings call, tariffs were mentioned only once, relating to sales of personal computers and Windows operating system licenses.

CEO Satya Nadella emphasized that software could help companies respond to rising costs due to tariffs, highlighting the company's AI products like GitHub Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft's shares rose after reporting higher revenue and earnings than analysts had predicted.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has reported a reduction in digital ad spending by Chinese online retailers due to President Donald Trump's trade policy. According to Meta's finance chief Susan Li, "Asia-based e-commerce exporters" have decreased their spending, likely in response to the end of de minimis trade exemptions for Chinese imports. This policy change, which primarily affects online retailers like Temu and Shein, has led to a shift in advertising spend to other markets, resulting in lower overall spend for these advertisers. Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region reached $8.22 billion for the first quarter, falling short of Wall Street projections.</p>

          <p>Washington and Kyiv have signed a long-awaited deal involving Ukraine's natural resources, after months of contentious negotiations. Both sides have confirmed that it sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and sets outs how revenues would be split. In a statement, the US said the agreement "signals to Russia" that the Trump administration is "committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous" Ukraine. It comes just over two months after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Zelensky at the White House turned into a public shouting match sparking fear that the US might withdraw its support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate to defeat a bipartisan resolution that sought to block President Donald Trump’s global tariffs. The resolution, which would have revoked the emergency order used to enact the tariffs, failed in a 49-49 vote due to the absence of two senators. The move effectively prevents tariff opponents from bringing the resolution back up for consideration. Trump has imposed tariffs on a wide variety of imports, including steel, aluminum, autos, and goods from Mexico, Canada, and China.</p>

With Japan aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, LNG is expected to play a crucial role in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, as burning natural gas emits less carbon than other fossil fuels.</p>

The judge has referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.
