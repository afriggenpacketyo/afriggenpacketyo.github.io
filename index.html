          <p>Ukraine has accused Russia of attempting to derail the upcoming peace negotiations scheduled to take place in Istanbul. President Zelensky has expressed concerns over Russia's commitment to meaningful dialogue, citing the absence of negotiating proposals from Moscow. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has affirmed its readiness for a complete ceasefire, submitting its own proposals to Russia. The previous round of talks in Istanbul yielded a prisoner exchange, but no significant breakthroughs, as the conflict continues with Russia controlling approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory. Optimism remains guarded amidst ongoing reports of explosions in both Ukrainian and Russian regions. </p>

          <p>Germany's plan to return asylum seekers to Greece has created tension between the two nations. While both countries share a conservative stance on immigration, Greece is resistant to accepting repatriated migrants. Athens seeks increased EU support for border protection and a migration agreement with Libya to manage the flow of migrants. Greece has seen a 30% drop in arrivals this year due to effective border protection and improved cooperation with Turkey, and is hoping for an agreement with Libya to further stem migration from that region. The situation is further complicated by a Greek naval court bringing charges against coastguards regarding the sinking of the Adriana, a migrant vessel. </p>

Japan and Cambodia have also agreed to strengthen security cooperation, reflecting Japan's broader efforts to deepen ties with Asian countries amid China's growing influence. Japan's consumer affairs center is warning of rice scam websites as prices soar, and cheaper stockpiled rice is now available in stores. </p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff policies are facing significant pushback, with a New York court blocking his signature trade policy. The administration declared a national emergency to impose tariffs, but the court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize such broad tariff measures. Although an appeals court temporarily stayed the decision, this marks a major setback for Trump's economic agenda. Despite these challenges, the administration intends to continue pursuing its tariff policies, claiming they have a strong legal case and can find alternative means if necessary (not investment advice).</p>
