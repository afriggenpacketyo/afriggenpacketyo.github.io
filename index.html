          <p>President Trump stated that Apple would face a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, specifically mentioning India. Apple has been shifting production to India due to more favorable trade relations with the U.S. Some analysts estimate that producing iPhones in the U.S. could increase the price significantly, with one estimate putting the cost at $3,500 per iPhone.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, responding to a lawsuit filed by the university. The lawsuit challenged the Department of Homeland Security's decision to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, citing the university's tolerance of "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators." Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating that Harvard would suffer irreparable injury if the ban took effect before a court hearing, which is scheduled for Tuesday. The ban would affect over 7,000 current visa holders studying at Harvard, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium.</p>

          <p>The House Republican tax and spending package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," does not include an extension of the premium tax credits under the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA), which are set to expire at the end of the year. This omission is notable given that the bill includes other proposed changes to the ACA marketplace. Without the extension, nearly all subsidized ACA enrollees can expect their monthly premiums to rise. The absence of the credits' extension is expected to affect millions of Americans who rely on the ACA marketplace for health insurance.</p>
