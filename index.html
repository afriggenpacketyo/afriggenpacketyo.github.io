        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colombian senator and presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head at a Bogotá campaign event, sparking fears of renewed political violence ahead of the 2026 elections. The attack, carried out by a 15-year-old, has left Uribe in critical condition after undergoing surgery, with his wife asking for prayers. The incident has drawn comparisons to a dark era of political violence in Colombia, reminiscent of the violence in 1989, raising concerns about the country's security and political climate. United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio pointed a finger at Petro, who he has previously clashed with and referred to as "Gustavo Chavez". Several presidential hopefuls have called for greater protection for candidates ahead of the upcoming elections, and the Ministry of Defense has offered a reward for information related to the assassination attempt. The event has further polarized the political landscape in Colombia. </p>

          <p>This article argues that many institutions are preemptively complying with Donald Trump's policies, which smooths the way to autocracy. It suggests that universities, law firms, and corporations are censoring themselves and altering their behavior to avoid Trump's ire. The author advocates for "anticipatory noncompliance" as a counter-strategy, highlighting examples of institutions pushing back against Trump's demands, such as universities challenging funding threats and states contesting civil rights law interpretations. The article suggests that standing firm against authoritarian demands is essential for restoring democracy, and that popular opposition is emerging in various sectors of society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article asserts that a "global intifada" is manifesting in the United States through organized, Hamas-aligned networks that are inciting violence and terrorism against Jews and Israelis. It cites recent attacks, including a Molotov cocktail attack in Colorado and the murder of Israeli Embassy staff in Washington, D.C., as evidence of this trend. The author argues that campus protests are not student-driven but orchestrated by professionals to carry out Hamas's agenda. The piece calls for holding perpetrators accountable through criminal prosecution and civil litigation, as well as disrupting their support and resources, advocating for a shift in strategy to address the root causes of anti-Semitism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that recent anti-Jewish attacks in America, such as the firebombing in Colorado and the shooting in Washington, D.C., inadvertently strengthen the case for Zionism. The author contends that these acts of violence demonstrate the continued need for a Jewish state, as they prove that Jews are not always safe or accepted outside of Israel. The piece suggests that anti-Zionist movements should focus on making Jewish people feel welcome and secure in their home countries, thereby negating the need for a separate state, but the current movement often seems determined to make Jews feel unwelcome, which only bolsters the Zionist cause.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details how a network of women in Latin America revolutionized access to safe abortions through the use of misoprostol. Starting in the 1990s, activists shared information about the drug, which could induce abortions, circumventing strict legal restrictions. They established hotlines and published manuals, like the Barbie-themed guide in Argentina, to provide women with crucial information. Activists also developed the "acompañamiento" model in Mexico, offering support throughout the abortion process, while Socorristas en Red in Argentina systematized accompaniment and collected data to advocate for legalization. The movement culminated in Argentina legalizing abortion in 2021, inspiring similar changes in Colombia and Mexico, showcasing the power of grassroots activism and accessible information. </p>
