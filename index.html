          <p>Across the United States, large-scale "Hands Off!" demonstrations took place, protesting President Trump and Elon Musk's policies and actions. The protests, organized by over 150 groups, addressed concerns such as government downsizing, economic policies, human rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. Demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C., state capitals, and various locations in all 50 states, voicing their opposition to the administration's agenda. Protesters criticized the administration's moves to cut federal jobs, reduce social security services, and scale back protections for marginalized groups, and the White House responded by stating that President Trump will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>As U.S. consumers rush to purchase goods before President Trump's tariffs take full effect, experts advise caution against overspending and accumulating debt. Economists predict that the tariffs will increase prices for everyday items and potentially lead to a recession. While stocking up on certain items may seem prudent, consumers should prioritize their long-term financial stability and avoid panic buying. With many Americans already burdened by debt, experts emphasize the importance of a measured approach and careful consideration of financial goals.</p>

The babies are the offspring of Mommy and Abrazzo, two of the zoo's oldest residents. The hatchlings are being kept behind the scenes for now, and the zoo plans a public debut on April 23, as well as a naming contest. Mommy is considered one of the most genetically valuable Galapagos tortoises in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' species survival plan.</p>

          <p>Economists are questioning the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions and inflates the actual rates. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the formula underpinning Trump's sweeping "reciprocal" tariff plan is the country's trade deficit with the U.S., divided by its exports, then divided by two. The economists say that that number should be closer to 1.0 (0.945).</p>

At UC San Diego, Chancellor Pradeep Khosla said in a campus message late Friday that five students had their visas revoked. The federal government has not explained the reasons behind these terminations. Last month, the Trump administration began revoking student visas at high-profile campuses, including Columbia, Cornell, George Washington, Tufts and other universities where it alleged that the students affected were antisemitic and aligned with terrorists because of their pro-Palestinian writings or protests.</p>
