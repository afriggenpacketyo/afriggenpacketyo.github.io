          <p>Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan visited Hiroshima Prefecture to honor the victims of the atomic bombing ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The couple paid their respects at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, offering flowers and a silent prayer at the cenotaph, marking their first visit to the city since the Emperor's accession in 2019. They also viewed an exhibition on building remnants and met with survivors at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, continuing a tradition of imperial family members showing deep concern for the suffering of atomic bomb survivors.

          <p>Hurricane Erick, the fifth named storm of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season, strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane as it approached southern Mexico. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from Acapulco to Puerto Angel, forecasting landfall in Oaxaca or Guerrero. Erick was expected to bring between 8 to 12 inches of rain, leading to life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, with dangerous storm surge also expected to cause coastal flooding. Acapulco, previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023, was in the path of Erick, raising concerns about potential impacts. The optimism score is based on the potential for devastating natural disaster and the author's tone which is neutral. </p>

          <p>The Buss family is reportedly selling a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the owner of the L.A. Dodgers, in a deal valued at $10 billion, which would make the Lakers the most valuable sports franchise in the world. Jeanie Buss will remain as governor, representing the team in league matters, continuing her role since her father Jerry's death in 2013. Walter also owns the Professional Women's Hockey League, the Los Angeles Sparks, and has interests in Chelsea and the Cadillac Formula 1 racing team, expanding his sports portfolio. The sale marks a significant moment for the Lakers, who have been under the Buss family's ownership since 1979 and have won 11 NBA titles during that time. The optimism score reflects the excitement around the change in ownership and potential positive impact on the team's future. </p>

          <p>Chinese ambassador Xie Feng urged the U.S. to look at the 'whole picture' regarding tariffs and trade relations, arguing that current tariffs on Chinese imports are 'unreasonably high.' Xie stated that the U.S. goods deficit would not shrink while export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms remain in place. He emphasized China's willingness to buy more from America, but noted the U.S. restrictions on exports of competitive products like semiconductors. The ambassador's remarks come as the U.S. and China recently agreed on a framework to ease trade tensions. The optimism score is based on the author's neutral tone on the current state of trade relations between the two countries. </p>

The Financial Times highlights the US's capability to destroy Iran's underground nuclear sites and its national security warning to the UK over Chinese involvement in a wind turbine project.

          <h2>Nippon Steel CEO Highlights Growing Strategic Importance of US Steel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that U.S. Steel is of growing strategic importance due to higher U.S. tariffs on steel products. Hashimoto believes that while his company's acquisition of U.S. Steel should help the U.S. economy, trade levies will not revive its manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary after Trump reversed his initial opposition. The company has concluded a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, pledging to invest around $11 billion by 2028 in U.S. Steel. The optimism score is based on the potential for the acquisition to benefit the U.S. steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier Li Qiang has called on Jiangsu province, a key manufacturing hub in China, to step up efforts in technology, trade, and consumption to support the country’s economic growth. During a three-day visit, Li emphasized the importance of embracing innovative development, stimulating effective demand, fostering entrepreneurship, and deepening reform and opening up. Jiangsu's gross domestic product rose 5.9 per cent year on year in the first quarter of this year. The province has been tasked by Beijing with playing a leading role in stabilizing growth amid sluggish domestic demand and increased US tariffs.

The Israeli military said that airstrikes targeted Tehran and other areas of Iran, and Iran fired missiles at Israel. The Arak heavy water reactor is located 250 kilometers southwest of Tehran, and heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors but produces plutonium, which can be used in nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has urged Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. The optimism score is based on the author's tone on the potential for escalation of the conflict. </p>
