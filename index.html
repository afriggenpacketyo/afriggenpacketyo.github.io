          <p>Data indicates a significant trend in the global travel industry: Americans are increasingly traveling abroad, while the number of foreign visitors to the United States is decreasing. In March, foreign visitors arriving by air fell nearly 10% year-over-year, while U.S. citizens flying abroad increased by 1.6%. This imbalance could widen the existing $50 billion gap between U.S. revenue from travel and what Americans spend overseas. Factors contributing to the decline in international tourism include trade tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's moves to downsize USAID have led to significant job losses across the U.S., impacting nearly 20,000 employees. Companies and organizations relying on USAID funding have been forced to implement furloughs and layoffs, affecting workers in states like North Carolina, Vermont, and California. A website tracking the economic impact estimates that over 19,000 American jobs have been lost due to these cuts, with 46 states affected. Many job seekers are struggling to find comparable work, leading some to exit the formal job market altogether.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced his opposition to sports teams changing their names to remove references to Native American heritage, calling the changes "degrading to the Indian population." He specifically mentioned the Washington Commanders and the Cleveland Guardians, stating that he believes the original names, Redskins and Indians, were superior and had heritage behind them. Trump also expressed support for Massapequa High School's right to maintain its nickname, the Chiefs, despite a New York law requiring schools to remove indigenous-related logos.

          <p>SK Hynix reported a 158% surge in quarterly profit, exceeding estimates due to robust demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) offerings used in generative artificial intelligence chipsets. Revenue rose 42% year-on-year, driven by the increasing impact of AI on the memory market and the company's leading position in HBM technology. SK Hynix expects continued spending on AI by Big Tech, with the expansion of open-source AI models and sovereign AI projects further fueling memory demand.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders targeting universities, aiming to reshape higher education institutions by cracking down on diversity and inclusion efforts. The orders address foreign gifts to universities and college accreditation, with the administration alleging that accreditors rely on "woke ideology" rather than merit. The White House claims accreditors have imposed "discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-based standards," violating federal law. Despite condemning DEI efforts, Trump also signed an order establishing a White House initiative on historically black colleges and universities to promote excellence and innovation.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight synthetic food dyes from the American food supply, citing potential links to behavioral changes and cancer. HHS and the FDA aim to revoke authorization for two colorings and collaborate with manufacturers to eliminate six others commonly found in processed foods. While some experts support the move, pointing to studies linking dyes to ADHD symptoms, others argue for more research. The International Association of Color Manufacturers criticized the decision, asserting the safety of color additives based on reviews by global health authorities.</p>

          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted by 0.1% in the first quarter, marking the first contraction since late 2020, primarily due to a significant drop in construction activity.

Despite a temporary suspension of blanket tariffs by the U.S., South Korea remains subject to tariffs on key exports like steel and automobiles.

          <p>The Trump administration's new U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, Bill Essayli, plans to pursue immigration charges against Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano, who was convicted of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated in a 2021 crash that killed two people. Essayli noted that Ortega-Anguiano, who is awaiting release from state prison, could face up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted of illegally reentering the country after two prior deportations. The decision comes amid concerns that Ortega-Anguiano could be released early, prompting criticism from state and federal officials. Governor Newsom's office has pledged to honor an ICE detainer on Ortega-Anguiano.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a possible shift in his approach to trade, stating that if the U.S. cannot reach deals with other countries within a few weeks, he will impose tariffs. He mentioned that the U.S. and China are in daily contact to work out a trade agreement but did not provide details on the progress. The markets rallied following Trump's comments, along with his assurance that he would not fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. This suggests a softening stance on trade and economic policy compared to previous statements.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his administration are pressuring Ukraine to accept an American-designed peace proposal that would essentially grant Russia control over the territory it has gained in the war. The plan would also block Ukraine from joining NATO, and may recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the proposal, stating that it violates Ukraine's constitution. Trump responded by criticizing Zelensky, accusing him of prolonging the conflict. The proposal has faced criticism for potentially rewarding Russian aggression and undermining international law.</p>

          <p>California is offering residents another opportunity to receive up to $2,000 toward the purchase of an e-bike through the California E-Bike Incentive Project. The program, which had a previous offering that saw a massive wave of applications, has adjusted its process to a random drawing system to ensure fair access. Applicants must enter an online waiting room between 5 and 6 p.m. on Tuesday, after which up to 1,000 applications will be approved for vouchers. The program aims to provide vouchers for 1,500 e-bikes and is open to California residents who meet specific income requirements.</p>
