          <h2>PwC Report Challenges Myths About AI's Impact on Jobs and Wages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 01:36:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new PwC report, analyzing over 800 million job ads across six continents, challenges common fears about AI's impact on the workforce. The report indicates that AI is creating jobs and increasing wages, particularly for workers with AI skills, which are seeing a 56% wage increase. It also finds that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI since 2022. The study suggests that AI can enrich automatable jobs by freeing up employees for more complex tasks, and that softening job growth in AI-exposed occupations could be beneficial in countries with declining working-age populations. The report highlights the need for workers to be prepared to take on new roles requiring different skills in the evolving job market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that over 30,000 criminal prosecutions in England and Wales collapsed between October 2020 and September 2024 due to lost, damaged, or missing evidence. The data, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, indicates a rising trend in cases failing due to unavailable evidence, including 70 homicides and over 550 sexual offences. The increase is attributed to resourcing issues following cuts to police forces and the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012, which has forced police forces to handle evidence storage themselves. The National Police Chiefs' Council stated that the data includes instances where expert witnesses or medical statements are unavailable, but the findings underscore serious concerns about police evidence storage and handling practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese producer prices have been in deflationary territory for over two years due to overcapacity and weak domestic demand, leading to concerns of a "China shock" in global markets. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., other countries in Asia worry that a flood of cheap imports could squeeze local industries. However, some economists believe this influx of low-cost goods could ease inflationary pressures in inflation-worn economies, offering central banks some relief. Nomura predicts that emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may lead to more rate cuts across Asia, with central banks decoupling from the Fed to deliver additional easing (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new Ipsos poll reveals that many Europeans believe their societies are in decline, with negative sentiment growing across major economies. In Germany, 77% of respondents feel society is broken, marking a 16-percentage-point increase since 2021, with similar rises in Great Britain and France. Economic concerns contribute to this sentiment, as most respondents believe their economies are rigged to benefit the wealthy and powerful. Notably, Britons are the most likely to support a "strong leader who breaks the rules" to fix these problems, contrasting with lower support for such leadership in Germany and the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, has been met with concern but less shock compared to his initial 2017 ban. The administration has implemented a series of restrictive immigration policies, including suspending the asylum system, ending temporary legal residency for numerous nationalities, and restricting student visas. Critics argue that these measures create layers of restrictions that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and those seeking refuge. Experts suggest the new ban is more likely to withstand legal challenges but fear it normalizes discriminatory practices.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to contact Musk but was unsuccessful, while Republicans expressed frustration with Musk's vague criticism and lack of productive feedback. Democrats, on the other hand, saw Musk's opposition as an opportunity to sidetrack the bill, though some acknowledged their past criticism of Musk. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $2.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade, a figure Republicans dispute.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus overturning the 2022 decision that required the executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The judge said the government's assessment did not provide a sufficient basis for the utility to swiftly conduct construction work to protect against a huge tsunami.</p>

The government currently imports 770,000 tons of rice annually tariff-free under WTO rules, but most is not for human consumption. The government is also attempting to contain soaring prices by selling reserve rice directly to retailers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Muskâ€™s relationship has ended with a tweet about Jeffrey Epstein, which was inevitable. The Trump-Musk feud is not so much a distraction as it is evidence of a societal tendency toward abstraction, even obfuscation. A cage match is easier to watch than a discussion about who deserves benefits and resources. It is certainly more cathartic than an ideological stalemate about the world we want to build.</p>

          <h2>Trump Doubles Down on Claims That Biden Aides Illegally Used Autopen</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has doubled down on his accusations, without evidence, that Biden was not really running the country, claiming aides used his autopen to carry out "radical" policies. Biden has denied the allegations and the Justice Department's legal counsel have endorsed autopens as lawful for signing bills into law, but Trump claimed during an Oval Office session with reporters that the use of the tool was the "biggest scandal maybe in the last 100 years" of this country.</p>

The Trump administration's approach to tariffs has triggered concerns over rising prices and a weakening economy. The athleisure brand joins a growing list of big companies to warn about the impact of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.</p>
