          <p>The Toba Aquarium in Japan houses the last two captive sea otters in the country, May and Kira, as the wild population faces severe decline due to hunting, pollution, and breeding challenges. Experts emphasize the need to understand the reasons behind the species' endangerment, including the Exxon Valdez oil spill and rising sea temperatures. The aquarium is taking innovative steps to keep the otters healthy, such as encouraging exercise during feeding, and streams their activities on YouTube. While a population has established itself off Hokkaido, Japan, experts call for facing the situation head-on to ensure the species' survival.</p>

Johnson admitted to the crime at his trial, expressing remorse but claiming he was high on crack cocaine at the time. The article details the brutal attack on Harris, who suffered extensive burns and later died, and recounts Johnson's unsuccessful appeals to halt the execution. Harris had worked at the convenience store for more than 10 years, living only about a block and a half away, according to testimony from her son, Scot Harris.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will permit use of Covid vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, but may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. The FDA will demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk. The new recommendations mark a departure from the previous policy of offering annual Covid shots to everyone 6 months and older. Some experts worry the new criteria will deny many people who want to be vaccinated, potentially leading to more unnecessary deaths.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a waiver for Nebraska to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks using SNAP benefits, marking a significant shift in federal nutrition policy. This decision reverses decades of Agriculture Department denials and could pave the way for similar bans in other states. The prohibition adds to existing restrictions on SNAP benefits, which already exclude hot foods, nonfood items, alcohol, and tobacco. While proponents argue it incentivizes healthier purchases, opponents fear it may lead to broader cuts to food stamps and is paternalistic.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to expand the country's air defense system by the end of his term. The ambitious project, intended to protect against catastrophic attacks, faces logistical and financial hurdles. Experts estimate the project could cost far more than Trump's proposed $175 billion, with the Congressional Budget Office suggesting it could reach $542 billion. The system is designed to intercept missiles from any location, including space, and is being overseen by Gen. Michael Guetlein of the Space Force.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has initiated a criminal investigation into Andrew M. Cuomo, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, concerning his testimony regarding decisions made during the coronavirus pandemic as governor. This inquiry follows the Trump administration's dismissal of an indictment against the city’s current mayor, Eric Adams, on corruption charges. The investigation stems from a referral by House Republicans and is based on allegations that Cuomo lied to Congress about editing a report on nursing home deaths.

This redesign marks the first time the RAV4 will eliminate a traditional gas engine, opting for hybrid and plug-in hybrid options. The decision is driven by growing customer demand and the popularity of hybrid models, with electrified vehicle sales accounting for 43.1% of Toyota's U.S. sales in 2024. Despite tariffs imposed by President Trump on imported vehicles and auto parts, Toyota aims to continue growing its hybrid offerings.</p>

          <p>A new report by ICF projects that electricity demand in the United States could increase by as much as 78% by 2050, potentially leading to significant challenges for grid reliability and affordability. The report attributes this growth to rising temperatures, the increasing use of emerging technologies like cryptocurrency mining and data centers, and the adoption of electric vehicles. Retail electricity costs are also expected to rise, potentially doubling by 2050. Grid operators are already warning of high peak demand during the summer months, and households are expected to pay higher prices for electricity.</p>

The volcano, which last erupted in 2015, is showing signs of increased activity, but scientists say the eruption poses no danger to people on land. The first sign of an eruption will be a sharp increase in the number of earthquakes around the volcano, caused by magma moving toward the surface.

          <p>Japan's Agriculture Minister Taku Eto resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he had "never had to buy rice" because supporters gave it to him. This remark came amid a national rice shortage and soaring prices, making it particularly insensitive. The government has been implementing measures to curb rising prices, but these efforts have so far failed to yield results. Public support for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has also declined sharply.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that most U.S. states do not require specific emergency plans for students with disabilities, leaving them feeling at risk during crises. The article highlights the experience of Niamh Winright, a student with autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis, during a school shooting, illustrating the challenges faced by disabled students in emergency situations. In response, some states are beginning to implement laws requiring individualized safety plans for students with disabilities. These laws mandate discussions between school officials, students, and parents to ensure the unique needs of disabled students are addressed during emergencies.</p>

Despite the positive results, the company's remaining performance obligation and next-gen security ARR outlook were unchanged, leading to investor disappointment. Palo Alto's solid results despite a trade war and the uncertain macroenvironment were added proof that cybersecurity remains the most resilient spending category in software.
