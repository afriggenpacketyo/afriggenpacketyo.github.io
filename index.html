          <p>Jordan Murray, a 25-year-old California man, is accused of fatally stabbing a 40-year-old man in Fair Oaks. Murray had been released from jail in November 2024 under a 'mental health diversion' program following two violent robberies in May and June 2024, where he allegedly sprayed employees with a caustic chemical. The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office expressed outrage that Murray committed a preventable murder only six months after his release. He is now held without bail and faces charges of murder and felony robbery and is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider raising taxes before the Spring Statement. The memo proposed measures to increase taxes by Â£3-4 billion annually, including raising corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, scrapping the tax-free allowance on dividends, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While these proposals were not implemented, they highlight ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions, especially concerning welfare cuts and defense spending. Conservative Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticized the memo, stating it confirmed the Labour Party was still debating which taxes to increase next.</p>

The ransomware attack is believed to be the work of Scattered Spider, using tools from DragonForce, and M&S is working to restore operations and reshape the company for the future.</p>

Huang explained that Nvidia's market share in China has significantly decreased as Chinese firms have filled the gap with their own chips. He emphasized that A.I. research continues in China, even without sufficient Nvidia products, and that Nvidia is committed to continuing sales in China.</p>

The bill includes provisions to extend the 2017 tax cuts, increase military and immigration enforcement spending, and cut Medicaid and other social programs.

Drawing inspiration from Leo XIII, the new pope aims to challenge injustices and promote global cooperation, setting the stage for a challenging relationship with Catholic Maga figures in the US government.

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is meeting with Donald Trump at the White House to reset relations after repeated attacks on his government. The U.S. administration has criticized Pretoria for alleged persecution of white Afrikaner farmers and its stance on Israel. Ramaphosa aims to correct Trump's misconceptions about race relations and policies in South Africa, with a vital free trade agreement hanging in the balance. Despite tensions, Ramaphosa hopes to find common ground with Trump, potentially leveraging South Africa's mineral wealth to counter China's influence.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking outrage with a remark about never buying rice due to receiving it as gifts from supporters. This comment drew attention to the government's inability to resolve the ongoing rice shortage, which has driven up prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister to address the issue. The shortage has been attributed to decades-old policies that protect small-time farmers, hindering newcomers from cultivating land and leading to uncultivated acres, with the situation worsened by the soaring prices and shortages.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in securing enough votes due to opposition from both conservatives and moderates over issues like spending cuts, Medicaid, and state and local tax deductions. The Rules Committee met overnight to advance the legislation, with conservatives pushing for steeper spending cuts and moderates resisting larger cuts to Medicaid.

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall 'mega tsunami' could potentially devastate America's West Coast if a strong earthquake hits the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. This quake could cause coastal land to sink and generate waves reaching up to 1,000 feet, threatening cities like Seattle and Portland. The scientists emphasize that this event would happen rapidly, leaving no time for adaptation or mitigation, with the most severe effects expected in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.</p>

Despite periods of fluidity, United's season has been plagued by basic mistakes and financial losses, making it arguably their worst since the 1973-74 relegation campaign.
