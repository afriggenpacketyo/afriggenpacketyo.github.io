          <p>U.S. officials have reportedly been informed that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, prompting concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against American sites in Iraq, which led to the U.S. advising some Americans to leave the region. Despite rising tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy is scheduled to meet with Iran for further nuclear program talks. Iran's defense minister warned that U.S. bases in host countries would be targeted if a conflict is imposed. The Trump administration has been attempting to negotiate a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, which Israel has been skeptical of for years, and the situation remains delicate given Iran's continued uranium enrichment. Optimism about a peaceful resolution remains low as the situation unfolds.</p>

          <p>David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a fundamental disagreement with the party regarding the role of the vice chair.

This decision follows controversy and disagreements between Hogg and senior DNC leaders, including chair Ken Martin. Despite these disagreements, Hogg expressed respect for his fellow officers, and Martin commended Hogg's activism and dedication to the party, wishing him well in his future endeavors.

Despite the evacuation, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff still plans to meet with Iranian officials for nuclear program talks.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a spending review that includes an extra £29 billion per year for the NHS in England, along with increased funding for defense and housing. The government aims to boost artificial intelligence and transport projects as part of its plan to "renew Britain". While some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget squeezes, the review prioritizes security, economic growth, and a future-proof NHS. The Spending Review includes £39 billion over 10 years for social and affordable housing and an increase in police funding, contingent on local council tax increases, and the government plans to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers by 2029.</p>

          <p>During a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Representative Linda Sanchez (D-CA) accused Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent of interrupting her due to her gender, sparking audible reactions in the room. The exchange occurred during a tense questioning session regarding the impact of tariffs enacted under President Trump’s administration. Sanchez claimed that Trump’s tariffs have increased household costs, while Bessent defended the administration’s trade policies.

The detailed observations, including the star's size and brightness, have helped researchers narrow down the star's possible position.

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans has decreased by 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, even after his time running the Department of Government Efficiency. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has fallen to 62%. The poll reveals a deep divide between Republican and Democratic voters regarding Musk, who contributed significantly to President Trump's re-election campaign. Musk's public falling out with Trump over a spending bill and subsequent social media exchanges may have contributed to the decline in his favorability among Republicans.</p>

          <p>The government's recent Spending Review is being viewed as a gamble on long-term strategic investments amid an era of political volatility and public impatience. While long-term capital spending is expected to transform the public realm and boost economic potential, day-to-day spending faces limitations and cuts. This approach contrasts with the typical critique of short-termism in politics, as the government prioritizes strategic long-term goals over immediate gains. The success of this strategy hinges on the electorate's willingness to exercise patience as they await the benefits of these investments.</p>

This move is seen as a competitive advantage over the US and Singapore, potentially attracting digital asset firms and investors to the city. With China's restricted cryptocurrency use, Hong Kong hopes to secure a prominent spot in the stablecoin market, dominated by US dollar-backed tokens, and strengthen its financial influence in the digital era.</p>
