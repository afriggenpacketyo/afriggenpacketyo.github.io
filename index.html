          <p>Jurors in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs have become deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering after reaching verdicts on four other counts. Legal experts suggest the complexity of the RICO charge is likely a major factor for the jury's inability to reach a unanimous decision. The defense's strategy of not calling any witnesses is described as "high stakes poker," as it relies solely on creating reasonable doubt from the prosecution's case. The judge has instructed the jury to continue deliberations to try and resolve the impasse.</p>

Instead, resources would be focused on the next-generation 14A process to better compete with rival TSMC for major clients like Apple and Nvidia.

The chaotic episode has weakened the Prime Minister's authority, drawn comparisons to more fraught political eras, and led to questions about his leadership and the future of his Chancellor.

          <p>President Donald Trump toured a newly constructed migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, which has been nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The remote center, surrounded by swampland, was built quickly by the state of Florida to support the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies. Trump praised the facility's rapid construction and its secure, isolated location, suggesting the surrounding alligators serve as natural "bodyguards." The site, which can house up to 3,000 people, is part of a broader plan to expand detention capacity to facilitate mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data indicates that the number of migrants apprehended for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped to a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded apprehensions. This continues a significant lull in illegal immigration that the Trump administration credits to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced enforcement measures. For the second consecutive month, no apprehended migrants were released into the U.S. The figures represent a dramatic decrease from the peak levels seen under the previous administration and are the lowest reported in decades.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tesla fell by 7% ahead of its second-quarter delivery report, with the drop coinciding with a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The feud ignited after Musk criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," arguing it would worsen the national deficit and harm renewable energy incentives crucial for Tesla. Trump responded by suggesting Musk could lose significant government contracts for his various companies, including SpaceX. The conflict adds another layer of uncertainty for Tesla, which is already facing expectations of a year-over-year decline in vehicle deliveries. (not investment advice)</p>

However, it also proposes deep cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid and allocates $170 billion for defense and border security.

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing confidential Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that federal health officials unlawfully transferred sensitive informationâ€”including names, addresses, and immigration statusâ€”to be used for immigration enforcement. The states argue this action violates federal privacy laws, upends decades of policy, and creates a climate of fear that could deter people from seeking essential medical care. The suit seeks to halt the data sharing and compel the destruction of any information already transferred.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer noted that among the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, only Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta managed to end the first half of 2025 at all-time highs. He explained that Microsoft rebounded due to strong growth in its Azure cloud business. Nvidia overcame concerns about competition and US government sales restrictions because of the persistent, unrivaled demand for its superior AI chips. Cramer attributed Meta's success to its surprisingly strong quarterly earnings and powerful advertising capabilities, which allowed it to recover from an earlier decline. (not investment advice)</p>
