          <p>President Trump has announced his nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer prominent in the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as the next U.S. Surgeon General. Means, a former surgeon turned metabolic health advocate, is expected to work closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to address chronic diseases and promote overall health. Means' background includes a medical degree from Stanford and co-founding Levels, a health tracking app, but she is not board-certified in a medical specialty and has expressed controversial views on vaccines and glucose. Her nomination signals a continued focus on alternative health perspectives within the administration.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government, under President Claudia Sheinbaum, is suing Google for allegedly changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps, following a decree by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexico asserts that Google should label the waters corresponding to Mexican and Cuban territories as the Gulf of Mexico. Google claims the change aligns with its policy of reflecting official U.S. government geographic designations. The Mexican Foreign Ministry had previously requested Google not to apply the Gulf of America label to Mexican waters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is embarking on his first major foreign trip of his second term, prioritizing business deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. This focus comes as his administration faces challenges in brokering peace in Gaza and addressing other regional conflicts. Trump aims to highlight Saudi Arabia's pledge to invest $600 billion in the U.S. and the UAE's commitment to $1.4 trillion in investments. Experts suggest these deals serve to strengthen ties and potentially insulate the Gulf leaders from criticism regarding other sensitive issues, like the ongoing conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir has escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, bringing the two nuclear-armed nations to the brink of war. Recent exchanges of missiles and drone strikes have intensified the decades-old conflict over the Kashmir region. Both countries accuse each other of escalating the crisis, with Pakistan claiming numerous civilian casualties from Indian strikes, while India asserts it targeted militant camps. The rivalry stems from the partition of India in 1947 and the ongoing dispute over the Kashmir region, which both nations claim in full but control only in part.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened tensions over the Kashmir region, the Indian government has ordered the blocking of thousands of social media accounts and imposed restrictions on news portals, raising concerns about free speech. The government claims the measures are necessary to combat misinformation and maintain national security, but press freedom activists have condemned the move as censorship. The blocked accounts include those of prominent Pakistani journalists and several Indian news organizations. Critics argue that the restrictions limit access to reliable information and create an environment ripe for false narratives.</p>

This statement comes amidst ongoing interest from the U.S., particularly from President Trump, in acquiring the autonomous Danish territory. Denmark summoned the top American diplomat in the country for an explanation after reports surfaced that U.S. officials were collecting information on Greenland's independence movement and views on U.S. resource extraction.

Lei said he was feeling down, cancelled some meetings and business trips, and stopped interacting on social media for a while. The post followed weeks of intense public scrutiny regarding the safety of Xiaomi’s driving-assistance system. Lei, who has more than 26 million followers on Weibo, has been relatively quiet since last month.</p>

The two leaders communicate frequently, often bypassing formal diplomatic channels, to discuss strategic matters and offer personal support. Macron's early support for Zelensky's presidency helped to legitimize him on the world stage, and while there have been periods of frustration over the pace of French weapons deliveries, their bond has deepened, particularly after Macron's visit to Kyiv.

          <p>A Nigerian Doctor Who fan, Adesoji Kukoyi, expressed his delight that the show will, for the first time, be set in Nigeria, specifically in Lagos. Kukoyi, who has been watching Doctor Who since his childhood in the 1980s, was thrilled to see the preview featuring a Lagos marketplace. The episode marks the first time the show has been primarily set in Africa, which is fitting given that nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s were unearthed in a Nigerian TV facility in 2013. The episode is expected to showcase Nigerian culture and folklore, with a mysterious character called the Barber and a towering spider.</p>

          <p>As China and the United States engage in formal trade talks for the first time since the resurgence of their trade war, analysts are offering a range of predictions. Ideal scenarios involve a deal that de-escalates current tariff rates, while worst-case scenarios include one or both parties walking out without consensus, potentially sending markets into turmoil. Optimistic forecasts suggest a pause in import duties, similar to the 90-day suspension offered previously, to create a timeline for negotiating the tariffs. Since Trump's return, the US has significantly raised tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory duties from China.</p>

          <p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been strategically working to make the world dependent on China's exports and technological know-how, a plan he initiated long before the trade war with the U.S. began. This strategy involves dominating supplies of essential goods to deter foreign interference and weaponizing the supply chain through export controls and blacklists. While this approach has strengthened China's position in some sectors, it has also strained relationships with trading partners and created economic challenges within China. Experts suggest that China's focus on state-controlled industries may hinder its long-term growth and global influence.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit and is now slowly spiraling back towards the planet. Experts estimate that the spacecraft, weighing approximately 1,050 pounds and equipped with a protective heat shield, has a good chance of surviving its descent through the atmosphere. While the exact landing location is unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude, covering a large portion of the Earth's surface.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple has returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to its rightful owner, a Japanese temple, after years of dispute. The statue was stolen from Kannonji Temple in Japan in 2012, but Buseoksa Temple in South Korea claimed it had been looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago. After a series of court rulings, including a Supreme Court decision, the statue was finally handed over to representatives of the Japanese temple. The statue was displayed to visitors for 100 days before its return.</p>
