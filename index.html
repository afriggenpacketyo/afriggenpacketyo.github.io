          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the American political spectrum, with figures like President Trump and former President Biden denouncing the act. The event has highlighted deep national divisions, which were evident even during a chaotic attempt to hold a moment of silence on the House floor. While many leaders have called for a reduction in political vitriol and a return to civil discourse, the immediate aftermath has also seen partisan finger-pointing regarding the rhetoric that may foster such violence.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their upcoming game, Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry has responded to comments from Cleveland Browns defensive back Grant Delpit, who downplayed the difficulty of tackling the famously powerful player. Delpit's remarks have added fuel to the AFC North rivalry, prompting Henry to state, "We'll see on Sunday." This exchange is part of a broader series of pre-game trash talk between the two teams, with players from both sides making pointed comments about their opponents' abilities, setting the stage for a highly anticipated matchup.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The verdict relates to his attempts to remain in power after losing the 2022 presidential election to his rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The court also barred Bolsonaro from running for public office until 2033, a decision that has drawn criticism from U.S. officials who called the prosecution a "witch hunt."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey of primary school teachers in England indicates a growing number of children are starting reception class without fundamental skills, such as being toilet-trained or able to speak in full sentences. Educators attribute this decline in school readiness partly to social isolation and increased screen time, which limit meaningful interactions. Schools are now dedicating more resources to provide extra support for speech and language development and are working collaboratively with parents to address these developmental gaps before they impact learning.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help parents navigate the common challenge of fussy eating, a child nutritionist suggests several strategies to make mealtimes less stressful. Key advice includes giving children autonomy by letting them choose what to eat from the options provided and refraining from labeling foods as "good" or "bad." The expert also recommends focusing on making the dinner table a fun, engaging environment and involving children in food preparation to foster familiarity and encourage them to try new things.</p>

          <p>A new immigration holding facility near Fort Bliss, Texas, designed to hold up to 5,000 people, has been described by Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar as a "giant tent city." After visiting the site, she raised concerns about detainee conditions, citing poor food quality that reportedly made people sick and a complete lack of information provided to those being held. The $1.24 billion facility is operated by a contractor with no prior public record of running detention centers, adding to worries about transparency and oversight.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old man in Los Angeles County has been arrested and charged with the murder of his one-year-old daughter. Authorities responded to a call about a child not breathing and discovered the toddler unresponsive in a vehicle, where she was pronounced dead. The father, Edwin Johnson, was initially arrested on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter and child neglect before sheriff's detectives requested the charge be elevated to murder, though specific details about the circumstances of the death have not been released.</p>

These destructive worms, which can also secrete a toxin irritating to humans and pets, pose a threat to soil health and native ecosystems. The public is being advised not to cut or squish them, as this causes them to multiply through regeneration, and to instead capture and dispose of them by freezing or drowning in soapy water.</p>

The suspect reportedly fired from a rooftop, a known vulnerability for open-air venues that are inherently more difficult to secure than indoor spaces with controlled access points. Security experts note that while campus police were present, preventing such an attack would have been extremely challenging without comprehensive surveillance of all surrounding high-ground positions, a measure not typically employed for such events.</p>
