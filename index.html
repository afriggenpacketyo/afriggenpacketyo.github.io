          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated musical satirist known for his witty and often controversial songs in the 1950s and 60s, has passed away at the age of 97. After a successful but relatively short-lived music career, where he tackled subjects like nuclear war and pollution, he returned to his other passion, teaching mathematics. His unique style of satirical songwriting, which often involved embracing the very things he detested to highlight their absurdity, influenced generations of comedians and musicians.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant from Honduras is facing homicide charges after allegedly causing a wrong-way, intoxicated-driving crash in Wisconsin that resulted in the deaths of two teenagers. The suspect, who had a prior drunk driving conviction, now has an ICE detainer lodged against her for deportation. The Department of Homeland Security has highlighted the case, criticizing what it terms "sanctuary jurisdiction" policies for contributing to the tragic event. The suspect is being held on a $250,000 bond per case.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have established a framework for a new trade deal, averting a potential trade war by setting a 15% tariff on all EU goods exported to the US. The agreement, announced after negotiations between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, also includes commitments for the EU to invest $600 billion in the US and purchase $750 billion in American energy. While both sides hailed the deal as a victory, it represents a significant step in rebalancing the transatlantic trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Human rights organizations in Argentina are facing significant challenges, including mass layoffs and funding cuts, under President Javier Milei's austerity-focused government. Agencies and memorials dedicated to documenting the crimes of the 1976-1983 military dictatorship, such as the ESMA Museum and the National Archive of Remembrance, have seen their staff drastically reduced. Prominent groups like the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, which works to identify children stolen during the dictatorship, have also had their government subsidies cut, jeopardizing their critical work in seeking truth and justice for victims.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the profound and complicated story of two Argentine siblings separated during the country's military dictatorship. Mariana Eva Pérez successfully located her brother, Guillermo, who was stolen as a newborn in 1978 after their parents were "disappeared" and murdered by the regime. The story details the emotional journey of their reunion, Guillermo's struggle to accept his true identity, and the painful reality that his adoptive father was involved in his biological mother's capture. Despite finding each other, their relationship remains fractured by two decades of vastly different lives and unresolved trauma.</p>

          <p>An investigation led by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully located a Skyvan aircraft used for "death flights" during Argentina's military dictatorship. The plane, which was used to drop political prisoners into the Atlantic Ocean, was found in the U.S. being used for skydiving excursions. Its flight logs provided irrefutable evidence of its sinister past, proving instrumental in the 2017 conviction of 48 former officials for crimes against humanity. The aircraft has since been returned to Argentina and is now displayed at the former ESMA detention center as a powerful symbol of state terrorism.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area is well-positioned to become a global leader in sustainable tourism. With significant investments in green technology, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system, the region has the necessary infrastructure. The author suggests that policymakers should now focus on creating a cohesive low-carbon tourism corridor that links cities through clean and smart travel options. This would not only advance environmental goals but also appeal to the growing number of modern travelers who prioritize sustainability.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, with transatlantic trade and the conflict in Gaza expected to be key topics. The leaders will likely discuss the recently agreed-upon US-UK trade deal, but Starmer also faces a delicate diplomatic task regarding Gaza. He must balance the UK's position with European allies, who are taking a more critical stance on Israel, against the position of the United States. The meeting underscores the complex geopolitical landscape the UK government is currently navigating between its key partners.</p>

          <p>The recently announced trade deal between the United States and the European Union is being analyzed as a political victory for both sides, though many specific details are yet to be revealed. For the EU, the agreed-upon 15% tariff is better than the 30% that was threatened, while the US secured significant investment commitments and tariff revenue. The agreement is a key part of President Trump's broader strategy to renegotiate global trade relationships. This article suggests the successful negotiation could provide momentum for the US ahead of upcoming trade talks with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May delivered a shaky performance in a 4-3 loss to the Boston Red Sox, fueling speculation as the MLB trade deadline nears. May, who is in his final year before free agency, gave up four runs over five innings, undone by a three-run fifth inning. The right-hander's inconsistent season and the team's pending rotation crunch have led to his name being mentioned in trade rumors. The start was a crucial final data point for the Dodgers' front office as they weigh their options before Thursday's deadline.</p>

Manager Sarina Wiegman praised Bronze's "crazy mentality," confirming the team had to manage the issue throughout the competition. Bronze was eventually substituted in extra time of the final after injuring her other leg, leaving the pitch in tears but as a European champion.</p>

          <p>Jordan and the UAE have resumed aid airdrops into Gaza, and truck convoys have entered from Egypt, following Israel's announcement of a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in some areas. The move is intended to allow more humanitarian supplies to reach the besieged population, where the World Health Organization warns malnutrition has reached "alarming levels." Despite the pause, medics reported that Israeli fire killed nine people near an aid route. The UN and other international bodies continue to stress that land routes are the only sustainable way to address the crisis.</p>
