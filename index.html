          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the only way to dismantle Hamas's remaining strongholds. He outlined goals including demilitarizing the enclave and installing a non-Israeli civilian administration, asserting Israel's intent is to "free Gaza," not occupy it. The plan has drawn international condemnation and concern for hostages and civilians, with the UN holding an emergency meeting and aid groups warning of a deepening humanitarian crisis. The article also notes the death of an Al Jazeera journalist in a concurrent Israeli strike, which the IDF later confirmed, alleging the journalist was a Hamas operative.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner addressed online criticism after she was condemned for attending an Oasis reunion concert without her children. After sharing photos from the event, a user commented that she had "forgotten" she has two kids, prompting Turner to clap back about the existence of shared custody. She explained that her children were likely with their father, her ex-husband Joe Jonas, on that day. The exchange, which drew widespread support from her fans, comes nearly a year after the couple finalized their divorce and custody agreement.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old tourist from New York, identified as Kevin Mares, was fatally shot in the La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Mares was visiting the island with friends to attend one of Bad Bunny's highly popular residency concerts. According to police, he was an innocent bystander caught in an argument between several other people, during which one individual opened fire, injuring two other local men. The incident highlights persistent safety concerns in the historically volatile but increasingly popular tourist area, which gained fame from the song "Despacito."</p>

          <p>A coalition of European leaders, including those from the EU, France, and Germany, issued a joint statement emphasizing that peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Kyiv's involvement. Their statement came in response to a planned one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war. While welcoming efforts to stop the fighting, the leaders stressed the need for a just peace and credible security guarantees for Ukraine. The White House has indicated it remains open to including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, but the meeting is currently set to be bilateral at Putin's request.</p>

The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with a one-stroke lead but finished tied for third after a late bogey.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This follows warnings that there are significantly more graduates than available positions, with about 4,000 more nursing and midwifery graduates than open jobs. While nursing unions welcomed the move cautiously, employer representatives raised concerns about how the additional staff would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old man who believed the COVID-19 vaccine had caused him to become depressed. White killed police officer David Rose before dying during the incident, though it is unclear if his death was self-inflicted. The suspect's father and neighbors confirmed his deep distrust of the vaccines, which he blamed for his health issues. In response, a CDC workers' union has demanded that federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, stating it fuels a climate of hostility and puts scientists at risk.</p>

In May 1945, just days before the war's end, the ship was packed with over 4,000 prisoners and anchored in the Baltic Sea. It was then mistakenly attacked and sunk by British Royal Air Force fighters who believed it was being used by fleeing Nazi officials, resulting in the deaths of nearly all prisoners aboard.

          <p>Liverpool's new-look team, featuring four summer signings in the starting lineup, was unveiled at the Community Shield match against Crystal Palace, which ended in a 2-2 draw and a penalty shootout loss for the Reds. New acquisitions Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong showed flashes of brilliance, with both scoring on their competitive debuts. However, the article notes that defensive vulnerabilities remain, as Liverpool twice surrendered leads and looked sloppy at the back. Manager Arne Slot acknowledged that the revamped team needs time to adapt, suggesting that while the attack looks promising, defensive reinforcements are still needed before the transfer window closes.</p>

Ahmed first took 2-23 with the ball to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest 124-9. He then contributed a crucial 31 runs with the bat during the chase, which the Rockets completed with four balls to spare. Despite a mid-innings wobble caused by the Superchargers' spinners, the Rockets' strong start and Ahmed's key partnership ensured they maintained their unbeaten record in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly pushed back against allegations from Chinese state-affiliated media that its H20 artificial intelligence chips represent a national security risk for China. An article on WeChat claimed the chips could be remotely shut down through a hardware "backdoor," a feature sometimes called a "kill switch." Nvidia issued a strong denial, stating that cybersecurity is critically important and that its chips do not contain any such backdoors. This exchange marks an escalation in tensions over U.S. semiconductor export controls, even as Nvidia has resumed shipping the less-advanced H20 chips, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>A man in Austria survived a dangerous ride by clinging to the outside of a high-speed train after it departed a station without him. The incident occurred in Sankt Poelten when the passenger, reportedly a 24-year-old Algerian man, was taking a cigarette break on the platform and missed the train's departure. He jumped into the space between two carriages and began banging on windows to get attention, prompting the conductor to perform an emergency stop. A railway spokesman condemned the act as incredibly irresponsible, noting such actions usually result in death.</p>
