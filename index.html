          <p>Dutch semiconductor giant ASML aimed to reassure investors about its 2026 growth outlook, even as it forecasted a significant sales decline in China for the upcoming year. The company stated that 2026 total net sales would not be below 2025 levels and plans to offer more detailed guidance in January. While the firm benefits from the ongoing AI boom, with substantial third-quarter orders, it continues to navigate tightening U.S. chip export restrictions impacting its China business. Analysts generally hold a positive view, anticipating growth driven by AI chip foundries and increased global semiconductor manufacturing, despite some market volatility. The firm's recent partnership with a French AI company also highlights its strategic moves in the evolving tech landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets showed gains on Wednesday, diverging from Wall Street's declines, amidst a renewed trade dispute between the U.S. and China. U.S. President Donald Trump criticized China for not purchasing soybeans and threatened "retribution," including a cooking oil embargo. This geopolitical tension contributes to elevated market volatility, as noted by veteran investors. Simultaneously, China's consumer prices unexpectedly fell in September, with producer price deflation persisting, reflecting subdued domestic demand and trade uncertainties. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also hinted at a potential halt in bond holding reductions and future interest rate cuts, influencing global economic sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has recommended that veterinary practices be mandated to publish their prices. This initiative aims to provide pet owners with upfront cost information, enabling them to shop around for better deals, following an investigation into soaring vet costs. The CMA found that vet prices have risen at nearly double the inflation rate over seven years, and that practices owned by large groups charge significantly more than independent ones. Proposed measures include revealing group ownership, capping prescription fees, and banning bonuses for specific treatments, addressing concerns that pet owners are often kept in the dark about potential expenses, as illustrated by a £12,000 unexpected bill for one dog's surgery.</p>

          <p>"Big John" Fisher, a British social media personality known for his viral fast-food reviews and signature catchphrase "bosh," has been detained in Australia due to a visa issue. Fisher, who had arrived in Western Australia for a scheduled tour, stated via social media that he would be deported to London, despite believing his visa was "legit." Australian authorities reportedly deemed his visa inappropriate for working during his visit. He is now spending his 52nd birthday in a detention hotel awaiting deportation, expressing disappointment but maintaining his love for Australia. His son, British heavyweight boxer Johnny Fisher, confirmed the situation, adding a lighthearted comment.</p>

          <p>Team GB track cyclist Jack Carlin has announced his retirement from the sport at 28, citing a loss of motivation after the last summer's Olympic Games. Despite a successful career including four Olympic medals and 19 international accolades, Carlin felt unable to "ignite that spark again" following a severe crash in his final Olympic event and a subsequent period of recovery and travel. He expressed feeling "daunted but excited" by the decision, concluding his "whirlwind 10 years" content with his achievements. Carlin, now exploring new identities beyond "Jack the cyclist," has rediscovered a love for golf and is considering future career paths outside professional sport.</p>

          <p>The UK's independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have urged the government to prepare for at least 2C of global warming by 2050. The committee warned that the country is "not yet adapted" to existing weather extremes, let alone future projections. They recommended establishing a framework of clear long-term objectives, with five-year targets and departmental accountability, to prevent further temperature rise. Baroness Brown, chairwoman of the CCC's adaptation committee, criticized recent political pledges to scrap climate change legislation, emphasizing the need for ambition in adaptation efforts. The UK can expect increased heatwaves, drought, flooding, and extended wildfire seasons.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, has resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, with officials warning the toll could increase. The victims' bodies, severely burnt, will require DNA testing for identification before being handed over to distraught families. The blaze, which started at the factory and spread to an adjacent chemical warehouse, was exacerbated by lax safety standards and poor infrastructure, common issues in Bangladesh. Most deaths were attributed to toxic gas inhalation and locked exit doors. Authorities are investigating the factory and warehouse owners, as the chemical warehouse reportedly lacked fire safety clearance and proper operating licenses, highlighting systemic safety failures.</p>

Significant work remains on the framework for Gaza's demilitarization and governance. Cracks are already appearing in the ceasefire, with disputes over the return of hostage bodies and renewed clashes.

          <p>Royal Mail has been fined £21 million by Ofcom, the communications watchdog, after failing to meet its delivery targets for both first and second-class post in the 2024/25 financial year.

This marks the third significant fine for the company in recent years, prompting Ofcom to warn of further penalties unless a credible improvement plan is urgently implemented. Royal Mail acknowledged the decision and stated it is working to improve service quality, citing changes in recruitment and training. The fine was reduced by 30% due to Royal Mail's admission of failings.</p>

The High Court ruled that while the Migration Act provisions burdened political communication, they served a legitimate purpose in protecting the community from visitors who might "stir up dissension."

The Pentagon previously declared the U.S. in "armed conflict" with cartels, deeming them a national security threat. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, facing U.S. allegations of drug trafficking, believes these actions are an attempt to force him out, while some experts question the legality of destroying boats under laws of war.</p>

Despite controlling possession and creating more chances, the USA faced a physical Australian side, leading to some heated moments and a scuffle between teams. This article details the key moments of the game, highlighting individual performances and the USA's resilience as they continue preparations for next year's World Cup.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles is hearing arguments on the legality of the Trump administration's maneuvers to install Bill Essayli as the "acting" United States attorney, bypassing Senate confirmation. Defense attorneys are seeking to dismiss indictments and disqualify Essayli, arguing the process circumvents constitutional protections. The judge questioned the broad consequences of such dismissals, noting 203 indictments since Essayli's "acting" designation. The challenge highlights concerns about the limitless appointment of temporary officials, drawing parallels to similar legal battles in New Jersey and Nevada. Essayli's multiple designations as "special attorney" and "first assistant" further complicate the legal interpretation of his authority.</p>

          <p>Scholars suggest that escalating US-China trade tensions, characterized by sanctions, export controls, and tariff threats, could paradoxically strengthen Beijing's resolve. According to one economic researcher, external pressure aligns with China's national character, transforming into motivation. The latest friction points include the shipping sector, with both nations imposing port fees and Beijing sanctioning a South Korean shipping giant for alleged collaboration with US efforts. This article indicates that China plans to emphasize a long-term, steady strategy at an upcoming Communist Party plenum, signaling a commitment to its economic plans without yielding to US pressure, despite months of negotiations and temporary truces.

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly expressed his strong disapproval of a Time magazine cover photo featuring him, calling it "the Worst of All Time" and "super bad." Despite the accompanying article being a "relatively good story" about his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire, Trump criticized the photo's angle for making his hair "disappear" and creating a "floating crown" effect. This reaction highlights Trump's long-standing obsession with his image and appearances on Time's cover. The article notes that even Russia's foreign ministry director defended Trump's appearance, while a picture editor suggested the photo aimed for a sense of grandeur but was aesthetically unflattering for the subject.</p>

          <p>A TV advertisement by Red Tractor, the UK's largest certifier of farm products, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for exaggerating its environmental benefits. The ASA ruled that Red Tractor provided "insufficient evidence" to substantiate claims that its farms ensured a high degree of environmental protection, citing a report that found these farms were "not currently an indicator of good environmental performance." Environmental group River Action, which filed the complaint, accused the scheme of "greenwashing" and urged supermarkets to stop using it. Red Tractor, however, called the decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is animal welfare and food safety, not environmental standards.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the visas of six individuals from various countries for making "incendiary" social media comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The State Department stated that the U.S. is not obligated to host foreigners who wish death upon Americans, inviting the public to report concerning posts. This action is part of a broader crackdown, which has also seen the Pentagon and Secret Service sideline personnel for negative comments about Kirk's death. The article notes legal experts question the government's power to revoke visas based on speech, highlighting unsettled constitutional issues regarding non-citizens' First Amendment protections.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government is under increasing pressure from Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties to publish evidence related to the recently collapsed case against two individuals accused of spying for China. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) clarified it would not obstruct the release of the evidence, contradicting earlier government suggestions that it would be "inappropriate." The case collapsed because key government witness statements, concerning whether China was deemed a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses, could not be obtained. This article highlights calls for transparency and questions about the government's stance on China, with implications for national security and political accountability.</p>

The declaration, passed by a 4-1 vote, empowers the county to mobilize resources, seek state and federal aid, and expedite contracts for legal assistance and rent relief. Supervisors stated that the raids have caused "widespread fear," disrupted local economies, and strained essential services for over 3 million immigrants in the county.

          <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in the case of Pedro Hernandez, convicted of murdering Etan Patz, after a federal appeals court ordered a retrial or release due to a trial judge's error. Patz, who went missing in 1979, became the first missing child featured on a milk carton, changing national responses to such cases. Hernandez, 64, is serving a 25-year-to-life sentence, with his conviction largely based on confessions despite a history of mental illness and low IQ. The appeals court found the jury instruction regarding the voluntariness of his confessions was "clearly wrong" and "manifestly prejudicial."</p>
