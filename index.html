          <p>Donald Trump is visiting his two golf resorts in Scotland, a trip combining personal business with official duties, including a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The visit is notable for a sitting U.S. president so openly promoting private interests, drawing criticism as global crises continue. A massive security operation is in place to manage the visit and expected protests, with local debate stirred by his pro-oil commentary. The trip highlights Trump's ongoing entanglement of his business empire with his political career.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has urged the European Union to foster a healthy economic relationship built on both cooperation and competition. Speaking at a business symposium with EU leaders, Li emphasized that collaboration is the "only right choice" for both sides after 50 years of diplomatic ties. He suggested focusing on mutual growth in areas like services trade, green technology, and technological innovation. Li also positioned a strong EU-China partnership as a stabilizing force for global trade and supply chains against rising protectionism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, becoming the first G7 nation to take this step. The decision was framed as part of France's commitment to a just peace and was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israel as a "reward for terror." The move has also been criticized by the United States, which called it "reckless." This development increases pressure on other Western nations, including the UK, to reconsider their own positions on Palestinian statehood amid the ongoing Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>University of Southern California football coach Lincoln Riley states he feels "refreshed and recharged" entering his fourth season, despite mounting pressure after a disappointing 7-6 record last year. Riley attributes his improved mindset to a more stable program structure and a strong front office, allowing him to focus on refining the team rather than making major overhauls. He expresses confidence in the team's progress, particularly on defense, and in new starting quarterback Jayden Maiava. The program's top-ranked 2026 recruiting class is cited as evidence of strong internal momentum.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order aimed at imposing federal oversight on college sports, specifically targeting athlete compensation and scholarship allocation. The order directs federal agencies to enforce new rules designed to protect non-revenue and women's sports by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels. It also seeks to regulate "pay-for-play" name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, which have transformed college athletics. The move comes after a legal settlement allowed direct payments to players, raising fears that football and basketball would absorb all resources.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has reported the first-ever direct experimental observation of quantum friction between two solid surfaces. The scientists discovered that when studying folded layers of graphene, friction did not always increase with thickness and, in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how the material's bending altered electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. The findings could have significant implications for designing highly efficient, low-wear nanodevices and advanced quantum materials.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of charges of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge ruled that the testimony of the complainant, known as EM, was not "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The central issue of the trial was whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, had also consented to subsequent sexual acts with the other four who entered the room. The players' lawyers argued they believed she consented, while she testified she was intoxicated and fearful.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, age 45, was defeated in the second round of the DC Open, ending her bid for a first multi-match winning streak since 2019. She lost to Poland's Magdalena Frech in straight sets. Williams' first-round victory had made her the oldest woman to win a WTA tour-level match in two decades, a significant achievement after a long absence from the sport due to surgery. Despite the loss, the crowd showed strong support for the seven-time Grand Slam champion, who received a standing ovation as she left the court.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the profound challenges faced by individuals deported from the United States, many of whom are sent to a country they are now unfamiliar with after decades away. It follows the stories of people like Juan Carlos, who lived in the U.S. for 19 years, and Uliser, who chose to self-deport to Mexico after prison to avoid being sent to a more dangerous third country. Nonprofits in Tijuana work to help the newly arrived integrate, but resources are strained. The report notes that while deportations are high, they have not reached the one million annual target set by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The suicide prevention charity Samaritans is planning to close more than 100 of its 200-plus branches across the UK and Ireland over the next decade. The charity's leadership argues that maintaining so many physical locations is not sustainable and that consolidating into fewer, larger regional hubs will improve service delivery. However, the proposal has sparked significant concern among the charity's volunteers. Many fear the move will lead to an exodus of volunteers, undermine the supportive in-person culture, and create impersonal call centers, potentially harming the vital service they provide.</p>

          <p>The UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) has issued a dire warning that one in five children in Gaza City is now malnourished, with cases increasing daily. Unrwa's commissioner-general described people in Gaza as "walking corpses," citing reports that over 100 people, mostly children, have died of hunger. The report is echoed by over 100 international aid organizations warning of mass starvation. Israel maintains there is no siege and blames Hamas for malnutrition, but aid workers on the ground describe a catastrophic famine where even obtaining basic food has become a life-threatening endeavor.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts is being protected by an unprecedented security operation, described as the most extensive in Scotland since the late Queen's death. Following a recent assassination attempt in the US, the threat level is exceptionally high, with an estimated 5,000 police officers, sniper teams, and US Secret Service agents deployed. A 15-foot metal barrier has been erected around the Turnberry resort, and measures reportedly include a personal chef to prevent poisoning. This massive security presence has transformed the small villages hosting the president into fortified zones.</p>

The council chairman dismissed the president's comments as a "distraction" and expressed confidence the deal will pass. The agreement is seen as a major step toward bringing the NFL team back to the district, with proponents touting its potential for job creation and economic investment.</p>

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges who were recently fired by email have spoken out, describing their terminations as arbitrary, unfair, and an "attack on the rule of law." The judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases, claim they received no explanation for their dismissals. They also alleged they were pressured by the administration on how to rule in certain cases to facilitate easier apprehension of immigrants by ICE agents outside the courtroom. Their accounts add to reports that over 100 immigration judges have been fired or have left their posts under the Trump administration, raising concerns about judicial independence.</p>

Watson, an undrafted rookie from Florida, weighed 464 pounds at his pro day and has been working with a team nutritionist.
