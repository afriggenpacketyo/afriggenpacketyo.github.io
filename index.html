          <p>The Supreme Court upheld a Biden administration rule regulating ghost guns, a victory for federal efforts to curb gun violence. The 7-2 decision found the rule consistent with federal firearms law, rejecting arguments that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives overstepped its authority. The ruling clarifies the definition of 'firearm' under the Gun Control Act of 1968.</p>
