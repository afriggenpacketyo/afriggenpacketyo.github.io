          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 18:13:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump Treasury Department has implemented new sanctions targeting key members of the Cartel del Noreste (CDN), identified as a foreign terrorist organization. These sanctions aim to block the U.S. assets of Miguel Angel de Anda Ledezma and Ricardo Gonzalez Sauceda, disrupting CDN's violent activities, including intimidation, kidnapping, and terrorism along the southern border. According to Paul Perez of the National Border Patrol Council, these actions create a power vacuum within the cartel, potentially leading to infighting and weakening the organization. He emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to protecting American citizens and decimating cartel activity. The sanctions are viewed as a significant step in addressing the threat posed by cartels to border security and public safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will remain headquartered in Pittsburgh. This arrangement, reversing Biden's block on Nippon Steel's bid, is projected to create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Nippon Steel confirmed its commitment to protecting American workers and national security, while U.S. Steel's CEO previously warned that blocking the deal could lead to the company pivoting away from Pittsburgh. While the specifics of the partnership remain unclear, the announcement caused U.S. Steel shares to jump, and Trump plans to hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh to celebrate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meme coin dinner, an exclusive event for top holders of his cryptocurrency, has been criticized for its underwhelming experience despite the opulence on display. Attendees who spent a combined $148 million on the token reported that "the food sucked" and that security was lax. Trump made a brief appearance, re-hashing crypto talking points, but did not interact with most guests. Some attendees expressed disappointment and noted that many were checking their phones during the dinner to monitor the coin's price, which had plunged 16% that morning.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily shielded the Trump administration from a lower court ruling that required Elon Musk’s government efficiency team, DOGE, to release internal documents. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued a stay to allow the full court to consider the administration's argument that DOGE is exempt from public records laws. The case stems from a lawsuit by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which seeks information about Musk's team. The administration argues that DOGE is a presidential advisory body and not a federal agency, thus exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled upcoming concerts due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. NPH occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, leading to walking difficulties, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition, which is more common with age, is often underdiagnosed due to its symptoms being mistaken for normal aging. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt that drains excess fluid, and physical therapy to improve gait stability. The prognosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment, with surgery potentially reversing symptoms.</p>

          <p>Eight individuals have been found guilty in connection with the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris, where millions of dollars' worth of jewelry were stolen. The four who directly participated in the heist received sentences of up to eight years, but these sentences were largely suspended due to time already served. Kardashian stated that the crime was the most terrifying experience of her life but expressed belief in growth and accountability. The defendants, dubbed the "Grandpa robbers," were spared harsher sentences due to their age and health conditions, though prosecutors emphasized the seriousness of their actions.</p>

          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's location during the construction of a new control tower. The incident, combined with a previous fatal midair collision, has raised concerns about safety near the airport. The Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to address these issues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block is unconstitutional, permanently blocking its enforcement. Judge John Bates found that the order infringed on the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments, characterizing parts of it as a "screed" expressing animosity towards the firm. The order, which instructed officials to review and revoke security clearances and terminate government contracts, was seen as retaliation for the firm's legal challenges against Trump's policies. The ruling marks the second legal setback for the administration in its efforts to punish law firms critical of its policies.</p>

Russia's confirmation of North Korea's troop deployment to Russia, timed with the Victory Day events, further emphasizes this alignment. This alignment poses a challenge to the post-war order, potentially allowing other actors like Donald Trump to reinsert themselves into the global conversation.</p>
