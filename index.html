          <h2>Seven Children Killed in India After Monsoon Rains Cause School Roof to Collapse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 10:08:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least seven children died and twenty others were injured after a school roof collapsed in Rajasthan, India. The incident occurred during the morning assembly, trapping students under the debris of the single-story building. While a recent safety survey had not flagged the building as unsafe, officials suspect that weeks of heavy monsoon rains contributed to the structural failure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the event as tragic, and authorities have launched a detailed investigation to determine responsibility for the collapse.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has stated that the National Health Service (NHS) faces a difficult period as resident doctors in England commence a five-day strike over pay. While senior doctors are providing cover, the walkout is expected to cause significant disruption, though efforts are being made to continue non-urgent services. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that doctors' pay has decreased by a fifth since 2008 when accounting for inflation, and they criticize the government for not negotiating on salary. Previous strikes have led to over a million canceled appointments and operations.</p>

          <p>A provision from the 2021 American Rescue Plan that made student loan forgiveness tax-free at the federal level is set to expire at the end of 2025. Unless Congress acts, borrowers who have their debts canceled under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans could face significant tax bills starting in 2026. Experts note that forgiven debt is typically treated as taxable income by the IRS, which could result in thousands of dollars in taxes for the average borrower on an IDR plan. Consumer advocates criticize this policy, arguing it unfairly burdens struggling borrowers with a new form of debt. (not investment advice)</p>

A key area of concern is the competition for critical raw materials essential for green and digital technologies, where China has established a dominant position.

          <p>Mental health experts are drawing attention to the underdiagnosis of depression in older adults, which is often mistakenly attributed to the normal aging process. While symptoms are largely the same across age groups, depression in the elderly can present with more physical complaints, leading to misdiagnosis by both patients and doctors. Stigma also remains a significant barrier for older generations to seek help. Treatment is complicated by the fact that older patients are often on multiple medications for physical ailments, which can interact with antidepressants. Experts stress the importance of early diagnosis and addressing mental health concerns alongside physical ones.</p>

Peltola was flying solo after transporting hunters and was carrying a load of moose meat that pushed the plane nearly 120 pounds over its maximum gross weight. Additionally, moose antlers had been strapped to the plane's wing strut, creating an "unapproved external load" that degraded flight performance. According to the report, these factors led to a loss of control shortly after takeoff, resulting in the fatal crash.</p>

          <p>Doctors and humanitarian aid workers in Gaza are reporting a grim and escalating hunger crisis, with widespread malnutrition disproportionately affecting children. The Hamas-run Health Ministry stated that 113 people, including 81 children, have died from hunger since the war began. Organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) report that 25% of children and pregnant women they screen are malnourished, and cases of severe malnutrition in young children have tripled in two weeks. Aid groups warn that the territory is on the precipice of mass starvation, as their own staff struggle to find food while treating an increasing number of malnourished patients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release talks is in doubt after both the U.S. and Israeli negotiating teams withdrew from discussions in Doha, Qatar. A U.S. envoy stated that Hamas's response to the latest proposal showed a "lack of desire" to reach an agreement, while Hamas expressed surprise at the "negative" remarks. The proposed 60-day ceasefire involved the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but disagreements remain over aid distribution and a permanent end to the war. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen, with the UN warning of man-made mass starvation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect and grow their money, with top rates currently exceeding the rate of inflation. CDs allow savers to lock in a fixed interest rate for a specific term and are considered safe investments, typically insured up to $250,000. While national average CD yields are modest, online banks often provide much more competitive rates, with some one-year CDs offering APYs above 4.40%. Financial experts suggest that savers can get the best returns by comparing offers from online banks and considering short-term CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor in affordability. As of late July 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.79%, while a 15-year loan averages around 6.01%. Experts note that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. To get the best possible rate, financial advisors recommend strengthening one's credit score, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders rather than only using one's current bank.

Black, who was elected as the UK's youngest MP in 2015 at age 20, had already stepped down from Parliament before the last election. She stated that there were "too many times" she did not agree with the party's decisions and felt it needed to change more, though she remains a supporter of Scottish independence.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has lowered its financial guidance for the year after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter profit. The company attributed the decline to the disruptive impact of U.S. tariffs and significant restructuring costs. The tariffs alone cost Volkswagen €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) in the first half of the year, contributing to a revised forecast for its operating return on sales. The results highlight the vulnerability of European carmakers to global trade disputes, particularly President Trump's import tariffs, which have created high uncertainty and squeezed profit margins across the automotive sector.

While a vast majority of UN members support Palestinian statehood, key Western powers like the U.S., Canada, and Australia have withheld formal recognition, advocating for it only as part of a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel.

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the formal nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey. This procedural move clears a legal hurdle, enabling her to serve in the role in an acting capacity. The decision came after a federal court in New Jersey had moved to replace Habba, whose initial 120-day interim appointment was expiring, with her deputy. Attorney General Pam Bondi sharply criticized the judges' intervention, and by withdrawing the Senate nomination, the administration sidesteps a law that would have prevented Habba from continuing to serve as the acting head of the office.</p>

In a letter to the DHS Secretary, lawmakers expressed concern that concealing identities erodes public trust, violates due process, and makes it difficult to distinguish legitimate officers from criminals impersonating them. The letter cites several instances where criminals have posed as ICE agents to commit robberies and other crimes.
