          <p>Vice President JD Vance warned that Europe faces a potential 'civilizational suicide' due to issues like mass migration, rising violent crime, and struggling economies. The UK's economy has stagnated, and migration is causing social friction. France's economy is slowing, with migration also posing challenges. Germany is in a recession, and migration has surged, leading to political tensions. Italy has seen economic growth and a decrease in illegal migration due to stricter border controls, while Poland's economy is growing, and it maintains low asylum requests, with Hungary seeing low migration rates and a recovering economy.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant win at the Japanese Grand Prix, but McLaren faced strategic difficulties, particularly with tire wear and pit stop timing. McLaren attempted to undercut Verstappen but were thwarted by Mercedes' strategy with George Russell, forcing them to pit Oscar Piastri early. Lando Norris's pit stop was faster, but Verstappen maintained his lead. McLaren acknowledged that resurfacing the track impacted their tire wear advantage, making it harder to challenge Verstappen's pole position.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of tariffs on developing countries in Asia, including Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Laos, is raising concerns about their economic stability. These tariffs, which are not reciprocal, could exacerbate debt crises and lead to social dislocation. Countries like Sri Lanka, already bailed out by the IMF, face significant challenges in meeting the conditions of their bailout deals. Multinational brands may shift production to countries with lower tariff rates, potentially causing mass layoffs in affected economies.&#x20;</p>

          <p>An Afrikaner from South Africa expresses bewilderment at Donald Trump and Elon Musk's claims that Afrikaners are facing genocide and oppression, leading to an offer of special refugee status in the United States. The author argues that Afrikaners are generally better off today than before 1994, with a progressive constitution, rule of law, and an independent judiciary. The author suggests that Trump's interest stems from concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in South Africa. The author and fellow Afrikaners are bemused by the offer of refugee status, seeing themselves as Africans and rejecting foreign interference.</p>

The program aimed to install new heating and cooling systems, windows, and siding, but the funding pause has left the project in limbo, forcing residents to rely on fans and portable air conditioners.

          <h2>Trump's Third Term Talk Sparks Debate Over Constitutional Limits</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump's suggestion that he could seek a third term as president, despite constitutional limits, has ignited debate and concern. While legal experts dismiss any credible legal basis for a third term, Trump's comments have been interpreted as a trial balloon to test the waters. Some fear that the idea could gain traction within the Maga movement, potentially leading to a constitutional crisis. Democrats are moving to counter Trump's remarks and reaffirm support for the 22nd amendment.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn of Risks as Student Loan Program Moves to SBA</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are expressing concerns that the Trump administration's decision to move the federal student loan program to the Small Business Administration (SBA) will put borrowers at risk. The SBA's lack of experience with student loans and planned staff cuts could lead to poor service and increased defaults. The move comes amid changes to borrower repayment plans and rising costs of living, creating a challenging environment for student borrowers. Critics argue that the decision is unlikely to save the government money and could destabilize the student loan system.</p>

          <p>People and properties have been evacuated as a wildfire has spread over a large area of forest in Galloway, in the south west of Scotland. Emergency services were initially called to Glen Trool at about 23:50 on Friday, with police urging people to avoid the area. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said two crews remained on the scene on Sunday morning, with helicopters continuing to water bomb the area. Rising temperatures across the UK have led to wildfire warnings being put in place for several parts of the country.</p>

          <p>Treasury minister Darren Jones has declared that the era of globalisation has ended following the imposition of new tariffs by President Trump. This comes as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer considers state intervention to protect UK firms. The UK government is continuing its policy of not responding with counter-tariffs, as other countries have done, preferring a 'calm' approach focused on a UK-US trade deal. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch disagreed that globalisation was over and pointed to "great" trading relationships with other countries.</p>
