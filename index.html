          <p>A "No Kings Day" protest in downtown Los Angeles escalated when police deployed tear gas and flash-bangs after protesters allegedly threw objects at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building.  Protesters claimed the police initiated the violence, while law enforcement cited the throwing of rocks, bricks, and fireworks.  A citywide curfew remained in effect, and Mayor Karen Bass appealed for non-violent demonstrations. The protest was one of many across the country held in defiance of President Trump's policies.</p>
