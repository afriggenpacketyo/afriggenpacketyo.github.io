          <p>An NHS doctor and her husband have been sentenced to 10 months in jail for stealing and selling hospital-grade personal protective equipment (PPE) on eBay. The couple, Attiya and Omer Sheikh, made nearly £8,000 by selling items like face masks and gloves during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This occurred at a time when the NHS was facing critical shortages of such supplies. An investigation was launched after an NHS supplier noticed its products being sold online, leading to a search of the couple's home where stolen goods were discovered.</p>

          <p>The European Union has imposed sanctions on two Chinese regional banks, Suifenhe Rural Commercial Bank and Heihe Rural Commercial Bank, as part of its 18th sanctions package against Russia. The banks are accused of providing financial assistance that supports Russia's military actions. This move marks a significant step, as the EU has been hesitant to target Chinese entities directly over the war. Chinese officials had previously warned the EU against this action, signaling that Beijing would likely respond to the blacklisting of its financial institutions, which could further strain diplomatic and economic relations.</p>

          <h2>German Chancellor Criticizes Israeli Conduct in Gaza as Senior Clerics Visit After Church Strike</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has publicly stated that Israel's military approach in Gaza is "no longer acceptable," marking a rare and significant criticism from a staunch ally. He called for an immediate ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid as the death toll continues to rise. The statement coincided with a visit to Gaza by two of Jerusalem's most senior Christian clerics, who traveled to the region to offer support after a deadly Israeli airstrike hit the Holy Family Catholic Church. The strike, which Israel called a mistake, killed three people who were sheltering there.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a crucial election, far-right political parties in Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito are using rhetoric similar to Donald Trump's MAGA movement, focusing on issues such as unruly tourists and crimes allegedly committed by foreigners. This strategy aims to attract voters concerned about cultural norms and national identity, despite Japan's pressing need for foreign labor due to a declining birthrate. The trend highlights a rise in nationalist politics, mirroring similar movements in Europe and the United States.</p>

          <p>Chevron has won a critical arbitration case against its rival Exxon Mobil, resolving a dispute over valuable offshore oil assets in Guyana. The ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce affirms Chevron's right to proceed with its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation. Exxon had claimed a right of first refusal on Hess's 30% stake in the prolific Stabroek Block oil development. With the legal challenge overcome, the landmark deal is now expected to close, significantly expanding Chevron's portfolio with some of the world's most promising new oil discoveries.</p>

          <p>This article examines the enduring and dangerous influence of the 1978 novel "The Turner Diaries," labeled the "bible of the racist right." The book, which fantasizes about a violent race war and genocide, has served as a blueprint for domestic terrorists like Timothy McVeigh and inspired extremist groups. The analysis argues that the novel's hateful ideas have seeped into mainstream political discourse, resonating with the rhetoric of white grievance and anti-immigrant sentiment seen in contemporary politics.

          <p>Recent polling data suggests that American public opinion on immigration is becoming more positive, a phenomenon political analysts describe as a "thermostatic" reaction to President Trump's hardline policies. After years of growing anti-immigrant sentiment, a record 79% of Americans now view immigration as a good thing for the country, according to Gallup. Support for aggressive enforcement measures has declined, while backing for legalization proposals has increased. This shift indicates that while Trump's rhetoric was popular in theory, the practical implementation of his agenda may be pushing public sentiment in the opposite direction.</p>

A super-injunction was used to prevent media reporting.

          <p>The United Nations human rights office has received credible reports of widespread abuses, including summary executions and arbitrary killings, during recent sectarian violence in Suweida, Syria. The clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes have reportedly resulted in nearly 600 deaths. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk stated that alleged perpetrators include members of the interim government's security forces as well as local armed groups. The UN is calling for an immediate end to the bloodshed and for independent investigations to hold those responsible accountable for the atrocities.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, concluding the host's successful tenure since 2015. The network described the move as a financial decision, but the timing has fueled speculation about political motives. The cancellation was announced just days after Colbert publicly criticized CBS's parent company, Paramount, for its $16 million legal settlement with President Donald Trump, which Colbert called a "big fat bribe." This has led prominent critics and politicians to question whether the show was canceled for political reasons.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing control of a small Cessna 172 aircraft and causing a major security scare in Vancouver, Canada. The suspect allegedly threatened a flight instructor before flying the plane toward Vancouver's airport, prompting NORAD to scramble F-15 fighter jets. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated the man acted with an "ideological motive" to disrupt airspace. Social media posts linked to the suspect suggest a belief that he was a messiah sent to save humanity from climate change.</p>

          <p>A moment from a Coldplay concert has gone viral after the stadium's "kiss cam" focused on a couple who reacted with apparent horror instead of affection. The man and woman quickly separated, with the woman burying her face in her hands. Online sleuths identified the pair as Andy Byron, the married CEO of a software company, and Kristin Cabot, the company's head of human resources. The clip has fueled widespread online speculation that the two were having an affair, turning a lighthearted concert moment into a source of intense public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has responded to the European Union's latest sanctions package by stating that Russia has adapted and developed a "certain immunity" to such measures. A Kremlin spokesperson described the new restrictions, which target Russia's energy and banking sectors, as illegal and anti-Russian. However, he asserted that Russia will analyze the package to minimize its consequences and claimed that the sanctions are a "double-edged weapon" that also brings a negative effect for the countries imposing them. This defiant stance comes as the West continues to tighten economic pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has issued an amber warning for thunderstorms across parts of southeast and eastern England, cautioning of potential flash flooding and significant disruption. The forecast predicts torrential rain, with over a month's worth expected to fall in some areas within a few hours, accompanied by frequent lightning and large hail. While the heavy rain poses a risk of flooding, it is not expected to alleviate the country's ongoing drought conditions. The rapid runoff will likely overwhelm local drainage systems rather than replenishing depleted groundwater levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces are projected to increase by an average of 15% next year, a record-setting pace, according to a new KFF analysis. Experts attribute the steep rate hikes primarily to the scheduled expiration of enhanced federal subsidies, which were not extended in the recent Republican budget bill. The loss of these subsidies is expected to cause millions of healthier individuals to drop their coverage, leaving a sicker and more expensive patient pool for insurers to cover, thereby driving up costs for everyone.

          <p>The European Union has agreed on its 18th package of sanctions against Russia, which includes lowering the price cap on Russian crude oil. The new cap will be set at approximately $47.6 per barrel, a reduction from the previous $60 threshold. This measure, part of a G7-led effort, aims to further restrict Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine. The policy is designed to keep Russian oil flowing to global markets to prevent a supply shock while simultaneously limiting Moscow's profits from its energy exports.</p>

While the initial bonus is attractive, tax experts warn that the rules are complicated. The accounts function similarly to a traditional IRA, meaning funds are generally locked until age 59½ without a 10% penalty, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. This structure makes them less flexible than other savings vehicles like 529 college savings plans, which offer more tax advantages and fewer restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>
