          <p>A devastating school shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis tragically claimed the lives of two young children, aged eight and ten, and injured 17 others, including 14 children, with two in critical condition. The assailant, armed with a rifle, pistol, and shotgun, fired through church windows during a school service before dying from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara condemned the "sheer cruelty and cowardice" of the attack, while Mayor Jacob Frey lamented the violence in a place of worship and called for action beyond mere condolences. The incident, which occurred on the first week of school, has deeply impacted the community, prompting prayers from state and national leaders.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer remains highly optimistic about Apple's stock trajectory, despite its recent surge, citing significant potential from the upcoming iPhone 17 launch event on September 9th. He anticipates a new, slimmer iPhone model featuring Apple's first in-house modem chip could act as a major catalyst, drawing parallels to the successful MacBook Air introduction. Goldman Sachs analysts share this bullish outlook, forecasting an upside to iPhone revenues and reiterating a "buy" rating, driven by form factor updates and potential price increases for the Pro model. This positive sentiment follows Apple's substantial $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, helping to alleviate tariff concerns. Investors are also keenly awaiting further details on Apple's artificial intelligence strategy, which Cramer believes could involve a significant acquisition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice has reportedly accepted a six-game NFL suspension for his role in a high-speed crash on a Dallas highway that left several people injured. The 25-year-old previously pleaded guilty to two third-degree felony charges, including collision involving serious bodily injury and racing, resulting in a 30-day jail sentence and a $115,000 payment for victims' medical costs. The NFL imposed the ban following its own investigation, just a week before the Chiefs' season opener. This suspension means Rice will miss significant games, including a Super Bowl rematch against the Eagles and a high-profile match with the Ravens, making him eligible to return to the field in mid-October.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia, through its sovereign wealth fund's AI and data center company Humain, is investing billions to become the world's third-largest AI provider, behind the U.S. and China. Humain, launched in May, plans to deliver full-stack AI capabilities across data centers, infrastructure, and advanced AI models, with ambitious targets for gigawatt capacity by 2034. The kingdom faces challenges, including intense competition from the UAE, high costs for cooling data centers in the desert, and a significant talent gap for AI engineers. Despite these hurdles, Humain has secured major partnerships with chipmaking giants like AMD and Nvidia, and has committed $23 billion to strategic tech partnerships and a $10 billion venture fund.</p>

          <p>Ryanair plans to increase the bonus for staff who intercept passengers with oversized cabin bags from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag, effective this November, as announced by CEO Michael O'Leary. This policy aims to discourage the minority of travelers who attempt to bring larger-than-allowed carry-on luggage, ensuring smoother boarding processes and fewer flight delays. Ryanair is scrapping an €80 cap on how much staff can earn each month for catching people with bags that are too large, further incentivizing adherence to bag rules. Separately, O'Leary expressed strong skepticism regarding the UK's sustainable aviation fuel mandate, deeming it unachievable due to insufficient supply and describing SAF as "nonsense."</p>

          <p>German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has opened a new artillery ammunition factory in Unterlüss, Germany, with plans to become Europe's largest munitions production facility. The plant aims to ramp up production of 155mm caliber artillery shells to 350,000 units annually by 2027, addressing critical shortages for Ukraine and NATO members. High-profile attendees, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, highlighted the strategic importance of this €500 million investment.

This stance comes as Trump is expected to discuss a post-war vision for Gaza, and follows the UN's confirmation of famine in the region.

Best Buy, less reliant on China, executed a smaller freight front-loading compared to previous years. Discount retailer Five Below, despite significant exposure to Chinese imports, maintains flexibility in its inventory and sourcing to find optimal prices.

This decision results in a permanent reduction of monthly benefits, roughly 70% of the full amount, and also diminishes future cost-of-living adjustments. Furthermore, early claiming means missing out on delayed retirement credits, which offer an 8% annual increase for each year benefits are postponed until age 70, potentially leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost income over a 20-year retirement. It can also reduce survivor benefits for a spouse, making it crucial for higher earners to consider delaying. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man previously deported by error and now in immigration custody, is seeking asylum in the United States, his lawyer confirmed in court. A federal judge has extended a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting him to Uganda until at least October, ensuring he remains within 200 miles of the Maryland court for legal access. Abrego Garcia's legal team argues his detention and planned deportation are retaliation for challenging his previous wrongful removal to El Salvador. Despite a 2019 asylum denial due to late filing, an immigration judge found his claims of gang persecution credible, granting him protection from deportation to El Salvador.</p>

The timing capitalized on the significant public attention generated by the engagement. This follows a previous stock surge for American Eagle in July, attributed to a collaboration with actress Sydney Sweeney and a supportive comment from President Donald Trump, highlighting the impact of celebrity endorsements on the brand's market performance.

          <p>A podcast discussion with classicist Mary Beard explores the pervasive misuse of ancient Roman history in contemporary politics, particularly in drawing polemical comparisons for modern purposes. The article highlights how concepts like fascism, once thought buried, reemerge in new forms, thriving on the search for enemies and exploiting technology. Beard emphasizes the significant differences between ancient Rome and modern societies, noting Rome's lack of statistics, budgets, and a clear understanding of its own geography or economy. The discussion cautions against simplistic historical analogies, stressing that while history offers lessons, modern problems require solutions tailored to their unique American context, rather than relying on flawed comparisons to Roman emperors or events.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has implemented a sweeping global tariff program, with higher rates for countries with political grievances, arguing these taxes boost American manufacturing and protect jobs. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, passed on to consumers or leading to fewer imports, though a trade court ruling on Trump's authority is ongoing. Critics contend Trump uses tariffs as a negotiating tactic, making dramatic and sometimes contradictory policy statements. The article details specific tariffs on goods like steel and cars, and rates for countries including India, Brazil, and Vietnam, noting the UK negotiated a lower 10% rate. These policies have caused volatility in global markets and are contributing to US inflation, with companies like Adidas and Nike planning price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts were particularly astonished by the spikes being fused directly onto the bone, a unique feature among all known animals. The discovery suggests that early ankylosaurs in the Jurassic period might have developed such elaborate armor primarily for display, with these structures later evolving into more functional body protection against the massive carnivorous predators that emerged in the Cretaceous period.</p>

While Apple faces a potential 7% drop in pre-tax profits if these deals are blocked, some analysts believe Google could benefit in the long run by being freed from costly payments that no longer drive demand. The Justice Department aims to foster competition, but rivals like Microsoft have struggled to challenge Google's dominance, which some economists liken to a natural monopoly.
