          <p>Pfizer has raised its full-year adjusted profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and robust business performance. The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street estimates, largely driven by strong sales of its COVID-19 products and other key drugs. This optimistic forecast comes as the company navigates potential impacts from U.S. government pressures to lower drug prices and proposed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The company's stock saw a notable increase in premarket trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer being considered for the position of Federal Reserve Chair, as Bessent wishes to remain in his current role. Trump revealed that the list of potential candidates has been narrowed to four individuals, though he did not disclose their names. The announcement follows the recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, which provides Trump an opportunity to appoint another official to the board. Likely contenders are believed to include former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, both of whom favor lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>Recovery efforts are ongoing across Scotland after Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, left thousands of homes without electricity. Utility provider SSEN reported that while power has been restored to 50,000 homes, approximately 22,000 properties, primarily in the Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire, are still affected. The storm caused widespread disruption, including numerous train cancellations due to fallen trees on railway lines and the closure of major roads. Officials expect most customers to have power restored by Tuesday evening, but complex repairs may extend into Thursday for some localized areas.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Jeremy Corbyn has publicly criticized his former Labour colleague, Angela Rayner, for authorizing the sale of eight community allotment sites since the general election. Allotments are protected by a 1925 act, requiring ministerial approval for any sale. Corbyn, a passionate allotment gardener himself, argued that these green spaces are vital for communities and should not be sacrificed for development, especially when alternative sites like ex-industrial land are available. The decision has drawn criticism from multiple sides, with growing concern over the loss of community gardens amid long waiting lists for plots across the UK.</p>

She is requesting data from three recent evacuations, including timing and passenger demographics, and an update on congressionally mandated testing. The senator argues that the FAA must ensure its safety protocols reflect the realities of modern air travel to protect the public.</p>

          <p>Russia has entered the trade dispute between the United States and India, with the Kremlin asserting that India has the sovereign right to select its own trading partners. The statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose substantial tariffs on India for purchasing discounted Russian oil, which he claims fuels Moscow's war efforts. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov condemned the U.S. threats as illegitimate attempts to force countries to sever trade relations with Russia. The conflict underscores growing geopolitical tensions as India has significantly increased its oil imports from Russia since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

The mayor pointed out that Mamdani, a state assemblyman, did not attend the funerals of six other officers who died since 2022. This criticism highlights the contentious issue of policing in the mayoral race, with Mamdani's previous anti-police rhetoric now under intense scrutiny.</p>

The author argues that recent outrage over her commercial partnerships, including an American Eagle ad and selling soap with her bathwater, is part of a pattern of manufactured online flame-wars. Despite criticism, these events have boosted brand visibility and sales, suggesting Sweeney is adept at navigating and capitalizing on the attention economy. The piece contends that Sweeney's unapologetic approach to her career and image resonates with a public that desires larger-than-life, entertaining movie stars rather than politically correct figures.</p>

The issue has gained prominence following a case in Warwickshire and calls from ministers for greater transparency. While contempt of court laws prevent the release of information that could prejudice a trial, the College of Policing's official guidance does not explicitly permit or prohibit sharing a suspect's nationality. This leaves individual forces with discretion, leading to inconsistent practices and public debate over balancing transparency with the need to prevent misinformation and ensure fair legal proceedings. The guidance is currently under review.</p>

          <p>Energy giant BP has announced a comprehensive review of its oil and gas projects with the goal of boosting profits and maximizing shareholder value. CEO Murray Auchincloss stated the company will seek to improve how it develops and monetizes its fossil fuel assets, signaling a continued strategic shift back towards oil and gas. The announcement follows a period of investor pressure over underperformance and coincides with the news of BP's largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years off the coast of Brazil. The company also reported better-than-expected profits for the second quarter of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations, primarily due to struggling sales at its KFC and Pizza Hut chains in the United States. Both brands saw a 5% decline in U.S. same-store sales, reflecting increased competition and changing consumer dining habits. In contrast, Taco Bell continued its strong performance with a 4% rise in same-store sales. Globally, Yum's digital transactions now account for 57% of its system sales, and the company continues to expand its restaurant count, mainly through international KFC openings.

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska encountered a hostile and vocal crowd during a town hall meeting in Lincoln. Audience members repeatedly heckled and booed the congressman as he attempted to defend his vote for a major policy and tax bill signed by President Donald Trump. The crowd's anger was particularly focused on the bill's changes to Medicaid and its tax provisions, with chants of "Tax the Rich!" and "Vote him out!" interrupting Flood's explanations. The congressman argued the bill provided a middle-class tax cut and supported necessary infrastructure, but he failed to placate the highly critical audience.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have left Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to pass a controversial redistricting plan that would likely increase the GOP's congressional seats. At least 51 Democrats flew to other states, temporarily halting legislative business. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers located and arrested to compel their return to the state capitol. This dramatic move highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting, a process sought by Donald Trump that could significantly shift the state's political landscape ahead of the next election cycle.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm a total of nearly £46 million for failures leading to the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The collapse impacted around 300,000 investors. The FCA found that between 2018 and 2019, Woodford and his firm made unreasonable investment decisions, increasing the fund's holdings in illiquid assets, which prevented them from meeting withdrawal requests. Woodford has been fined nearly £6 million personally and banned from certain roles, while his firm faces a £40 million fine; both are appealing the decision.</p>

          <p>NASA is reportedly fast-tracking plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 to power a future permanent human settlement. The move is seen as a response to similar ambitions from China and Russia and is considered essential for providing continuous energy during the Moon's two-week-long nights, where solar power is not viable. However, the ambitious timeline faces challenges, including recent significant cuts to NASA's budget and scientific concerns that the project is driven more by geopolitical competition than scientific collaboration. The plan involves seeking proposals from commercial companies to develop a reactor capable of generating at least 100 kilowatts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a limited injunction against a new Arkansas law that requires public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. The ruling prevents enforcement of the law in four school districts where families filed a lawsuit, arguing it violates the constitutional separation of church and state. However, the law remains in effect for the rest of the state's 237 districts. U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks described the law as part of a coordinated strategy to inject Christian doctrine into public schools. Similar laws in Texas and Louisiana are also facing legal challenges, setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court case.</p>

The program was designed to fund community-led projects to address environmental hazards in disadvantaged areas. The plaintiffs are seeking a court order to immediately reinstate the program and unfreeze the funds, which had been awarded to nearly 350 groups before being abruptly terminated by the administration.</p>

While some metrics like second-quarter GDP appear strong, underlying data points to weaker consumer spending and business investment, elevating the risk of a recession.
