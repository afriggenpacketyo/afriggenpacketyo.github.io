          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from sending California National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. This ruling follows a similar decision preventing the use of Oregon's own National Guard and came after California's governor sued to stop the deployment. The judge questioned the necessity of the troops, noting there was no evidence of violence that would justify such a federal intervention against the state's wishes. The block will remain in effect until at least October 19, escalating the legal battle between state and federal authorities over presidential power.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying in the Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Mexico, with forecasters expecting it to reach Category 2 strength. While the storm's center is predicted to move parallel to the coast and not make direct landfall, its outer bands are already bringing heavy rainfall to the region. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for coastal areas from Punta San Telmo to Punta Mita. Residents are warned of potential flash flooding, particularly in higher terrains, as the storm continues its path north-northwest through the middle of the week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has unveiled a plan to reform the house-buying process in England and Wales, aiming to make it faster and less expensive. The proposals would legally require sellers to provide key property information upfront and introduce the option of binding contracts to prevent deals from collapsing late. This initiative could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and reduce transaction times by four weeks, according to government estimates. Critics, however, raise concerns about increased initial costs for sellers and draw comparisons to previously failed policies like home information packs.</p>

          <p>The reported acquisition of Bari Weiss's digital publication, The Free Press, by Paramount and her potential appointment as editor-in-chief of CBS News marks a significant moment in media. This article analyzes Weiss's ascent since leaving The New York Times, positioning her as a leader of a new center-right faction organized around opposition to "woke" ideology and institutional experts. The Free Press's worldview is characterized by its anti-woke stance, skepticism of established institutions, strong support for Israel, and a measured approach to the Trump administration. Her potential role at CBS raises questions about whether she will enact minor reforms or fundamentally reshape the network's ideological direction.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been jointly awarded to Shimon Sakaguchi, Mary Brunkow, and Fred Ramsdell for their groundbreaking discoveries related to the immune system. Their research identified "regulatory T-cells," which act as security guards to prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This discovery has been crucial for understanding and developing new treatments for autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, where this process fails. The laureates' work has also opened new avenues for cancer therapies and improving the success of organ transplants.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat and vocal supporter of Israel, has publicly called on Hamas to accept a peace proposal being brokered by the Trump administration. In a series of social media posts, he criticized pro-Palestinian protesters for not pressuring Hamas to agree to the deal, suggesting their priorities are misplaced. Fetterman has consistently diverged from some in his party with his staunch pro-Israel stance, previously describing what he sees as a "betrayal of Israel" by some Democrats. His comments highlight the ongoing efforts and political dynamics surrounding the proposed ceasefire to end the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The South African nationalist group "Operation Dudula" is intensifying its anti-immigrant activities, recently calling for migrant children to be excluded from public schools. Founded in 2021, the populist movement blames foreigners for crime, unemployment, and strained public services, employing aggressive tactics like blocking hospital access and conducting vigilante ID checks. Critics and researchers argue that the group's claims are based on exaggerated figures and that it scapegoats migrants for systemic government failures rooted in post-Apartheid inequality. Despite causing outrage, including an incident where a sick child died after being denied healthcare access, the group's "South Africans First" motto continues to attract support.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has resigned after just 27 days in office, plunging the nation into a new political crisis. His departure, which came hours after naming a new cabinet, was prompted by his failure to unite a fragmented parliament to support a forthcoming budget. The resignation caused immediate financial market instability, with the CAC 40 index falling and government bond yields rising. Opposition parties from both the far-left and far-right have called for President Emmanuel Macron to dissolve parliament or resign, intensifying the political paralysis that has gripped France since the 2024 elections.</p>

Church, who previously won substantial damages after her phone was hacked by the News of the World, believes her defiance and anger at the time helped her survive the intense scrutiny.

During his trial, a psychologist used the test to label Roberson a "psychopath," comparing him to historical dictators, which likely influenced the jury's decision. A growing number of researchers and lawyers argue this tool is being misused to sway juries toward harsher sentences based on media-fueled stereotypes rather than reliable predictions of future danger.

This stance rejects the notion that the party has moved too far left, instead blaming losses on timid messaging and dismissing polling data as irrelevant.

          <p>The concept of empathy is being debated, with some questioning its inherent value and others, including therapists, acknowledging its potential for causing burnout and vicarious stress. Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki explains that empathy has three components: emotional, cognitive, and compassionate. While it can lead to biased decisions, Zaki argues that empathy is fundamental to human connection, improving health, relationships, and societal cooperation. He suggests viewing empathy not as a fixed trait but as a skill that can be developed, like a muscle, through conscious practice, humility, and turning compassionate feelings into positive action.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown continues into its sixth day, with the Senate scheduled to vote on funding measures Monday afternoon. Lawmakers are at an impasse, with Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for the failure to reach a compromise. The Senate will first vote on a Democrat-backed bill that includes healthcare provisions, which Republicans oppose. If that fails, a vote is expected on a Republican-supported 7-week stopgap funding bill that has already passed the House, as both sides continue to trade accusations over who is responsible for the disruption of government services.</p>

          <p>Consumer advocacy group Which? has initiated a £480 million legal case against U.S. tech firm Qualcomm at London's Competition Appeal Tribunal. The lawsuit alleges that Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive practices by overcharging smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung for its essential chip components and licensing fees. Which? claims these inflated costs were passed on to consumers, and if successful, nearly 30 million UK customers who purchased certain smartphones between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to compensation of around £17 each. Qualcomm has previously stated that the case has no basis.</p>

          <p>In a move to appeal to right-of-center audiences, CBS News plans to name Bari Weiss as its new editor in chief. The appointment coincides with the acquisition of her online publication, The Free Press, by Skydance Media, the new corporate owner of CBS's parent company, Paramount. Weiss, who has no broadcasting experience, is seen as a change agent tasked with redefining the network's brand amid accusations of liberal bias. The move has generated uncertainty within the newsroom, as it comes alongside planned network-wide layoffs and follows other recent changes aimed at reshaping the network's ideological direction.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health has issued a series of grants, including $5.1 million to Cornell University, as part of a $50 million Autism Data Science Initiative. This funding aims to rigorously analyze existing treatments and outcomes to inform future studies on the complex condition. The initiative comes as the Trump administration has made autism a public health priority, while also promoting unproven theories about its causes, such as links to vaccines and Tylenol. Some autism research experts expressed relief that the funded projects are taking a sophisticated, scientific approach, despite concerns about the administration's broader rhetoric on the issue.</p>

          <p>The German government intends to extend the tax exemption for electric vehicles as part of a broader strategy to support the country's automotive industry and promote clean energy. According to the Finance Minister, the proposal would apply to EVs registered by the end of 2030, with the 10-year tax exemption period running until December 31, 2035, at the latest. This measure is designed to incentivize the early adoption of electric cars and secure Germany's position as a leading auto manufacturer. The plan will be discussed at an upcoming automotive industry summit with the German Chancellor. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 528 mammal species reinforces that females often outlive males, a gap that is nearly six years among humans in the U.S. Researchers suggest the longevity advantage is an evolutionary trait millions of years old, linked to genetics, mating behaviors, and caregiving responsibilities. For instance, males across many species engage in riskier behaviors to reproduce, which shortens their lifespan. In humans, men have historically been more likely to smoke and drink, and are less likely to seek preventative medical care, contributing to higher mortality rates from conditions like cancer and heart disease.</p>

          <p>Former employees from oversight offices within the Department of Homeland Security are warning that recent staff cuts could lead to increased civil rights violations and deaths in immigration detention. The Trump administration eliminated hundreds of positions from offices like the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, arguing they were inefficient. These employees were responsible for investigating complaints, inspecting facilities, and ensuring compliance with federal law. Without this internal oversight, former staff and advocates worry that the rapid expansion of ICE detention facilities is proceeding without necessary checks and balances, leaving detainees vulnerable to abuse.</p>

Chinese state media reported that about 350 people have been brought to safety, while rescuers are still working to reach another 200. The snow, reportedly up to three feet deep in some areas, crushed tents and blocked paths at an elevation of over 16,000 feet.

          <p>Postal service across Canada has ceased as thousands of Canada Post workers have walked off the job in a nationwide strike. The strike is a protest against sweeping government-authorized reforms that include ending door-to-door delivery for millions, closing some post offices, and increasing pricing flexibility. The union argues these changes will lead to significant job losses and harm public services. This action compounds an ongoing dispute over pay and benefits, leaving mail and parcels undelivered as the financially struggling Crown corporation warns the strike will worsen its already precarious financial situation.</p>
