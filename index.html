          <p>A devastating Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed nine of a pediatrician's ten children and severely wounded her husband. The pediatrician, Alaa Najjar, was working at Nasser Hospital when the strike occurred, destroying her family's home. The IDF stated that they struck suspects operating from a structure near their troops and are reviewing the civilian casualties in what they describe as a dangerous war zone. This incident is part of a larger conflict that has seen a renewed blockade of Gaza and allegations of human shield usage by the Israeli military, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. ()</p>

          <p>In a move interpreted as a strong affirmation of Canadian sovereignty against potential encroachment from the United States under President Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to address the Canadian Parliament. This invitation marks a significant shift in Canada's relationship with the Crown, as it emphasizes the country's unique identity and traditions distinct from its southern neighbor. The King's visit underscores Canada's independence at a time when economic stability is threatened by US tariffs and political pressure. While the monarchy's relevance is debated among Canadians, this symbolic gesture highlights the enduring ties between Canada and the British Crown. ()</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has cancelled his summer tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to symptoms that can mimic aging or other neurological disorders like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The condition is treatable with surgery to relieve pressure on the brain, and Joel's public announcement may raise awareness and encourage others to seek diagnosis and treatment. Despite the setback, Joel is undergoing physical therapy and hopes to return to performing in the future. ()</p>

          <p>The rising cost of driving lessons, averaging Â£36-Â£40 per hour, is making it increasingly difficult for learners to obtain their licenses, impacting their ability to access jobs, education, and essential services. Learners are having to cut back on other expenses or take fewer lessons, delaying their progress. Instructors argue that the increased prices are necessary to cover rising expenses such as fuel, insurance, and car maintenance. The practical test backlog is also forcing learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills, exacerbating the financial strain. ()</p>

Converts often prioritize family and traditional gender roles, opting for homeschooling and emphasizing the importance of women focusing on family rather than careers.

A 50-year-old woman with early-stage lung cancer is among the first to receive the LK101 injection, a personalized mRNA vaccine designed to reduce the risk of relapse.
