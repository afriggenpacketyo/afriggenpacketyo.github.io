          <p>China is leading a diplomatic effort with Russia, Pakistan, and Iran to oppose former President Trump's stated intention to reclaim the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. Following a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the four nations issued a joint statement emphasizing respect for Afghanistan's sovereignty and opposing the establishment of foreign military bases in the region. The move is a direct response to Trump's remarks about retaking the base, which he noted for its strategic proximity to China's nuclear facilities. This coalition underscores a significant geopolitical alignment against potential U.S. military re-engagement in the area.</p>

          <p>A growing national movement known as "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY) is pushing for legislation to allow religious institutions to build affordable housing on their property, bypassing restrictive local zoning laws. A new bipartisan bill in Congress, the Faith in Housing Act, seeks to enable this on a federal level, requiring new developments to serve low-income families. While the concept has seen success in states like California, it has faced significant opposition elsewhere from local governments concerned about losing control over zoning. Proponents argue it's a win-win, addressing the housing crisis while providing financial stability for religious organizations with declining membership.</p>

          <p>A London court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the rap group Kneecap, due to a procedural error. He was charged for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization in the UK, during a concert. The chief magistrate ruled the charge "unlawful" because it lacked the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General within the six-month statutory time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence his advocacy for Gaza, a sentiment echoed by First Minister Michelle O'Neill.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, UK health officials are warning of a seasonal increase in both flu and COVID-19 cases, urging the public to understand the differences between the two respiratory viruses. While both share symptoms, flu often presents suddenly with fever and body aches, whereas COVID-19's symptoms have evolved to often include cold-like signs such as a hoarse or sore throat. Health agencies report a recent rise in coronavirus cases and emphasize that both illnesses can be serious, particularly for vulnerable populations. Officials are strongly encouraging eligible individuals to receive both the flu and COVID-19 booster vaccines to reduce severe illness and hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre is calling for Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, to be stripped of her courtesy royal title. The demand follows the emergence of a 2011 email in which the Duchess referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend" and seemed to apologize for publicly distancing herself from him. Since the email was published, seven charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust, have severed ties with Ferguson. A spokesperson for the Duchess stated the email was written to fend off a defamation lawsuit from Epstein and that she regrets her association with him.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power across Africa through a network of government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. These centers, now in 49 African countries, offer language courses and scholarships, attracting students who see it as a path to economic opportunity. However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in promoting Beijing's political agenda, potentially interfering with academic freedom at host universities. Analysts argue that this cultural expansion is intertwined with China's economic interests, including access to the continent's vast natural resources, and call for African nations to establish clearer rules of engagement.</p>

An unmanned submersible captured footage of about 10 V-1 cruise missiles covered in creatures, including marine worms, mussels, and fish. In a particularly surprising observation, researchers saw over 40 starfish gathered directly on an exposed block of TNT, a highly toxic explosive.

          <p>Business owners in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, are facing potential property tax increases after a city-wide revaluation resulted in an average 22% jump in commercial property values. This assessment of over 2,000 properties was conducted after the Department of Revenue found they were valued at only 85% of their market rate, creating an inequitable tax burden on homeowners. While the higher valuations could lead to higher tax bills, the final impact will depend on the new mill rate set in the city's upcoming budget. The revaluation adds a projected $350 million to the city's tax base, which could potentially lead to a lower mill rate. (not investment advice)</p>

The book details an incident where she rejected prepared talking points declaring "JOE BIDEN WON," throwing the paper on a table and telling staff not to "feed me bulls--t." Harris describes the debate as a series of missed opportunities and garbled sentences, culminating in Biden's widely criticized line, "We finally beat Medicare."

Beyond standard anti-dumping investigations, China employs tools like the "Unreliable Entity List," which can restrict trade and investment with foreign firms deemed to harm its national interests. Another key mechanism is the implementation of export controls on "dual-use" items, which are goods that have both civilian and potential military applications. These strategies form part of a broader playbook that allows China to exert economic leverage in response to actions like significant import duties. (not investment advice)</p>

Frenk emphasized that UCLA will uphold academic freedom and resist interference in admissions and curriculum, though the university is negotiating with the Department of Justice. He acknowledged "failures" in handling campus protests and committed to addressing the climate for Jewish students.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump Administration Policies Are Actively Increasing Electricity Costs for Consumers</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that despite campaign promises to lower energy prices, the Trump administration's actions are systematically driving up electricity costs. The author argues that policies blocking new clean energy projects, which are the cheapest and fastest source of new power, are creating a supply shortage as demand from data centers and manufacturing grows. The article also cites new tariffs on materials like steel, the cancellation of key transmission projects, and forcing unprofitable coal plants to remain open as direct contributors to higher consumer bills. The author questions whether these moves are due to economic incompetence or a deliberate strategy to protect the oil industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to reports, former British Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair is being considered to lead a transitional authority in Gaza following the current conflict. The proposal, said to have White House support, would involve a UN-backed governing body supported by Gulf nations, which Blair would lead for a period of up to five years before returning control to Palestinians. Blair, who served as a Middle East envoy after leaving office, has recently participated in high-level talks about Gaza's future. His office stated he would not support any plan that involved displacing the Gazan population, as discussions about the territory's post-war governance continue.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto is currently tracking over the Atlantic, and while not expected to make landfall, it could interact with another developing storm system nearby. This interaction could lead to a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms become entangled and rotate around a common center. The outcome depends on the storms' relative strengths; if comparable, they might "dance" around each other before separating, but more often the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one. While an interaction between Humberto and the second system is considered unlikely, it remains a possibility that forecasters are closely watching.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NFL game in Dublin between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings holds special significance as a homecoming for the Steelers' founding Rooney family. Art Rooney, who founded the team in 1933, was the great-grandson of Irish immigrants who fled the Great Famine. His son, the late Dan Rooney, was a pivotal figure in the NFL and served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, fostering deep connections with the country. The game at Croke Park is seen as more than just football, celebrating the deep cultural ties between Ireland and the one in ten Americans of Irish heritage, including many players and executives.</p>

          <p>An ash tree located on a busy street in Glasgow has won the Woodland Trust's Tree of the Year 2025 competition after a public vote. The Argyle Street Ash, nominated as a wildcard entry, is a beloved local landmark with deep cultural roots, even being referenced in a 1951 book about the city. It triumphed over nine other contenders, including an oak that may have inspired a Radiohead album. The win is being celebrated as a victory for urban trees, which often face threats despite their importance to communities. The Glasgow ash will now go on to represent the UK in the European Tree of the Year contest in 2026.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his 2020 testimony to a Senate committee regarding his authorization of a leak to the media and the FBI's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Comey has declared his innocence and stated he has confidence in the judicial system. The indictment follows recent public calls by President Trump for the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his political adversaries, raising concerns about the collapse of the traditional separation between the White House and federal law enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Fatal Sniper Attack at Dallas ICE Facility Highlights a Rising Trend of Long-Range Shootings</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, where a gunman killed one detainee and wounded two others from a nearby rooftop, is being viewed by experts as part of an alarming trend of sniper-style attacks. The incident is one of at least seven such long-range shootings since the July 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump. The suspect in the Dallas attack, who died by suicide, allegedly planned the ambush for months and left writings indicating a desire to terrorize ICE agents. Law enforcement experts express concern over this "next chapter" in active shooter violence, noting the challenge of preventing attacks by individuals willing to die and the copycat nature of recent incidents.</p>
