          <p>An attack on a migrant facility in Houthi-controlled northern Yemen resulted in the deaths of dozens, according to both the Houthi militia and aid officials. The Houthis attributed the strike to the U.S. military, claiming at least 68 African migrants were killed, though the U.S. military has not yet responded to the claim. This attack occurred shortly after the U.S. military reported conducting over 800 strikes in Yemen targeting Houthi command-and-control facilities and weapons systems since mid-March. Houthi officials have condemned the strike, stating that over 100 civilians have been killed in recent attacks. </p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly targeting unaccompanied immigrant children for potential deportation or criminal prosecution, raising concerns about "backdoor family separation". ICE is conducting "welfare checks" on these children, ostensibly to ensure their safety, but an internal document reveals that ICE is also gathering intelligence to assess whether the children are a "flight risk" or a "threat to public safety". Legal services for unaccompanied minors have been slashed, and the federal agency monitoring these children has begun sharing sensitive data with ICE. Advocates express alarm over the trauma these operations are causing to children and families.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jet rolled off an aircraft carrier and sank into the Red Sea due to human error during towing operations.

The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is demanding that UPenn restore honors to female athletes and issue an apology for allowing sex discrimination. This decision stems from the controversy surrounding Lia Thomas, a transgender woman who competed on the women's swim team and broke multiple records. The OCR has given the university 10 days to comply with Title IX or face potential legal action.</p>

          <p>Temu has added import charges of approximately 145% after President Trump imposed tariffs on many imports from China, effectively more than doubling the price of many items. These charges cover customs-related processes and costs. Rival discount retailer Shein has also raised prices but states that tariffs are included in the price, meaning there are no extra fees at delivery. The import fees erode Temu's value proposition, which has made the platform popular with consumers, and has sharply slashed its online ad spending in the U.S.</p>
