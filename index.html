          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled Dominion Voting Systems' $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit regarding his unfounded claims of 2020 election rigging. The confidential agreement, filed in federal court, permanently dismisses the suit initiated in 2021. This settlement adds to Giuliani's legal and financial challenges, following previous settlements by Fox News and Newsmax over similar allegations. The case highlighted the significant impact of election conspiracy theories on public trust and individuals.</p>

The demand follows the appearance of John Brown Gun Club recruitment flyers at Georgetown University, which referenced the assassination of TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk.

          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve received a one-game suspension and a fine from the WNBA for her conduct and comments following a playoff loss. The league cited her aggressive pursuit and verbal abuse of an official, delayed court exit, inappropriate fan comments, and critical remarks in a post-game press conference. This marks a rare playoff suspension for a WNBA coach. Reeve strongly criticized the officiating crew's competence for a semi-finals game, highlighting broader league concerns about officiating consistency.</p>

          <p>Europe has established a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the USA heading into the Ryder Cup singles matches, requiring only 2.5 more points for retention. This historic lead comes despite "thuggish, moronic, and personal insults" from American galleries directed at European players like Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. The European team's exceptional performance has led to a significant American capitulation, with resale prices for Sunday tickets plummeting. Captain Luke Donald remains pragmatic, emphasizing the job isn't done, but acknowledging his team's strong fight.</p>

          <p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, joined by Portland officials, pushed back against President Trump's order to send federal troops to the city. Kotek asserted there is "no need for military troops in our city" and deemed any federal takeover a "threat to communities across Oregon." She urged residents to peacefully voice their opinions but avoid property damage or violence. Portland's Police Chief also stated no uptick in violent unrest, contrary to the president's claims, reinforcing local opposition to the deployment.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler experienced a historic struggle at the Ryder Cup, becoming the first American to lose in all four opening sessions. Despite his recent dominance and two major wins this year, his authority dissolved in the team format, particularly due to inconsistent putting. This performance highlights how the Ryder Cup's intense, sprint-like format can expose flaws in even the best players. Scheffler's unraveling underscores that rankings and reputation are immaterial when faced with the pressure of critical shots in team competition.</p>

          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated wellness trend. While some users report positive results, consultant dermatologists remain skeptical about oral collagen's ability to reach and impact skin effectively. The body breaks down collagen into peptides, which may or may not preferentially target skin cells. Experts generally agree that topical collagen creams are ineffective, and emphasize sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as far more impactful for skin health than expensive supplements.</p>

Firing a Fed chair would be unprecedented and is likely unconstitutional, as a Supreme Court decision indicated presidents lack the authority to remove Fed officials at will.

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion commercial loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain following a cyber attack that halted production for weeks. The loan aims to protect jobs in the automotive sector, which employs around 150,000 people, and prevent small suppliers from collapsing. The cyberattack, attributed to Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, has cost JLR an estimated £50 million per week. This government intervention is deemed an "important first step" by unions, though critics argue the response was too slow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California faces a chronic housing shortage, a consensus among policymakers and academics, yet estimates of its scale vary dramatically. Figures range from 56,000 to 3.5 million missing units, depending on the methodology used, such as target vacancy rates or "pent-up demand." The article explains these discrepancies arise from messy data, differing definitions of "housing needed," and the challenge of quantifying local market dynamics. Despite the varied numbers, experts agree the shortage is substantial, underscoring the immense task ahead for lawmakers and planners.</p>
