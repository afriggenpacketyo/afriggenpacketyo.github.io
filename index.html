          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly traded higher on Monday, as investors seemed to disregard the latest tariff developments influencing global trade. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed, and South Korea's Kospi rebounded from a previous fall, while Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a modest decline after hitting a record high. The Reserve Bank of Australia is poised to keep its cash rate stable, navigating a challenging economic environment with "material upside risks to Q3 inflation" alongside indications of softer employment and moderating wages. This article notes that US markets also saw gains on Friday following the release of crucial inflation data, breaking a three-day losing streak for major indexes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deliveries of China's C919 narrowbody passenger jet, intended for the country's three largest airlines, appear to be lagging behind schedule, according to recent company financial reports. This situation has fueled market speculation regarding potential snags in the aircraft's engine supply. For example, Air China and China Eastern Airlines each received only one C919 during the first half of the year, despite their stated targets of adding ten jets each in 2025. China Southern Airlines also reported leasing only three of the twelve jets it expected this year. This article indicates that while manufacturer Comac has transported over 2 million passengers since the jet's maiden commercial flight, an independent aviation analyst suggests that securing engines for the model might be proving challenging, potentially hindering its goal of competing with established Western aircraft manufacturers.

          <p>USC women's basketball star JuJu Watkins has announced she will sit out the entire upcoming 2025-26 season to focus on recovering from a serious knee injury sustained during the NCAA tournament in March. The injury, which occurred during her stellar sophomore season, was a significant blow to USC's title aspirations. Orthopedic surgeons had previously indicated a recovery period of up to 12 months. This article notes that while her absence creates a void, the arrival of top prospect Jazzy Davidson is expected to help the team.

          <p>The Kremlin has asserted that while initial discussions on reducing strategic nuclear weapons should occur bilaterally between Russia and the U.S., the nuclear arsenals of Britain and France must ultimately be incorporated into future disarmament negotiations. This stance comes after a recent Russian proposal to the U.S. to uphold the limits of their New START arms control treaty for one year post-expiration in 2026, provided the U.S. reciprocates. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov underscored that these smaller European arsenals are an integral component of the overarching issue of global European security and strategic stability. This article highlights that both France and Britain, never signatories to New START, maintain considerably smaller arsenals compared to the two major nuclear powers.</p>

          <p>This article delves into strategies for managing "energy vampires" within friendships—individuals who tend to deplete your emotional and mental energy through their behaviors. Psychologist Suzy Reading characterizes these friends by their excessive need for attention and reassurance, or their subtle ways of eroding your mood through backhanded compliments or an insistence on positivity. Author and journalist Radhika Sanghani emphasizes that the primary indicator is often how you personally feel after spending time with them, noting feelings of being drained. The article provides three actionable approaches: initiating an honest conversation about feeling unheard, establishing clear boundaries if the friend is unwilling to change, and adjusting shared activities, such as opting for a walk instead of a deep conversation, to mitigate their tendency to dominate interactions. These techniques are designed to safeguard your personal well-being.</p>

Adams, who assumed office in January 2022, has endured a challenging year marked by a federal corruption scandal and scrutiny over his ties to the Trump administration. This article highlights that despite his exit, Adams' name will still appear on the November ballot.

This significant exodus is occurring as part of a broader Trump administration initiative aimed at enacting substantial reductions across the federal workforce. Concurrently, with Congress facing an imminent deadline to authorize more funding and avert a government shutdown, the White House has directed federal agencies to draft contingency plans for widespread employee firings should a partisan agreement fail. This article features a long-time employee from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) who described the prevailing atmosphere of "fear and intimidation" that led to their departure, underscoring how the perceived undermining of their mission, job security, and work-life balance ultimately compelled many to leave their positions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, after federal courts universally blocked it twice. The administration argues that American citizenship should only be granted to those lawfully entitled, challenging the long-held interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. This article explains that Trump's order unilaterally declares only newborns whose parents have permanent legal status are eligible citizens, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of children annually. Legal experts like James Sample believe a ruling in Trump's favor would be an "earthquake," though he considers it unlikely, suggesting Trump may also see political benefit in the legal battle.</p>

          <p>The Village of Broadview has launched a criminal investigation following an incident where a CBS News Chicago reporter's truck was struck by a pepper ball fired by an ICE agent. Reporter Asal Rezaei recounted that she was driving alone near the ICE facility entrance, with no active protest occurring, when a masked agent discharged a pepper ball from inside the fence. The projectile hit her driver's side panel, causing chemical agents to fill her truck and leading to her vomiting outside the vehicle. This article emphasizes that Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills publicly condemned the "allegedly unprovoked attack" and anticipates complete cooperation from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The incident raises significant concerns regarding press freedom, the conduct of federal agents, and the safety of journalists covering sensitive locations.</p>

          <p>Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo suspects Russian involvement in a series of critical undersea cable and pipeline damages in the Baltic Sea, linking incidents to Russia's "shadow fleet" of oil tankers. A 60 Minutes investigation detailed the Finnish special forces boarding of the oil tanker Eagle S, suspected of severing the Estlink-2 electric cable. Other vessels, including the Newnew Polar Bear and Yi Peng 3, are implicated in damaging telecommunications cables and a gas pipeline by dragging anchors.

          <p>Two individuals who witnessed the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University are now advocating for a return to civilized debate in the United States. Hunter Kozak, a self-professed liberal who was the last person to speak with Kirk before a sniper fatally wounded him, and Jeb Jacobi, a student volunteer for Kirk's organization, both underscore the critical necessity for Americans to engage in respectful dialogue and co-exist, even with differing viewpoints. This article notes that Utah Governor Spencer Cox also visited the campus post-shooting to promote messages of civility and unity among students. The eyewitnesses stress that citizens hold significant power through their votes to influence political discourse and must collectively prioritize community cohesion over divisive rhetoric, especially in the wake of such a tragic event.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Joshua Cole, has been arrested by the FBI for allegedly threatening a local gay pride event in Abilene, stating he wanted to "pay them back for taking out Charlie Kirk." Cole, posting under the name "Jay Dubya" on Facebook, also wrote about sending a "clear message" to participants. During a traffic stop, Cole admitted to the posts and owning a firearm, though he denied intent to shoot. This article highlights that the threats were deemed specific and not idle talk by the FBI. Cole, previously arrested for a terroristic threat, was detained due to his criminal history and perceived danger to the community.</p>

          <p>The historic Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. This measure aims to manage the overwhelming tourist numbers, which reached 2.6 million last year for a village of only 100 residents. The director of the village's museum explains that tourists often intrude on residents' privacy. The fee will include museum and windmill access, currently paid separately, with projected annual revenues of €24.5 million for maintenance and infrastructure. This article notes that while some tourists understand the need, local shop and restaurant owners fear a significant loss of business.</p>

          <p>The article explores how weight-loss injections, despite their effectiveness, are creating a two-tier system where access to obesity treatment increasingly depends on wealth. While some drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro are available on the NHS, strict eligibility criteria and regional disparities mean thousands miss out, forcing over 90% of users to pay privately. With prices potentially rising, concerns are growing that good health could become a luxury. This article highlights that health inequalities may worsen, as deprived areas with higher obesity rates struggle with access. Experts question whether medicalizing obesity overlooks broader societal issues and a "broken food system." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Mets' playoff aspirations were extinguished with a 4-0 loss to the Miami Marlins, marking the culmination of a months-long collapse. Despite holding the best record in MLB in mid-June with a $322.6 million payroll, the team went 38-55 in the second half, missing the postseason a year after reaching the NLCS. Their defeat allowed the Cincinnati Reds to secure the final NL wildcard spot. This article notes that the Mets' season was significantly impacted by pitching woes and injuries, particularly to Kodai Senga, and mirrors similar late-season meltdowns from 2007 and 2008, leaving fans with a familiar sense of frustration.</p>
