          <p>Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were vandalized and set on fire in downtown Los Angeles during protests against President Trump's immigration policies. The Alphabet-owned company confirmed that five vehicles were affected and could not be retrieved, leading to the suspension of Waymo services in the protest area until it is deemed safe. The protests, which began after Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted raids in the city, escalated over the weekend, resulting in clashes between police and protesters near the Metropolitan Detention Center. Waymo is coordinating with the Los Angeles Police Department for guidance amidst the ongoing situation. The incident highlights the tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and its impact on public order and infrastructure.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to sue the Trump administration after the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles to address protests. Newsom criticized Trump for "commandeering" the state's National Guard without consulting him, calling it illegal and immoral. The deployment followed large-scale immigration enforcement operations and clashes between law enforcement and protesters, prompting Newsom to request the federal government to rescind the deployment, asserting there was "no need" for the National Guard. The governor's decision to sue underscores the escalating tensions between California and the federal government over immigration policy and the use of federal resources.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found a correlation between the loosening of gun laws in certain states and a rise in firearm fatalities among children. Researchers examined data from the 13 years following the Supreme Court's decision that limited local governments' ability to restrict gun ownership. The study suggests that reduced restrictions on firearms may have contributed to increased risks for children. The research is likely to fuel further debate on gun control measures and their potential impact on public safety. The optimism score reflects the somber implications of the study's findings.</p>

          <p>A hospital trust and a ward manager were found guilty of health and safety failings in connection to the death of Alice Figueiredo, a 22-year-old woman who took her own life while being treated at Goodmayes Hospital. Alice had a history of suicide attempts and used a bin bag from a communal toilet to end her life, despite warnings from her family about the risk of keeping bin bags accessible. The North East London Foundation NHS Trust (NELFT) was cleared of corporate manslaughter, and the ward manager, Benjamin Aninakwa, was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter, but both were convicted under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The case highlights the importance of patient safety in mental health units and the need for improved communication and risk assessment.

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval from Americans, particularly Republicans, but is heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted.

Half of Americans believe Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most disapprove of the program, emphasizing the need for due process.
