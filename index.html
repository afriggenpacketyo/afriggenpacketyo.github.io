          <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, resigned from her post due to disagreements with the Trump administration's policy toward Ukraine. Brink stated that the administration was putting pressure on Ukraine, the victim of Russian aggression, rather than Russia itself. In the article, she advocates for increased pressure on Russia through sanctions in the energy and banking sectors, arguing that appeasement will only lead to more war. She also criticized the administration's perceived reluctance to openly condemn Russia's actions and called for a clear strategy to support Ukraine and deter Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that contentious exchanges between President Trump's nominees and Democratic senators during confirmation hearings are primarily intended to energize the Democratic base. The article posits that with limited power in a Republican-controlled Congress, Democrats are focusing on demonstrating resistance to the Trump administration. Examples include heated questioning of FBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. These confrontations, while sometimes dramatic, may have little substantive impact but serve to signal ideological alignment to constituents.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Walmart will "eat some of the tariffs" imposed by President Trump, following a direct demand from the president. This claim contradicts earlier statements from Walmart indicating that the company would need to raise prices for consumers to offset tariff costs. The article notes that Trump's initial tariff plans sparked market turmoil and criticism, leading to a partial reversal with reduced tariffs on China. Bessent maintains that Walmart's initial warnings were a "worst-case scenario" for legal purposes.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the potential for inflation resulting from the Trump administration's tariffs, stating that Walmart's warnings of price increases were a "worst-case scenario." He claimed to have spoken with Walmart's CEO, who assured him the retailer would absorb some of the tariff costs. Bessent also dismissed concerns about Moody's downgrade of U.S. government debt, calling it a "lagging indicator." Walmart executives have previously indicated that higher prices were already appearing on shelves.</p>

The inspiration behind Bale's foster care work came 17 years ago when he looked at his young daughter and imagined her without parents.
