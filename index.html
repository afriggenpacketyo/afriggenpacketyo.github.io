          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The agreement was reached during a phone call that Trump described as productive, stating he believes "great progress was made." This development comes just one day before Trump is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. High-level advisors from both the U.S. and Russia are set to meet next week to prepare for the summit, signaling a renewed diplomatic push.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The possibility of the U.S. supplying Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine is reportedly a key factor motivating Russia to engage in diplomatic talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that Moscow is "rushing to resume dialogue" upon hearing about the potential transfer of these long-range weapons. While President Trump has publicly considered sending the missiles as leverage, he also expressed concerns about depleting U.S. stockpiles. The strategic value of Tomahawks lies in their ability to strike high-value Russian targets from a distance, though logistical challenges regarding their deployment remain a significant consideration for military analysts.</p>

          <p>Oliver Blume, who has served as the CEO of both Porsche and its parent company Volkswagen Group, will be stepping down from his role at the luxury sports car brand. He will, however, continue to lead the broader Volkswagen Group. This dual-CEO position had drawn criticism within the German auto industry, which has faced numerous challenges in recent years. Blume has been at the helm of Porsche since 2015 and took over the leadership of Volkswagen in 2022 following the resignation of his predecessor, Herbert Diess. The supervisory board announced the change in a formal statement.</p>

Following the "Mr. Clean" investigation by IndyStar and Mirror Indy, council members expressed concern but indicated they would wait for further reporting before taking action. The editor reflects on how investigative journalism often serves as a last resort for individuals whose warnings about wrongdoing have been ignored by authorities. This reliance by both the public and officials demonstrates why newsrooms invest significant resources into in-depth reporting that holds powerful figures and institutions accountable.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's upcoming meeting with President Trump is set against a backdrop of evolving U.S. policy and rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine. After a contentious meeting earlier in the year, Trump's tone has shifted, influenced by Ukraine's battlefield successes and a growing disappointment with Vladimir Putin. This change is underscored by Trump's recent agreement to meet with Putin in Budapest, a development he plans to discuss with Zelenskyy. Foreign policy experts suggest Trump may now be more inclined to increase pressure on Russia, potentially through sanctions or providing advanced weaponry like Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine.</p>

Organizers aim to stand in solidarity to defend democratic principles and protect communities from what they describe as chaos and corruption. This event follows a similar day of action in June, which organizers estimated involved 5 million people in over 2,000 separate events.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's policies, particularly the trade war and the government shutdown, are causing a severe economic crisis in America's farm country. Retaliatory tariffs from China have decimated markets for crops like soybeans, while new tariffs on fertilizer and equipment have driven up production costs. The government shutdown exacerbates the problem by delaying critical farm loans and disaster relief from the USDA. The author contends that farmers are facing a "Farmageddon," with many on the brink of a crisis reminiscent of the 1980s, and calls for an end to the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a history of athlete activism on social justice issues, the vast majority of elite athletes in North America have remained silent regarding the conflict in Gaza. This article explores the reasons behind this silence, citing fear of losing sponsorships, backlash from fans and organizations, and being labeled antisemitic as primary deterrents. Interviews with current and former athletes reveal that many are advised by agents to avoid the topic, fearing the "Kyrie treatment." The piece contrasts this situation with other movements like Black Lives Matter, suggesting the geopolitical complexity and powerful narratives surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict create unique pressures that discourage public commentary.</p>

In response, many progressive organizations working on issues from voting rights to climate justice are "locking arms" in solidarity, vowing not to be intimidated.

Hart was one of five players charged with sexual assault from a 2018 incident but was acquitted earlier this year. This article argues that his swift return, despite the seriousness of the initial allegations, exemplifies a pattern in hockey where scandals are followed by quiet re-integration rather than a true reckoning with the sport's culture.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's primary stock index, the Kospi, achieved a new record high for the third day in a row, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. The index briefly surpassed 3,794 before closing slightly up, bucking a broader trend of losses across other Asia-Pacific markets. The regional downturn was influenced by renewed fears in the U.S. banking sector and persistent trade tensions. While markets in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Japan saw significant declines, the positive sentiment in South Korea demonstrates investor confidence in the potential outcomes of the current trade talks.

          <p>The Taiwanese government has banned its officials from participating in events organized by China to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's "retrocession" to Chinese rule in 1945. Taipei accuses Beijing of attempting to distort history to support its territorial claims over the democratically governed island. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council stated that China uses these events to promote the false narrative that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China, with the ultimate goal of annexation. This move highlights the escalating tensions and differing historical interpretations between the two governments as they both mark the end of World War Two.</p>

          <p>Authorities in South Australia have officially ended the extensive search for Gus Lamont, a four-year-old boy who went missing from a remote homestead near Yunta late last month. Despite a massive land and air operation involving police and the Australian Defence Force covering 95 square kilometers, no new evidence of the boy's whereabouts was found. Police do not suspect foul play but have now transitioned the case to a "recovery operation." The disappearance of the boy, who was last seen playing outside his home, captured national attention and has left his family and the community devastated by the lack of resolution.</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection to prevent HIV, known as cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales, aligning their policy with Scotland's. This new option, administered every other month, provides an alternative to the daily pills currently used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Health experts hope the injection will help reach individuals for whom daily pills are impractical or difficult to take consistently, thereby advancing the UK's goal of eliminating new HIV cases by 2030. The treatment is considered a game-changer for public health, offering a more convenient and discreet method of HIV prevention.</p>

          <p>China has initiated military training drills in the South China Sea near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, coinciding with the final day of joint naval exercises between the United States and the Philippines. The Chinese Maritime Safety Administration issued a notice prohibiting all vessels from entering a designated zone during the drills. The U.S.-Philippine exercises, which also included forces from Japan, Canada, and France, were aimed at enhancing joint maritime defense capabilities. This move by Beijing is seen as a direct response and contributes to the escalating tensions in the region over disputed territories.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the political climate under Donald Trump fosters an "anti-truth crusade" that undermines the very concept of objective facts. The author points to the replacement of professional fact-checking with "community notes" by tech giants like Meta and Google as evidence of a shift away from verifiable evidence toward algorithm-driven consensus. This trend is framed as a dangerous unraveling of Enlightenment principles, where inconvenient evidence is dismissed as bias and the term "misinformation" is attacked. The article defends the crucial role of independent fact-checkers in grounding public debate in truth and resisting the growing storms of unreason.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the immense expectations placed on 18-year-old basketball phenom Cooper Flagg as he enters the NBA with the Dallas Mavericks. The article traces the historical narrative of the "Great White Hope" in American sports, a mythos born from a desire to find a white champion in predominantly Black-dominated fields. Flagg, a highly touted, athletic, two-way player from Maine, arrives in Dallas, a city with a history of white superstars like Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Dončić. He must navigate not only the pressures of being a top draft pick but also the complex racial and cultural baggage that accompanies this long-standing narrative.</p>

          <p>Colonel Michael Randrianirina has been sworn in as the president of Madagascar following a military coup that ousted President Andry Rajoelina. The takeover occurred after three weeks of youth-led protests against widespread poverty and chronic utility shortages. Rajoelina fled the country, and the military announced it would assume power. The African Union has suspended Madagascar's membership in response, and the United Nations has condemned the coup. Randrianirina has stated that a military-led committee will govern for up to two years before new elections are held, insisting that the country has not chosen a military regime.</p>

          <p>U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology is planning to stop supplying server memory chips to data centers in mainland China. This decision follows a 2023 ban by Beijing on the use of Micron's products in critical national infrastructure, which has severely impacted the company's business in that sector. Micron was the first American semiconductor firm targeted by Beijing in what was seen as retaliation for U.S. tech curbs. The company will, however, continue to sell its products to China's automotive and smartphone industries, as well as to Chinese customers with significant data center operations located outside of mainland China.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, states that the traditional pub industry now faces competition from coffee shops and food delivery services. With a growing number of people, especially younger generations, not drinking alcohol, consumers are spending their leisure time and money in different venues. To adapt, pubs are improving their food and coffee offerings and creating more comfortable, family-friendly environments to attract a broader customer base. The chain is also exploring "competitive socialising" activities like games to entice customers who are looking for more than just a drink.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is actively working to establish a direct export channel for fresh durians to China, aiming to increase profits for its growers. Currently, Indonesian durians often pass through neighboring countries like Malaysia and Thailand, which assist with the necessary phytosanitary approvals and cold-chain storage required by Chinese customs. By developing its own certification processes and improving its refrigeration infrastructure, Indonesia hopes to bypass these intermediaries and capture a larger share of the lucrative Chinese market. China is the world's largest consumer of durians, importing over 90% of the global supply.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that the city of Shanghai is facing a severe dual threat from land subsidence and rising sea levels. As a delta city built on soft sediment, Shanghai is naturally prone to sinking, a process that is heavily accelerated by human activities like groundwater extraction. Researchers found that this localized subsidence is often occurring at a faster rate than the global average sea-level rise. This combination of sinking land and rising waters poses a significant and growing risk to the coastal megacity and its large population.</p>
