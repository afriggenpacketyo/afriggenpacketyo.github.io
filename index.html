            <p>The construction industry, traditionally male-dominated, is exploring how technology and AI can attract more women. A German construction company, LAT, uses a robotic dog equipped with cameras and sensors to document work sites, reducing the need for manual paperwork. The company's co-owner, Larissa Zeichhardt, emphasizes the importance of digitization in making construction jobs less demanding and more family-friendly, which has led to increased interest from female applicants. Bianca Weber-Lewerenz, the first female mason in Baden-Württemberg, believes AI and BIM (Building Information Modeling) are creating new roles for women, simplifying communication and reducing waste.</p>

            <p>Germany is seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens for their alleged involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, specifically related to an incident at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. The individuals were served with deportation orders instructing them to leave the country by April 21, leading to legal challenges based on EU freedom of movement laws. The Berlin Immigration Office cited property damage and graffiti as reasons for the deportations, referencing Germany's Staatsräson, which emphasizes the country's responsibility toward Israel. Critics argue that this is a political concept being used to justify deportation, while supporters emphasize the need to combat antisemitism.</p>

The government argues that Google illegally stifled competition by paying companies to set Google as the default search engine, and is pushing for remedies like spinning off Chrome and selling Android. Google contends that these measures would harm consumers and innovation, and that users choose Google because they prefer it. The outcome could significantly reshape the digital market landscape.</p>

            <p>Amy Woolard's poem '1994' explores themes of connection, loss, and the search for solace. The poem weaves together images of mixing drinks, remembering the dead, and finding belonging in shared experiences. It reflects on the nature of love, memory, and the human condition, suggesting that even in darkness, there is a persistent drive to find connection and meaning.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia is attempting to create a false impression of honoring an Easter ceasefire, alleging continued attacks despite Vladimir Putin's announcement of a temporary truce. Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and assaults along the front line, as well as drone strikes. He reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce and emphasized the need for Russia to fully adhere to the ceasefire conditions. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that Ukrainian forces launched attacks despite the ceasefire.</p>
