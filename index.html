          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a crucial test vote on a significant tax and spending package championed by President Trump. The bill's passage remains uncertain due to internal Republican disagreements over provisions like Medicaid cuts and the debt ceiling increase. Despite pressure from the White House to pass the legislation by July 4th, several GOP senators remain opposed or undecided, making the outcome dependent on a few key votes. The bill includes extensions of tax cuts alongside controversial reductions in social programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One week after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions of the attack's effectiveness have emerged from the Trump administration. While the President claimed the program was "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested a more limited setback of only a few months. Officials have since offered evolving characterizations, with some focusing on the achievement of a ceasefire with Israel as the primary success rather than total destruction. Questions also remain about the fate of Iran's enriched uranium, which may have been moved before the attack.</p>

          <p>Following his primary victory, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, the likely next mayor of New York City, has become a key figure in Republican attack lines. GOP leaders are using his progressive platform to portray the entire Democratic party as extremist and out of touch with mainstream America. In response to these attacks, which have included what some call Islamophobic rhetoric, several prominent Democrats have defended Mamdani, even while some moderate party members have kept their distance from his campaign.</p>
