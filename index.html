            <p>PGA Tour Enterprises is reportedly considering a bid to acquire part ownership of the United States' Ryder Cup operations, currently controlled by the PGA of America. This move reflects the PGA Tour's long-standing desire to have a greater influence over major golf events. The potential deal comes amidst ongoing challenges in unifying the PGA Tour with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, despite initial framework agreements and substantial investment from the Strategic Sports Group. The future of the Ryder Cup and elite golf remains uncertain as negotiations continue.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is backing a recall campaign aimed at unseating opposition lawmakers in an effort to regain control of the legislature. The DPP's move follows months of legislative gridlock, with the party accusing the opposition of obstructing key government initiatives. Analysts caution that the campaign could deepen political divisions at a time when Taiwan faces increasing pressure from Beijing. The DPP needs to successfully unseat and replace at least six district-based KMT legislators to reclaim a working majority.</p>

            <p>The article analyzes the implications of Donald Trump's tariff policies on global trade and Britain's relationship with the US. It argues that Trump's actions, reminiscent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, risk triggering a global recession and undermine international cooperation. The author suggests that Britain should prioritize closer ties with the EU for economic and security reasons, especially considering the negative impact of Brexit and Trump's tariffs on British exports. The article also criticizes Keir Starmer's perceived desire to maintain close relations with Trump.</p>

            <p>An Alabama woman, Towana Looney, had a pig kidney removed after a record 130 days due to her body beginning to reject it. Looney, who had been on dialysis since 2016, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the research, which provided valuable insights into xenotransplantation. Although back on dialysis, she felt better for the break she had from it. Doctors are investigating the rejection, and Looney's case contributes to ongoing efforts to address the organ shortage by genetically modifying pigs for human transplants.</p>

            <p>Dive teams are continuing to search the Hudson River for the remaining wreckage from a helicopter crash that killed six people. The NTSB is focusing on recovering the main rotor, main gear box, and tail rotor, as these parts could provide crucial clues about the cause of the accident. Preliminary investigations suggest a rotor may have broken off, causing the helicopter to crash. The helicopter did not have flight recorders, making the recovery of physical evidence even more critical.</p>
