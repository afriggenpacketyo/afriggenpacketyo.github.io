          <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen with intellectual disabilities, was detained by Customs and Border Protection in Arizona for 10 days after allegedly claiming to be a Mexican citizen; his family provided documentation proving his citizenship, but DHS initially defended the arrest, citing Hermosillo's statement. His parents assert he cannot read or write and wouldn't understand what he signed; after being located at a detention center, Hermosillo's case was dismissed, and he was released. The Arizona Attorney General is investigating the wrongful detention, highlighting concerns about the treatment of vulnerable individuals by federal authorities.</p>

Adam Schefter of ESPN noted that any coach drafting Sanders needs to be secure in their position, as speculation could arise about Deion Sanders potentially taking over if the team struggles. Schefter also mentioned Sanders' buyout at Colorado, adding another layer of complexity to the decision-making process for NFL teams considering drafting him.</p>

The USS Yorktown, protected by the Naval History and Heritage Command, serves as a resting place for hundreds of servicemen and has been the site of multiple remotely operated vehicle dives since its discovery in 1998.</p>

Critics argue that this movement aims to push women out of the public sphere and narrow their prospects to childbearing and housekeeping.</p>

          <p>At least 26 tourists were killed in India-administered Kashmir in a mass shooting claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), raising security concerns and challenging the Indian government's narrative of stability in the region.

The incident has raised concerns about tourist safety, especially with the upcoming Amarnath Yatra Hindu pilgrimage, and has prompted criticism of the government's security policies in the region; some suggest the attack aims to destabilize India's Kashmir narrative.</p>

Despite these challenges, ECOWAS must champion democratic values, leave doors open to the juntas, and improve its legitimacy to address the sub-region’s unconstitutional changes of government.</p>
