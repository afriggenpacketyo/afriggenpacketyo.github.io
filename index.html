          <p>A federal judge has ordered Sean "Diddy" Combs to remain detained pending his sentencing after a jury convicted him on two prostitution-related charges. The judge denied bail, agreeing with prosecutors that the crimes warrant mandatory detention and noting Combs' potential as a flight risk. While Combs was acquitted of more severe charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison for each conviction, with a proposed sentencing date in October.</p>

          <p>Following recent US and Israeli strikes, some nuclear proliferation experts fear Iran may adopt a more dangerous and secretive approach to its nuclear ambitions. In response to the attacks, Iran's parliament has voted to halt cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), cutting off independent verification of its program. This move has escalated international concerns that Tehran might withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, further destabilizing the region and complicating future diplomatic efforts.</p>
