          <p>Following a virtual meeting in Kyiv with Ukraine's allies, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a unified demand for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire starting Monday, threatening "massive" sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if the demand is unmet. The meeting included leaders from France, Germany, Poland, and others, with US President Trump reportedly reaffirming his support for the ceasefire after a call with Starmer. The Kremlin reacted by accusing European leaders of confrontational remarks, but indicated they would consider the proposal. This article emphasizes the unified front and potential consequences if Russia does not comply with the ceasefire demand.</p>

          <p>President Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency is creating conflicts of interest that are impeding the passage of crypto legislation. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, intended to regulate stablecoins, due to concerns that Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures are a corrupt scheme. His meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, have raised ethical questions, leading Democrats to oppose the bill.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing criticism and the potential for being labeled "Too Late" by President Trump due to the Fed's cautious approach amid tariff uncertainties and inflation concerns. Economists suggest Powell is in a no-win situation, as threats to both the Fed's mandate on employment and inflation make any action a potential mistake. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to cut rates, but Powell has dismissed pre-emptive cuts, citing a solid economy.
