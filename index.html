          <p>Donald Trump's governing doctrine of unpredictability is causing tension at the NATO summit, as European leaders struggle to balance impressing him with their financial commitments while also planning for the possibility of him abandoning the alliance. Trump's approach to international affairs is driven by a desire for easy wins and a resentment towards countries that don't offer him favorable deals. His recent military intervention in the Middle East, influenced by Benjamin Netanyahu, reflects his vanity and appetite for glory rather than a conventional strategic calculus. The article suggests that Trump's volatile style creates instability and makes it difficult for European democracies to coordinate defense against external threats. The optimism score reflects the anxiety and uncertainty caused by Trump's leadership style.</p>

          <p>Richard Gerald Jordan, Mississippi's longest-serving death row inmate, is scheduled to be executed nearly five decades after he kidnapped and killed a bank loan officer’s wife in 1976.

His lawyers argued his war trauma was not adequately considered during his trial, while the victim's family expressed a desire for the execution to proceed.

          <p>California leaders reached a tentative agreement on a $321-billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12-billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding. The budget includes cuts to healthcare for undocumented immigrants and reinstates asset limit tests for Medi-Cal enrollees, while preserving funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants. The agreement also requires legislators to pass a bill lessening the number of building projects requiring a full environmental review under CEQA.
