          <h2>US Judge Denies Release of Detained Palestinian Activist Mahmoud Khalil</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US judge denied the release of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, despite a previous ruling that the Trump administration could not detain him based on claims of threats to US foreign policy.  The government now seeks to detain him on alternative grounds, alleging he lied on his green-card application.  Khalil's lawyers argue these claims are a pretext to keep him detained, and that his detention is retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights. The ruling prolongs Khalil's detention, keeping him separated from his wife and newborn son.</p>
