        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former Republican Congressman George Santos, ordering his immediate release after less than three months served. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, was described by Trump as "somewhat of a 'rogue'" but praised for his consistent Republican voting record, with Trump also citing alleged mistreatment in prison. This controversial decision follows a public appeal from Santos and lobbying efforts by Republican allies, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who called his conviction a "grave injustice." The U.S. Attorney's Office and several New York House Republicans have condemned the commutation, arguing that Santos's extensive fraud and deceit warranted a much longer period of incarceration.</p>

          <p>Organizations across Southern California are preparing for dozens of "No Kings" rallies and marches throughout Los Angeles County, building on previous large-scale demonstrations against the Trump administration's perceived authoritarianism. These protests, backed by numerous national groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and MoveOn, aim to peacefully push back, asserting that "We don't do dictators or kings in America" and highlighting diversity and empathy as core strengths. Specific event details, including locations and times from Alhambra to Whittier, have been widely disseminated to guide participants across the county. This extensive mobilization reflects a sustained effort by community groups to express dissent and advocate for democratic principles, fostering a sense of collective action against perceived threats to American values.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Spy Drama "Silent Honour" Spurs Public Admiration for Real-Life Agents</h2>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has inspired a significant outpouring of public praise and remembrance for real-life intelligence agents, leading to a surge in visitors to a Beijing park. Hundreds of flowers and thank-you notes were laid at the tomb of Wu Shi, an underground Communist Party member who served as a KMT lieutenant general in Taiwan in 1949, whom many now refer to as an "unsung hero." This unexpected public reaction, occurring outside of traditional grave-sweeping festivals, highlights a newfound appreciation for the sacrifices made by historical figures in China's intelligence community. The article suggests that the drama's strong cultural impact has fostered a deeper connection between the public and the often-secretive world of espionage.</p>

          <h2>Billionaire Bill Ackman Urges Curtis Sliwa to Exit NYC Mayoral Race, Fearing Socialist Victory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 21:59:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has intensified his involvement in the New York City mayoral race, publicly urging Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out, fearing a democratic socialist victory. Ackman argues that Sliwa's continued candidacy is inadvertently paving the way for Zohran Mamdani to win, citing prediction market data showing Mamdani with a nearly 90% chance of victory. Ackman, who supports former Governor Andrew Cuomo's independent bid, believes a one-on-one contest would be more competitive and prevent a socialist from leading the city. Sliwa's campaign, however, has firmly rejected the influence of billionaires, asserting that voters, not donors, will decide the outcome, and insists Sliwa will remain in the race, accusing Cuomo of playing spoiler.

          <p>President Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling for an end to the war but, for now, declining to authorize the transfer of Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv, citing potential escalation. This decision followed a surprise phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where Putin warned against the missiles and offered the prospect of trade deals and another high-profile summit in Budapest, without Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy praised Trump's recent Gaza ceasefire deal, expressing hope for similar momentum in Ukraine, and even proposed a drone-for-Tomahawk exchange. However, Trump's apparent willingness to engage Putin directly, and his caution on military aid, indicates a complex and potentially challenging diplomatic path for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A Marine from the "Gunfighters" squadron tragically died, and another was hospitalized, after their AH-1Z Viper helicopter crashed during a training mission in a desert area of Imperial County, Southern California. The incident, which occurred around 7:05 p.m., claimed the life of one pilot who was pronounced dead at Pioneers Memorial Hospital in Brawley, while the second pilot was transported to Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs in stable condition. Maj. Gen. James B. Wellons, commanding general of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, expressed profound sadness and gratitude for the fallen Marine's "ultimate sacrifice."

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling, seeking permission to deploy National Guard troops to Illinois, escalating a legal and political battle with Democratic-led cities. The Justice Department's emergency filing argues that federal agents have been "threatened and assaulted" in Chicago and Broadview, necessitating military intervention to protect federal property and officers. This move follows previous deployments to other Democratic-led cities, which the president justifies as curbing unrest and bolstering immigration enforcement. Democratic officials, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, strongly oppose the deployment, characterizing it as politically motivated, an overreach of federal authority, and a misuse of military resources against peaceful protests.</p>

This high-profile case remained cold for decades until Hernandez's 2012 arrest, where he confessed to luring and killing Patz, though his attorneys contend he suffers from mental illness and made a false confession.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of more potential issues, stating, "When you see one cockroach, there are probably more," drawing comparisons to the 2023 banking crisis. This follows earlier concerns over auto-related company collapses and highlights a fast-growing, riskier category of lending that emerged post-2008, where regulated banks fund thousands of non-bank lenders. Investors are now actively hunting for hidden risks in NDFI loan books, as these loans, while potentially profitable, can lead to rapid and near-total wipeouts, making their true exposure hard to ascertain.

While overall demand for jewelry is slightly dented, a "fear of missing out" has prompted more customers to buy, anticipating further price increases. Jewellers are adapting by designing lighter, more elaborate-looking pieces and offering smaller gold coins to cater to stagnant customer budgets. A clear trend indicates more customers are buying gold and silver for investment rather than purely for jewelry, a shift reflected in bullion market data, a surge in gold exchange-traded funds, and the Reserve Bank of India's increased gold reserves.

          <p>The U.S. is witnessing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl epidemic, with fatal overdoses falling by approximately 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This remarkable decline is largely attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, which prioritize drug users' health and well-being over criminalization. North Carolina, leading this trend with a 35% decrease, has implemented innovative programs like law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) and expanded access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) such as methadone. The widespread availability of naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, and a generational shift among young people avoiding opioids are also credited for this positive change, alongside substantial opioid settlement funds for prevention and recovery.</p>

While natural variability like weaker winds plays a role, researchers suggest recent changes to shipping fuels, which reduced sun-reflecting sulphur aerosols, might be revealing the full impact of human-caused warming.

          <p>Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Tesla investors vote against a proposed pay plan for CEO Elon Musk, which could grant him nearly $1 trillion more in stock. ISS acknowledged the "astronomical grant value" if performance targets are met, but cited "unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design" as reasons for opposition. Tesla disagreed, accusing ISS of missing fundamental points of investing and governance, and reiterating that Musk receives nothing unless shareholders "win big." This recommendation comes after a 2023 Delaware court ruling rescinded Musk's 2018 pay package due to improper granting, a decision Tesla is currently appealing, adding complexity to the upcoming Nov. 5 shareholder vote.

          <p>A Pakistani national has been sentenced to 40 years in a U.S. prison for smuggling ballistic missile parts from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen, an operation that also tragically resulted in the drowning of two U.S. Navy Seals. Muhammad Pahlawan was convicted on five counts, including terrorism offenses and transporting weapons of mass destruction, after being detained during a U.S. military operation in January 2024. His crew testified they were duped, believing they were fishermen, while Pahlawan, who referred to himself as a "walking dead person" in texts, knew the dangerous nature of the cargo. The components seized were described as "some of the most sophisticated weapon systems" Iran proliferates to terrorist groups, highlighting the severe impact on international shipping.</p>

          <p>Six months after approving a record-setting $4 billion settlement, Los Angeles County has tentatively agreed to pay another $828 million to resolve over 400 additional sexual abuse claims against county employees. These allegations, some dating back to 1959 and involving abuse in foster care and juvenile detention facilities, were enabled by a 2020 California law suspending the statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault victims. County officials are balancing their obligation to compensate victims with protecting taxpayers from fraud, especially as investigations into alleged paid fraudulent claims are currently underway. The cumulative settlements have severely strained the county's finances, impacting critical programs and services, prompting calls for legislative fixes to balance victim rights with public entity financial stability.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has publicly rebuked City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto, directing her to withdraw her request to halt a federal judge’s order prohibiting LAPD officers from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. The council's 12-0 vote came a day before "No Kings" anti-Trump demonstrations were set to begin, with council members asserting that journalism should never be attacked, especially during peaceful protests. Feldstein Soto had argued the ban was overly broad and jeopardized officer and public safety, but her legal team ultimately withdrew the request, though an appeal of the injunction is still pending. This incident highlights growing council frustration over increasing legal payouts and the city attorney's proactive litigation without explicit council direction.</p>

This pole position underscores McLaren's belief that Verstappen remains a strong title contender, despite being 63 points off the lead, following a recent revival by his Red Bull team.

          <p>A mysterious "6-7" trend is sweeping through classrooms, causing students to erupt in glee when they hear the numbers, baffling adults and even leading to school bans due to disruptions. The phrase originates from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," which he leaked in late 2024 without assigning it a specific meaning. The lack of inherent meaning has allowed the phrase to become a playful, generational code word, amplified by social media and appearances in shows like "Abbott Elementary" and "South Park." Educators are finding it challenging to combat, with some principals suggesting rolling with the punches or even joining in to make the trend "uncool," highlighting how kids enjoy secret codes and making adults react.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has been indicted on 18 criminal counts for allegedly systematically sharing classified information with unauthorized relatives while writing his tell-all book. Prosecutors allege Bolton used a group chat, including his wife and daughter, to transmit over 1,000 pages of classified material, including contemporaneous descriptions of high-level foreign policy deliberations and sensitive White House activities. While Bolton submitted his manuscript for prepublication review and made changes, a subsequent political review and the alleged hacking by Iran of an email account containing diary entries further complicate the case. Bolton has pleaded not guilty, arguing this prosecution is nothing but political retribution from the Trump administration for his vocal criticism.</p>

His apology follows significant backlash from local officials and residents who opposed federal intervention, noting federal law widely bans domestic troop deployment for law enforcement. Governor Gavin Newsom and city leaders countered Trump's exaggerated crime claims with data showing declining homicides and robberies, asserting local control over public safety.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S.-China trade war is characterized by "shock tactics," including blame games, tit-for-tat threats, and unpredictable meetings between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping, raising concerns about prospects for resolution. Analysts and former government officials suggest this volatility stems from a disregard for traditional diplomatic norms, leading to both sides misreading each other's intentions and actions. Recent escalations include Trump's salvoes following Beijing's expanded export controls over strategic rare earth minerals, which in turn were triggered by Washington's expanded sanctions on companies linked to blacklisted firms on national security grounds. This continuous cycle of retaliatory measures underscores the deeply fragile and contentious nature of the trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>
