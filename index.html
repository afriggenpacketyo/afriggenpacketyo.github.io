          <p>Protests have erupted in Buenos Aires following the horrific torture and murder of two women and a teenage girl, which was allegedly livestreamed on social media. The crime, linked to drug gangs, has shocked the nation and sparked outrage over femicide, with demonstrators demanding justice and greater protection for women. The case highlights the severe issue of gender-based violence in Argentina, where a woman is killed every 36 hours, and has drawn attention to President Javier Milei's controversial proposal to remove "femicide" from the country's penal code. Several suspects have been arrested, but the alleged mastermind remains at large.</p>

          <p>This article details the rise of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, from inheriting a single Australian newspaper to building a global empire that includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. It explores his ruthless business tactics, his strategy of owning both populist tabloids and elite newspapers, and his significant influence on politics in the UK, Australia, and the US. The piece highlights his symbiotic relationship with politicians like Margaret Thatcher and his early cultivation of Donald Trump through the New York Post's Page Six column. Experts describe his impact on political discourse as both fascinating and, for many, poisonous.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's robust manufacturing economy, which benefited from the first "China Shock" in the early 2000s, is now facing a severe economic crisis from a second wave. Unlike the first shock that targeted low-end goods, this new wave sees China competing directly in Germany's core industries like automobiles and machinery, turning a key customer into a major competitor. Economists warn this could lead to a deindustrialization worse than what the U.S. experienced, as German exports plummet and companies struggle with cheaper, "good enough" Chinese products. The situation is forcing Germany to reconsider its export-led model and explore options like tariffs and boosting domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A source close to negotiations indicates that Hamas and other Palestinian factions are likely to accept a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza. The 20-point proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for a swift ceasefire, the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid. The plan also outlines a future for Gaza governed by an interim administration of Palestinian technocrats, with an international "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. Several key Muslim-majority nations have already issued a joint statement welcoming the proposal, signaling broad regional support for the diplomatic effort.</p>

          <p>Veteran goalkeeper Craig Gordon, 42, has been named to the Scotland national football squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Greece and Belarus. This marks his return to the team after recovering from a neck injury that has kept him out of action since May. Gordon, who has 81 caps for his country, replaces his Hearts teammate Zander Clark in the squad.

          <p>In a crucial speech at the Labour Party conference, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to present the British public with a choice between his party's vision of "renewal" and the "decline and division" he associates with Reform UK. Facing internal criticism and falling poll numbers, Starmer will argue that his path, while difficult, is one of decency and rebuilding the country from the grassroots up. The speech is seen as a pivotal moment for his leadership, as he attempts to regain momentum and unite his party ahead of a difficult budget and challenging local elections next year.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a surge in attacks on its critical infrastructure, including cyberattacks, drone incursions, and physical sabotage of its rail system. Officials and security experts attribute the threats to a combination of state actors like Russia and China, as well as domestic left-wing extremists. These "hybrid attacks" are seen as attempts to destabilize society and erode public trust in government institutions. The incidents have prompted calls for enhanced security measures and greater transparency, as concerns grow over whether Germany is adequately prepared to defend against such multi-pronged threats.</p>

          <p>Kentucky has been aggressively disqualifying residents from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) using fraud allegations based solely on shopping pattern data, a practice judges have criticized. The state has revoked benefits from hundreds of individuals for activities like making same-day purchases or whole-dollar transactions, which officials deem suspicious but are not proof of fraud. This has made Kentucky second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, often affecting low-income families over small sums of money. Despite a court order to stop, lawsuits allege the state continues this practice, creating significant hardship for vulnerable residents.</p>

Following President Trump's pardons, a growing number of defendants are filing requests to have the federal government refund payments meant to cover the millions in damages to the Capitol. While one judge has ordered a reimbursement, citing a vacated conviction, another has denied a similar request, creating a legal gray area.

          <p>A U.S. official has suggested that Taiwan's dominance in the semiconductor industry is a vulnerability for America, challenging the long-held Taiwanese belief in a "silicon shield." For years, Taiwan has operated under the assumption that its critical role in the global chip supply chain would compel the U.S. to defend it against a potential Chinese invasion. However, the official, Lutnick, stated that the U.S. administration's objective is to onshore significant chip manufacturing, reframing Taiwan's chip concentration as a risk rather than a guarantee of protection. This signals a potential shift in U.S. strategic thinking regarding Taiwan's security.</p>

In contrast, Santa Rosa's rebuilt Coffey Park neighborhood has seen property values double, pushing it from middle-class to upscale.

          <p>Arsenal centre-back William Saliba has committed his future to the club by signing a new five-year contract, ending speculation of a potential move to Real Madrid. The 24-year-old French international credited manager Mikel Arteta and his staff for his development, stating his belief that they can help him become one of the best defenders in the world. Saliba has become a cornerstone of Arsenal's defense since his debut in 2022, making 105 league appearances. The extension is seen as a major boost for the club as they aim to win major trophies.</p>

          <p>In Nepal, a two-year-old girl named Aryatara Shakya has been chosen as the new Kumari, or "living goddess," a centuries-old tradition revered by both Hindus and Buddhists. She was carried from her home to a temple palace in Kathmandu, which will be her residence until she reaches puberty, at which point she will return to mortal life. The selection process requires girls to meet strict criteria, including having unblemished features and showing no fear of the dark. The former Kumari, now 11, has retired, and the government now provides a small pension to help former goddesses readjust to normal life.</p>

          <p>A Greenpeace study reports that Russia has earned billions in tax revenue from liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales to European Union companies since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. While the EU has banned Russian oil and coal, LNG imports remain exempt from sanctions, allowing Russia's Yamal LNG to collect an estimated $9.5 billion in taxes from global exports. French, German, and Spanish energy companies are among the top clients, with their tax contributions funding a significant portion of Russia's war machine. The study highlights that key EU importers have spent more on Russian LNG than they have provided in support to Ukraine. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As U.S. lawmakers face a midnight deadline to pass a funding bill, the federal government is on the brink of a shutdown. A shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve a budget, halting all nonessential government functions and furloughing hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay. Essential services, such as the military, air traffic control, and law enforcement, continue to operate, but workers are not paid until the shutdown ends. Mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare are unaffected, but national parks, museums, and various federal agencies could close, causing disruptions and economic losses.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-led ceasefire proposal for Gaza represents the most serious effort to end the conflict, backed by broad international and Arab support. The plan details an immediate hostage-prisoner exchange and a framework for Gaza's reconstruction under a transitional body, potentially leading to a reformed Palestinian Authority taking control. However, significant hurdles remain, as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasizes indefinite security control, while Hamas faces pressure to accept terms that require its disarmament. The deal's success hinges on navigating these conflicting interests, with the potential for it to collapse if either side feels its core objectives are not met.</p>

This new strategy puts them in the position of potentially forcing a shutdown, which could carry political risks, as the public has historically blamed Republicans for such standoffs.

This strategy allows them to weather economic uncertainty while seeking returns in assets that are less correlated with the stock market, such as fractional ownership of fine art or real estate investment platforms.

          <p>Economists warn that a potential U.S. government shutdown could harm an already delicate economy, though the initial impact is typically modest. The primary damage comes from furloughed federal workers cutting back on consumer spending, with each week of a shutdown estimated to reduce quarterly GDP growth by about 0.1%. However, a prolonged shutdown could inflict more significant damage, erode consumer confidence, and disrupt the flow of crucial economic data, like the monthly jobs report. This could complicate the Federal Reserve's ability to manage inflation and employment, making it harder to steer the economy through a turbulent period. (not investment advice)</p>
