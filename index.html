          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule, which offered lower rates for some nations ahead of a looming deadline. Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief and gratitude for the reduced duties, with Cambodia's rate dropping from 49% to 19%. Taiwan received a temporary 20% tariff with the possibility of further reductions, while Malaysia's rate was also lowered to 19%. In contrast, India, having not secured a deal, faces a 25% tariff as negotiations for a broader trade agreement continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced a new schedule of tariffs on imports from over 60 countries, with rates ranging from 10% to over 40%. The duties, which will take effect in seven days, are categorized based on whether the U.S. has a trade surplus or deficit with the partner nation. This move is part of the administration's broader strategy to rewrite international trade rules, though it has fallen short of its "90 deals in 90 days" goal and has raised concerns about economic uncertainty.

          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has formally requested a trade due to stalled contract extension negotiations. McLaurin, who is entering the final year of his contract, previously sat out the start of training camp to avoid fines but remains a "hold-in" on the physically unable to perform list. The two-time Pro Bowl selection is coming off a career-best season where he was instrumental in the team's playoff run. The team's general manager expressed a desire to keep McLaurin, but the lack of progress has led to this significant development.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the financial precarity and exhaustion experienced by many millennial women, who were encouraged to pursue their passions but now face systemic economic challenges. The author contrasts her freelance, insecure career with the more stable, full-time jobs of her male peers, arguing the system relies on undervalued female labor. Feeling caught between societal expectations and economic reality, she notes a dark humor in longing for a wealthy patron or spouse as the only perceived safety net, highlighting a generational sense of disillusionment.</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait are enhancing their military relationship, highlighted by the imminent opening of a joint ammunition factory.

          <p>The Trump administration has revived its use of tariffs as a primary tool of economic policy, imposing new import taxes on numerous countries to encourage domestic purchasing and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Tariffs function as a tax on foreign goods, which can lead to higher prices for consumers as companies pass on the costs. The administration's approach has been volatile, with critics accusing the president of using dramatic policy announcements as a negotiating tactic, creating uncertainty in the global economy and impacting prices on various consumer goods.

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a $200 million project President Trump aims to complete before his term ends. Trump stated the addition is necessary to host large-scale events without relying on tents on the South Lawn, calling the project "his gift to the country." Funding will reportedly come from Trump himself and other private "patriot donors." This will be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948, replacing the current East Wing.</p>

          <p>Following design software company Figma's highly successful IPO, its major venture capital backers are holding a combined stake worth approximately $24 billion. The company's stock soared 250% on its first day of trading, reaching a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion, more than triple the amount of Adobe's failed acquisition offer. This blockbuster debut marks a significant positive turn for the tech IPO market, which has been largely dormant since late 2021, providing a major paper return for firms like Index Ventures, Greylock, and Sequoia.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is drafting legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire fund, which is at risk of being depleted. The plan would source $9 billion from shareholders of the state's three largest utilities and the other $9 billion from their customers via an extended surcharge on monthly bills. The original $21 billion fund, created in 2019 to protect utilities from bankruptcy after their equipment sparks fires, could be exhausted by a single major blaze. Consumer advocates and utility executives have both expressed criticism of the new proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a legislative hearing, it was revealed that top officials in Kerr County, Texas, were either asleep or out of town when deadly flash floods struck over the July 4th weekend. The county's emergency management coordinator and sheriff both testified they were asleep, while the county's top executive was away. The floods killed at least 95 people in Kerr County alone, leading to criticism over whether authorities provided adequate warnings. The officials defended themselves, stating there was no forecast from the National Weather Service indicating the disaster's magnitude.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that a majority of the 109,000 arrests made by ICE in the first five months of President Trump's second term occurred in Southern and border states. Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of all arrests, followed by Florida and California. This geographic concentration is attributed to local law enforcement cooperation with federal authorities and large immigrant populations. Overall, ICE arrests have increased by 120% compared to the same period in the previous year, aligning with the administration's goal of a mass deportation effort.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Modern Potato Evolved from Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in the journal Cell proposes that the modern potato evolved from an ancestor of the tomato around 9 million years ago. Scientists analyzed hundreds of potato genomes and found that the potato's ability to produce starchy tubers resulted from a hybridization event. An ancient tomato species provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while a wild, non-tuber-producing potato relative from Chile contributed a gene that controls their growth. This discovery helps solve the long-standing puzzle of the popular vegetable's genetic origins.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals China's Use of a 'Dark Fleet' to Evade Sanctions on Iranian Oil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News investigation found that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by secretly purchasing Iranian oil using a "dark fleet" of tankers. These ships conduct ship-to-ship oil transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, often with their identification transponders turned off to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which props up the Iranian regime and its programs, is estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran. Despite new U.S. sanctions, the activity appears to be increasing, as China does not recognize the unilateral U.S. restrictions.</p>
