          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly threatened to support a primary challenger against Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina. The threat came after Tillis announced his opposition to Trump's major spending bill, citing concerns over significant cuts to Medicaid funding in his state. Despite Tillis's "no" vote, the bill narrowly cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate with support from other Republicans. Trump also criticized Senator Rand Paul, another Republican who voted against the measure, questioning his party loyalty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium for a potential bomb in a matter of months. This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi said caused severe but not total damage, contradicting claims that the program was obliterated. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) believes Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its activities. This situation has heightened tensions, with Iran's parliament suspending cooperation with the IAEA in response to the attacks.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous points decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul, 28, dominated the fight as Chavez Jr., 39, was largely defensive and inactive, throwing few punches throughout the contest. The judges scored the fight 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92 in favor of Paul, who has now won 12 professional fights. The victory continues to raise questions about the quality of Paul's opponents, as Chavez Jr. appeared far from his prime championship form.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of a 17-year-old TikTok star in Pakistan has intensified concerns over the safety of women who maintain a public online presence. Many female social media users in the country report experiencing a pattern of online harassment, stalking, and threats that often escalate into real-world danger. Activists argue that deeply ingrained patriarchal norms contribute to a culture where women's visibility is perceived as a threat to traditional values, making them targets for abuse. Despite some platform-level safety improvements, many women feel that social media companies and authorities are not doing enough to protect them.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, at least 81 Palestinians were killed and over 400 injured in Israeli strikes across Gaza over a 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near a stadium in Gaza City, which was being used as a shelter for displaced people, killing at least 11 individuals, including children. The ongoing violence continues as mediators from Qatar express hope that the recent Israel-Iran truce could create momentum for a new ceasefire agreement in Gaza.

          <p>A jury has convicted Samuel Woodward of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of his former classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, who had ties to a neo-Nazi group, targeted and killed Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The defense conceded that Woodward was responsible for the death but argued it was not premeditated. This article details the long road to justice, the evidence presented at trial, and the Bernstein family's effort to counter the hatred that led to their son's murder by promoting kindness.</p>

          <p>The French government is leading a â‚¬1.35 billion investment into satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink broadband service. This move positions Eutelsat as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty, especially after its 2023 merger with British venture OneWeb. However, experts are skeptical about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term, citing significant disparities in scale, with Eutelsat operating 650 satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. The company is expected to focus on sovereign, security, and enterprise markets rather than mass-market consumer broadband. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated his continued progress as a pitcher by throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his MLB career, a four-seam fastball that reached 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong performance on the mound, where he allowed one hit and struck out one, Ohtani was unable to contribute offensively, going hitless in four at-bats. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak.</p>

          <p>New regulations banning smoking on all public beaches, in parks, and near schools and swimming pools have gone into effect across France. The rules are part of a broader government initiative to protect children from passive smoking and to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. The ban also applies to bus shelters but notably excludes the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants. Violators could face fines ranging from â‚¬135 to â‚¬700, although a grace period will be initially observed to allow the public to adapt to the new measures.</p>

After Hulme rejected her advances, Pinto engaged in extensive online harassment, including making false accusations of heinous crimes. The article highlights systemic failures, alleging that both the police and the Bishop of Leicester initially dismissed Hulme's complaints, with the bishop even accusing Hulme of witchcraft before Pinto's eventual conviction and a subsequent apology from the bishop.</p>

This practice involves local authorities implementing rules that are even stricter than those mandated by the central government.

          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, cities like London are experiencing significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to the "urban heat island" effect. This phenomenon is caused by dark, hard surfaces like roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly and keeping urban centers warmer, especially at night. The lack of vegetation and water in cities further contributes to the temperature difference, which can be as much as 10Â°C. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent, this effect poses a growing risk to urban populations.</p>
