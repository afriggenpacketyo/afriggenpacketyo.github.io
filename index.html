          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing non-compliance with information requests and concerns about an unsafe campus environment for Jewish students. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of promoting anti-Hamas sympathies and employing racist diversity policies, leading to the revocation of the university's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. Harvard condemned the move as unlawful and retaliatory, asserting its commitment to hosting international students and scholars. The decision prohibits Harvard from having aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status for the 2025-2026 academic year.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, setting stricter standards than federal regulations, including the state's EV mandate requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. The vote was 51-44, with Sen. Elissa Slotkin joining Republicans. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn agency rules, but Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California's Attorney General is prepared for a legal fight, and the decision is expected to impact 16 other states and D.C. that have adopted California's standards.</p>

          <p>A new White House report outlines concerns about the health of American children, emphasizing issues such as rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and mental illness. The report echoes Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views on the modern environment's impact on health and corporate influence on research. It highlights the role of ultraprocessed foods in children's diets and raises concerns about vaccines, though it avoids linking them to autism. The report also points to a lack of government funding for nutrition research and the potential risks of synthetic chemicals.</p>

          <p>Thailand's deep south is experiencing renewed conflict between Thai military forces and separatist groups, with violence escalating in 2025. The Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), a dominant separatist group, has been implicated in attacks targeting civilians. Efforts to achieve a Ramadan ceasefire failed, leading to increased attacks and casualties. Despite peace talks and involvement from Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, analysts believe the efforts are more symbolic than practical, with the government prioritizing narrative control.
