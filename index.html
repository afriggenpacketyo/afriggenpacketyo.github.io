          <p>Iran is reportedly planning to integrate with China's BeiDou satellite navigation system to enhance its security infrastructure. This move follows significant losses to its military and nuclear facilities during a recent conflict with Israel and the US. Analysts suggest this strategic shift, born from a "bitter experience" with Western technology, could deepen Beijing's technological and geopolitical influence in the Middle East. The collaboration is a key component of ongoing long-term agreement negotiations between Tehran and Beijing.</p>

Despite expressing that he is "very disappointed" with Putin, Trump has been noncommittal on whether the consequences will be enforced, suggesting a potential bilateral meeting is still possible.

          <p>Shares of government-backed mining company MP Materials surged after it reported a narrowed second-quarter loss and a significant jump in sales. The positive results were driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, a critical component for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and robotics. This performance follows a major investment from the U.S. Defense Department, which purchased $400 million in stock and set a price floor for NdPr. The company is now focused on scaling up its magnet production facility in Texas. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite being on track for $20 billion in annual recurring revenue, the company remains unprofitable due to the high costs of developing advanced AI models. Altman emphasized that as long as the models continue to improve on a distinct curve, the rational strategy is to run a loss, a position afforded by remaining a private company free from public market pressures.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) is taking over an investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham. The claims, first reported by the BBC, come from five women who state they were exploited by grooming gangs and also abused by officers during the 1990s and early 2000s. South Yorkshire Police initially planned to handle the inquiry but faced calls for its removal to ensure transparency. The NCA has affirmed its commitment to keeping the victims central to the investigation.</p>

          <p>Robert Gordon, the former Michigan state health director who oversaw the implementation of Medicaid work requirements, is warning other states about the potential for catastrophic coverage losses. A new federal law mandates a vast expansion of these requirements, which Gordon's experience showed can cause tens of thousands to lose insurance despite extensive efforts and millions in spending to prevent it. He describes how his team worked to mitigate fallout but still projected 80,000 people would lose coverage before a court blocked the policy. He argues the policy is administratively wasteful and ultimately just as harmful as directly cutting people from Medicaid.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, the father of Rom Braslavski, a 22-year-old Israeli hostage held by Islamic Jihad for 670 days, makes a desperate plea to President Trump for assistance. He describes the horror of seeing his son in a recent propaganda video, appearing emaciated, tortured, and on the verge of death. The father, who states this is the first time he has seen his son cry, appeals to Trump's leadership to demand the immediate release of all 50 hostages remaining in Gaza. He frames the situation not just as an Israeli tragedy but as a "global test of conscience."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a high probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September, savers are being advised to consider opening a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in currently high rates. The article argues that a CD with a term of 12 months or less, particularly with a larger deposit like $10,000, offers a strategic way to earn substantial interest without sacrificing long-term access to funds. It notes that banks may lower their CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision, making it prudent to act sooner. This approach allows savers to benefit from high returns while maintaining flexibility for future financial moves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent constitutional amendment in Togo has allowed President Faure Gnassingbe to transition to a new, unelected role as President of the Council of Ministers, effectively cementing his family's nearly 60-year rule. This move, which critics label a "constitutional coup," transfers most presidential powers to his new position and removes term limits, potentially allowing him to rule indefinitely. Observers and human rights advocates fear this could serve as a blueprint for other African leaders to subvert democratic processes and extend their power without facing direct elections, contributing to a worrying trend of shrinking civic space on the continent.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, describing him as "highly CONFLICTED" in a post on Truth Social. The demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton, which raised concerns about Tan's reported investments and ties to numerous Chinese companies, including some allegedly linked to the Chinese military. In response, Intel released a letter from Tan to employees in which he affirmed his commitment to the company and legal standards, pushing back against what he called "misinformation." Intel's stock slipped following the president's post.</p>

          <p>Leading global insurers like Allianz and Zurich are warning that the escalating climate crisis threatens to make entire regions uninsurable, which could destabilize the broader economy. An Allianz board member noted that as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, the world is approaching a point where offering cover for assets like homes will no longer be viable, impacting mortgages and investments. With a massive existing gap between economic losses and insured coverage, insurers fear that rising risks will make premiums unaffordable, effectively destroying the system that underpins capitalism by managing financial risk.</p>

          <p>Star Chinese investment banker Bao Fan has reportedly been released after being detained by mainland authorities for more than two years to "cooperate" in an unspecified investigation. The founder of China Renaissance Holdings, Bao's sudden disappearance in early 2023 sent shockwaves through the country's business and tech communities. During his absence, he resigned as CEO and chairman but remains the company's controlling shareholder.

          <p>Viktoriia Roshchyna, a 27-year-old Ukrainian journalist, was buried in Kyiv after dying in Russian custody. Roshchyna was captured by Russian forces two years ago while reporting from occupied territories and died last autumn during a prison transfer. Her body, which showed signs of torture and abuse, was only returned to Ukraine in February as part of a larger exchange of fallen soldiers. An international investigation revealed some of her internal organs were missing, possibly to conceal the cause of death. President Zelenskyy posthumously awarded her the Order of Freedom for her civic courage and patriotism.</p>

          <p>A new CNBC survey indicates President Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain negative, with 51% of the public disapproving of his job performance. The poll also shows a record-low favorability rating for the Democratic Party, sinking to a net -32 percentage points. While Trump's ratings are stable, the public holds negative views on his handling of key issues like inflation and federal spending, with securing the southern border being the only policy area with a positive approval rating. The survey suggests a complex political environment with voter dissatisfaction directed at both sides. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a move to appease President Trump's calls for U.S.-based manufacturing, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced plans to spend approximately $600 billion in the U.S. over four years. While not committing to final iPhone assembly in the country, Cook highlighted that key components like glass and sensors are already made by American suppliers like Corning and Coherent. The announcement appeared to succeed in easing pressure, as Trump simultaneously announced that Apple would be exempt from a planned tariff on chips. Experts view the move as a savvy navigation of political pressures, giving the president a headline without fundamentally altering Apple's global supply chain.</p>

          <p>OpenStore, an e-commerce aggregator co-founded by venture capitalist Keith Rabois, is shutting down nearly all of the 40-plus Shopify brands it acquired. The company will now focus solely on its menswear brand, Jack Archer, after raising a new funding round at a drastically reduced valuation of $50 million, down from $1 billion. This move signals the end of the boom for the e-commerce aggregator market, which raised billions to roll up independent online sellers during the pandemic. Many aggregators, including OpenStore, struggled to profitably manage their diverse portfolios as online retail growth cooled and customer acquisition costs rose.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute identifies the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as the most-stolen vehicle in the U.S. for model years 2022 to 2024. The high-performance muscle car had a theft rate 39 times higher than the average vehicle, with thieves attracted to its power and a specific security vulnerability in its on-board data ports. The report notes that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks dominate the top 20 list of most-stolen cars. Conversely, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in secure garages and have advanced connectivity features.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Crocs, Andrew Rees, has described the current consumer environment as "concerning," leading the company to plan a reduction in orders for the second half of the year. Rees noted that U.S. consumers are behaving cautiously with discretionary spending, and retail partners are consequently reducing their future orders. In response, Crocs plans to pull back on promotions and reset retail partners with new stock for its Heydude brand, which will create short-term sales headwinds. The company's stock fell sharply after it issued a weaker-than-expected forecast for the third quarter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Market analysts are suggesting that bitcoin's predictable four-year price cycle, which revolves around its "halving" event, is showing signs of breaking down. Historically, bitcoin's price would peak 12-18 months after the halving, followed by a major crash. However, the recent cycle saw an all-time high before the April 2024 halving, largely driven by the launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Experts believe factors like institutional investment and a more supportive regulatory environment are creating a new, less volatile market dynamic, potentially ending the era of 80% price crashes.
