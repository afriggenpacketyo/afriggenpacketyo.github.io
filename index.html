          <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin asserted that the Trump administration's deregulatory actions would not adversely affect public health or the environment, emphasizing the need to balance environmental protection with economic growth. Zeldin defended the reconsideration of rules across various sectors, including power plants and wastewater regulations, arguing that the Biden administration's regulations were too broad and costly. However, the Environmental Protection Network, comprising former EPA employees, estimates that the deregulations could lead to increased air pollution, resulting in nearly 200,000 premature deaths and numerous asthma attacks annually. Zeldin encouraged public input during the deregulatory process. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers, led by Professor Wang Chao, has made a significant advancement in quantum cryptology by successfully factoring a 90-bit RSA integer using a D-Wave Advantage quantum computer. This achievement raises concerns about the potential for quantum computers to break even the most secure encryption, leading to a hypothetical "Q-Day" where data security is compromised. The development has spurred a global race to develop quantum technologies and countermeasures, such as post-quantum cryptography, to stay ahead of the looming threat. RSA encryption, widely used for securing digital communications, relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>A paddleboard tour operator, Nerys Bethan Lloyd, faced sentencing after four individuals drowned during a tour she led on the River Cleddau in Pembrokeshire in October 2021.

During the court proceedings, family members of the deceased expressed their grief and anger, describing the devastating impact of the tragedy and accusing Lloyd of negligence.

Wilshere, previously a first-team coach, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley as he takes charge of the team's upcoming matches against Middlesbrough and Cardiff.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over higher levies imposed by Washington. A proposal involves increasing the amount imported from the United States to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000. Japan has traditionally protected its domestic rice industry, but concessions are seen as necessary to secure exemption from U.S. tariffs. The move also addresses growing calls for more affordable imported rice amid domestic supply shortages. Optimism score: 55</p>
