          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles to assess the situation regarding protests over ICE raids, stating that the Trump administration believes the National Guard and Marines are still necessary despite waning protests. Vance accused Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass of inciting violence during the protests, alleging they endangered law enforcement. He suggested the administration would use the Guard in other places if local authorities don't enforce laws and protect federal agents. Federal agents were seen outside the Dodgers ballpark after the team blocked immigration authorities from entering, sparking further protests. Optimism around the situation remains cautious, given the potential for renewed tensions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil on bail, determining he was not a flight risk or threat. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested by ICE in March, sparking demonstrations. The government accused Khalil of failing to disclose information on his residency application, but the judge expressed skepticism about the government's reasoning and suggested it was punishing him for his protests. Khalil's attorneys argued his free speech rights were violated, and his wife accepted his diploma on his behalf during his detention. </p>

          <p>Representative Darrell Issa suggested a constitutional amendment to allow Congress and the Supreme Court to remove a president deemed unable to perform their duties, citing concerns about the alleged cover-up of former President Biden's health. Issa argued that the 25th Amendment's reliance on the Vice President and Cabinet may be insufficient due to potential bias. The House Oversight Committee is set to interview Biden administration officials regarding the former president's decline, seeking to determine if officials used the autopen without authorization. Amending the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber and ratification by three-quarters of states, making it a challenging endeavor.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, charged with murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allege that prosecutors intentionally violated his right to a fair trial by releasing his journal entries. The defense argues the release was meant to bias the public, undermining his right to a fair trial, especially considering the federal prosecution could lead to the death penalty. Mangione's attorneys are seeking to delay or dismiss the state case to focus on the federal prosecution. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and it remains unclear which prosecution will proceed first.</p>

          <p>This satirical article humorously critiques the lack of a clear uniform for ICE agents, questioning how individuals are supposed to recognize them as law enforcement. It suggests that the absence of a uniform implies a lack of accountability and makes it difficult to distinguish agents from ordinary citizens or even criminals. The piece sarcastically advises agents to avoid looking like they are acting in an official capacity, recommending outfits that are confusing and non-identifying. The author uses Coco Chanel's quote to emphasize the removal of anything that identifies them as an officer of the law.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly contradicted his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, stating she was "wrong" in her assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. This marks the second time in a week Trump has dismissed Gabbard's assessment, as the White House asserts Iran has the necessary components to build a nuclear weapon quickly. Gabbard defended her testimony, claiming media outlets took her words out of context, emphasizing that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks if it chooses to finalize assembly. The disagreement highlights internal tensions within the administration regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court sided with civil liberties groups who argued the law violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Republican lawmakers, including President Trump, supported the mandate, arguing the Ten Commandments are historically significant and foundational to U.S. law. The ruling is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, potentially testing the conservative court on the issue of religion and government.</p>
