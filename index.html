        <h2>Shift in Republican Party Stance on Russia</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-15 04:00:44 EDT</div>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The Republican party's stance on Russia has shifted dramatically, moving from cold war hawks to a more isolationist and pro-Putin approach under Trump's influence.  This is evident in Trump's actions, such as setting up a peace process excluding Ukraine and his criticism of Zelenskyy.  While some Republicans remain critical, many are silent or supportive due to loyalty or fear of Trump.  Younger Republicans also show skepticism of institutions like NATO.</p>

        <h2>Trump's Use of South Africa as a Cautionary Tale</h2>

        <p>President Trump and his supporters portray South Africa as a cautionary tale of anti-white discrimination resulting from diversity initiatives.
