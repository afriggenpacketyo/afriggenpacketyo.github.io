While acknowledging their many political differences, Hochul emphasized her responsibility to work with whomever the voters choose to lead New York City. She noted that Mamdani's campaign has highlighted the economic struggles many residents face, a sentiment she believes needs to be addressed regardless of political affiliation.</p>

Authorities reported that heavily armed assailants arrived on motorcycles and in vehicles before opening fire. This attack is the latest in a wave of extreme violence that has plagued the country, which authorities attribute to disputes among organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels. The incident underscores the severe security crisis in Ecuador, which has seen thousands of homicides this year.</p>

The blaze spread rapidly across the hill, with smoke visible across the city during a busy festival weekend, but no casualties were reported. Police closed off the area and advised the public to stay away while four fire appliances and specialist resources worked to control the flames.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor laborers from heat, farmworkers continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. Advocates and some lawmakers attribute the ongoing tragedies to a lack of effective enforcement by the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA). A recent state audit criticized the agency for insufficient staffing and outdated procedures, while reviews of recent fatalities show few penalties were imposed on employers. The situation is compounded by the fact that many farmworkers are undocumented and fear retaliation for reporting unsafe conditions.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators marched through central London, calling for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Led by the UK's chief rabbi, protesters carried Israeli flags and placards displaying the faces of the hostages. Some attendees expressed anger at the UK government's conditional intention to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a concession to Hamas. The Metropolitan Police made three arrests for assault and a public order offense during the largely peaceful demonstration.</p>

The union stated the attack, carried out by a man who distrusted COVID-19 vaccines, was not random and has compounded months of vilification that has put scientists at risk. They specifically called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a clear stance against disinformation to reinforce public trust in science. The union also requested enhanced security and that staff not be required to immediately return to work in buildings marked by bullet holes.</p>

          <p>NPR has announced a new series, "The World, Reordering," which will examine the significant shifts currently reshaping the global system. The series aims to explore how the post-World War II "liberal international order," once defined by U.S. leadership and multilateralism, is now fracturing due to the resurgence of authoritarian powers and changing alliances. Reporting from international correspondents will analyze how countries are adapting to a world where U.S. influence appears to be waning. The project will investigate whether these new dynamics can sustain the progress and prosperity seen since 1945.</p>

Abbott vowed to call continuous special legislative sessions, stating the Democrats could be forced to stay away for years to evade arrest.

This incident has intensified the debate within the FDA and the medical community about balancing the need for rapid access to treatments for desperate patients against the risks of unproven therapies.

          <p>A fast-spreading wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has burned nearly 5,400 acres along the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, prompting evacuation orders for thousands of residents. A Kern County firefighter sustained major injuries when his truck rolled over a ridge in the steep terrain while battling the blaze. Fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, the fire expanded rapidly, though favorable weather has since allowed crews to make progress on containment. The incident is one of several active wildfires across California, a state increasingly affected by longer and more destructive fire seasons linked to climate change.</p>

Many investors had bet against the company, citing its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential financial hits from antitrust rulings and tariffs. However, when President Trump publicly endorsed Apple's U.S. investment plans, the stock rose, forcing short-sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, which in turn drove the price up even further.

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid a heartfelt tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, whom he portrayed in the 1995 film "Apollo 13." Following Lovell's death at age 97, Hanks described him as a man who dared to lead others to places most would not go on their own. Lovell famously commanded the near-disastrous Apollo 13 mission, which became known as a "successful failure" after the crew returned safely to Earth against all odds. Hanks praised Lovell's courage and pioneering spirit, concluding his tribute with, "God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell."</p>

          <p>The Japanese practice of 'forest bathing,' or shinrin-yoku, is gaining popularity as a method for improving mental health and focus. The mindfulness technique involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses to connect with the natural environment. Certified forest therapy guides lead walks designed to help people slow down, disconnect from technology, and be present, which can lower stress levels. Experts note that the benefits can be achieved even with short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard, not just on long-guided hikes.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting to address Israel's plan to take control of Gaza City, a move that has drawn widespread international condemnation. UN officials warned the offensive could trigger another humanitarian calamity, while nations like the UK and France urged Israel to reverse its decision.

          <p>Branding expert and self-described introvert Goldie Chan argues that building a personal brand is a key strategy for introverts to succeed in the workplace.

Chan recommends starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online, to build comfort and momentum. She emphasizes that a personal brand is built through both online presence and offline activities, like participating in hobby groups.</p>
