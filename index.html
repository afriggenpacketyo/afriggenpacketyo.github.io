            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that doctors involved in two end-of-life cases can be named publicly, reversing previous court orders. This decision follows legal battles initiated by the parents of Isaiah Haastrup and Zainab Abbasi, who sought to share their children's stories. The court emphasized the importance of freedom of speech and the public's right to know about patient treatment in public hospitals. The ruling was welcomed by the families, who felt previously silenced, while NHS trusts expressed concerns about potential abuse or harassment of medical staff.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has issued a warning that the outlook for global trade has sharply deteriorated due to the surge in tariffs and trade policy uncertainty. The WTO now projects a decline of 0.2% in the volume of world merchandise trade for 2025, a significant drop from previous expectations. This decline is expected to particularly impact North America, with exports forecasted to decrease by 12.6%. The WTO also cautioned about severe downside risks, including the potential for reciprocal tariffs and broader policy uncertainty, which could further exacerbate the decline in global goods trade.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>According to WH Smith's CEO, Carl Cowling, Donald Trump's tariff war may lead to price cuts rather than inflation for UK retailers. He argues that East Asian suppliers seeking alternatives to the US could increase stock availability in the UK. WH Smith has not yet experienced supply disruptions, and its stock orders are secured until after Christmas. Cowling believes the company's US business is well-positioned, with local sourcing for food and potential supplier shifts to countries with lower tariffs for other products.

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a proposal to slash the State Department budget by nearly half, potentially eliminating funding for international organizations like the UN and NATO. The plan also includes closing smaller embassies and consulates, scaling back foreign service travel, and eliminating the Fulbright scholarship program. A State Department spokesperson stated that the proposal is an early draft and not yet final. Democrats have warned that such cuts would create a vacuum for adversaries like China and Russia to fill on the world stage.</p>

            <p>New US export restrictions on Nvidia’s H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chips are expected to disrupt the plans of China’s Big Tech firms and force companies to shift to domestic semiconductor alternatives. Nvidia disclosed that Washington will require a license to export its H20 chips to China, a move the company expects to cost it US$5.5 billion. Analysts believe Nvidia's China business is likely to decline significantly, prompting Chinese companies to accelerate their reliance on domestic AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a key development in underwater acoustic technology that could enhance the country’s underwater defence capabilities. The innovation allows scientists to pinpoint the depth of a low-frequency sound source with near-perfect accuracy in the Arctic’s Beaufort Sea. The research details how scientists could use challenging Arctic oceanographic conditions to develop a passive depth-discrimination method with 93 per cent accuracy for underwater targets and a 100 per cent success rate for identifying surface vessels.</p>

The minerals are used in a number of key US defence systems including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.</p>

The author argues that AI can hurtle its users along similar swings, and in many instances, to depend on technology, to trust it at all, means to be betrayed by it.</p>

            <p>This article argues that artists should frame their opposition to AI companies' use of their work in terms of moral injury. Moral injury occurs when individuals are forced to violate their own values, leading to shame, anxiety, and depression. Framing the issue this way challenges the narrative that AI innovation is essential for progress. The author argues that artists' concerns go beyond fair use or remixing, as they believe AI contributes to the "enshittification" of the world.</p>
