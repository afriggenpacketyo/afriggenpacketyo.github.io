            <p>Several news outlets are focusing on the recall of Parliament to address the British Steel situation, with the Guardian reporting it as a move paving the way for nationalization to save UK jobs. The Financial Times leads with the Federal Reserve's readiness to intervene in response to Donald Trump's tariffs. Prince Harry's claims that his UK security was downgraded to trap him are also prominent, with the Daily Telegraph reporting he believes this was to discourage him from moving his family to the US. Other stories include the Daily Mail's report on the NHS England CEO allegedly 'sleeping on the job' during his commute.</p>

The helicopter, owned by Meridian Helicopters and operated by New York Helicopter, plummeted into the water near the New Jersey side of the river. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause of the crash, with witnesses reporting the rotor blades were already detached when the helicopter hit the water.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite opposition from the District Attorney's office. The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are seeking a reduced sentence and potential parole eligibility. The current DA attempted to withdraw a previous motion in favor of resentencing, claiming the brothers have not taken full responsibility. The judge denied this request, and the resentencing hearing is scheduled to continue, with relatives expressing gratitude for the decision.</p>

            <p>Following Beijing's announcement of matching tariffs on US goods, Chinese healthcare companies involved in processing human blood plasma into medical products have seen gains. Analysts attribute this to the tariffs on US plasma products, boosting the market share of domestic manufacturers. China relies on imports to meet demand for albumin, a blood protein used to treat trauma victims and those with kidney and liver diseases. With foreign exporters facing increased costs, local companies are poised to benefit from the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

This move has been criticized by advocates who argue that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened and that it undermines America's commitment to its allies.

            <p>Denton Loudermill Jr., an Olathe, Kansas man who was falsely identified as a shooter at the Chiefs Super Bowl rally in 2024, has been found dead.

He filed a lawsuit against Burchett, which was later dismissed. Loudermill's attorneys plan to continue litigation on his behalf, emphasizing the stress and burden he faced due to the false accusations.</p>

            <p>President Trump stated that he took a cognitive test as part of his recent physical examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, claiming he “got every answer right.” This comes as Trump, at 78, is the oldest president to start a second term, and his predecessor Joe Biden visibly slowed down while in office. A cognitive test was previously part of Trump's 2018 White House physical, while it was not included in Biden's 2024 physical after Biden struggled during a debate with Trump.</p>

            <p>Southern California Edison is exploring the possibility that an idle transmission line somehow reenergized and sparked the Eaton fire. Edison will take precautionary measures to harden other idle towers and lines, including additional field inspections and changes to maintenance procedures. The company believes induction, where the magnetic field of an active line induces current in an unconnected line, may have caused the reenergizing. Edison is reviewing whether manual changes will require additional grounding of idle lines.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles court has ruled that the resentencing hearing for the Menendez brothers can move forward, despite opposition from the district attorney. The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking a lesser term that could make them eligible for freedom. The district attorney argued that the brothers have not fully taken responsibility and have continued to grasp at alleged lies in the case. The judge ruled that prosecutors failed to show why the resentencing effort should not continue and emphasized the importance of maintaining consistency.</p>

            <p>South Carolina executed Mikal Mahdi by firing squad, marking the second time the state has used this method in the past five weeks. Mahdi, convicted of killing an off-duty police officer, chose the firing squad over lethal injection or the electric chair. This execution is part of a series of executions in South Carolina after a 13-year pause due to uncertainty in obtaining lethal injection drugs. The state has also passed a bill allowing suppliers of pentobarbital to remain secret.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must try to release a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to “facilitate” bringing back Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The government has conceded that Mr. Garcia was deported due to an “administrative error”, though it also alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies. The judge directed the Trump administration to provide her with daily updates on what steps they are taking to bring Mr Garcia back to the US.</p>

            <p>The UK government is poised to intervene in the operations of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, which is at risk of closure, with MPs recalled to pass emergency legislation. The plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, is losing £700,000 a day despite significant investment. The government is considering options to protect the site, including the ability to order raw materials and direct the company's workforce. This intervention stops short of nationalization, but aims to prevent the UK from losing its capacity to produce virgin steel.</p>
