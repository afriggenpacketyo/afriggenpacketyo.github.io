        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, secured a decisive parliamentary majority in recent elections, critical for the nation's path to EU integration. President Sandu had warned of "massive Russian interference," with her party ultimately gaining 50% of the vote. The election unfolded amidst significant tension, including bomb scares at polling stations internationally and arrests within Moldova for plotting unrest, which PAS leaders blamed on Moscow-backed groups. This clear mandate allows Sandu's party to form a government without relying on pro-Russian factions, solidifying the country's pro-Western trajectory despite ongoing challenges like corruption and economic struggles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critically examines Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," portraying it as a revealing look into a campaign driven by political mechanics and celebrity appeal rather than substantive policy or unique conviction. The author contends that Harris and her team exhibited a significant lack of self-awareness, attributing campaign failures to external factors rather than internal strategic missteps. The piece suggests that the reliance on "vibes and spectacle" and a reluctance to diverge meaningfully from Joe Biden's platform ultimately hindered her connection with a broader electorate. This critique raises concerns about the Democratic Party's capacity for genuine introspection and its future ability to effectively counter rising political challenges.</p>

          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent experienced a direct insider threat when a criminal gang, Medusa, attempted to recruit them to facilitate a hack on the BBC. The reporter, acting under guidance, engaged with the group, who offered a substantial percentage of a multi-million-dollar ransom for access to corporate systems. Medusa, identified as a ransomware-as-a-service operation potentially based in Russia, escalated pressure by attempting an MFA bombing on the reporter's phone. This unsettling experience provided a unique and concerning insight into the sophisticated and persistent tactics cybercriminals employ to exploit internal vulnerabilities, underscoring significant risks for organizations worldwide.</p>

He detailed experiences of interrogation, torture in Russian facilities like Borisoglebsk, and deliberate food deprivation in penal colonies. Released in a prisoner exchange, Mykolaienko expressed profound gratitude for Ukrainian resilience but also concern over those not contributing to the war effort. He suspects treachery led to Kherson's quick fall and passionately calls for international condemnation of Russia's continued targeting of Ukrainian civilians.

          <h2>Goldman Sachs Anticipates China Rate Cuts in Fourth Quarter Amid Growth Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates that China's central bank is increasingly likely to implement monetary easing measures in the fourth quarter, projecting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This outlook stems from concerns over slowing economic momentum, with year-on-year growth potentially decelerating significantly. The People's Bank of China recently signaled a more cautious economic perspective, moving from "positive momentum" to "making strides while maintaining stability." Policymakers are under mounting pressure to bolster growth, though the data-dependent nature of decisions means no action could occur if the annual "around 5%" growth target is sustained.

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has withdrawn from his reelection campaign, attributing the decision to persistent media speculation and a Campaign Finance Board ruling that hindered his fundraising efforts. His exit transforms the mayoral race into a three-way competition involving Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' time in office was characterized by a federal corruption scandal and scrutiny over his ties to the Trump administration, which he maintained were in the city's best interest. Political rivals swiftly responded, with Mamdani criticizing Trump's perceived influence and Cuomo attempting to narrow the field to himself and Mamdani.</p>

          <p>The continuing decline of traditional American shopping malls is opening up significant real estate opportunities for small businesses, including health practitioners, artists, and independent retailers. A national vacancy rate of 5.8% in shopping centers, coupled with softening demand, is leading to more favorable conditions such as flexible lease terms and moderated rent increases. This shift allows smaller enterprises to access prime commercial spaces that were previously unaffordable. Landlords are increasingly willing to negotiate with local businesses, offering incentives like shorter leases, partial fit-outs, and even rent-free periods to maintain activity and prevent further vacancies. This trend is fostering local regeneration and providing a lifeline for entrepreneurs navigating competitive markets.</p>

Similarly, China Southern Airlines reported only "financially leasing" three of the twelve jets it expected.

          <p>USC women's basketball sensation JuJu Watkins has announced she will sit out the entire upcoming college basketball season to fully recover from a serious knee injury sustained during the NCAA tournament in March. Watkins, who achieved phenom status in her first two seasons, expressed appreciation for the overwhelming support received during her healing journey. Her injury significantly impacted USC's championship aspirations last season. While her absence creates a considerable void, the arrival of highly-touted prospect Jazzy Davidson is anticipated to help mitigate the impact. Watkins, who previously led USC to a Big Ten title, is expected to declare for the WNBA draft in 2027 when eligible.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has asserted that while initial discussions on reducing strategic nuclear weapons should occur bilaterally between Russia and the United States, the nuclear arsenals of Britain and France must ultimately be incorporated into future negotiations. This declaration follows Russia's recent proposal to the U.S. to voluntarily uphold the limits of the New START arms control treaty for a year after its expiration, provided the U.S. agrees. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated a positive reception, noting President Trump's interest in broader denuclearization talks that include China. Russia emphasizes that these European arsenals are a crucial component of overall global and European security and strategic stability.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced that the Los Angeles Police Department will increase patrols around houses of worship across the city, responding to the deadly shooting that occurred at a Michigan church. The incident in Michigan, which resulted in at least four fatalities and eight injuries, involved a gunman driving a vehicle into the church, opening fire on congregants, and then setting the building on fire before being neutralized by law enforcement. Mayor Bass unequivocally condemned this type of violence as "reprehensible" and emphasized that it has no place in the country. This proactive security measure aims to bolster public safety and provide reassurance to the numerous religious communities within Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>A historic mass resignation is anticipated on Tuesday, with over 100,000 federal workers expected to formally leave their positions as part of a Trump administration initiative to significantly reduce the federal workforce. This unprecedented exodus coincides with a looming government shutdown deadline, as Congress faces pressure to authorize more funding. The White House has already directed federal agencies to prepare for potential layoffs in the event of a shutdown. Workers who are departing describe a climate of "fear and intimidation" that made their continued employment untenable, citing a diminished sense of mission, scapegoating, and profound job insecurity as primary motivations for their decisions.</p>

          <p>According to CM Energy's president, Wang Yongxin, developing a dependable methanol supply chain is paramount for Hong Kong to realize its ambitious goals for green marine fuels. Although the city has successfully implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel fueling, the transition to green methanol necessitates a comprehensive upstream-to-downstream infrastructure. This includes facilitating the tax-free import, storage, and sale of mainland-produced methanol within Hong Kong. Wang's comments were made during the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, a pioneering large-vehicle carrier capable of operating on both conventional and methanol fuels, indicating a planned increase in green methanol adoption by 2027.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed severe deficiencies at Schoen Clinic York's specialist eating disorder unit, revealing staff photographed sleeping during shifts when they should have been monitoring vulnerable patients at risk of self-harm. Whistleblowers and former inpatients detailed numerous "unsafe" incidents, including staff failing to intervene during self-harm and using highly triggering language towards patients. Additional concerns involved unhygienic food, which contributed to the unit receiving a one-star food hygiene rating. The unit has since closed due to low referral rates, and a co-located dementia unit also faced a temporary halt in admissions over safety issues, underscoring systemic care problems.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for an expedited Supreme Court review of its executive order aimed at unilaterally ending birthright citizenship, an order that has been consistently blocked by federal courts. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the government possesses a compelling interest in ensuring American citizenship is granted only to those lawfully entitled, asserting that lower court rulings undermine border security. This executive order attempts to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, challenging over a century of settled legal precedent established by the landmark U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark case. Critics, including the ACLU, vehemently oppose the order, labeling it illegal and warning of profound societal disruption if upheld.</p>

Evidence from notes discovered at Jahn's residence revealed his deep animosity towards ICE and meticulous planning for the attack. Jahn had legally acquired the rifle used in the incident just a month prior. He initiated the shooting from the rooftop of a nearby office building, aiming to cause harm or fatalities among ICE personnel. The attack tragically resulted in one death and two critical injuries among detainees who were in targeted vans.

Governor Tina Kotek explicitly stated that no insurrection or public safety threat exists to justify military intervention, despite a Pentagon memorandum authorizing the deployment to safeguard federal property. Oregon's Attorney General Dan Rayfield contends that Trump's action is unlawful, allegedly based on misinformed social media reports and outdated protest footage from 2020.

          <p>Labour faces a considerable challenge in rebuilding trust with business leaders, many of whom experienced a "desperate loss of faith" following the party's post-election Budget. Despite a pre-election campaign to position itself as "the natural party of business" and pledges of pro-business policies, the Budget implemented a £25bn increase in employers' National Insurance and a significant rise in the National Living Wage. Billionaire John Caudwell, who previously supported Labour, criticized these measures for disproportionately impacting businesses employing low-wage workers. While large-scale inward investment is noted, smaller businesses feel overlooked and are hesitant about future investments due to escalating costs and new employment rights legislation.</p>
