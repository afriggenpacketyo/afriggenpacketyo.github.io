          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a record high for the second consecutive day, driven by a tech rally on Wall Street following a significant deal between AMD and OpenAI. Despite the initial surge, the index later pared its gains to close flat. Chip-related stocks experienced volatile trading, while Japanese Government Bond yields also rose to their highest levels in years. The market's performance reflects investor optimism in the tech sector, though some volatility indicates underlying caution among traders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is visiting Washington to meet with President Trump in an effort to restart stalled trade negotiations and address punishing U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods. With negotiations dragging on and a previous deadline missed, Carney faces domestic pressure to secure a deal, particularly for sectors like steel and lumber. While no major breakthroughs are expected from the "working visit," the face-to-face meeting is seen as a crucial step to gain the president's attention and find common ground on economic and security issues.</p>

The facility consists of 1,300-tonne data cabins submerged 35 meters deep, which significantly reduces the energy consumption and operational costs associated with traditional land-based centers. This initiative is a key part of Hainan's strategic plan to develop its "blue economy" by pioneering new marine technologies. Each cabin can house hundreds of servers to manage a wide range of digital services.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was forced to retire from her first-round match at the Wuhan Open against American Ann Li. Trailing 6-1, 4-1, Raducanu appeared to be struggling significantly with the hot and humid conditions in China, looking fatigued and lacking energy. After a medical timeout where her blood pressure and temperature were checked, she made the decision to withdraw from the tournament. The retirement is a setback for her ambitions of securing a seeded position for the upcoming Australian Open.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced a slight decline as investors reacted to the political crisis in France following the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu. France's CAC 40 index saw notable losses, particularly impacting major banks like Societe Generale and BNP Paribas. The broader pan-European Stoxx 600 index also edged lower, with market sentiment further dampened by disappointing German factory order data.

          <p>Recent surveys highlight a significant erosion of mutual trust between Israelis and Palestinians, raising concerns about the long-term prospects for reconciliation after the current war. Polls show a majority of Israelis, particularly Israeli Jews, agree with the statement that there are no innocent people in Gaza, indicating a hardening of attitudes and a lack of empathy. Experts note this "dehumanization" on both sides presents a major obstacle to any future peace process, even as international efforts like the new U.S.-led plan aim to find a resolution.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is facing a severe political crisis after Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's resignation just 27 days into his term, deepening the country's political deadlock. Lecornu stepped down after failing to secure support from rival parties for his government's budget, leaving Macron with several difficult options. He could appoint a sixth prime minister in two years, potentially from an opposing party, or dissolve parliament and call for new elections, a risky move given the strong polling of Marine Le Pen's far-right party. Macron has ruled out his own resignation.</p>

Lecornu's resignation after just 27 days underscores the inability of France's fragmented parliament to form stable coalitions.

          <p>Dr. Neville Lawrence, the father of Stephen Lawrence, has stated that one of his son's murderers, David Norris, must identify the other individuals involved in the 1993 racist attack before he can be considered for release. Norris, who is seeking parole after 13 years in prison, recently admitted his involvement for the first time. Dr. Lawrence insists that for Norris to be deemed safe for release, he must demonstrate genuine change by providing the names of the other killers who have never been brought to justice for the murder.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to announce a lower-cost version of its best-selling Model Y SUV as the company looks to reinvigorate sales and counter growing competition in the global electric vehicle market. CEO Elon Musk has previously indicated the vehicle would be priced below $30,000, including tax credits, to make it accessible to a wider range of consumers. The move comes as Tesla faces challenges from an aging product lineup and increased competition, particularly in China and Europe, leading to a decline in its market share.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers staged a crucial seventh-inning comeback to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3, taking a 2-0 lead in the National League Division Series. After being shut down for most of the game by Phillies pitcher Jesús Luzardo, who had retired 17 consecutive batters, the Dodgers' offense came alive. A series of smart at-bats and aggressive baserunning, highlighted by three two-out RBIs, allowed them to score four runs and silence the Philadelphia crowd. The victory puts the Dodgers just one win away from advancing to the NL Championship Series.</p>

Originally founded in Minnesota in 1975, the chain disappeared after facing bankruptcy and a hepatitis A outbreak in 2004. The revival was made possible through an agreement between the founder's son and Hormel Foods, which owns the brand's trademark.</p>

Despite the legal challenge, a judge declined to issue an immediate temporary restraining order, and it was revealed in court that troops from Texas are already on their way. State and city officials argue the deployment is a politically motivated power grab intended to sow chaos.

          <p>In a surprising move, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly broken from her party's stance by calling for an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies. Citing the fact that her own adult children's insurance premiums would double without them, Greene stated she would not "toe the party line" on the issue. This aligns her with a key Democratic demand during the ongoing government shutdown. Her position adds a prominent MAGA voice to a small group of Republicans who are concerned about the financial impact of letting the tax credits expire.</p>

U.S. Border Patrol recorded approximately 238,000 apprehensions, a dramatic decrease from the record highs seen under the previous administration. The sharp decline is attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, which include sealing the border, ending asylum processing, and increasing deportations. The White House has declared the policies a success in securing the border, though they continue to face legal challenges and criticism.</p>

The project aims to provide easier access to the world-famous beach, which is currently only reachable via a steep and difficult trail. While it may boost tourism convenience, the construction has sparked debate about its potential impact on the natural landscape and the local environment. The development involves lowering workers and equipment over the cliff face to attach the elevator shaft directly to the rock.</p>
