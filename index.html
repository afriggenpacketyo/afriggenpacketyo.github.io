            <h2>Trade War and Policy Shifts Create Global Economic Uncertainty</h2>

            <p>An opinion piece highlights the growing concerns surrounding the Trump administration's trade war and policy shifts, which are injecting volatility into global markets and undermining trade foundations. The article questions the lack of a strong international response, attributing it to potential fear, complacency, or a lack of viable alternatives. It explores the possibility that the US is using tariffs as a negotiation tactic to address trade imbalances, but warns that such measures disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses, and ultimately harm consumers. The piece also considers the potential for the US to reverse globalization by reshoring manufacturing, which could lead to significant investment, higher production costs, and inflation.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration halted the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project in New York, raising concerns about the future of clean energy initiatives. The project, which aimed to power 500,000 homes, had already received federal permits and broken ground. The administration cited insufficient analysis in the project's approval, despite evidence of thorough environmental review. Industry experts fear this decision could jeopardize other offshore wind projects and signal a broader opposition to renewable energy.</p>

            <p>The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, was delayed due to legal disputes. The hearing was intended to determine if they should receive a new sentence potentially allowing their release after three decades in prison. Attorneys for the brothers sought the recusal of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, while prosecutors requested a review of a risk assessment report. The judge postponed the hearing to May 9 to consider these requests, further complicating the timeline for a decision on the brothers' fate.</p>

While carbon capture from the air is more common, this project explores the potential advantages of using seawater, which has a higher carbon concentration. If powered by renewable energy, the technology could be scaled up to remove significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 traded flat as investors analyzed inflation data, which showed a 3.6% year-on-year increase in March, marking three consecutive years above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. The "core-core" inflation rate also rose, further complicating the economic outlook. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi saw a slight increase. Markets in Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore were closed for the Good Friday holiday.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status. This move is part of an ongoing battle over alleged antisemitism on campus, with the White House urging Harvard to change its hiring, teaching, and admissions practices. Harvard has defended its actions and received support from other institutions in defense of academic freedom. The potential loss of tax-exempt status could cost Harvard millions of dollars annually.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham, UK, are on strike due to a dispute over the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles, which are higher-paid positions. The union claims that the changes could result in pay cuts for some workers. The council argues that the WRCO role is not safety-critical and that maintaining it could lead to equal pay claims. The strike has resulted in waste accumulation throughout the city.</p>
