This meeting occurs within the context of the Trump administration's broader efforts to re-evaluate and potentially alter long-standing national vaccine policies. The panel's decisions could signal significant shifts in public health guidance, reflecting the influence of its new leadership and their stated concerns about the existing vaccine schedule.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper commented that while the Federal Reserve has room for a few more interest rate cuts, excessive easing could push the economy into a "danger territory." He expressed concern that further rate reductions, especially while inflation is not fully controlled, might reignite price pressures by boosting demand faster than supply and potentially create asset bubbles. Despite finding current market valuations high, Tepper stated he remains constructive due to the Fed's current easing stance, acknowledging the difficulty of betting against the central bank.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the U.S. government from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan children, sharply criticizing the Trump administration's justification for the action. Judge Timothy Kelly ruled that the administration's argument for reuniting the children with their families in Guatemala "crumbled like a house of cards" upon review. The decision came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the deportations, which advocates argued were being carried out without due process for minors who may have pending immigration cases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, seeking to lift lower court orders that are currently preventing the president from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The Justice Department argues that judicial interference is improperly hindering the president's removal authority. President Trump seeks to oust Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, creating a significant legal and political clash over the independence of the central bank's leadership.</p>

          <p>For the first time in South America, scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including beetles, flies, and ants, perfectly preserved in 112-million-year-old amber. Found in a sandstone quarry in Ecuador, these specimens provide a rare window into life during the Cretaceous period, a time when flowering plants were beginning to diversify. The discovery helps fill a major gap in the fossil record, as most similar amber deposits have been found in the Northern Hemisphere, and will aid in understanding ancient biodiversity.</p>

Spinoza advocated for using reason to understand and regulate emotions, a practice now known as metacognition, which involves observing one's feelings from a distance. By doing so, individuals can avoid being controlled by primal reactions like anger and fear, allowing them to respond to censure with equanimity and maintain their inner peace.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025 has provided tangible relief to the housing market, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate falling to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a borrower with a $500,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment that is approximately $300 cheaper than it was at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs enhances affordability for new buyers and creates significant savings opportunities for existing homeowners considering a refinance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a so-called "mileage clock" within the brain, pinpointing the specific cells responsible for estimating distance traveled. In a study involving running rats, scientists recorded brain activity showing that certain cells fire in a regular, repeating pattern that correlates with the distance covered. Further experiments with human volunteers suggest the same navigational mechanism exists in our brains, and it can be disrupted when visual landmarks or environmental shapes are altered, impairing our ability to judge distance.</p>

          <p>Top elected leaders from Washington, D.C., testified before the House Oversight Committee, pushing back against President Trump's declaration of a "public safety emergency" in the city. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb argued that the unilateral surge of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops undermines public trust and threatens the District's autonomy. They contended that such actions are counterproductive and called on Congress to instead support local efforts to rebuild the police force and fill judicial vacancies.</p>

          <p>New scientific research warns that deaths caused by inhaling wildfire smoke are projected to increase dramatically, potentially reaching 1.4 million fatalities globally each year by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed. The studies, published in Nature, found that the fine particulate matter in wildfire smoke is about 10 times more toxic than other air pollution. While the risk is global, the burden is expected to fall disproportionately on Africa, which could see an elevenfold increase in smoke-related deaths.</p>
