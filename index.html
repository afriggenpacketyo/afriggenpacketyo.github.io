          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulted in one fatality and several injuries, prompting an FBI investigation into what authorities are calling an intentional act of terrorism. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, damaged nearby buildings and shattered windows across several blocks. According to Dr. Maher Abdallah, who runs the clinic, no staff members were harmed, and the clinic's IVF lab and stored embryos remain secure. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities working to determine whether the act was domestic or international terrorism. </p>

          <p>Two prominent figures from the far-right are reportedly attempting to infiltrate and influence the Reform UK party, aiming to push it towards extremist views. David Clews, a conspiracy theorist, and Mark Collett, a Nazi sympathizer, are urging their supporters to join Reform UK and promote their anti-immigration agenda. They claim to already have sympathizers within the party, though Reform UK denies any association with the far-right and asserts a stringent vetting process is in place. The goal is to shift the party's platform towards policies such as reducing immigration and initiating mass deportations.</p>

While Gove doesn't believe a referendum is necessary at the moment, he acknowledged that a significant shift in public opinion could prompt a review of the decision.

New evidence about alleged sexual abuse and the release of a Netflix drama have garnered support for the brothers, with figures like Kim Kardashian advocating for their freedom. A Los Angeles judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.
