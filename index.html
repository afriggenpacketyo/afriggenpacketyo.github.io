        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a strong month for stocks in May, investors are showing skepticism about the U.S. equities market, according to exchange-traded fund flows. Inflows into equity ETFs have decreased by more than half since the market recovered from April losses, suggesting underlying fears remain due to trade uncertainty and tariff battles. Investors are largely moving their money into ultra-short duration bonds, indicating a cautious stance on U.S. equities. While retail investors with a long-term focus have continued buying U.S. stocks, interest in tech ETFs and cyclical stocks has waned, with income-producing equities becoming less attractive due to rising bond yields.

          <p>Leaders from the fashion industry, including Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, met with White House officials to discuss potential tariff relief. The fashion industry, which supports ten million American jobs, has historically faced high tariffs, causing companies to raise prices on goods. The goal of the meeting was to discuss balanced trade and how to best maintain jobs in the U.S. and preserve American prosperity. There has been long-lasting tension between Wintour and Melania Trump, as the former First Lady was never featured on the cover of Vogue.</p>

          <p>Reality TV star Kristin Cavallari has described her decision to cut her father out of her life as "the best decision I've ever made," citing a significant weight lifted from her. She explained that the decision came after years of feeling uncomfortable around her father, who she says constantly put her down as a child and crossed boundaries with her children. Cavallari shared that she had been wanting to distance herself for a long time and that it wasn't until he "crossed the boundary with my kids" and wouldn't apologize that she pulled the trigger. She emphasized the importance of removing people who bring hurt and sadness from one's life, even if they are parents.</p>

He highlighted the Justice Department's high conviction rate in January 6th trials, attributing it to overwhelming evidence rather than bias.

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act is facing opposition from Senate Republicans, including Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, who are concerned about its impact on the national debt. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by more than $1.5 trillion, it is projected to add about $3.1 trillion to the debt. These senators are pushing for deeper cuts than those in the House-passed bill, potentially complicating its passage in the Senate, where Republicans can only afford three defections. The White House defends the bill, citing its potential to save $1.6 trillion over 10 years, and accuses scorekeepers of using "shoddy assumptions."</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that measles vaccination rates in children have declined in most U.S. counties since before the COVID-19 pandemic. The MMR vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year across 33 states. This decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 1,088 cases reported, most of which are in West Texas.

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. The ruling, made by a Trump appointee, is the latest to limit the administration's practice of rapidly deporting people accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The judge ruled that the government hasn't provided adequate notice for individuals to challenge their deportation. The Supreme Court has also weighed in, stating that people need a chance to challenge their deportation under the law.</p>

Experts attribute the low participation to factors such as the off-year election, a new and convoluted balloting process, and the obscurity of the candidates. Opponents mocked Morena’s electoral prowess, labeling the vote “Black Sunday,” and criticizing the end of judicial independence. It seems likely that pro-Morena judges will take their seats, reinforcing Morena’s power.</p>

The original closure plans were part of broader efforts to reduce government spending, but the reversal ensures continued access to essential resources for California's agricultural sector.
