          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 08:58:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Football Association (FA) in England has announced that transgender women will be prohibited from playing on affiliated women's soccer teams starting in June. This decision follows a recent U.K. Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a "woman" under British equalities law, prompting the FA to amend its rules. The FA had previously applied stricter eligibility criteria for trans women but is now implementing a full ban, acknowledging the difficulty this poses for transgender individuals who want to participate in the sport. The FA is contacting registered transgender women to explain the changes and explore ways for them to remain involved in soccer.</p>

          <p>Senator Tommy Tuberville and former coach Nick Saban will meet with President Trump to discuss NIL regulations, addressing issues such as the transfer portal and contracts for college athletes. Tuberville criticized Democrats for hindering progress and emphasized the importance of women's sports and Title IX, highlighting concerns about biological men competing in women's sports. He believes that the current landscape could lead to a loss of non-revenue sports and decreased fan loyalty. The discussion will also focus on ensuring that all states have a level playing field regarding NIL money, with the goal of preserving college sports.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's shares experienced a significant increase in extended trading after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results, driven by its Azure cloud business, and provided surprisingly strong guidance. Revenue increased 13% year over year, and net income climbed 18%, exceeding analysts' expectations. Despite concerns about President Trump's tariffs, Microsoft's optimistic forecast provided relief to investors, with the company planning to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. CEO Satya Nadella had previously mentioned Microsoft intends to allocate $80 billion in fiscal 2025 for data center construction to handle AI workloads.</p>

          <p>A court has determined that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction from the Epic Games case, with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stating that Apple's Vice President of Finance Alex Roman "outright lied" to the court. Rogers accused Apple of adopting these lies and misrepresentations, referring the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings against both Roman and Apple. The case stems from Apple's App Store policies, with the court originally ordering Apple to allow developers to link to external websites for purchases, a ruling Apple is now accused of trying to undermine.</p>

          <p>CVS Health will significantly increase access to Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy for patients covered by its pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark, starting July 1.

This move aims to provide the drug at a more affordable price, with Caremark negotiating a lower net price for Wegovy compared to its rival, Eli Lilly's Zepbound.

          <p>Initial unemployment claims surged to 241,000, exceeding expectations and marking the highest total since February, potentially indicating economic challenges. Continuing claims also rose to 1.92 million, the highest level since November 2021, with much of the increase stemming from New York. This report emerges amid broader economic concerns, including a recent Commerce Department report indicating a decline in gross domestic product. Despite the rise in claims, the longer-term trend remains relatively stable, and economists anticipate an increase in nonfarm payrolls for April.</p>

          <p>A community of Asian refugees is living in fear and confusion as the Trump administration increases immigration enforcement, specifically targeting Bhutanese refugees with criminal records. These individuals, who legally arrived in the U.S. through a humanitarian program, are being detained and deported, leaving them stateless as neither Bhutan nor Nepal recognizes them as citizens. Advocates argue that these deportees were not given proper opportunities to appeal their deportation orders, and the lack of transparency from federal authorities has left communities grappling for answers and consumed by fear. The situation has triggered widespread PTSD within the community, with many now carrying documentation to prove their legal status.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed a mineral deal that could bring substantial investment into a joint fund to help rebuild Ukraine after the war with Russia, though it will take years to extract the resources and yield profits. While the Trump administration initially wanted Ukraine to use its mineral wealth to repay past U.S. military assistance, this idea was removed in the final agreement. The deal does not include a security guarantee, which Ukraine had sought to prevent further Russian aggression, but it does tie President Trump to the future of Ukraine, signaling a long-term commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine.</p>

The agreement also affirms Ukraine's aspirations to join the European Union and includes the possibility of future US military assistance. Despite these commitments, there are no concrete security guarantees from the US, leaving some uncertainty about the long-term commitment of Ukraine's most important ally.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, but lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to a cancer treatment deal. The company's blockbuster diabetes treatment, Mounjaro, and weight loss drug, Zepbound, exceeded expectations, while Eli Lilly maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance. CEO Dave Ricks noted that the threat of tariffs is already incentivizing drugmakers to invest in U.S. manufacturing, potentially reducing the need for tariffs. The company also advocates for permanent lower tax rates in the U.S. to further encourage domestic production.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, serving as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), described his first 100 days as "very intense," claiming $160 billion in savings but admitting that progress has been limited due to "entrenched interests." Musk stated that achieving the goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending remains "possible" but requires more political support. He criticized the current federal budgeting structure, comparing reform to "changing the direction of a fleet of supertankers." Musk also discussed his relationship with President Trump, his living arrangements in Washington, and ongoing investigations into fraud.</p>

          <p>Under President Trump, the U.S. has seen a significant shift away from promoting human rights and democracy in foreign policy, a vision long espoused by Henry Kissinger. Trump's administration has defunded USAID, eliminated human rights offices at the State Department, and dismantled the U.S. Agency for Global Media, curtailing efforts to broadcast into countries with limited freedoms. While Kissinger valued stability and avoiding nuclear war, Trump's approach appears to prioritize self-interest and power, potentially leading to a more ruthless version of realpolitik where moral concerns are disregarded.</p>
