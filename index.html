          <p>A large wildfire near Keratea, southeast of Athens, has resulted in the death of an elderly man and caused significant destruction to homes, leading to widespread evacuations. Fanned by powerful winds, the blaze is one of over 50 forest and agricultural fires that have ignited across Greece in a single 24-hour period, marking one of the most severe days for wildfires this summer. Authorities are struggling to contain the fire, which spans over seven kilometers, and have issued emergency alerts urging residents in multiple areas to leave. International firefighting crews from the Czech Republic and Romania have joined the effort to combat the flames amid warnings of continued high risk.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the death of Jim Lovell, the esteemed astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission. Lovell, who passed away at age 97, is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 lunar mission, which famously turned into a "successful failure" after an oxygen tank explosion. He and his crew managed to return to Earth safely against incredible odds, a feat that showcased remarkable ingenuity and courage. Lovell also served as the command module pilot for Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the moon, where he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space."</p>

Speaking to Fox News Digital, Markus expressed his passion for being a criminal defense lawyer and representing what he calls "the underdog," framing his work as an honor to help someone in need. The comments come as Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence, was transferred to a minimum-security prison camp, a move criticized by some.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic explores the motivations behind Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to approve a plan to occupy Gaza City. The article suggests Netanyahu is beholden to his hard-right coalition partners, who advocate for annexing and resettling Gaza, a goal not supported by the majority of the Israeli public or its security establishment. This political dependency appears to be the primary driver of his recent actions, creating a significant gap between his government's policies and public sentiment. The piece argues that Netanyahu is essentially performing a balancing act to ensure his political survival, even if it means pursuing a strategically questionable path.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin "very shortly" to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. He indicated that a potential peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories," a politically sensitive proposal for Kyiv. The announcement follows reports that a U.S.-Russia deal is being discussed that could freeze the current battle lines, effectively ceding some occupied Ukrainian territory to Russia. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk noted that there are "certain signals" that a freeze in the conflict may be approaching, adding a European perspective to the rapidly developing diplomatic efforts.</p>

The company now anticipates a global sales decline of 3% to 5%, a significant revision from its earlier, more optimistic projections. Executives noted that consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending, with breakfast being one of the first meals to be skipped in favor of eating at home. The adjustment comes as rival McDonald's has seen success by expanding its value menu, suggesting Wendy's may need to enhance its marketing of affordable options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michael Brown, the 45-year-old suspect in a fatal shooting at a Montana bar, has been captured following a weeklong search, Governor Greg Gianforte announced. Brown is accused of killing four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda on August 1 before fleeing into the nearby mountains. Authorities described the attack as an act where an "unstable individual" murdered four people in cold blood for no apparent reason. Brown, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, reportedly had a history of mental health struggles, according to his niece. The capture brings a sense of resolution to the community mourning the four victims.</p>

          <p>Independent UK Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted on social media platform X, alerting authorities and demanding mass deportations for the individuals in the boat. It was later confirmed by the HM Coastguard that the vessel contained a crew raising money for motor neurone disease (MND) research. After realizing his error, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity. The rowing crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" and noted the "vigilante-style" attention they received.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, nullifying a lower court's criminal contempt order against federal officials. The case originated from the administration's deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, allegedly in defiance of a judge's order to halt the flights. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg had found probable cause for contempt, but the D.C. Circuit Court, in a 2-1 decision, vacated his ruling. The majority opinion stated that resolving the inter-branch conflict was necessary, while the dissenting judge argued that defiance of court orders undermines the judicial system. The decision marks a significant legal victory for the administration.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has started training with her new coach, Francisco Roig, as she aims to improve her ranking and challenge top-tier opponents. Having rebuilt her ranking to No. 30, Raducanu is looking to add more power to her game, which has been effective against mid-ranked players but has struggled against the sport's biggest hitters. The new coaching partnership is seen as a hopeful step to help her make a significant impact at the upcoming US Open and other major tournaments. Her first match under the new guidance will be against Olga Danilovic at the Cincinnati Open.</p>

          <p>Health officials in China's southern Guangdong province are implementing extensive measures to combat the country's largest-ever outbreak of the chikungunya virus, which has infected over 8,000 people. The mosquito-borne virus causes fever, rash, and severe joint pain. In response, authorities are deploying tactics reminiscent of the COVID-19 pandemic, including fogging streets with insecticide and isolating infected individuals. While chikungunya is rarely fatal, the population's lack of immunity has prompted a strong response. The virus is typically found in tropical regions, and its spread is facilitated by climate change and global travel, prompting travel advisories.</p>

          <p>Ad-tech company The Trade Desk saw its shares fall by a record 39% following the announcement of its CFO's departure and growing investor concern over competition from Amazon. Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations, the company's stock suffered its steepest single-day drop ever. The departure of CFO Laura Schenkein and the increasing dominance of Amazon's advertising platform have unsettled the market. Analysts suggest that Amazon's aggressive moves could erode The Trade Desk's value proposition over time, overshadowing the company's otherwise solid quarterly performance.

The sheriff described the case as one of the "most disturbing cases of medical fraud" they had ever investigated, noting that she potentially put thousands of lives at risk.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) making arrests at criminal courthouses is creating a "chilling effect" that could undermine the justice system, according to legal experts. Lawyers and prosecutors report that this tactic is deterring immigrants from appearing in court, not only as defendants but also as victims and witnesses. This fear can pressure defendants to accept plea deals and prevent victims from seeking protective orders or testifying in cases. Critics argue that this practice obstructs justice, as it can lead to cases being delayed or dismissed if key individuals are too afraid to participate.</p>

          <p>A government watchdog group, the Democracy Defenders Fund, has requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family on behalf of President Trump. The group argues that the Department of Defense may have broken laws by accepting the foreign gift and by reportedly diverting $934 million from a nuclear missile program to retrofit the aircraft. Critics contend the jet is a redundant expense, given the existing Air Force One fleet, and raises questions about fiscal priorities and potential violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause. The Pentagon accepted the plane under an agreement for discretionary use.</p>

It highlights the practices of bestselling author Kelly Corrigan, who uses short, three-minute dance breaks to reset her mood and finds that taking calls while walking helps her stay engaged. The piece suggests that integrating small acts of movement and tidying one's workspace can foster a better environment for ideas to develop. Ultimately, it advocates for working with the body's natural energy rhythms by embracing these micro-breaks as an essential part of the creative process.</p>

Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that condemnation and threats of sanctions "will not weaken our resolve." The decision to expand the war has drawn sharp rebukes from the UN, UK, France, and Canada, and prompted Germany to suspend military exports to Israel. The plan, which aims to disarm Hamas and establish a new civil administration, has also faced opposition from within Israel, including from military officials and the families of hostages, while Hamas has called it a "new war crime."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's latest round of sweeping tariffs is fueling concerns among some economists about the risk of "stagflation"—a period of high inflation combined with low economic growth. The new import duties, which raise the effective average tariff rate to its highest level since 1934, are expected to increase consumer prices as businesses pass on costs. This, combined with a slowing GDP forecast and a recent disappointing jobs report, has intensified the stagflation debate. While the White House has dismissed these concerns, some economists argue the U.S. may be entering a "stagflation lite" scenario, creating a challenging environment for the Federal Reserve.

          <p>Despite a growing movement to remove synthetic food dyes from products, a significant exception remains: titanium dioxide. This chemical, used to make foods like ice cream and salad dressing appear whiter, is not included in recent pledges by major food industry groups to phase out artificial colors like Red 40 and Yellow 5. While the EU has banned titanium dioxide over DNA damage concerns, the FDA allows it to be labeled simply as "artificial color." This article suggests the food industry is reluctant to abandon the highly effective whitening agent, which may mean consumers will have to get used to less vibrant food if it is eventually phased out.</p>
