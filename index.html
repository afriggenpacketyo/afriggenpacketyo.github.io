          <p>Apollo Global Management is set to provide a £4.5 billion ($6 billion) loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK, addressing a funding shortfall. This investment-grade, unsecured debt financing package features an interest rate below 7%. The project, which involves constructing two nuclear reactors, has faced delays and budget increases, with China General Nuclear Power Corp halting its funding in late 2023. The Hinkley Point C project is expected to power around six million homes, highlighting the significance of private capital in European infrastructure projects. Optimism score is proportional to the author's reflection on the magnitude of the project's potential impact on energy stability and economic growth.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing tensions, a Trump administration official suggests that diplomacy with Iran remains a possibility within a two-week window. Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff has been in communication with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, although no meetings are planned. This approach is partly due to the losses sustained among Iran's senior leadership and nuclear policy experts, who would be involved in any deal-making. European diplomats are scheduled to meet with Araghchi in Geneva, though some U.S. officials express skepticism about the Europeans' ability to handle Iran effectively.

          <p>States are increasingly offering tax incentives to attract data centers, leading to significant losses in tax revenue. A CNBC analysis reveals that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, benefiting tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. Watchdog groups argue that these facilities do not create enough jobs to justify the tax breaks, while their energy consumption is immense. The growing number of tax breaks has sparked debate about whether massive corporations should receive such generous incentives. The article highlights the financial implications of these incentives for states and the potential drawbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite some claims that Gen Z is becoming more conservative, data suggests that the youth vote shift in 2024 was likely a one-off event rather than a lasting ideological realignment. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate in 2024 compared to 2020, they have become less likely to identify as conservative. On specific issues, young adults remain more liberal than previous generations, with increasing support for legal status for undocumented immigrants and addressing the effects of slavery. The author concludes that Gen Z's dissatisfaction with the economy may have driven their votes in 2024, rather than a fundamental shift to the right.

          <p>The article suggests that the prospect of expanding the welfare state in America is diminishing due to political and economic factors. Democrats face challenges in winning full control of the federal government and have become more hesitant to raise taxes on the middle class. The potential passage of President Trump’s tax cut plan could exacerbate fiscal constraints and inflationary risks. The author suggests liberals may need to scale back their ambitions for social spending and focus on regulatory policy. The article emphasizes the moral imperative of expanding America's safety net and the need for Democrats to build the electoral power and political will to raise taxes. (not investment advice)</p>
