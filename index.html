          <p>A new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll reveals that Donald Trump's job approval rating is the lowest for any president in 80 years, with only 39% of respondents approving of his performance.

Additionally, majorities disapprove of his handling of various issues, including stock market volatility, tariffs, and foreign relations. While Trump maintains support from his base, the poll highlights growing concerns about his administration's actions and their impact on the economy and the country's founding principles.</p>

          <p>As stock and bond markets experience volatility, dividend stocks are becoming increasingly attractive to investors seeking income and stability. With over 100 dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available, investors have various options, including actively managed ETFs like the T. Rowe Dividend Growth ETF (TDVG) that aim to identify high-quality dividend payers. While tech stocks remain prominent dividend payers, investors can use dividend ETFs to gain exposure to the sector without overweighting it. Experts suggest that dividend stocks are particularly suitable for retirees seeking a steady income stream, especially amidst uncertainty in the bond market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's coastguard seized a tiny sandbank, Sandy Cay, in the South China Sea, sparking criticism from the White House and escalating tensions with the Philippines, who also laid claim to the area.

The incident occurred as US and Philippine forces conducted joint military exercises in the region, further fueling tensions with China, which has asserted expansive claims in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency operation led by the DEA resulted in the arrest of over 100 undocumented immigrants at an underground nightclub in Colorado Springs, reportedly frequented by TdA and MS-13 gang members. Authorities seized drugs, including pink cocaine, weapons, and evidence of prostitution during the raid. Colorado has become a hub for violent criminals and the state's immigration policies have allowed the state to be used as a command center for human and drug trafficking. The active-duty service members found at the club will be dealt with by the Army CID.</p>

          <p>An Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport, resulting in the deaths of the crew, is being investigated for potential missteps in the execution of "visual separation." The crew requested and received permission to use visual separation, allowing them to navigate around other aircraft independently of air traffic control. Aviation experts have warned about the risks associated with mishandling visual separation, a common practice that can become dangerous when not properly executed. The incident highlights the need for continued vigilance and adherence to safety protocols in aviation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has provided a glimmer of hope for Ukrainians who fear being forced into a lopsided peace agreement with Russia. Trump questioned why President Putin would continue the war while the US is trying to broker peace, hinting at potential sanctions. This shift in tone, particularly after a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv, suggests that Trump might not force Ukraine into a peace plan that favors Moscow. The US has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that would force Kyiv to abandon its aspirations of joining NATO, offer Ukraine only vague security guarantees, and see the United States officially recognizing Crimea as Russian, which Ukraine has rejected.</p>

Hamas appears more open to negotiating a lasting solution, proposing the release of all hostages in exchange for a ceasefire of at least five years, potentially including disarmament if Israel withdraws its forces from Gaza. Israel, however, shows no intention of withdrawing, and continues its offensive on Gaza, while Hamas has signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon at the national and regional level.</p>
