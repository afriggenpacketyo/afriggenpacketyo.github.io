          <h2>US and China Anticipated to Reduce Tariffs Amidst Ongoing Economic Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 04:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite conflicting statements, Morgan Stanley economists anticipate that the US and China will engage in trade negotiations and gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% by the end of the second quarter. More comprehensive talks later in the year could lead to further tariff reductions, potentially reaching 34% by year's end, reflecting the removal of fentanyl-related tariffs. Washington has imposed tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese imports this year, while Beijing's levies on US goods have risen to 125%. Despite potential tariff reductions, the overall direction of economic growth is expected to remain downward due to the damage already inflicted on the economic cycle.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has secured victory in the Canadian federal election, capitalizing on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment and concerns about Canada's economic sovereignty. The Liberals' win marks a significant turnaround after facing declining popularity and Justin Trudeau's resignation earlier in the year. The election was heavily influenced by President Trump's tariff threats and comments about potentially annexing Canada, which galvanized voters around issues of leadership and economic survival. While the Liberals may need to work to unite Canadians, the results highlight the importance of addressing divisions and navigating a complex relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap has issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox after footage emerged of a band member appearing to advocate violence against Conservative politicians. The group rejected any suggestion that they intended to incite violence and said the footage was taken out of context. The controversy has led to calls for Kneecap to be denied entry to the USA and Canada for their upcoming tour, and for government funding to be withdrawn. The group also clarified their stance on Hamas and Hezbollah, stating unequivocally that they do not support either organization and condemn all attacks on civilians.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars' shares experienced a significant drop after the company announced cost-cutting plans of 18 billion Swedish krona due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter. The company's operating profit fell to 1.9 billion krona, down from 4.7 billion krona in the same period last year, with a narrowed EBIT margin of 2.3%. The cost-cutting measures will include reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations. Volvo Cars has also withdrawn its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, citing market headwinds, price competition, and turbulence related to tariffs.</p>

          <p>The government is considering expanding the sugar tax to include milkshakes and pre-packaged lattes, potentially impacting a significant portion of milk-based drinks on the market. This proposal aims to incentivize manufacturers to reduce sugar content in these beverages, building on the success of the existing sugar tax on fizzy drinks. The government is also proposing reducing the maximum sugar allowance in drinks subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml. The consultation period for these changes will run until July 21, with the goal of improving children's health by addressing excess sugar consumption.</p>

          <p>Electricity has been largely restored to Spain and Portugal after a major power outage disrupted daily life across the Iberian Peninsula. The outage affected critical infrastructure, including traffic lights, trains, and communication networks, leaving millions without power. While the cause of the blackout is still under investigation, officials have ruled out foul play, such as a cyberattack. Hospitals, banks, and transportation services were disrupted during the outage, but power has been mostly restored as of Tuesday morning.</p>

Critics argue that the lawsuit was part of Beijing's assault on rights and democracy in Hong Kong.

The new rules retain 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, and increase the electrical capacity so that about 50% of the total power output will come from the electrical part of the engine, running on 100% sustainable fuel. This has attracted Audi and Ford, and led Honda to stay in the sport. The changes may initially open up the field, but are expected to lead to increased competition over time.</p>
