          <p>Pfizer has increased its 2025 adjusted profit outlook, citing effective cost-reduction strategies and robust business performance. The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, with adjusted earnings per share at 78 cents against a predicted 58 cents. This positive forecast comes as the company navigates potential impacts from U.S. drug pricing pressures and tariffs, maintaining its full-year revenue guidance. The updated outlook also includes a one-time charge related to a licensing deal for a cancer treatment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has set two new national heat records in a single day, with temperatures soaring to 41.8 degrees Celsius (107.24°F). This extreme weather event is part of a broader trend of rising global temperatures attributed to climate change, which has also impacted South Korea. The heatwave is causing significant environmental and agricultural problems in Japan, including water shortages, delayed rice cultivation, and adverse effects on cherry blossoms. Officials are urging public caution, especially for the elderly, to prevent heatstroke amid the unusually severe summer conditions.</p>

          <p>A cloudburst in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand has triggered a massive mudslide and flash flooding, reportedly killing at least four people with over 50 others missing. The severe weather event effectively washed away a village, prompting a large-scale rescue operation. The Indian military has deployed teams to the affected area of Dharali to assist in the efforts, which the state's chief minister described as being conducted "on a war footing." Authorities have issued warnings for people to avoid rivers as the situation remains critical.</p>

          <p>China's struggling property market may be approaching a turning point, according to analysts who note a resumption of credit flow to developers and a decrease in unsold home inventory. Fitch Ratings has improved its forecast for 2025, now predicting a smaller 7% decline in new home sales, revised from a 15% drop. The stabilization is partly attributed to the growing market share of state-owned developers, which has helped consolidate the sector. These indicators suggest the downturn might be less severe than previously feared by some investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article asserts that the Trump administration's proposal to rescind the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding" is a fundamental assault on all federal climate policy. This finding, which concludes that greenhouse gases harm human health, is the legal basis for regulations on vehicle emissions, power plants, and more. The author argues the move repudiates the federal government's authority to limit these gases, using strained legal and scientific arguments that defy consensus. The piece warns that this action will paralyze climate action for years, regardless of the eventual outcome in court.</p>

          <p>An analysis examines whether X's Community Notes feature is an effective tool against misinformation or if it sometimes fuels it. While research shows the notes can reduce the spread of false posts, there are significant issues with accuracy, speed, and potential bias. Examples show notes have spread misleading information or shifted the context of a post, and experts raise concerns that the system can be gamed by bad actors. Although contributor numbers are growing, published notes are declining, and their slow appearance often fails to keep pace with viral falsehoods.</p>

          <p>A new agreement between the UK and France has come into force, allowing the UK to detain and return some migrants who arrive on small boats. In exchange, the UK will accept a number of asylum seekers from France who pass specific checks. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper declined to specify how many people would be returned under the trial scheme, stating the numbers would start small and increase over time. The plan aims to deter illegal channel crossings, but experts question whether the initial numbers will be high enough to have a meaningful impact.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest as he stands trial for allegedly masterminding a coup to stay in power after his 2022 election loss. The justice ruled that Bolsonaro had violated previous precautionary measures by communicating with supporters at a protest via his son's phone. This development escalates the legal and political drama in Brazil, which has been intensified by the Trump administration's vocal support for Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro's lawyers plan to appeal the order.</p>

          <p>A small Tuscan olive oil producer, Olio Piro, which found initial success exporting to the U.S., is now facing significant challenges due to President Trump's new 15% tariff on European imports. The founders say the new tax, combined with trade uncertainty, has forced them to pivot and seek growth in other markets like Canada and Japan. The article highlights the broader impact of the tariffs, which will likely raise prices for American consumers since the U.S. imports 95% of its olive oil.
