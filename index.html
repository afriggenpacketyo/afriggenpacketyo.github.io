          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the acclaimed 2002 film 'Bend It Like Beckham' is currently in development. The announcement was made in Basel, where England's Lionesses are set to play in the Euro 2025 final, highlighting the original movie's influence on women's football. Chadha is aiming for a 2027 release to mark the film's 25th anniversary, considering either a new film or a television series. She expressed a desire to reunite the original cast, including Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, and to explore how much has changed for women in sports while still facing challenges.</p>

          <p>Mobile provider EE has conducted overnight maintenance to resolve a technical issue that left many customers unable to make or receive calls. This follows a more significant outage earlier in the week that affected thousands of both mobile and landline users. Despite the company, owned by BT, stating that the network is now 'running as normal,' some customers continue to report persistent service problems. EE has apologized for the inconvenience, assuring that it is continuing to monitor the network to prevent a recurrence of the fault.</p>

          <h2>Increased Power Demand from AI Data Centers Contributes to Rising Summer Electricity Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electricity bills are expected to rise significantly this summer, with the increasing energy consumption of artificial intelligence data centers being a major contributing factor. PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. power grid operator, reports a sharp climb in electricity usage, as AI-focused data centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional ones. This surge in demand, coupled with the shutdown of many fossil fuel plants and delays in clean energy projects, is straining the power grid. As a result, customers in the 13 states served by PJM may see their monthly bills increase by $25 or more.</p>

          <p>Tech company Astronomer has hired actress Gwyneth Paltrow as a 'very temporary' spokesperson to help manage the fallout from a recent scandal. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after being filmed in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert, an event that went viral online. Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, appeared in a short video addressing the company's renewed focus on its data workflow automation services. The move is a clear attempt by the New York-based tech firm to steer public conversation away from the embarrassing incident involving its former leadership.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that both Cambodia and Thailand are seeking an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly fighting along their shared border. He reported having spoken with the leaders of both nations, expressing optimism for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing territorial dispute. The conflict, centered around the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple, has recently escalated, resulting in at least 33 deaths and displacing over 130,000 people. Trump also indicated that future U.S. trade agreements with both Southeast Asian countries would be contingent on the cessation of hostilities and the establishment of peace.</p>

This violence occurs as ceasefire negotiations have reportedly stalled and the United Nations warns of a growing famine, with an increasing number of deaths from malnutrition-related causes, especially among children.

          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents found no evidence to support claims of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza. The findings, compiled before USAID ceased independent operations in July, challenge assertions by the Trump administration and Israel used to justify restricting aid flow and supporting a new distribution system. The report examined incidents between October 2023 and May 2024, concluding that in most cases of lost aid, the perpetrator could not be identified. The State Department and the Israel Defense Forces have forcefully pushed back against the report's conclusions, citing other intelligence and video evidence.</p>

          <p>BBC analyst Jeremy Bowen describes the plan to airdrop aid into Gaza as an 'act of desperation' that is unlikely to solve the growing hunger crisis. Drawing on his experience covering past conflicts, he argues that airdrops are a crude and inefficient method of delivery, often resulting in aid landing in dangerous areas or causing accidental deaths. He contends that this method delivers far less than truck convoys and is typically a last resort, which is not the case in Gaza where land access is possible but restricted. Bowen concludes that only a sustained ceasefire and an unrestricted, large-scale ground operation can truly address the starvation unfolding in the region.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed the week at record highs, fueled by positive news on trade deals and strong corporate earnings. The market was particularly boosted by President Trump's announcement of a 'massive' trade agreement with Japan, and attention is now turning to upcoming talks with China and the European Union. Second-quarter earnings season is also in full swing, with a majority of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far beating expectations. Despite some mixed housing data, the overall market sentiment remains strong heading into the final trading days of July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While daily coffee consumption is common for most Americans, experts say the ideal amount varies significantly from person to person. The FDA recommends no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, which is roughly equivalent to four cups of coffee, a range considered safe by many dietitians. However, some individuals are more sensitive and may experience anxiety or jitters with less. Recent studies have linked moderate coffee intake to health benefits, but heavy consumption can pose risks, especially for those with hypertension. Experts advise people to be mindful of how their body responds and to prioritize meals and water over caffeine.</p>

They describe being subjected to daily beatings, humiliation by guards, unsanitary conditions, and being told they faced sentences of 30 to 90 years. These accounts offer the first detailed look inside the controversial prison, which human rights groups have criticized as a facility designed to make people disappear.</p>

          <p>Tom Rogers, a former NBC Cable President and self-described 'raging bull' on Netflix, is now expressing concern about the streaming giant's future. He points to a decline in viewing time per subscriber and growing competition from free content platforms like YouTube as significant headwinds. While Netflix's recent earnings were positive, Rogers notes that engagement is the key driver of its business model, affecting everything from price increases to programming budgets. He also suggests that AI could be a 'double-edged sword,' helping Netflix with ad targeting but also empowering amateur creators on YouTube to produce more professional-looking content.</p>

Panelists on 'Washington Week With The Atlantic' argued that the case centers on the idea of powerful people acting behind closed doors, a narrative Trump often uses against his opponents. However, in this instance, his past association with Epstein and the administration's handling of related files position him as a defender of the powerful. This contradiction makes it difficult for him to control the narrative and deflect public and political focus from the issue.</p>

Researchers found that while some products had low levels likely from packaging, others had levels high enough to suggest PFAS were used in the manufacturing process.
