          <p>Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University in Tamil Nadu, India, in collaboration with the UK's Face Lab, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old skulls found at the ancient burial site of Kondagai. These reconstructions offer insights into the early inhabitants of southern India, revealing features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries. The findings from the Keeladi archaeological site challenge historical narratives that confined early Indian urban civilization to the north, suggesting a sophisticated independent civilization in the south. This work sparks discussions on ancestry and migration, highlighting the region's diverse past and aiming to create a gene library from degraded skeletal remains.</p>

          <p>A bus carrying the Aliquippa Junior High football team crashed in Economy Borough, Pennsylvania, en route to a game, resulting in at least 21 children and the bus driver being hospitalized. The incident occurred when the bus veered off the road, struck a hillside, and briefly tipped before landing upright, also knocking down live utility wires. The exact cause of the crash remains under investigation, and the conditions of those injured are currently unknown. Local officials, including Aliquippa Mayor Dwan Walker and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, expressed support for the community, which is holding a vigil.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole for the 1989 killings of their parents, marking their first chance at freedom. The parole hearings were marred by controversy when an audio recording of Erik's session was inadvertently released by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, causing a temporary halt to Lyle's hearing. Their attorney argued the leak compromised the fairness of the proceedings, while a corrections spokesperson confirmed the "erroneous" release. Both brothers will be eligible for parole again in three years, with a possibility of an earlier hearing in one year. The case continues to attract significant national attention, fueled by social media campaigns and past allegations of parental sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Several major European parcel companies, including DHL, Royal Mail, and national post offices in France and Spain, are temporarily suspending some shipments to the U.S. The decision stems from new U.S. tariff policies, effective August 29, which eliminate the "de minimis" rule allowing duty-free entry for packages under $800. Companies cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics systems for customs duty collection and data transmission as the primary reasons for the pause. The Trump administration defends the policy, calling the previous rule a "catastrophic loophole" that reduced revenue and enabled illicit imports.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million Americans in the West are under dangerous heat alerts this weekend, with temperatures soaring into triple digits from Arizona to Washington. Cities like Seattle and Portland, unaccustomed to prolonged extreme heat, are expected to challenge daily record highs. This heat wave also fuels elevated fire weather concerns and widespread monsoon thunderstorms, bringing flash flooding risks and potential lightning-sparked fires. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Fernand has formed in the central Atlantic, becoming the sixth named storm of the season, though it is forecast to remain over open waters east of Bermuda. Lingering rough surf and dangerous rip currents from Hurricane Erin continue to impact the East Coast.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its defense manufacturing capabilities, exemplified by a massive new aviation industrial complex in Shenyang, spanning an area the size of 600 football fields. This development underscores China's commitment to bolstering its capacity for mass production of military weapons, a focus intensified by recent global conflicts. Experts note that Beijing maintains a substantial defense industry, which can be further supported by its civilian manufacturing sector during wartime. This strategic investment aims to ensure China can outproduce and outlast rivals like the United States in potential protracted warfare scenarios.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning significant changes to sentencing rules in England and Wales, allowing courts to impose non-custodial penalties such as bans from pubs, concerts, sports matches, driving, and travel. These reforms aim to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending, following recommendations for fewer custodial sentences for less serious crimes to address prison overcrowding. The Ministry of Justice intends to introduce legislation enabling broader restrictions, even for offenses unrelated to the specific ban. Additionally, offenders released from prison could face similar restrictions and more mandatory drug testing, as part of a wider strategy to cut crime and ensure prison space for dangerous individuals.</p>

She also stated that a "client list" does not exist and speculated that Epstein's death was not a suicide by external parties.

Retailers have also benefited from strong brand loyalty and new revenue streams, like advertising and third-party marketplaces, which offer higher margins.

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has significantly out-raised his rivals in the New York City mayoral contest, securing over $1 million between early July and mid-August, with substantial grassroots support. His fundraising dominance is mirrored by a polling lead, positioning him ahead of incumbent Eric Adams and former governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's platform includes rent freezes, free public services, and elevated taxes on universities. Despite a $250,000 donation from a billionaire's daughter to a PAC supporting him, Mamdani has previously urged supporters to focus on volunteering. Both Adams and Cuomo face pressure to withdraw but have expressed determination to continue their campaigns.</p>

          <p>China plays a complex dual role in Southeast Asia's environment, being the largest investor in renewable energy projects while simultaneously expanding operations in highly polluting sectors like nickel processing and rare earth mining. This expansion is driven by stricter regulations in China, cheaper labor, and weaker environmental enforcement in neighboring countries. Environmentalists warn of severe long-term consequences for local communities and ecosystems, with reports of increased pollution in the Mekong River. While Chinese capital supports green infrastructure, its involvement in heavy industries raises concerns about the commitment of Southeast Asian governments to environmental protection.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Los Angeles and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. These jurisdictions limit cooperation with federal immigration agencies, and the judge ruled that Trump's executive order to cut funding was likely unconstitutional and violated the separation of powers. Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles applauded the decision, reaffirming the city's commitment to defending residents' rights. The ruling is the latest development in the ongoing legal battle between the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies and local governments seeking to protect undocumented immigrants.</p>

Lee and fellow Democrat Robert Garcia accused the Trump administration of feigning compliance with the subpoena and not genuinely seeking justice for victims or the truth.

The narrative follows a German botanist and his partner, later joined by an idealistic couple and a grandiose baroness, whose conflicting ideals lead to chaos on the uninhabited island of Floreana.
