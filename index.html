            <p>A 38-year-old man, Cody Balmer, was arrested after allegedly setting fire to the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence in Harrisburg early Sunday morning. Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were home at the time and were safely evacuated by state and Capitol police. Balmer faces charges including attempted homicide, terrorism, and aggravated arson. The fire caused significant damage to the residence, a 29,000 square foot Georgian-style home, and is under investigation by Pennsylvania State Police, who are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to a conviction.</p>

            <p>Newcastle United's players and staff dedicated their 4-1 victory over Manchester United to manager Eddie Howe, who was admitted to hospital after feeling unwell. Assistant managers Jason Tindall and Graeme Jones oversaw the game in Howe's absence. The players responded with an exceptional performance, securing their first league double over their opponents since the 1930-31 season. The team's thoughts remained with Howe, who masterminded their recent Carabao Cup triumph.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the Trump administration to completely cancel its reciprocal tariffs as trade tensions between the two countries continue. This comes after Trump announced a 90-day pause on some global tariffs but increased levies on Chinese imports. The US Commerce Secretary hinted at temporary exemptions for some electronics, but President Trump refuted this, adding uncertainty to the situation. China has called the exemptions a "small step" while evaluating the impact of the moves.</p>

            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping currently have no plans to communicate amidst the escalating trade war. Trump has imposed tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, with higher rates for those retaliating with tariffs on U.S. exports. China has responded by raising tariffs on U.S. goods, calling the levies a "joke." Greer insists that Trump is working to reshore American manufacturing as part of a broader global trade issue.</p>
