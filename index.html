          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition in parliament, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The party secured 60 of the 230 seats in the National Assembly after recent elections, capitalizing on concerns about immigration and the instability of traditional parties. Chega's rise reflects a broader trend of far-right movements gaining traction in Europe, challenging the dominance of center-right and center-left parties. Led by Andre Ventura, Chega campaigned on a platform of nationalism and promises to "Save Portugal," indicating a potential reshaping of political discourse and policy priorities in the country.</p>

          <p>An acetylene gas cylinder found at a Tokyo construction site, the location of explosions that injured ten people, had expired in November 1964. The explosions occurred during piling work for a new house in Edogawa Ward, a site that had been a parking space for about 40 years. Police suspect that workers drilling at the site inadvertently pierced the cylinder, causing the acetylene gas used for welding to ignite. The rusted cylinder had a hole approximately six centimeters in diameter, indicating its deteriorated condition.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a blow to his economic policies, as the Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to halt the tariffs, though most are currently suspended, and also blocked levies on China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>

While Toyota has stated it will not pass on the tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term.

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. has begun soliciting early retirement applications in the United States as part of its efforts to turn its fortunes around. The program is part of a broader streamlining effort, including cutting 20,000 jobs and closing seven vehicle plants globally. The Japanese carmaker aims to reduce its workforce in the U.S. market, where it has struggled with poor sales due to a limited hybrid model lineup. Nissan will also solicit early retirement applications from administrative staff in Japan this summer.</p>

          <p>The British government is considering sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, in response to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The decision comes amid rising pressure over the acute suffering of civilians and follows Britain joining France and Canada in condemning Israel’s expanded military operations. The recent deadly shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some British officials to question the timing of potential sanctions. Britain is also weighing whether to recognize an independent Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Despite legal guarantees at national and EU levels, racial segregation in schools continues to affect Roma children in Slovakia, where over 60% attend schools where they are in the majority. In nearly a quarter of all primary schools, Roma children are separated into "Roma schools" or "Roma classes," often with lower academic expectations and higher drop-out rates. The Slovak government initially denied discriminatory treatment but later acknowledged the segregation and introduced reforms, yet these measures often reinforce segregation. Activists urge Slovakia to end segregation by implementing diverse classrooms, mixed environments, and early support.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to conflict is framed as a reaction to opposition, where he believes others are responsible for his actions. Since regaining the White House, Trump has been fixated on making an example of those who push back against him. He views conflict as a zero-sum game, seeking not just a win but humiliation and control over those who oppose him. This is exemplified in his administration's pressure campaign against Harvard University, where he claims the university is "treating our country with great disrespect."</p>

The quarter-percentage rate cut came as the country continued to grapple with heightened political uncertainty following the botched attempt by former leader Yoon Suk Yeol to impose martial law in December. The BOK monetary policy board attributed the rate cut decision to its expectations that economic growth will "decline considerably" while inflation remains "broadly stable."

Along with worldwide delivery delays, this contributes to a sharp slowdown in the growth of China’s aviation capacity, analysts said. Held back by tariffs and global supply chain constraints, China’s civil aviation passenger capacity is likely to grow by an average of 3.1 per cent a year until 2028, analysts at China International Capital Corporation (CICC) said in a note released on Wednesday.
