          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, marking a significant return after decades spent working behind the scenes as a television writer and producer. The 66-year-old revealed he had to relearn his own hit songs and take guitar lessons, now choosing to play bass for a fresh challenge. Cassidy, who achieved fame in the 1970s with music and acting roles, candidly admitted he never truly enjoyed being a public figure but now embraces his role as a storyteller. His extensive "The Road to Us Tour" will feature a blend of classic tracks, new material, and personal narratives, promising a comprehensive look at his career starting in Nashville.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UCLA's football team suffered a significant 30-23 loss to UNLV, described as a "full-blown debacle," which extends their season-opening disappointment and marks their first 0-2 start since 2019. The article highlights persistent issues, including a slow and often out-of-position defense, alongside an offense that struggled to sustain drives and capitalize on opportunities. Despite quarterback Nico Iamaleava leading a late fourth-quarter comeback attempt, which was ultimately thwarted by an interception, the Bruins could not secure a victory. This lopsided defeat against a Mountain West Conference opponent intensifies the pressure on coach DeShaun Foster early in his second season, raising questions about the team's overall productivity and defensive capabilities.</p>

          <p>A Russian overnight drone attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, tragically resulted in the deaths of at least two people, including a one-year-old baby whose body was pulled from the rubble, and left eleven others injured. Residential buildings in the Svyatoshynkyi and Darnytskyi districts were directly hit, leading to partial destruction and ongoing fires. This fresh assault also extended to Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelensky's hometown, where three infrastructure facilities were struck. The attack unfolded amidst escalating warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin to the West against providing aid to Ukraine, following his rejection of proposals for a "reassurance force" after a recent Paris summit.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying against oligarchic control and bolstering Mamdani's progressive platform. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, champions policies like freezing rent prices, increasing housing availability, and raising taxes for the city's wealthiest 1%, resonating strongly with working-class and low-income communities. Sanders lauded Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a crucial "test case of whether democracy is still able to prevail" against the influence of billionaire donors and tech oligarchs. The event also featured Mamdani's condemnation of CUNY's dismissal of professors supporting Palestinian solidarity, with both leaders criticizing the lack of embrace from mainstream and centrist Democrats for Mamdani's policies.</p>

          <p>USC's offense secured a dominant 59-20 victory over Clay Helton's Georgia Southern team, accumulating an impressive 755 yards, the most for the Trojans in two decades. Quarterback Jayden Maiava led the charge, throwing four touchdowns and achieving a career-high 412 passing yards well before the fourth quarter. The article notes the Trojans' rushing attack also proved formidable, racking up 309 yards with notable contributions from Waymond Jordan and Eli Sanders. While USC's defense exhibited some breakdowns, the sheer offensive firepower negated any significant threat. This decisive win, coming against their former coach, provided a cathartic moment for the Trojan faithful, showcasing the team's strong start to the season.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has swelled to an estimated $1.8 billion, making it the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history after no tickets successfully matched all winning numbers in the recent drawing. For a single winner, the estimated cash value option stands at $826.4 million before taxes. This substantial increase follows 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner, a streak that now ties the game's record. A fortunate winner has the choice of receiving a lump sum payment or an annuitized prize, which includes an immediate payment followed by 29 annual installments that progressively increase by 5% each year. The odds of claiming this monumental prize are 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm, currently swirling in the Pacific Ocean and tracking west-northwestward directly towards Hawaii. Forecasters have issued warnings that significant swells generated by the hurricane are anticipated to reach the Hawaiian Islands by Sunday, creating a risk of life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents that could persist through midweek. With maximum sustained winds near 140 mph, the hurricane was located approximately 860 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. In response, Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke declared a state of emergency, urging both residents and visitors to closely monitor updates and prepare accordingly for potential direct impacts such as heavy rainfall and widespread flooding early next week.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman, was retried and subsequently convicted of first-degree murder and arson in connection with the 2007 death of her husband, Todd Stermer. Prosecutors alleged she intentionally set their home ablaze and then fatally ran him over with a van as he attempted to escape the flames. Stermer consistently maintains her innocence, attributing the events to a tragic accident that occurred amidst a troubled marriage plagued by financial difficulties and claims of domestic abuse. The complex legal battle featured conflicting testimonies, including allegations of Stermer's affair and Todd's prior suspicions of arson.

          <p>A collaborative research team from the US and China has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. The technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, which causes water droplets on the surface to boil and form vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles expand to a certain point, they suddenly collapse, releasing energy and creating a strong force that can propel small jumpers up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) into the air. This study, published in the journal Science, demonstrates that cavitation can serve as an efficient launching mechanism, with scientists able to control the flow of light to direct how and where these tiny robots launch or even swim in water.</p>

          <p>Several Mexican Independence Day events in Chicago have been canceled or postponed due to widespread fears surrounding President Trump's announced plans to deploy National Guard troops and federal immigration agents to the city. Organizers of "El Grito Chicago," an event that attracted 24,000 people last year, explicitly cited community safety concerns as the primary reason for their decision. The Trump administration plans to dispatch 230 Customs and Border Protection agents to Chicago, a move preceded by the President inaccurately labeling the city "the most dangerous city in the world." Local officials, including Governor JB Pritzker, have voiced strong opposition, expressing concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targeting event attendees, leading to peaceful protests against the proposed enforcement actions.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts then controversially removed him, bringing in reliever Blake Treinen, who struggled significantly with command, issuing two walks and hitting a batter. Ultimately, embattled closer Tanner Scott surrendered a two-run, walk-off single, transforming what seemed like a potential season-turning victory into a "wasted opportunity" and a painful new low point for the already struggling Dodgers.</p>

          <p>China's private holiday accommodation sector, encompassing homestays and guesthouses, is currently experiencing a significant downturn, causing many operators to express regret over their investments. Following a short-lived "revenge travel" boom after pandemic restrictions eased, the market was quickly saturated by a surge in new supply, coupled with declining guest spending and intense price wars, which have severely squeezed profits. A report by Fastdata, a Beijing-based think tank, revealed that nearly 60% of the more than 400,000 businesses in this sector, most established within the last three years, now lament their decision to enter the market. Operators, such as Chen Mei who scaled back her coastal operations, highlight the industry's rapid boom-and-bust cycle, leaving many grappling with reduced profitability and thinning bookings.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S., including Yonkers Middle High School in New York, are increasingly adopting locked magnetic pouches from the company Yondr to effectively enforce statewide cellphone bans in classrooms.

With over 2.5 million students in 35 states now utilizing these pouches, educators report observing a positive shift towards increased in-person interaction among students, despite some initial skepticism and attempts to bypass the system. The initiative's core purpose is to establish phone-free spaces, thereby promoting enhanced focus and fostering a crucial culture change within learning environments.</p>

The military identified Muwasi, a makeshift tent camp, as the safe zone, promising essential services like field hospitals and food, though past instances have seen Israeli forces strike areas previously declared safe.

The article notes that while long-term borrowing rates eventually stabilized, the episode serves as a clear warning against economic instability. Reeves' team is expected to advocate that any budget deficit must be addressed through either higher taxes or spending cuts, with the Office for Budget Responsibility's judgment on UK productivity being a critical determinant of the required fiscal adjustment.

The group aims to offer a "cathartic" environment where women can share similar experiences, contrasting with traditional veterans' spaces where they often feel overlooked or presumed not to have served.</p>

          <p>Mount Sinai, a site revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is embroiled in controversy over Egypt's ambitious plans to transform it into a luxury mega-resort. The "Great Transfiguration Project" includes the construction of hotels, villas, and shopping bazaars, despite the area being a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to the ancient 6th-century St Catherine's Monastery. The indigenous Bedouin community, the Jebeleya tribe, has reportedly faced the demolition of their homes and tourist eco-camps with minimal compensation, and even the forced relocation of graves from their local cemetery. Critics, including UNESCO, express deep concern over the irreversible destruction of the area's unique natural and cultural characteristics, viewing this as development imposed against the will of the local community.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration enforcement operation, dubbed "Patriot 2.0," specifically targeting Massachusetts for the arrest and deportation of immigrants. This operation, anticipated to span several weeks, is primarily focused on individuals who have been released from local custody despite prior attempts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to detain them. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson openly criticized Boston's "sanctuary policies," asserting they attract and harbor criminals, placing public safety threats above law-abiding citizens. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, however, has defended her city's policies, limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, and stated her administration is actively preparing for potential federal National Guard deployment by reviewing legal precedents and engaging with community members.</p>

          <p>An initial investigative report by Portugal's air and rail accident investigations bureau (GPIAAF) has revealed that a crucial cable linking two cabins snapped shortly before the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon. The incident, which tragically killed 16 people and injured 21, occurred when the 140-year-old Gloria funicular swerved off its tracks and collided with a building. The report indicated that the cable had passed a visual check just hours before the derailment, and the scheduled maintenance plan was up to date. This finding suggests a sudden and unexpected failure. Two separate investigations are currently underway to determine the full causes of the accident, with a preliminary report anticipated within 45 days.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively employing decoy military equipment, such as plywood tanks and flat-pack howitzers, as a strategic tactic to deceive Russian forces and conserve valuable ammunition and resources. These imitations, which range from small radars to full-scale vehicles, are meticulously designed to mimic real military positions, often complete with realistic details like wheel ruts and ammunition crates, sometimes even successfully fooling visiting officers. Volunteers play a crucial role in supplying these inexpensive decoys, such as the $500-$600 M777 models, which effectively draw fire from much costlier Russian Lancet kamikaze drones. The article notes that Russia also utilizes decoys, including imitation Shahed drones, to overload Ukrainian air defenses, highlighting a widespread "decoy war" being waged by both sides.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is poised to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in an upcoming ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Acutis, who tragically died of leukemia at the age of 15, earned the nickname "God's influencer" for his innovative use of websites to document miracles and disseminate Catholic teaching. His canonization, which was previously postponed due to the death of Pope Francis, follows the official attribution of two miracles to him. His body, preserved in wax, rests in Assisi, Italy, attracting over a million pilgrims. A shrine at Our Lady of Dolours Church in Chelsea, London, where he was baptized, is also experiencing increased visitors, as many young Catholics find connection with his modern approach to faith.</p>

          <p>The United States Men’s National Team (USMNT) endured a disappointing 2-0 loss to South Korea, extending their experimental summer into a fall malaise and raising significant alarm bells just 279 days before hosting the World Cup. Despite head coach Mauricio Pochettino's stated goal of gaining new insights from this international window, the team exhibited a notable lack of communication in defense and repeatedly failed to capitalize on numerous scoring chances. Son Heung-min scored the opening goal, vividly illustrating the US team's defensive disjointedness. While Pochettino asserted the team would be in top form for the World Cup opener, the lackluster performance against a rejuvenated South Korean side, energetically cheered on by a partisan crowd, offered little immediate reassurance for their upcoming major tournament.</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour is transitioning from her iconic role as editor-in-chief of US Vogue to global editorial director, prompting significant discussion about the magazine's future relevance in a rapidly evolving, fast-paced digital world. Wintour, renowned for her instinctive understanding of the zeitgeist, pioneered putting pop stars and diverse figures on Vogue covers, effectively bridging the worlds of fashion and entertainment. Her successor, 39-year-old Chloe Malle, reportedly plans to issue less frequent, theme-centered editions, aiming to reposition the print magazine as a collectible item. Critics are now pondering how much of Vogue's enduring prestige is intrinsically tied to Wintour's powerful personal brand and whether the publication can sustain its influence amidst increasing financial pressures and fierce competition from social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has dramatically plunged by over 80% following the Trump administration's decision to eliminate a long-standing tariff exemption for low-cost imports. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) reported major operational disruptions, with 88 postal operators suspending some or all services to the US. The change, effective August 29, 2025, ended the "de minimis exemption" for parcels valued at $800 or less, shifting the burden of customs duty collection and remittance to transportation carriers or CBP-approved entities. While the policy aims to combat tariff evasion and drug smuggling, the UPU criticized the insufficient time and guidance provided for compliance, which has directly led to this severe drop in international mail volume.</p>

          <p>The European Union's new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) is scheduled for a gradual introduction this autumn, designed to enhance security and streamline travel for non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. Starting October 12, this system will replace the current manual passport stamping, requiring first-time travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at automated kiosks or with border officers. Concerns have been repeatedly voiced regarding the potential for significant queues, particularly at busy transit points like the port of Dover and Eurostar terminals, during the initial registration process. While a mobile phone app has been developed to pre-process some information, its widespread use is not anticipated at the outset, leading to a phased implementation over six months across all 29 participating countries.</p>

Users of ByteDance's Trae, for instance, have already expressed significant concerns about continued access to Claude and have begun inquiring about refunds.

          <p>Singapore is sounding a critical alarm over the looming threat of rising sea levels, which are projected to increase by up to 1.15 meters by the year 2100, posing an existential challenge to the low-lying island nation. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized that safeguarding the nation's very existence is paramount, especially since 30% of Singapore lies less than 5 meters above mean sea level, putting homes, infrastructure, and vital facilities at risk. This rise, exacerbated by human-caused climate change, means Singapore cannot retreat to higher ground like larger nations. Consequently, the country is committing billions to comprehensive coastal defenses, including land reclamation, seawalls, and barriers, while also supporting global efforts in clean energy and infrastructure modernization.</p>
