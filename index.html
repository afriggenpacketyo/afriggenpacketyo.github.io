          <h2>Chevron Finalizes $53 Billion Hess Acquisition After Winning Arbitration Against Exxon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:11:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion purchase of Hess Corporation, a move aimed at securing access to Guyana's extensive offshore oil reserves. The acquisition proceeded after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's stake in the lucrative Stabroek Block oil project. While Chevron's CEO celebrated the decision as an affirmation of standard industry practices for corporate mergers, the company anticipates some job reductions as it integrates Hess's operations. The outcome resolves significant market uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Reverse Mortgages as a Supplement to Social Security Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:08:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines how reverse mortgages can serve as a financial tool for retirees, particularly those who are "house rich but cash poor." It details three primary ways this can work: by converting home equity into a steady monthly income stream, providing access to a lump sum or line of credit for unexpected costs like healthcare, and enabling retirees to delay claiming Social Security to receive larger future benefits. The text emphasizes that while a reverse mortgage can offer financial flexibility, it's a significant decision that requires careful consideration to ensure it aligns with an individual's long-term retirement goals.

          <p>A recent study ranks the infrastructure of all 50 U.S. states, revealing that despite some national improvements, significant weaknesses persist in certain areas. The report evaluates states based on the condition of roads and bridges, power grid reliability, broadband access, and transportation logistics. Maine is identified as having the nation's worst infrastructure, primarily due to its unreliable power grid. Other states in the bottom ten include Alaska, Hawaii, and New Hampshire, which face challenges ranging from poor connectivity and remote locations to frequent power outages and inadequate transportation options.

          <p>At least 33 people have been killed and many others injured by lightning strikes in India's eastern state of Bihar over the past week. The fatalities occurred amid powerful monsoon storms, with most victims being farmers and agricultural workers caught outdoors. State officials have issued warnings, urging residents to stay inside during severe weather, and have announced financial compensation for the families of the deceased. Scientists note that climate change is contributing to an increase in lightning activity, as rising temperatures create more energy for the thunderstorms that produce these deadly strikes.</p>

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from the rest of the U.S. airline industry, accounting for over 86% of the sector's profits last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong brand loyalty, extensive international networks, and a strategic focus on premium travel, which better insulates them from market challenges like falling domestic airfares. While both carriers have trimmed their 2025 forecasts, they are capitalizing on revenue from premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs. This strategy contrasts with other airlines that are struggling to remain profitable even during peak travel seasons. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's production of strawberries and asparagus has fallen to its lowest levels in decades, according to new data from the country's Federal Statistical Office. The decline is attributed to farmers planting less of these crops, as rising operational costs, particularly wages, make their cultivation increasingly unprofitable. This trend has caused the prices for these seasonal favorites to rise, turning them into more of a luxury item for consumers. Consequently, Germany's self-sufficiency in strawberries has dropped significantly, though cultivation in protected environments like greenhouses offers a partial exception to the overall decline.</p>

Traveling to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, found a changed landscape where towns had moved and the once-bustling steamboat culture was in decline. Despite these changes, being back in a pilot house brought him immense joy, making him feel as if the intervening years had disappeared.

          <p>President Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move comes after the administration faced backlash, including from its own supporters, for a recent Justice Department memo that stated Epstein did not possess an incriminating "client list." In a social media post, Trump called the ongoing controversy a "SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats." Any release of the typically secret grand jury materials would require court approval and could face legal challenges from various involved parties.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's long-standing strategy of leveraging conspiracy theories is now turning against him in the controversy over the Jeffrey Epstein files. The author posits that Trump cultivated a base that thrives on narratives of secret sexual assault rings among the elite, which was politically useful for him. However, now that he is in power and trying to shut down the Epstein speculation, his followers are turning on him, demonstrating that the post-truth world he helped create is too unwieldy to control. The piece suggests a grim irony in this turn of events.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the flood at Camp Mystic in Texas, which killed 27 people, is examining a series of critical failures, including a lost opportunity to install a modern flood warning system. In 2018, Kerr County's application for a state grant to fund a new alert system for the Guadalupe River was denied, leaving the area with an inactive, outdated network. The camp's owner also reportedly waited over an hour to evacuate after receiving a severe flood warning. This tragedy highlights the devastating consequences of inadequate infrastructure funding and delayed emergency responses in a known flood-risk area.</p>
