          <p>Cracker Barrel has suspended its restaurant remodeling plans following significant public backlash against its recent rebranding efforts. The company had previously reversed a decision to modernize its logo after criticism from customers and public figures, including former President Donald Trump. In a statement, the chain acknowledged that the proposed modern designs did not align with the vintage, country-store aesthetic that customers value, promising to maintain its traditional atmosphere and focus on core brand elements.</p>

While Dimon noted that consumer spending remains somewhat stable, he expressed uncertainty about whether the trend points toward a recession or merely a slowdown, anticipating that the Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates soon.

          <p>Sixty years ago, on September 9, 1965, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax achieved baseball immortality by throwing a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs. The event remains a celebrated moment in sports history, remembered for Koufax's dominant performance and the iconic radio call by announcer Vin Scully. The game was the pinnacle of a legendary, albeit short, career for Koufax, who retired a year later at age 30 due to arthritis but left an indelible mark on the sport.</p>

          <p>An 88-year-old jewelry store owner in San Jose, California, was hospitalized after being assaulted during a brazen smash-and-grab robbery.

The victim's family reported he suffered a stroke and other injuries but is now in stable condition, while local officials condemned the attack and called for change.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Issue Warning Against 'Dangerous' Climate Engineering in Polar Regions</h2>

          <p>A group of over 40 polar scientists has warned that geoengineering techniques aimed at cooling the Arctic and Antarctic are dangerous and unlikely to be effective. Proposals such as artificially thickening sea ice or releasing reflective particles into the atmosphere could cause severe, unforeseen environmental damage. The researchers argue that these controversial ideas distract from the only proven solution to climate change—reducing fossil fuel emissions—and could also heighten geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist describes receiving backlash from readers who claimed his own COVID-19 infection proved that vaccines are ineffective. The writer connects this sentiment to the anti-vaccine rhetoric promoted by figures like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Infectious disease experts quoted in the article reaffirm that vaccines significantly reduce the severity of illness, noting that current hospitalizations are predominantly among the unvaccinated, despite widespread misinformation.</p>
