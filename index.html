          <p>The Conservative Party in the UK has unveiled a new borders plan, promising to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants within five years if they win the next election. The proposals include banning asylum claims for those entering without permission, preventing court challenges to rejected claims, and doubling funding for a reformed "Removals Force." This aggressive stance aims to increase removals five-fold from current figures and includes plans to end the UK's membership in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The article highlights that these measures are presented amidst challenging poll ratings for the party and a competitive political landscape.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated his hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza "in the coming days," following Hamas's agreement to certain aspects of President Trump's peace proposal. A delegation has been sent to Egypt to finalize technical details, with negotiations expected to conclude within a few days. While Hamas accepted the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a temporary end to fighting, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza remains a point of contention. The US views Hamas's response as positive, and Israel has reduced military activity to facilitate the hostage release.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police made at least 493 arrests in central London during protests organized by Defend Our Juries in support of the proscribed group Palestine Action. The demonstrations proceeded despite calls from ministers and police to postpone them following a deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers stated their commitment to compassionate responses to multiple atrocities, rejecting the idea of letting terror win by cancelling the vigil. The arrests were primarily for supporting a proscribed organization, with many protesters needing to be carried out of Trafalgar Square.</p>

          <p>Newly released 911 transcripts from an August Minneapolis church shooting detail the fear and chaos experienced by those inside when a gunman opened fire. Callers, including a parishioner hiding under pews and a staff member, reported multiple gunshots and injuries, while teachers heroically kept students quiet and hidden. The attack resulted in two children dead and 18 injured, with the alleged gunman dying by suicide. Investigators found no bias motivation, classifying it as not a hate crime under state standards, despite the profound tragedy and community impact.</p>

          <p>Iran executed six death-row inmates, alleging they carried out attacks in the oil-rich Khuzestan province on behalf of Israel. This marks the latest in a series of executions, which human rights activists claim are the highest in decades and often involve coerced confessions and closed-door trials. The individuals were accused of killing police and security forces and orchestrating bombings, with state television airing one man's confession. Independent human rights experts at the United Nations have criticized Iran's use of the death penalty.</p>
