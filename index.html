          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 01:22:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter profits that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a strong performance in its investment banking division. The German lender reported a net profit of €1.485 billion, outperforming a €1.2 billion forecast, with revenues aligning with market predictions at €7.804 billion. This positive result comes as European banks contend with a lower interest rate environment and geopolitical trade uncertainties, particularly the looming threat of U.S. tariffs that could impact the German economy. The bank also noted increased opportunities in advising clients on defense-related ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deoleo, the world's top olive oil producer, has warned that a potential 30% tariff on EU imports by the U.S. could lead to higher prices and reduced availability for American consumers. The Spanish company, which makes brands like Bertolli, highlighted that the U.S. imports approximately 95% of its olive oil, making it highly vulnerable to such trade measures. The threatened tariffs, which could take effect August 1, are causing uncertainty across various European export industries, including wine and cheese producers. Deoleo's CEO emphasized that penalizing access to a healthy food staple is counterproductive. (not investment advice)</p>

Both teams have recent history, with each securing a victory against the other in the Nations League this year. Spain, the reigning world champions, are in their first Euros final, while defending champions England have reached their third consecutive major final after overcoming several setbacks.</p>

          <p>The lawyer for Lauren Pisciotta, a former assistant to Kanye West, states that his client is in hiding out of fear after filing a lawsuit with serious allegations against the rapper. The updated civil case now includes accusations of sex trafficking, stalking, and sexual assault, in addition to the initial claims of sexual harassment. Pisciotta alleges she was subjected to repeated harassment, unwanted sexual advances, and disturbing behavior, including an instance of oral sexual assault. West has denied all claims, with his spokesperson dismissing them as "fantasy fiction" and vowing to challenge them in court.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate overturned by a UK court. The ruling raises significant questions about the original prosecutions and may pave the way for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. The decision has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the scandal, particularly focusing on the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's reliance on internal investigations conducted by the banks themselves. Hayes and Palombo have maintained they were scapegoats for the broader financial crisis.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, affirming a lower court's nationwide block on the policy. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the order's attempt to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen or temporary resident parents violates the 14th Amendment. The 2-1 decision keeps the injunction in place, preventing the administration from enforcing the policy. The ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration on a key immigration issue and moves the matter closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>

While universities have increased spending on wellbeing services, they stress they cannot replace clinical NHS services, which face long waiting times.

          <p>In a significant departure from presidential norms, Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, escalating his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. The visit is highly symbolic, as presidents have historically respected the central bank's political independence to avoid influencing monetary policy. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates and has even suggested he might try to fire him, a move whose legality is questionable. This direct confrontation at the Fed's headquarters represents a new level of political intervention in the central bank's affairs.</p>

This trend reflects a broader frustration with "NIMBY" (Not In My Back Yard) opposition that often stalls development.

          <p>A Scripps Institution of Oceanography student discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not seen locally in a decade. These pelagic snails, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, typically inhabit warmer tropical waters. Their appearance in Southern California often coincides with warmer ocean currents moving toward the coast, raising questions among researchers about a potential link to climate change. Scientists are encouraging the public to report any further sightings as they study whether this is a sign of shifting marine ecosystems.</p>

This strong performance highlights SK Hynix's leadership in the advanced memory market, challenging its rival Samsung. The company anticipates continued strong demand for the rest of the year, driven by ongoing investments in AI infrastructure by major tech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New regulations under the UK's Online Safety Act now require websites hosting pornography to implement robust age-verification systems, ending the era of simple checkbox confirmations.

The rules aim to prevent children from accessing explicit material, but concerns remain about user privacy and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs. Major platforms like Pornhub have committed to introducing the new checks, which represent a significant change for UK internet users.</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly pushed back against media reports claiming President Trump's name appears multiple times in Justice Department documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. A spokesperson dismissed the claims as "fake news stories" from political opponents, though an unnamed official reportedly did not deny his name is in the files. The controversy arises as the administration faces pressure to release more information about the case, a promise Trump made while campaigning. A judge recently denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury files from Epstein's 2006 Florida case, citing secrecy rules.</p>

          <p>Following the news of singer Ozzy Osbourne's death at 76, this article reflects on how his band, Black Sabbath, invented the genre of heavy metal. Formed in working-class Birmingham, the band reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s by creating a darker, heavier sound. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, and the band's occult-inspired lyrics set the template for generations of rock bands. Their early albums, like "Paranoid" and "Master of Reality," established them as pioneers whose musical influence remains indelible.</p>

This admission came after his debut at first base for the Giants, a stark contrast to his public insistence on being a DH while with his former team, the Boston Red Sox. Devers explained that playing in the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The change in stance follows a tense spring training where he and former manager Alex Cora were at odds over his defensive role.</p>

Opponents of the cull, led by Rep. Troy E. Nehls, argue it is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money.

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% quarterly increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. This surge was partly attributed to firms expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. trade policy changes and tariff implementations. Despite the positive quarter, analysts remain cautious, as domestic consumption shows weaker signs and the global trade outlook remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>
