          <p>Hundreds of extra police officers have been deployed in Manchester to reassure communities after a deadly attack at a synagogue. Officers are working extended shifts, with support from other forces, to provide a highly visible presence. The security measures also account for the upcoming Conservative Party Conference. Six individuals remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses related to the attack, in which two men were killed by a man who drove a car into a crowd before being shot by police.</p>

          <p>The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children is raising an alarm over a dramatic increase in financial sextortion schemes targeting teenage boys since the COVID-19 pandemic. Predators, often part of overseas criminal networks, pose as peers on social media and gaming platforms to trick boys into sharing explicit images, which are then used for blackmail. Lawmakers and the FBI acknowledge the crisis, with the FBI noting a 1,325% increase in cases linked to generative AI. The article emphasizes the devastating consequences, including youth suicide, and calls for greater action from tech companies and Congress.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal has described new underwater unmanned systems as "disruptive" and intelligent, capable of operating with stealth to evade enemy detection. According to an article in the publication, these systems operate below 90 decibels, making them difficult to track with sonar. The technology can be integrated with submarine-launched missiles and smart mines, forming a comprehensive, multilayered strike network. The report coincides with the PLA Navy's recent display of new unmanned submersibles and surface vessels, signaling advances in its naval capabilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has left national parks in a state of limbo, with thousands of employees furloughed and visitor services drastically reduced. While some parks remain partially accessible, key facilities and attractions are closed, causing confusion and disappointment for tourists. Park advocates express concern over the risks of operating with skeleton crews, citing potential for environmental damage and safety issues, similar to those seen in the 2018 shutdown. The closures also inflict significant economic damage on gateway communities that depend on park tourism.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 10:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small college towns across the United States are experiencing significant economic strain due to a sharp decline in international student enrollment. This trend, exacerbated by stricter visa processes and rhetoric from the Trump administration, has led to substantial revenue losses for universities and local businesses that rely on student spending. The article highlights Oxford, Ohio, where Miami University's international student population has plummeted, impacting everything from local restaurants to the housing market. Experts warn that this decline threatens the financial stability of smaller schools and the cultural diversity of their communities.</p>

          <p>After a 20-year restoration project, the tomb of Amenhotep III, one of ancient Egypt's most prominent pharaohs, has reopened to the public. Located in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, the large tomb was first discovered in 1799 but had been closed for extensive renovation work led by a Japanese team. The restoration included preserving paintings of the pharaoh and his wife on the tomb's walls. This reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revive its tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency for the country's economy.</p>

He notes that state insurance commissioners, regardless of party, unanimously support extending the tax credits to prevent market instability.

Projections show ANO winning around 35.5% of the vote, significantly ahead of the ruling center-right Spolu coalition. A win for Babis, who has opposed continued military aid to Ukraine and promoted a "Czech first" agenda, could shift the country's foreign policy. This result could align the Czech Republic more closely with Hungary and Slovakia, potentially creating further opposition to Brussels within the European Union.</p>

Despite being told she was too young for a mammogram by previous doctors, a high-risk clinic approved her for screening at age 36, leading to the discovery of two suspicious masses via an MRI. Her oncologist credits her self-advocacy with catching the cancer at a stage with a 99% five-year survival rate. Del Barrio's story underscores the importance of understanding personal risk factors and advocating for one's own health.</p>

          <h2>The Value of College Prestige Is Waning as Families Prioritize Cost and Career Outcomes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-held belief in the enduring prestige of elite universities is being challenged as families increasingly prioritize practical factors like tuition costs, career services, and hands-on learning opportunities. With college sticker prices soaring and the job market uncertain, many parents are questioning whether a brand-name degree is worth the high cost. This shift is causing fluctuations in college rankings, with schools like Northeastern and NYU rising in prominence by catering to these new priorities. The article suggests that a school's value is now measured more by what it delivers than by its historical reputation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has offered federal funding to nine elite universities in exchange for signing a "Compact for Academic Excellence," which critics describe as an attempt to impose ideological control over higher education. The agreement would require universities to adopt administration-dictated policies on admissions, free speech, hiring, and curriculum, effectively ending their independence. The document bans consideration of factors like race, sex, and political views in admissions and mandates standardized testing. This move is seen as a major escalation in the administration's efforts to reshape American universities to align with its political agenda.</p>

          <p>Ted Koerner may be one of the first residents to move back into a completely rebuilt home in Altadena, California, following the devastating Eaton fire. His primary motivation for the rapid reconstruction is his 13-year-old golden retriever, Daisy, whom he wants to allow to live out her final years in their familiar home. By liquidating retirement funds to start immediately and tenaciously navigating the bureaucracy, Koerner has pushed his project to near-completion while most others are still in the permitting phase.

          <p>This opinion article pays tribute to the life and work of primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91. It revisits her revolutionary discovery in 1960 that chimpanzees make and use tools, a finding that forced science to reconsider the definition of humanity. Her patient, empathetic approach, exemplified by her first gentle contact with the chimp she named David Greybeard, transformed our understanding of animal intelligence. Goodall's legacy extends beyond her research to global conservation efforts, forever changing how humans perceive their place in the natural world.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a railway station in Shostka, in Ukraine's northern Sumy region, has injured at least 30 people, including passengers and train staff. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack on civilian infrastructure as an act of "terrorism." The attack is part of a broader Russian assault on Ukraine's infrastructure, with overnight drone strikes also knocking out power to approximately 50,000 households near Chernihiv. In response, Ukraine has reportedly targeted one of Russia's largest oil refineries near St. Petersburg for the second time in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian demonstrators to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews" by reconsidering protests planned for this weekend following Thursday's synagogue attack. Police leaders in London and Manchester have expressed concerns that the demonstrations will strain resources needed for community protection. While protest organizers argue that cancelling peaceful events lets terror win, the Home Secretary has noted that powers exist to halt the marches if police advise they cannot manage them.</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly halted its offensive military operations in Gaza to allow Hamas to organize for a potential hostage release, following the militant group's positive response to a peace deal outlined by President Trump.

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that the UK will withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if her party wins the next general election. This major policy shift follows a party-led legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR obstructs key government objectives, such as migration reform. The move, announced on the eve of the party conference, aims to draw a clear line on a contentious issue and counter pressure from Reform UK. Labour criticized the decision as a sign of weakness, while legal experts warn of serious political and legal consequences.</p>
