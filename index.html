          <p>London Stansted Airport experienced significant disruptions on Wednesday, stemming from widespread train cancellations and delays caused by signalling system faults affecting CrossCountry and Greater Anglia services. Further complicating operations, a small fire erupted in the airport's Escape Lounge, generating a substantial amount of smoke and leading to the temporary closure of parts of the airport and security areas for a time. While the fire was swiftly extinguished by airport fire services with no reported injuries, passengers faced considerable delays and were urged to verify their flight statuses before traveling. This article highlights the dual challenges of infrastructure failure and an internal incident that severely impacted airport functionality and traveler convenience during the morning hours.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced that a new artificial intelligence tool, the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, helped recover nearly £500 million lost to fraud over the past year, with a significant portion related to pandemic-era schemes. This innovative AI, developed by the Cabinet Office, is designed to scan new policies for weaknesses, aiming to "fraud-proof" them before implementation. Despite civil liberties concerns regarding government AI use, ministers hail the record-breaking recovery as a major success, with the savings earmarked for public services. This article details the tool's effectiveness and its planned international licensing to countries like the US and Australia.</p>

          <p>A Canadian investigation concluded that TikTok's efforts to protect children's personal data and prevent underage use are inadequate, despite the app's 13-and-up age restriction. The probe found TikTok collected sensitive personal information from "a large number" of Canadian children, using it for targeted marketing and content, which can have harmful impacts. While TikTok disputes some findings, it has agreed to implement measures to strengthen its platform for Canadians. This article highlights growing global scrutiny over TikTok's impact on users and national security concerns, with governments worldwide, including the US and EU, examining the Chinese-owned app's data protection practices.</p>

          <p>Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has been ordered to repay nearly £5 million after falsely claiming it met safe maternity care standards, despite a damning Care Quality Commission report rating its services as inadequate. The trust had received the money from the Maternity Incentive Scheme, designed to encourage good care, but a subsequent review found non-compliance. This incident follows a pattern where other trusts with poor safety records also had to repay funds, highlighting systemic flaws in self-assessment within the NHS. This article details the financial repercussions and ongoing calls for a full independent inquiry into the Leeds trust's maternity services.</p>
