          <p>The Federalist Society, a traditionally right-wing legal organization, showed surprising ambivalence toward President Trump's executive actions at a recent gathering. While speakers generally supported Trump's policies, particularly deregulation, they expressed concern about the ‚Äúchaos‚Äù within the administration. Some speakers even advocated for stripping power from the executive branch, favoring judicial oversight, especially regarding Trump's tariffs. This suggests a potential conflict between the Federalist Society's vision of judicial power and Trump's approach to governance, potentially hindering lasting conservative policy changes.</p>

          <p>Despite earlier hopes of China acting as a mediator, it has been noticeably absent from recent negotiations regarding the conflict in Ukraine. The United States has engaged in separate deals with Russia and Ukraine to de-escalate military activity in the Black Sea, with ongoing discussions between American and Russian officials. While Ukrainian President Zelensky expressed willingness to meet with Putin in Turkey, China has not been involved in these developments. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman stated that Beijing supports all efforts toward achieving peace, but its limited involvement suggests the constraints on its diplomatic leverage in this situation.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce stricter immigration rules in response to voter discontent over high immigration levels. This shift comes as the right-wing Reform UK party gains traction by capitalizing on immigration issues. The new policies will restrict skilled visas to graduate-level jobs and limit lower-skilled visas to sectors crucial for industrial strategy, while also requiring businesses to increase training for British workers. These measures aim to regain control over immigration and address concerns about strained public services and ethnic tensions, signaling a departure from previous open-border policies.</p>

          <p>The BBC's use of AI to create a digital class taught by an AI-resurrected Agatha Christie has drawn criticism due to the author's well-documented aversion to public speaking and discussing her writing process.

While the content is respectful and informative, the use of AI is seen by some as a gimmick that detracts from Christie's legacy and could have been better served by a more traditional format, such as a one-woman play.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum faces a significant challenge as President Trump expresses his determination to use U.S. military force against Mexican drug cartels. While Sheinbaum has rejected the idea of U.S. troops on Mexican soil, Trump remains undeterred, raising concerns about potential unilateral U.S. strikes. Analysts suggest that Mexico's response to any such intervention would likely involve strong diplomatic protests and a temporary reduction in cooperation on issues like immigration and security, but a complete rupture in relations is unlikely due to Mexico's economic dependence on the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stance on transgender issues is emerging as a central theme in California's 2026 gubernatorial race. Candidates like Toni Atkins are vocally opposing Trump's policies, which include banning trans women from women's sports and restricting federal recognition of gender. With a significant LGBTQ+ population in California, support for LGBTQ+ rights is a major political force. While national polls show mixed opinions on transgender issues, California's Democratic candidates are expected to strongly advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, contrasting with the conservative positions.</p>

          <p>An L.A. resident has filed a lawsuit to prevent the transfer of elephants Billy and Tina from the Los Angeles Zoo to the Tulsa Zoo, advocating instead for their relocation to an animal sanctuary. The lawsuit, supported by a declaration from Cher, cites concerns over the elephants' living conditions and the potential for health issues related to captivity. Critics have long argued that the L.A. Zoo's enclosure is too small, leading to physical and mental distress for the elephants. The legal action intensifies a decades-long debate about the welfare of elephants in captivity.</p>

          <p>The decision by Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto to charge only two individuals out of nearly 350 arrested during pro-Palestinian protests at USC and UCLA has ignited controversy. Critics argue that this lack of prosecution may embolden future agitators and question whether the city attorney has shown bias. While Feldstein Soto cited insufficient evidence or university non-cooperation for most dismissals, others point to the violent attack on the UCLA encampment, where few assailants have faced accountability. This decision has frustrated campus officials, law enforcement leaders, and demonstrators on both sides of the issue.</p>

She emphasizes the importance of listening to one's body and challenging societal norms around exercise and food. Her approach focuses on functional fitness and compound movements, which she says are more valuable than machine lifting.</p>

          <p>To accelerate the rebuilding of fire-ravaged areas in Los Angeles, Congress should modify the tax code to address unique challenges faced by fire victims. Current tax laws incentivize residents to hold onto burned lots to avoid significant income taxes on insurance proceeds and property sales. Proposed reforms include exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance payouts and lot sales, and allowing buyers to defer income taxes on home sales if proceeds are reinvested in the fire areas. These changes would encourage both sellers and buyers, revitalizing affected communities and restoring the tax base.</p>

          <p>Two new studies on chimpanzees reveal key elements that may shed light on the origins of human language. Researchers found that chimps use rhythmic drumming patterns, with different populations using distinct structures akin to regional accents, and combine calls to create new meanings. These findings suggest that rhythmic structures and call combinations, both vital to human speech, were present in our evolutionary ancestors. The research also supports the idea that social interaction, such as gossip, may have driven the development of complex communication.</p>
