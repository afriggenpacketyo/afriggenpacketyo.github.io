            <p>A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press (AP) reporters and photographers from accessing the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other secure spaces. The ruling states that the White House's practice of blocking AP journalists since President Trump took office violates the First Amendment. This decision comes after the AP sued to regain its access, which was curtailed after the news agency continued to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by its original name, despite the President's preference for "Gulf of America."</p>

            <p>President Trump signed executive orders to reverse policies transitioning away from coal, aiming to boost America's "beautiful clean coal industry." These actions define coal as a "mineral," lift barriers to coal mining on federal lands, and prioritize coal leasing, ending an Obama-era moratorium. Trump asserts that these measures will help achieve affordable and reliable energy by slashing unnecessary regulations, using the Defense Production Act to turbocharge coal mining. Environmental groups criticize the move as a step backward, citing the harmful effects of coal combustion on air and water quality.</p>

Musk called Navarro a "moron" and "dumber than a sack of bricks," disputing Navarro's assessment of Tesla as merely a "car assembler." This feud highlights the internal disagreements within the Trump administration regarding trade policies, particularly as Tesla faces increased production costs due to tariffs on imported materials and parts.

            <p>Oren Cass, chief economist at American Compass, defends President Trump's tariffs as a necessary measure to reindustrialize the United States and support workers who have been left behind by globalization. He argues that economists have wrongly dismissed the importance of domestic manufacturing and that tariffs can incentivize domestic production. Cass acknowledges that tariffs may lead to short-term costs, such as higher prices for consumers, but believes the long-term benefits to the American economy outweigh these costs. He suggests that Americans are willing to pay more for goods made in the USA to support a stronger industrial base.</p>

            <p>A new study from UNLV suggests that type 2 diabetes can "rewire" the brain in ways similar to early-onset Alzheimer's disease, impacting memory and cognitive functions. Researchers found that high blood sugar levels may impair reward signals from the hippocampus to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), affecting decision-making and motivation. This could explain why people with diabetes find it challenging to stick to new diets and exercise regimens. Experts suggest that this knowledge can help individuals persevere with lifestyle changes, understanding that their difficulties are due to altered brain physiology rather than personal weakness.</p>

Moody's notes that companies are hesitant to make long-term supply chain investments amid such uncertainty, preferring to wait and see how other countries respond to the tariffs.

The order directs the Interior Department to facilitate coal leases and the Energy Department to research coal's use in powering AI data centers. However, experts argue that "clean coal" is a misnomer, as coal combustion inherently produces greenhouse gases and pollutants. Technologies to reduce emissions are not widely used, and the decline in coal usage has been a significant factor in reducing U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, with natural gas and renewables largely replacing coal-fired electricity.</p>

The market downturn, triggered by President Trump's sweeping tariff plan, has particularly affected Apple due to its reliance on China. Microsoft's market capitalization is now higher than Apple's. Both companies, along with Nvidia, were previously valued at over $3 trillion before the recent market sell-off. Analysts suggest Microsoft is more insulated from tariff uncertainty than other software companies.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to implement tariffs has faced criticism even from within MAGA circles, testing the faith of his most devoted followers. While some Trump loyalists dismiss concerns about the stock market decline, others, particularly those with significant financial losses, are struggling to reconcile the economic impact with their support for Trump. Some are blaming corrupt advisors for manipulating the President, while others attempt to rationalize the tariffs as a strategic move to eliminate trade barriers. The infighting and attempts to deflect blame highlight the challenges of defending Trump's policies even among his staunchest allies.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's air war against Yemen's Houthi rebels, dubbed Operation Rough Rider, lacks a clear strategy beyond a desire for "swift and unrelenting action." The bombing campaign, costing millions, is unlikely to achieve its goals without a ground offensive or diplomatic engagement with the Houthis' rivals. The Houthis, despite past setbacks, have consistently emerged stronger, and the air strikes risk solidifying their support base. A real solution would require a sustained effort to organize the Yemeni opposition and address the Houthis' growing influence in the region.</p>

Araghchi also clarified that the negotiations in Oman would be indirect, contrary to Trump's announcement of "direct talks." Trump had previously warned that Iran would face "great danger" if the discussions proved unsuccessful. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's escalating trade tensions with China could jeopardize Hollywood's access to the Chinese film market. As the U.S. and China engage in a trade war, a ban on Hollywood movies is being considered, which would significantly impact major entertainment companies. U.S. studios have already been struggling to maintain traction in China, as the country prioritizes its own productions. Experts predict a dramatic slowdown for Hollywood in China, even if a complete ban is not implemented. The film industry is being hammered along with the rest of the market, since Trump unveiled the tariffs during his “Liberation Day” speech.</p>

The White House press secretary dismissed the feud as "boys will be boys." Musk has previously expressed his hope for a zero-tariff policy between the U.S. and Europe.</p>

            <p>GOP Rep. Don Bacon is garnering support for a bill to restore more control of tariffs to Congress after President Trump's new tariffs sparked economic and political unrest. Bacon argues that the Constitution grants Congress the power over tariffs and taxes. The bill is companion legislation to a Senate measure that would require the president to provide Congress with 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The legislation faces an uphill battle in the House, but Bacon believes it could gain traction if the stock market declines or inflation and unemployment worsen.</p>

            <p>New Mexico has created a "turquoise alert" system for missing Indigenous Americans, becoming the fourth state to do so. The act, signed by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, aims to address the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people, particularly women and girls. The turquoise alert will function similarly to Amber or silver alerts, sending notifications to cellphones when a Native American is reported missing. Indigenous American and Alaska Native communities experience higher rates of violence, but cases of missing persons are often underreported.</p>

The outbreak is attributed to slipping vaccination rates in West Texas and the spread of misinformation about vaccines. Public health officials are employing traditional strategies like identifying cases, isolating patients, and contact tracing, but vaccine hesitancy is hindering efforts. Conflicting messaging from the Secretary of Health and Human Services and proposed funding cuts are further complicating the response.</p>
