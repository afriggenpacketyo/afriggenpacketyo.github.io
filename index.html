          <p>Following Israeli missile strikes on Iran, airlines worldwide canceled flights to Israel and rerouted flights to avoid the Middle East airspace. Delta Air Lines suspended its service to Tel Aviv through August 31, and United Airlines halted its Tel Aviv services through at least Saturday. Israeli airline El Al also suspended service, advising customers to avoid Ben Gurion Airport and recommending those abroad to arrange accommodation until security directives change. These disruptions highlight the immediate impact of geopolitical tensions on global air travel and passenger safety.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes, Iranian state television announced that Iran would not participate in the scheduled sixth round of nuclear negotiations with the United States. The talks were expected to occur in Muscat, Oman, but were suspended until further notice. Two Iranian news agencies reported explosions near the Fordo nuclear enrichment site, and air defense systems were activated in Tehran. U.S. President Trump urged Tehran to reach a nuclear deal before further escalation, while Israel stated its offensive targeted Iran's nuclear program, and the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard was reportedly killed in the attacks. Optimism about a peaceful resolution is dwindling as tensions escalate in the region.</p>

          <p>Gregg Jarrett argues that President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles is justified, despite a judge siding with California Governor Newsom over control of the Guard. Jarrett contends that Trump acted to save lives and property as Newsom failed to quell mob assaults on ICE officers. He cites a special statute granting the president extraordinary powers to subdue civil disorder against federal law enforcement. Jarrett criticizes Democrats for defending lawlessness and prioritizing sanctuary for illegals over the safety of citizens and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Israel initiated a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, followed by Iran launching over 100 drones at Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated the goal was to diminish the Iranian threat to Israel's survival, while Iranian President Pezeshkian vowed strong action against Israel. NATO Secretary-General Rutte urged de-escalation, but tensions remain high with potential for a wider conflict involving U.S. interests and regional actors like the Houthis in Yemen.

          <p>The CDC projects that the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, previously linked to a surge in hospitalizations in Asia, could account for more than one in three cases across the United States. The variant was detected in international travelers arriving in the U.S. last month, and now represents nearly half of the COVID infections detected in the CDC's airport surveillance program. Experts note that while NB.1.8.1 appears more transmissible, it does not lead to more severe illness compared to previous variants, and the Trump administration has recently made moves to change access to vaccines for some Americans.</p>

Judge Casper granted a preliminary injunction sought by 19 state attorneys general, finding that the states were likely to succeed in their case. The decision prevents the administration from requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form and from directing the Secretary of Defense to update absentee voting applications for military members and overseas voters.

          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded significantly in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns about tariffs and inflation softened, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, a 15.9% increase from the previous month, with improvements in both current conditions and future expectations. This shift coincided with a less aggressive stance on tariffs from President Trump, leading to a reduced outlook for near-term inflation. Despite these improvements, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, reflecting ongoing worries about the economic impact of trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) developed a "Minimal Quality of Life Index" that factors in essentials like food and shelter, as well as leisure costs and savings for education. The analysis reveals that the bottom 60% of households by income fall short of this standard, largely due to wages failing to keep pace with rising costs. Medical premiums, travel expenses, and rent have significantly increased, leading to a decrease in consumers' real spending power. (not investment advice)</p>
