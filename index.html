        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CBS, Donald Trump has approved plans for a potential attack on Iran but has not yet made a final decision. The decision to hold off on the strikes hinges on whether Iran agrees to abandon its nuclear program, according to a senior intelligence source. Trump is said to be considering a strike on Fordo, an underground uranium enrichment facility. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected Trump's demand for unconditional surrender, leading Trump to say his patience had run out, with Israel also launching attacks on Iranian missile sites and nuclear facilities, prompting Iran to respond with hypersonic missiles. The situation remains tense as Trump weighs his options and Iran asserts its refusal to negotiate under duress. Optimism remains relatively low given the potential for further escalation. </p>

          <p>Karen Read, acquitted in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston cop John O'Keefe, expressed gratitude to her legal team and supporters after the verdict. Her father credited the legal team, composed of lawyers from Boston, New York, and Los Angeles, for securing the not guilty verdict. The defense team included David Yannetti, Alan Jackson, Liza Little, and Robert Alessi. Experts predict the lawyers will see a boost in their careers, potentially representing celebrities and handling high-profile cases.

          <p>China's ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, has called on the US to consider the overall trade relationship between the two countries, stating that tariffs on Chinese imports are "unreasonably high." Xie argued that the US goods deficit would not shrink as long as export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms remain in place. He emphasized China's willingness to buy more from the US but noted restrictions on the export of competitive US products like semiconductors. Earlier in the month, the US agreed to ease some restrictions in exchange for increased exports of critical minerals from China, showing signs of potential de-escalation in trade tensions. Despite the ongoing trade disputes, the willingness to negotiate offers a glimmer of hope for improved economic relations.</p>

          <p>Opal Lee, known as "The Grandmother of Juneteenth," will not participate in this year's Walk for Freedom due to a recent hospitalization. The 98-year-old was hospitalized while traveling to receive an award in Ohio in May, marking the first time she has missed the event since it began in 2016. While she may still participate in a vehicle, her granddaughter, Dione Sims, will lead the 2.5-mile walk in her place. Lee previously expressed gratitude for the support she received after being hospitalized, with the event commemorating the 160th anniversary of Juneteenth.

Founded in 1925, Dongchoon once thrived during the golden age of South Korean circuses in the 1960s, but later faced declining audiences due to the rise of television and other forms of entertainment. Park Sae-hwan, the head of the circus, expressed his determination to keep Dongchoon alive, fearing that the country's circus arts would disappear without it. Today, Dongchoon continues to perform acrobatic shows at a seaside tourist area in Ansan, drawing both older and younger generations, with plans to build a circus school to nurture South Korean circus artists.</p>

The Metro dubs it "ArmageDon," while the Guardian reports Trump "keeps world waiting." The Financial Times highlights the US's capacity to destroy Iran's underground nuclear sites, and the Times says the UK is weighing military support for the US. The Daily Telegraph reports that the Attorney General warned Sir Keir Starmer that UK involvement in a US strike on Iran "could be illegal."

Sanders, the son of Hall of Fame player Deion Sanders, was stopped by the Strongsville Police Department and could face a $250 fine. Drafted in the fifth round of the NFL draft, Sanders is competing against three other quarterbacks to become the Browns' starter for the 2025 season.

          <p>The US government will resume issuing international student visas but will require applicants to make their social media accounts public for thorough screening. This move follows a halt on interviews for "F" visas (academic students), "M" visas (vocational students), and "J" visas (cultural exchanges) by the Trump administration in May. Prospective students will be vetted for "hostile attitudes" towards US citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the US imposes duties on various goods, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty costs. This legal practice involves altering an item's materials or dimensions to fit into a different product classification code. For example, some manufacturers are bundling steel and aluminum elements into final products to qualify for lower duties under Section 232. Companies must balance redesigning products with avoiding fraudulent misrepresentation of product classifications, as illustrated by Ford's case of misclassifying cargo vans. This strategic design approach can significantly reduce duty liability. (not investment advice)</p>
