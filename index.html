          <p>Tanya Gold's New York Times article describes attending a Reform UK rally in Birmingham, highlighting the party's attempt to capitalize on British discontent with the Labour government's struggles to improve public services and the economy. The rally featured theatrics like garbage cans and a fake pub to symbolize grievances, with Nigel Farage arriving on a digger. Reform UK, born from the Brexit Party, aims to channel public outrage, but its chaotic nature and lack of clear solutions raise questions about its viability. The article also notes the influence of MAGA on the party, with Farage pledging to implement a British version of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced that employees, including some previously approved for remote work, must return to the office three days a week starting in June, citing the benefits of in-person collaboration and creativity. The company is also scaling back remote hiring. In addition, Uber has increased the eligibility requirement for its one-month paid sabbatical program from five to eight years of employment. These changes come as Uber seeks to cut costs and improve performance in response to investor pressure, aligning with a broader trend in the tech industry. Last year, Khosrowshahi attributed the loss of loyal customers to remote work.</p>

          <p>HSBC's first-quarter results surpassed estimates, driven by strong performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, expected to be completed before the 2025 interim results. While profit before tax declined 25% year-on-year, it soared nearly 317% from the previous quarter. CEO Georges Elhedery acknowledged macroeconomic uncertainties and highlighted the adverse effects of protectionist trade policies on consumer and business sentiment. The bank aims to save $1.5 billion in costs by the end of 2026 through a restructuring plan announced last October.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured a victory in Canada's federal election, largely attributed to a backlash against Donald Trump's tariff threats and comments about making Canada the 51st state. Carney, who became Prime Minister after Justin Trudeau's resignation, successfully framed the election as a fight for Canada's economic survival and sovereignty. The Liberals may form a minority government, requiring them to negotiate with other parties to pass legislation. Carney intends to prioritize navigating the relationship with the US and securing Canada's economy against American tariff headwinds, including a promised tax cut for the middle class.</p>

          <p>DW reports on the Canadian election, noting that Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal party secured a win, although it was unclear if they would achieve a majority. Donald Trump's statements about making Canada the US's 51st state played a significant role in the campaign. Carney's Liberals, initially struggling, regained popularity due to Trump's threats against Canada's sovereignty and economy. The election outcome represents a setback for Trump, who consistently criticized the Liberals under Trudeau. The article highlights that many Canadians responded to Trump's approach by boycotting US goods and canceling vacations.</p>

          <p>Anthony Zurcher of the BBC analyzes the Canadian election, arguing that Donald Trump's actions inadvertently contributed to the Liberal victory. Trump's constant badgering of Canada and suggestions of annexation led to a reversal of fortune for the Liberal Party. While the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, initially held a strong position, Trump's rhetoric allowed the Liberals to rally support by portraying Trump as a threat to Canada's sovereignty. The irony is that Trump's approach may have prevented a Conservative victory, which would have aligned Canada more closely with his populist conservative priorities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, giving automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, they will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs. Automakers will be reimbursed for some tariff costs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of a new car's value in the first year, phased out over two years. Despite these changes, substantial tariffs will remain, raising prices for new and used cars. General Motors CEO Mary T. Barra welcomed the change.</p>

          <p>A factory in Vietnam is preparing for the worst as Donald Trump threatens a 46% trade tariff on Vietnamese goods. Workers at Dony Garment are working overtime to fulfill orders before any potential tariff implementation. The company began diversifying its market in 2021 to reduce reliance on the US, now exporting only 20% of its garments to America. While some businesses are vulnerable, others are cautiously optimistic, believing Vietnam can negotiate and grow despite the looming threat. Analysts suggest that tariffs above 10-20% would be intensely challenging for Vietnam.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed three executive orders targeting local jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, known as "sanctuary cities." One order directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to publish a list of these jurisdictions and pursue legal action against them. Another order aims to provide legal resources to police officers accused of wrongdoing and supply military equipment to local law enforcement. The administration accuses sanctuary cities of obstructing immigration officials and allowing criminals to go free. Critics argue that these actions are inhumane and unpopular with the American people.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is projected to win the federal election for the fourth consecutive time. The victory is attributed to a turnaround sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats and comments about annexing Canada. The Liberals are leading with 161 seats in Parliament, while the Conservative Party holds 150. The election was framed as a response to Trump's actions, which infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in nationalism. Carney has promised to allocate counter-tariff revenue to support Canadian workers affected by the trade war.</p>
