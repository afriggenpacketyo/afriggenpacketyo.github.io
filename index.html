          <p>A mines developer reports that producers of tungsten products in developed nations are panicking because China, which accounts for 82.7% of global raw tungsten ore mined last year, has restricted exports of critical industrial metals. The restrictions came as retaliation against Washington‚Äôs decision to raise duties on all Chinese imports by 10 per cent. The CEO of Almonty Industries says that US defense contractors face a looming supply chain challenge, as they must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. Tungsten is used to make cutting tools, drill bits, heavy machinery parts, ammunition, and armour, and also in clean energy applications.</p>

          <p>President Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, via email. Hayden's term was set to expire next year, and her firing has sparked outrage among congressional Democrats.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the firing a disgrace and an assault on the American way of life, while Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro demanded an explanation from the administration.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James' town hall was briefly disrupted by a Trump supporter who challenged her to apologize to the president.

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures have failed to cheer its stock market as worries over economic deterioration outweigh policy optimism, with investors focused on trade talks with the U.S. The stimulus package included interest rate cuts and a major liquidity injection, but the benchmark index barely budged. Analysts say markets had largely priced in the policies ahead of the briefing, coupled with concerns over the ongoing trade war hurting the world's second-largest economy. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures that directly boost consumer sentiment and more effective plans to prop up the real estate sector.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mechanical engineering student at the University of Alabama has decided to self-deport after being detained by immigration officials for six weeks. Alireza Doroudi's visa was revoked in June 2023, and despite the government dropping a charge behind his initial arrest, he chose to give up rather than continue to fight deportation. His lawyer accused authorities of denying his client due process and forcing him to choose between indefinite detention and self-deporting. Doroudi stated that he followed all the legal paths and did not cause any trouble in the country.</p>

While the judge praised the video's message, the use of AI in legal proceedings has sparked debate, with critics raising concerns about manipulation and deception. The defense lawyer suggested that the court's reliance on the AI video could constitute reversible error and require a resentencing.</p>

          <p>A federal class-action lawsuit accuses UCLA's medical school of using race as a factor in admissions, despite state law and Supreme Court rulings prohibiting affirmative action. The lawsuit, brought by activist groups, alleges that the medical school requires applicants to submit responses that reveal their race and that admissions committee members openly discuss race as a factor in decisions. The lawsuit comes as UCLA faces scrutiny by the Trump administration for potential ‚Äúillegal DEI‚Äù in admissions practices. The lawsuit alleges that UCLA routinely admits Black applicants with below-average scores, while requiring whites and Asians to have near-perfect scores.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain that will increase market access for American farm exports. In return, the US will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars per year with a 10% tariff and remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The agreement leaves in place a 10% baseline tariff on almost all countries, but is seen as a potential model for future trade deals. The deal with Britain is one of 17 that the Trump administration has been trying to strike with major trading partners.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's response to pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupying the main library has been markedly different from a similar incident a year prior, with campus security intervening aggressively and making arrests. The university's newly assertive approach has satisfied critics, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force. However, the forceful response has also disturbed those who believe unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force. The demonstrators vandalized the library with graffiti. Columbia is moving the judicial board that oversees protest discipline from the supervision of the university senate to the provost‚Äôs office.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the sprawling fiscal package, proposing a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million per year. Income above that level would be taxed at a rate of 39.6 percent, reversing a previous tax cut. This move has alarmed Republicans who generally favor tax cuts. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes with a populist flavor, including raising a tax on stock buybacks and further limiting companies‚Äô abilities to deduct compensation for highly paid employees.</p>

For many in Memphis, a city of more than 600,000 where more than a third of Tennessee‚Äôs Black residents live, the acquittal was a wrenching outcome that contradicted what they saw on video.</p>
