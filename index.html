          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer being considered for the role of Federal Reserve chair, as Bessent wishes to remain in his current position. Trump mentioned he has a list of four other potential candidates for the central bank's top job, including former Governor Kevin Warsh and NEC Director Kevin Hassett. This development comes as the White House continues to advocate for the Fed to implement lower interest rates, a key policy point for the administration. Current Chair Jerome Powell's term is set to expire in May 2026.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America rejected him as a customer, forcing him to use smaller banks. He asserted that JPMorgan gave him 20 days to move hundreds of millions of dollars and that Bank of America subsequently denied his request to open an account. This revives the ongoing debate about "de-banking," where conservatives and other groups allege they are unfairly denied financial services for political reasons. The Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to investigate and potentially penalize banks for dropping customers on political grounds.</p>

          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has made a public appeal for people to donate unwanted small pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as horses, to be used as food for its predators. The zoo defends the controversial practice by stating it has a responsibility to imitate the animals' natural food chain with "whole prey." The animals are euthanized by trained staff before being used as fodder. This policy is not new in Denmark; in 2014, the Copenhagen Zoo faced international criticism for killing a healthy young giraffe and feeding it to lions in front of visitors.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that deaths from obesity-related cancers in the U.S. have more than tripled over the past two decades, rising to over 13.5 million. The research, which analyzed CDC data from 1999 to 2020, identified older adults, females, and racial minorities as being at higher risk. Obesity is linked to 13 types of cancer, and experts are calling the trend a crisis that requires urgent public health strategies, such as improved screening and access to care. The findings underscore the severe health consequences of the nation's rising obesity rates.</p>

          <p>As Texas Democrats flee the state to block a redistricting bill, Donald Trump has voiced his support for the Republican effort, claiming the GOP is "entitled to five more seats." He argued that states like California and Illinois are gerrymandered in favor of Democrats and that the Texas plan is a necessary countermeasure. His comments add national political weight to the state-level showdown, framing it as part of a larger partisan battle for control of the U.S. House ahead of the midterm elections. The standoff continues as it is unclear if the Texas House can legally convene.</p>

The move comes as Netanyahu reaffirms his goals of defeating Hamas and securing the release of hostages. However, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has strongly criticized the potential plan, warning it would lead to an "endless war" with immense casualties for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

The U.S. has a substantial trade deficit with Switzerland, a major hub for gold refining and pharmaceuticals, which are currently exempt.

The images reveal a plane with a slim fuselage and lambda-wing design, suggesting it could be a third distinct sixth-generation fighter or possibly an uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft. Its streamlined shape, which lacks some features of piloted fighters, has led some to believe it is a drone optimized for stealth over maneuverability. The development points to China's continued advancement in next-generation military aviation technology.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. The Democrats' departure broke the legislative quorum, halting proceedings on a bill that would create five new GOP-leaning congressional districts. In response, the Republican House Speaker issued arrest warrants to compel their return. This dramatic escalation intensifies the political standoff, with Democrats arguing they are using a constitutionally permitted tool to protect voting rights, while Republicans accuse them of dereliction of duty.</p>

          <p>A new Microsoft report analyzing user interactions with its AI chatbot has identified the jobs with the highest exposure to being automated. Interpreters and translators top the list, with 98% of their work activities overlapping with AI capabilities, followed by writers, historians, and various customer service roles. The research highlights that tasks involving information gathering and writing are most commonly assisted or performed by AI. In contrast, jobs requiring physical, hands-on work, such as in the medical and trade fields, were found to be the most insulated from AI disruption.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi is reportedly directing prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury to investigate the origins of the FBI's 2016 Trump-Russia inquiry. This criminal probe stems from referrals by Trump administration intelligence officials and targets the initial investigation that concluded Moscow interfered in the election. The move is likely to intensify concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department, as it revisits a deeply divisive chapter in American politics and aligns with Trump's long-held grievances against the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>A Legionnaire's disease outbreak in the Harlem area of New York City has led to two deaths and at least 58 reported illnesses. Health officials have been tracking the outbreak since late July and have identified and remediated eleven cooling towers that tested positive for the legionella bacteria. The disease, a type of pneumonia, is contracted by breathing in contaminated water vapor and is not spread person-to-person. Officials are urging anyone in the area with flu-like symptoms to seek medical care, as the disease is treatable with antibiotics if diagnosed early.</p>

          <p>As Japan marks the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the number of living survivors, known as "hibakusha," continues to decline, with their average age now over 86.

Organizations and individuals, including the 12-year-old great-grandson of a survivor, are actively working to convey the horrors of nuclear weapons to a global audience and promote a message of peace.</p>

          <p>Contrary to common assumptions, a new Gallup report reveals that Gen Z employees are the least likely to favor working exclusively from home. Only 23% of Gen Z workers prefer a fully remote setup, compared to 35% of millennials, Gen X, and baby boomers. The report suggests this preference stems from a desire for in-person connection, mentorship, and a clearer understanding of their role within the organization, all of which can be more challenging in a remote environment. Consequently, 71% of Gen Z employees favor a hybrid work model, the highest of any generation.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is warning of a severe and looming hunger crisis in northern Nigeria, describing the situation as "unprecedented." An estimated 31 million people in the country face acute food insecurity, with at least 5 million children already suffering from malnutrition. The crisis is driven by a combination of protracted insecurity from jihadist groups like Boko Haram, which prevents farming, and a critical shortfall in international aid funding. Aid agencies report their food stocks are exhausted, threatening to undo years of humanitarian progress in the region.</p>

For Russia, isolated by the West, reviving RIC offers a platform to demonstrate it still has powerful partners and to balance its growing dependency on China. For China, it could help stabilize its continental flank amid tensions with India, while New Delhi walks a fine line, managing its strategic autonomy. The analysis questions whether these three powers can genuinely cooperate to ensure Asian stability or if it is merely strategic posturing.</p>

The author contends that the panel overstated risks and ignored robust data supporting the safety and necessity of these medications for treating severe maternal mental health conditions. Untreated depression and anxiety pose real dangers to both mother and baby, including preterm birth and maternal death. The article calls for evidence-based guidance over fear-mongering to ensure patients receive proper care.</p>
