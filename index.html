          <p>Zhou Zhongpeng, a former Peking University doctoral student, has reportedly cracked Shinichi Mochizuki’s Inter-universal Teichmueller Theory (IUT), a complex mathematical framework that has baffled experts since 2012. Zhou's breakthrough, achieved while working as an algorithm engineer, could transform the ABC conjecture from a conceptual abstraction into a computationally usable tool. Professor Ivan Fesenko, a leading IUT authority, claims Zhou's results surpass Andrew Wiles’ famed 1995 proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem in scope. This development revives Mochizuki's controversial theory and could have significant implications for number theory, marking a major achievement for Zhou.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political philosopher Erica Benner challenges the popular view of Niccolò Machiavelli as a proponent of ruthless pragmatism, arguing that his famous work, *The Prince*, is actually a satirical critique of authoritarian power. Benner suggests Machiavelli was deeply republican, believing in shared power and representative government, as evidenced in his *Discourses on Livy*. She argues that Machiavelli sought to expose the ways of tyrants and believed in a human morality based on studying human nature rather than abstract ideals. Benner also claims that Machiavelli's insights into the dangers of inequality and partisanship remain relevant to contemporary politics.</p>

This response follows an incident where the Montgomery County Detention Center failed to honor an immigration detainer for an MS-13 member, an error acknowledged by the county's Department of Correction and Rehabilitation Director.

Despite announcing plans to transition to a public-benefit corporation, resistance from figures like Elon Musk and concerns from regulators have led OpenAI to maintain nonprofit control. Critics worry that the pursuit of industry dominance could overshadow the ethical considerations necessary for developing safe and beneficial AI.

          <p>India's economy grew at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, despite global economic uncertainty. This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance in the fiscal year 2025, with the full fiscal year expanding by 6.5%. Robust domestic consumption and a lower dependence on exports have helped cushion India from the impact of U.S. trade policies. The U.S. recently imposed tariffs on goods imported from India, but these were later reduced to allow for deal negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research has detected Pfas, or "forever chemicals," in nearly all of 23 sampled US beers, raising safety concerns about this popular beverage. The study found a strong correlation between Pfas levels in beer and the local water supply, suggesting contaminated water is a primary source. Levels of Pfas in some beers exceeded drinking water limits, particularly in areas affected by firefighting foam or chemical plant pollution. The researchers recommend brewers use filtration systems to reduce Pfas levels and advise consumers to check Pfas levels in their beer's bottling location.</p>

          <p>Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee for governor of Virginia, is attempting to distance herself from her hardline anti-abortion record, declining to state whether she would support any restrictions on abortion access if elected. Her past statements reveal staunch opposition to abortion, including support for a 15-week ban and claims that abortion is "genocide." This shift in tone comes as polling shows her trailing the Democratic nominee, Abigail Spanberger, and as some GOP strategists cite concerns about her campaign's traction. Earle-Sears has also faced criticism for comments connecting slavery to diversity programs.</p>

However, new data has emerged suggesting that the expansion rate of the universe may differ from previous calculations, creating what is known as the Hubble tension.
