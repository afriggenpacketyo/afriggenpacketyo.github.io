          <p>Uber is requiring employees, including those previously approved for remote work, to return to the office three days a week starting in June, citing the benefits of in-office collaboration for creativity and speed. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi emphasized the need for employees to push themselves to achieve greatness as the company enters its next chapter. The policy change includes adjustments to the sabbatical program, increasing eligibility from five to eight years of tenure. This decision reflects a broader trend among tech companies to cut costs and encourage in-person work, following similar moves by Google, and it comes after Khosrowshahi previously linked remote work to a loss of loyal customers.

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump administration has reached a trade deal with an unnamed country, pending approval from its prime minister and parliament. While Lutnick declined to disclose the country, he clarified that China negotiations are managed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This announcement follows the recent implementation of widespread tariff hikes, many of which have been paused for 90 days, excluding those on China. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs has caused market volatility and declining business confidence, making this trade deal a closely watched development on Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines Ukrainian reactions to President Trump's peace plan, which reportedly involves recognizing Russia's control over Crimea and occupied territories, while promising Ukraine security guarantees and potential EU membership but barring NATO accession. Many Ukrainians reject these terms, with officials like Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko stating Ukraine is ready for negotiations but not surrender. Experts like Serhii Kuzan argue Ukraine's situation is better than perceived, citing tactical successes and growing arms industry, while Hanna Shelest believes Trump receives a skewed view of the conflict from his envoy. Despite differing opinions, there is consensus that legally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory is unacceptable, and Klitschko indicated Zelenskyy may be forced to make a painful decision.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article details how a Super Bowl commercial featuring NYU Langone Health doctors caught the attention of a North Carolina congressman, who initially criticized the hospital's spending of federal funds. Representative Greg Murphy sent a stern letter to NYU Langone's CEO, questioning the advertisement's cost. However, eight days later, Murphy wrote a follow-up letter expressing admiration for the hospital's patient outcomes and metrics. The shift in tone occurred after a private jet, linked to NYU Langone's billionaire benefactor Kenneth G. Langone, visited Murphy's hometown, raising questions about the congressman's change of heart.</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) is reviewing its transgender policy following protests and concerns over fairness and safety in women's football. The current policy allows biological males to participate in the women's game if they meet reduced testosterone levels and pass a match observation to assess risk. However, a new formal process will give the FA the ability to remove or refuse a player's permission to play in the women's game on a case-by-case basis. The FA says there are 20 transgender women registered to play amateur football in England, and none in the professional game across the Home Nations.</p>
