          <p>In Arizona, Stacey Wales used artificial intelligence to create a likeness of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, who was killed in a 2021 road rage incident, for his victim impact statement during the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas. The AI-generated avatar delivered a message of forgiveness, which Judge Todd Lang praised. While innovative, the use of AI in legal proceedings raises concerns about manipulation and deception. Defense lawyer Jason D. Lamm suggested that the court's reliance on the AI video could be grounds for appeal, while Brooklyn Law School professor Cynthia Godsoe voiced concern over the potential for emotional manipulation and alteration of evidence using AI. The NY Times article states that a New York appellate court rejected a lawyer's attempt to use an AI avatar to present an argument.</p>

          <p>President Trump has terminated Carla Hayden's position as Librarian of Congress via email, a move criticized by Democratic leaders. Hayden, who had served since 2016, was the first woman and African American to hold the position. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the firing as an effort to ban books and whitewash American history. Representative Joe Morelle called the decision ignorant and a threat to America's libraries and copyrighted economic interests. In a 2020 interview, Hayden noted the significance of a person of color leading the world's largest library, given the historical prohibition of literacy for people of color.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., replacing Ed Martin after Senator Thom Tillis opposed Martin's confirmation. Pirro, a former New York prosecutor and close ally of Trump, has been a vocal supporter of his election claims, even facing legal action for false statements. Martin will now serve as director of the "weaponization working group," investigating officials who investigated Trump.

          <p>President Trump's new trade pact with the UK, while hailed as a "breakthrough", is being analyzed for its actual benefits to America. The agreement retains the 10% import tax on most UK goods, while the US agreed to reduce import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the White House said it had won changes that would expand opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol and other agricultural products in the UK. Some analysts believe the changes are marginal and the benefits are limited, while others highlight the political victory it provides for Trump. American carmakers are expressing concerns that the plans made UK-cars less expensive to import than many of the models made by their companies, which have operations in Mexico and Canada.</p>

While many details are still being worked out, this deal may provide hints for other countries negotiating with the Trump administration.

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump wants to create a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This would roll back a tax cut from 2017. Republicans are also considering raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting compensation deductions for highly paid employees. The move aims to offset spending cuts on Medicaid and gain working-class support.</p>

          <p>India is considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a shift from its protectionist stance. This move comes after the Trump administration's announcement of tariffs on Indian exports.

          <p>Alex Ross Perry's new film, ‚ÄúPavements,‚Äù explores the legacy of the indie-rock band Pavement through a combination of documentary footage, a staged musical, an art gallery, and a biopic parody. The film examines the band's cult following and impact on a generation, despite their lack of mainstream success. Perry uses these varied formats to capture the band's essence and challenge conventional storytelling methods. The behind-the-scenes clips of the Pavement musical are the most delightful in the movie, just for the counterintuitive thrill of watching theater kids sing and dance through a catalog that would seem to defy their essential earnestness.</p>

Revenue exceeded expectations, but earnings per share fell short of estimates. The company's comparable store sales growth slowed to 3.5% in the first quarter, driven by traffic and average check increases. However, early trends in the second quarter show comparable sales increasing by 5%, exceeding consensus estimates, but the increased full year commodity cost inflation outlook shouldn't be ignored either.</p>

A Gaelic Players Association survey showed that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts.</p>

          <p>The acquittal of three former police officers in the state trial over the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols adds to a mixed series of verdicts for officers accused of wrongdoing. Defense tactics, including deflecting blame and emphasizing the dangers of policing, likely factored into the unanimous acquittal. The killing of Mr. Nichols is one the highest profile cases that prosecutors have brought against police officers in the five years since the murder of George Floyd. The state jury was predominantly white. The three officers were found guilty of witness tampering in a separate federal trial last fall, and Mr. Haley was found guilty on a lesser charge of violating Mr. Nichols‚Äôs civil rights by causing bodily injury.</p>
