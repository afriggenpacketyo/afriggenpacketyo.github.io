          <p>Ryanair is demanding that some flight attendants in Spain repay salary increases received between October and March, following a legal dispute with the Union Sindical Obrera (USO). The pay rise had been agreed with another union, CCOO, but USO successfully nullified the deal in court. Ryanair claims the affected flight attendants were "overpaid" and plans to deduct the money from their payslips. USO is exploring legal solutions, while Ryanair declined to comment on the number of affected employees or the consequences of non-payment.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric car battery maker, restricted U.S. onshore investors from participating in its Hong Kong stock listing due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. This move highlights the deepening financial decoupling between the two nations, as CATL has faced sanctions and political scrutiny in the U.S. despite supplying batteries to major automakers like GM and Tesla. The company aims to use the funds raised to expand its operations in Europe. Concerns are rising that this could be the beginning of a trend where American investors are shut out of potentially profitable opportunities.</p>

          <p>Authorities are still searching for six of the ten men who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans. One additional escapee was captured, leaving six still at large. Officials, including Orleans parish sheriff Susan Hutson, have cited faulty locks, cell doors, and staffing shortages as contributing factors to the breakout. Hutson is facing calls for her resignation amid investigations into the security lapses. There are also indications that the escapees may have had help from inside the jail.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call between President Trump and President Putin, many Ukrainians feel that Trump is stepping back from trying to end the war. Many Ukrainians feel they have little choice but to continue battling on. Some Ukrainians expressed exhaustion but stated they must continue to fight, with one Ukrainian stating that America and Russia are playing a "dirty and bloody game." Others expressed a desire for the war to end but a lack of expectation of any change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has sparked debate about the stability of renewable energy sources. While the investigation is ongoing, some have blamed Spain's reliance on renewables. Experts suggest that the blackout highlights grid stability issues more than problems with renewable energy sources. Solutions include improving grid connections, better battery storage, and implementing technologies like virtual inertia. Investment in grids needs to double to support the transition to renewable energy.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson faces a challenge in passing President Trump's budget bill due to disagreements among House Republicans. Factions such as deficit hawks, swing-district survivors, clean-energy advocates, and state-tax deductors have conflicting demands. Deficit hawks oppose the bill's increased deficit, while swing-district members want to protect Medicaid. Clean-energy advocates aim to preserve tax breaks, and state-tax deductors seek a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. The bill's future is uncertain as it heads to the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration sought to acquire a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar for use as Air Force One, raising ethical and practical concerns. The effort involved weeks of secret coordination, with Trump's Middle East envoy playing a key role. The plan, initially discussed as a purchase, morphed into a proposed gift from Qatar. Questions linger about the financial implications, ethical issues, and the feasibility of retrofitting the plane in time for Trump's use. Critics argue the arrangement could be seen as an attempt to curry favor with the administration.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs. The company is working with suppliers and diversifying its import sources to mitigate the impact. More than half of Home Depot's products are domestically produced, and the company aims to reduce reliance on any single country outside the U.S. to less than 10% of purchases within a year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's warning about potential price increases due to tariffs.</p>

Walmart and Mattel have also indicated they will have to raise prices. While some companies have been stockpiling goods, they will eventually need to pass the tariff costs onto consumers.</p>

Wu Hailong, president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, said Trump's global tariff war has worsened conflicts with allies, shaking transatlantic ties. He suggested that US allies may be weighing fresh options due to Trump's accusations that allies were exploiting US economic and military advantages, pledges to annex Canada and buy Greenland , and sidelining of Europe in talks with Russia over the Ukraine war.</p>
