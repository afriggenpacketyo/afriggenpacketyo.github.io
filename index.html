          <p>Several New York elected officials, including the city comptroller, were among dozens arrested during a protest at a federal building in Manhattan. The demonstrators were attempting to block access for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicles and inspect the conditions of a detainee holding facility. The protest highlights ongoing tensions between local officials in the sanctuary city and federal immigration authorities over the treatment of immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security described the protest as a "stunt" that endangered personnel and detainees.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, marking its lowest point since November 2024 and the third straight month of decline. The drop was partly driven by a significant easing in the surge of rice prices, although they remain at historically high levels. This data comes as the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy rate, though some analysts predict a rate hike in the near future. The figures provide a key indicator of the country's economic state amid global trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small cookie shop in Los Angeles is struggling with rising operational costs attributed to President Trump's tariffs on imported ingredients. The owner reports paying thousands of dollars more per month for premium supplies from countries like France and Japan, but has so far avoided raising prices for customers. This case highlights the broader economic pressure that tariffs are placing on small businesses, which often lack the resources to absorb such significant cost increases. Legal challenges to the tariffs are currently awaiting a Supreme Court hearing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Late-night host Stephen Colbert strongly defended his counterpart Jimmy Kimmel, whose show was suspended by ABC following controversial remarks. Colbert dedicated his show to the topic, labeling the suspension "blatant censorship" and calling President Trump an "autocrat" for his role in pressuring media networks. The segment also featured comments from David Letterman, who criticized ABC's move as capitulating to an "authoritarian criminal administration." The event has intensified the public debate over free speech and the influence of the executive branch on media corporations.</p>

A 500-meter security perimeter was established, affecting residents, embassies, and city offices, with emergency shelters set up to house those displaced. Bomb disposal experts are scheduled to defuse the device, which was discovered during construction work, a common occurrence in German cities. The operation required the temporary suspension of subway services, street closures, and river traffic.</p>

          <p>Longtime Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement at the end of the current season after an 18-year career.

          <p>Forestry experts in the United Kingdom are predicting a particularly spectacular display of autumn leaves this year due to the warm and sunny summer weather. The favorable conditions allowed trees to produce higher levels of sugar in their leaves, which leads to the creation of brighter red, orange, and gold pigments. While some trees experienced a "false autumn" and shed leaves early due to drought stress, recent rainfall has prompted some regrowth. The vibrant seasonal display is anticipated to begin in mid-September and last well into November across the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that television networks covering him negatively should potentially have their broadcast licenses revoked. The comments came a day after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's show, a move the president praised while also calling for the removal of other late-night hosts. The president incorrectly claimed that the FCC licenses networks directly; in reality, the independent agency licenses individual local stations and is prohibited by the First Amendment from censoring content based on viewpoint. The remarks have intensified concerns about administrative pressure on media outlets and the freedom of the press.</p>

          <p>An industry analyst predicts that consumers will see more "shrinkflation," where manufacturers reduce product sizes while keeping prices the same, as grocery costs continue to rise. Factors contributing to higher food prices include climate change, labor shortages, and the Trump administration's tariffs, which have significantly impacted items like coffee. This trend is altering consumer behavior, with more shoppers opting for store brands and buying in bulk to save money. The practice of shrinkflation is a subtle way companies pass on increased costs without overtly raising the sticker price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposed mining project near Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp has been halted after a nonprofit, The Conservation Fund, purchased the land for $60 million. The deal prevents a mineral company from mining for titanium and zirconium near the ecologically sensitive wetland, which is home to over 1,000 species. The project had faced strong opposition from a bipartisan coalition of advocates who feared it would disrupt the swamp's water levels and increase the risk of devastating wildfires. While this specific threat has been neutralized, other nearby private lands still hold mineral rights, leaving the swamp potentially vulnerable in the future.</p>

The committee recently voted to limit guidance for the combined MMRV vaccine for young children and is considering delaying the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. These specific vaccines have been chosen, experts argue, because they have existing, albeit minor, controversies that can be exploited to build a case against other, more established immunizations. This approach appears designed to gradually erode public trust in vaccines by creating confusion and casting doubt on the entire schedule.</p>

The launch positions Meta in a growing market, with competitors like Google, Snap, and Apple also developing their own smart glasses technology.</p>

          <p>A state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump is being framed as a much-needed political victory for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has recently faced significant domestic challenges. The carefully choreographed visit, featuring both royal pageantry and business at the Chequers retreat, resulted in a major US-UK tech partnership and promises of £150 billion in inward investment. Starmer successfully navigated potential diplomatic flashpoints, such as the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, finding ways to disagree without creating major conflict. The visit has provided the prime minister with a positive narrative focused on economic growth and jobs ahead of his party's conference.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan House committee has unanimously passed an amendment requiring more congressional oversight of the Trump administration's efforts to combat human trafficking. The move follows a Guardian investigation revealing significant staff reductions at the State Department's anti-trafficking office and a failure to publish a legally mandated annual report on the issue. The new measure directs the State Department to report on the impact of these staff cuts and consult regularly with Congress. Lawmakers from both parties expressed concern that the administration's actions have weakened the U.S. government's ability to monitor and prevent human trafficking globally.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer that the UK should "call out the military" to stop illegal migration. Speaking at a press conference, Trump drew parallels between the UK's situation and the U.S. southern border, arguing that such migration "destroys countries from within." The comments came during a visit that otherwise avoided major public disagreements, although Trump noted the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state was an area of difference. The UK government is currently implementing a new "one in, one out" deal with France to manage migrant crossings in the English Channel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First Amendment scholars are raising concerns that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) engaged in "jawboning"—or unconstitutional government pressure—that led to ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. The suspension followed comments from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who publicly stated that ABC's parent company, Disney, could "take action on Kimmel" or face "additional work for the FCC." Experts argue this created a clear link between a government threat and a private company's decision to stifle speech, a practice some call "censorship by proxy." The incident has intensified the debate over the Trump administration's use of regulatory power to influence media content and silence political critics.</p>

          <p>FedEx announced fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading to a more than 5% increase in its stock price during after-hours trading. The company attributed the strong performance to higher domestic package volumes, which helped offset headwinds from the changing global trade environment. The results were negatively impacted by the recent global elimination of the "de minimis" rule, which had allowed shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. FedEx provided an optimistic revenue growth forecast for 2026, signaling resilience despite macroeconomic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
