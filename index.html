          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded to state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary after initial results showed Mamdani with a commanding lead. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal, was attempting a political comeback. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, would be the first Muslim and Indian American to lead the city if elected. The primary is being closely watched as a litmus test for the Democratic Party after recent election losses, with counting expected to continue under the ranked-choice system. The former governor's loss marks a significant upset, highlighting the desire of New York Democrats for leaders who fight with enthusiasm and courage.</p>

          <p>A controversial Republican proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was removed from the tax and spending bill due to Senate rules violations. Senator Mike Lee's plan aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of public land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to address housing needs. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal violated the Byrd Rule, preventing the inclusion of provisions extraneous to the budget in a reconciliation bill. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, emphasizing the rejection of public land sales, even as Lee seeks revisions to revive the plan.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment found that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, indicates that the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, were sealed off. The resumption of the enrichment program depends on how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and repair electrical and water supplies. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, though officials caution that the assessment could change as more information becomes available.</p>

          <p>Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff called the leaking of an initial intelligence assessment of Iran's nuclear capabilities after U.S. strikes "treasonous." The assessment concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but likely set it back by a few months. Witkoff also assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding. He stated that it is "not even conceivable" that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within a matter of months.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. Using data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope and other sky surveys, researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. The extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study provides evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>
