            <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump to Proceed with Alien Enemies Act Deportations, with Due Process</h2>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled 5-4 to allow President Trump to continue using the Alien Enemies Act for rapid deportations of alleged gang members, but mandated that deportees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal in court. The ruling vacates a lower court's block on the deportations, stipulating that challenges must be raised in Texas, where the migrants are confined. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissented with the liberal justices, calling the administration's actions an "extraordinary threat to the rule of law." The ACLU claimed a partial victory, emphasizing the due process requirement. The act, last used in World War Two, allows the president to detain and deport citizens of an "enemy" nation without usual legal processes.</p>

            <p>Numerous colleges and universities across the United States, including Harvard, UCLA, and Stanford, are reporting that the Trump administration has revoked the student visas of international students. The State Department has revoked over 300 student visas nationwide since the beginning of Trump's second term, citing alleged violations of visa or green card conditions. These violations range from minor legal infractions to participating in demonstrations, while in some cases, the reason for the revocation remains unknown. The visa revocations have impacted students at Arizona State University, Central Michigan University, Colorado State University, and several others, causing concern among higher education institutions and international students alike.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the US if China does not withdraw its 34% counter-tariff, further escalating the trade war between the two countries. China has responded by accusing Washington of "economic bullying" and vowing to protect its interests. The potential tariff increase could lead to a total rate of 104% on Chinese imports, impacting US companies and global markets. Trump also stated that all talks with China regarding tariffs would be terminated. Uncertainty surrounding the tariffs has led to turbulence in global stock markets.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the US would begin direct talks with Iran, starting Saturday, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi confirmed the talks, referring to them as "indirect high-level talks" to be held in Oman. The meeting with Netanyahu also addressed new tariffs the US is levying on Israel, set to go into effect on Wednesday. Netanyahu stated Israel would work to eliminate its trade deficit with the US. Trump did not commit to eliminating tariffs on imports from Israel. The announcement comes amid market volatility, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones experiencing significant fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Stock indexes in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen rose at the open on Tuesday after Chinese state funds intervened to prop up the market, signaling a cooling of the recent global sell-off. The Hang Seng Index increased by 2.5%, recovering from a significant loss, while the CSI 300 index also saw gains. Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China’s sovereign wealth fund, purchased exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday and pledged further investments to maintain market stability. This intervention reflects the government's commitment to supporting the capital market amid economic uncertainty stemming from reciprocal tariffs with the US. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An opinion piece discusses the evolving relationship between Europe and China, especially in light of the US President Donald Trump's trade war. Increased engagement between Europe and China may offer a contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship. The author suggests that Hong Kong, as a gateway between the world and mainland China, can play a role in this evolving dynamic. The reciprocal tariffs implemented by the US go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade between countries. The piece posits that political strategy is currently overshadowing economic principles.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Washington Nationals 6-4, marking their third loss in the last four games, largely due to defensive miscues. Errors by Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas led to unearned runs for the Nationals, while stellar defense from the Nationals prevented potential rallies by the Dodgers. The Dodgers have committed seven errors in the last six games and yielded the most unearned runs in the majors. Despite a strong offensive performance from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' defensive struggles proved costly.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has made it easier for the Trump administration to deport individuals under the Alien Enemies Act, a 227-year-old law, though it stipulates that individuals must be given notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. The decision overturns a district court decision that had temporarily blocked deportations under the Act. The ruling mandates that challenges must be brought as a "habeas" proceeding, which can only be used by an individual to challenge their detention. Justice Sotomayor dissented, warning of the potential for human rights abuses in El Salvador's prisons where deportees may be sent.</p>

            <p>Unrelenting heavy rain and storms have resulted in at least 24 deaths across seven states in the South and Midwest, with rivers reaching near-record levels and inundating towns. Tennessee and Kentucky have experienced the highest number of fatalities, while Missouri, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, and Mississippi have also reported deaths. Cities have ordered evacuations, and utilities have shut off power and gas in affected areas. The National Weather Service has warned of major flood stages in multiple states, with extensive damage to infrastructure possible. The storms come after job cuts at NWS forecast offices, potentially impacting response efforts.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has fired Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO's military committee, reportedly due to comments supporting diversity in the force. Adm. Christopher Grady informed Chatfield that the administration wanted a different direction for the job. The decision is believed to have been made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, amid a campaign to remove leaders promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by a conservative foundation. Sen. Mark Warner expressed deep concern over the firing, stating it weakens the US position globally.</p>

            <p>Budget carrier Avelo Airlines has announced an agreement to fly deportation flights from Arizona starting in May, a decision the company acknowledges may be controversial. Avelo CEO Andrew Levy stated the move will support the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration Control and Enforcement agency as part of a “long-term charter program.” The flights will be both domestic and international, supported by three Boeing 737-800 planes based at Mesa Gateway Airport. The decision has drawn criticism, with the Mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, expressing his opposition and a local immigrant advocacy group calling for a boycott of the airline.</p>

            <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation to create a “turquoise alert” system for missing Native Americans in the state. The system, named after the blue-green mineral, will enable law enforcement to quickly share information, similar to “amber” and “silver” alerts. Cellphone alerts will be issued when there is evidence of imminent danger in the disappearance of a Native American. The legislation aims to address the troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country, with other states like California, Washington, and Colorado having similar alert systems.</p>

            <p>A 14-year-old Palestinian-American, Amir Mohammed Rabee, was fatally shot in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, sparking controversy and grief. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that soldiers opened fire on three individuals throwing rocks towards a highway, while Rabee's father claims his son was throwing stones at an almond tree. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has been asked to comment on claims that they accepted the Israeli military's explanation of the shooting. The incident occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Trump in Washington. Another American national was also killed in the West Bank in September.</p>

            <p>Tax professionals advise taxpayers who anticipate difficulty paying their taxes to file a return or request an extension to avoid accruing interest and penalties. The IRS is willing to work with taxpayers who communicate their situation, offering options like installment plans and, in cases of unusual hardship, a status of "currently not collectible." Free resources like Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites and the IRS Direct File program can assist with filing and payment arrangements. Even partial payments are preferable to not filing at all, and taxpayers should explore available credits and deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs have created a high-stakes game of chicken, leaving the global economy uncertain. Some nations are attempting to negotiate with the White House to avoid potentially devastating consequences, while China is retaliating. Trump has pressed ahead despite concerns from allies in Congress and on Wall Street. Netanyahu pledged that Israel would drop trade barriers and eliminate its trade surplus with the US. The European Commission has offered a mutual reduction of tariffs on industrial goods. China announced it was responding to Trump's 34% tariff increase with an additional 34% of its own.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can use a wartime law to deport alleged members of a foreign crime gang, but only if they are given the right to challenge the government’s claim. By a 5-4 vote, the court set aside orders from lower courts that said the administration had overstepped its power. The court said a group of alleged Venezuelan gang members facing deportation to El Salvador may appeal, but only before a federal judge in Texas, where they are held. The decision is a victory for Trump and a setback for federal judges who sought to check the check the president’s power.</p>

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily paused a lower court's order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The administrative stay gives the Supreme Court more time to consider the matter. The Trump administration had asked the Supreme Court to intervene, claiming that the district court order "sets the United States up for failure." Abrego Garcia was deported despite a 2019 protective order that should have prevented his removal. The Justice Department has argued that the government does not have jurisdiction over Abrego Garcia anymore because he is in the custody of the Salvadoran government.</p>

            <p>Jenna Ortega has addressed her departure from "Scream VII," stating it was unrelated to pay or scheduling conflicts, but due to the production "falling apart" after Melissa Barrera's firing. Barrera was fired by Spyglass Media Group over social media posts about the Israel-Hamas war, which she refuted as anti-Semitic. Christopher Landon, initially slated to direct "Scream VII," also resigned from the project. Screenwriter Kevin Williamson will now direct "Scream VII" and bring back original actress Neve Campbell to play Sidney Prescott.

            <p>Colossal Biosciences has genetically engineered three wolf pups with characteristics resembling the extinct dire wolf, including white hair and muscular jaws. The pups, ranging from three to six months old, are part of a project aimed at bringing back lost species. While the pups may physically resemble dire wolves, independent scientists caution that they cannot fully revive extinct species. Colossal scientists used ancient DNA from fossils to identify specific traits and then used CRISPR to genetically modify blood cells from a living gray wolf. The company has also cloned red wolves to increase genetic diversity within the endangered population.</p>
