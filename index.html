          <p>The South and Midwest regions of the United States are bracing for another round of torrential rain and flash flooding, exacerbating already waterlogged conditions from days of severe storms and deadly tornadoes. Numerous river locations are expected to reach major flood stage, potentially causing extensive damage to infrastructure and disrupting interstate commerce through key cargo hubs like Louisville and Memphis. Communities are also assessing the aftermath of recent tornadoes, with warnings of more twisters possible, and resources are stretched thin as nearly half of NWS forecast offices face significant vacancy rates. Despite the grim situation, some areas anticipate the severe weather risks to subside after Sunday, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei reaffirmed his support for Donald Trump at a Mar-a-Lago event, even as the world grapples with the implications of Trump's new tariffs. Milei's visit underscored his alignment with Trump's policies, despite potential economic repercussions for Argentina, and while other nations voice concerns over the tariffs, Milei's administration downplayed their impact, framing them as preferential treatment for Argentina. Milei seeks a $20 billion bailout from the IMF, hoping his alliance with Trump will prove beneficial in securing the funds needed to sustain Argentina's economic reforms. Milei's unwavering support for Trump reflects a broader ideological alignment and a strategic bet on the benefits of a close relationship with the former US president.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is arguing against a judge's order to facilitate the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite having legal permission to be in the U.S. Government attorneys claim the judge lacks the authority to compel the executive branch to engage with a foreign power in such a manner. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, was deported despite a 2019 ruling protecting him from deportation due to potential persecution by gangs in El Salvador. The case has sparked outrage and raised concerns about the treatment of non-citizens with legal status, while the White House maintains Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, a claim his attorneys deny.</p>

          <p>A new book argues that liberals may have been wrong about some of their pandemic policies, such as lockdowns and school closures, and that conservative criticisms deserved more rigorous debate. The authors contend that public health authorities and progressive elites often pushed measures without adequately weighing their costs and benefits, and ostracized those who disagreed. They point to data suggesting that there was no meaningful difference in Covid mortality rates between Democratic and Republican states, despite differing policies. The book raises questions about groupthink and partisan bias in the pandemic response, sparking debate about the effectiveness and consequences of various measures.</p>

          <p>Attorneys report that Venezuelans with legal permission to live and work in the United States are being unlawfully arrested by federal authorities and detained in ICE facilities. These individuals hold Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which protects them from deportation due to unsafe conditions in Venezuela. Despite the law stating that TPS holders "shall not be detained," these Venezuelans are being apprehended, raising concerns about potential mass deportations and disregard for legal protections. Lawyers suspect the Trump administration is preparing for mass deportations should Venezuelans lose their TPS status, leading to a blatant disregard for the law.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted a large-scale missile defense test in the Gobi Desert, firing as many as 16 ballistic missiles on a single target. The test aimed to assess a new dual-band radar system's ability to counter saturation attacks, demonstrating China's growing military capabilities. The new radar system successfully detected and tracked all missiles before they hit the target, achieving critical metrics for neutralizing advanced threats. This public disclosure of China's land-based early warning radar capabilities signals Beijing's confidence in its capacity to project dominance in a tense geopolitical landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inactive investors, often referred to as "dead" investors, tend to outperform active traders due to their "buy and hold" investment strategy. Active trading often leads to higher costs, taxes, and impulsive decision-making driven by emotions, while staying the course through market fluctuations typically yields better results. Human behavior is identified as the biggest threat to investor returns, as panic selling and excited buying can significantly detract from long-term gains. Experts recommend reviewing asset allocation and rebalancing portfolios periodically, rather than making frequent trades based on market trends. &#x20;</br>\<i>(not investment advice)<\/i></p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's tariff policies have led to significant stock market turmoil, with analysts describing the situation as worse than the worst-case scenario. The implementation of sweeping tariffs has triggered retaliatory measures from other countries, causing economic and market uncertainty. Economists are concerned about the rudimentary math used to calculate the tariffs, and the market has responded negatively, with major indices experiencing sharp declines. Investors are now grappling with the difficulty of pricing future earnings amid the unpredictability of global trade, raising concerns about a potential recession.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced it will "pause" shipments to the US in response to Donald Trump's new tariffs on imported cars. The 25% levy, which came into effect on Thursday, has prompted the British car firm to reassess its trading strategy. The US is a significant market for JLR, and the company is taking short-term actions to address the new trading terms while developing longer-term plans. The move reflects the broader impact of Trump's tariffs on global trade, with concerns raised about potential job losses and the need for firms to rethink their trading strategies.</p>

          <p>Laura Loomer, a far-right provocateur, has gained significant influence within the Trump administration, raising concerns about the president's association with extremist ideologies. Loomer's involvement has reportedly led to staff firings and requests for lists of perceived disloyal individuals, highlighting her power within the White House. Her past statements and associations with racist and extremist groups have drawn criticism, yet she remains a confidante of the president. Loomer's prominence reflects a shift towards more extreme positions within the administration and raises questions about the future direction of Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>China has vowed to take "resolute measures" to protect its interests against tariffs imposed by the United States, calling the levies "suppressive" and a violation of international trade rules.

This response follows China's earlier announcement of tariffs on American goods, escalating trade tensions between the two countries.
