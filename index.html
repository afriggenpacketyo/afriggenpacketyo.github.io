        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search in Portugal for Madeleine McCann, nearly two decades after her disappearance from Praia da Luz in 2007. The search, prompted by warrants from German prosecutors, spans 21 plots of land between the resort where Madeleine disappeared and the location where the prime suspect, Christian Brückner, was staying at the time. Brückner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate sexual assault case and is suspected of Madeleine's murder, although he denies any involvement. Authorities are conducting the search based on a European warrant, aiming to uncover any evidence that could lead to charges before Brückner's potential release, as the investigation continues. The case remains a high-profile missing person investigation.</p>

          <p>A shooting near a humanitarian aid distribution center in the southern Gaza Strip resulted in at least 27 deaths and over 90 injuries, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged a shooting occurred approximately 500 meters from the aid site, stating that forces fired shots at suspects who deviated from designated access routes and approached them in a threatening manner. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which operates the aid site, reported that distribution was conducted safely at their location but acknowledged an investigation into injuries occurring outside the designated safe corridor. This incident follows another shooting near an aid distribution site just days prior, prompting calls for an independent investigation by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, as the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire. Optimism surrounding this event is low given the loss of life and the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Sit-at-home protests called by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have significantly disrupted life and commerce in southeastern Nigeria, particularly on Mondays. These protests, intended to demand the release of IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu, have led to widespread fear and compliance among residents, with armed groups enforcing the order through violence and intimidation. A recent report estimates that the protests have caused economic losses of over $4.79 billion, severely impacting transportation, trade, and small businesses. The protests have also disrupted public institutions, such as schools and hospitals, contributing to a climate of fear and ideological extremism among the youth in the region.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after the Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, withdrew from the governing coalition due to disagreements over immigration policies. Wilders demanded stricter asylum measures, including a freeze on applications and limits on family reunification, which were not supported by the other coalition partners. This move triggers the likely prospect of snap elections, as Wilders stated that his party could not support the government's asylum plans. The collapse comes amid a surge in right-wing parties across Europe, fueled by EU skepticism and concerns over immigration and economic anxiety, as the political landscape remains in flux.</p>

Klein notes that coverage of international conflicts like those in Israel and Gaza or Ukraine and Russia has decreased due to the focus on domestic issues under Trump. Ashford provides a realist perspective on Trump's "America First" foreign policy, highlighting its focus on American interests and its potential impact on global affairs.

          <p>Luang Prabang, a city in northern Laos, has experienced significant economic growth through tourism, leading to a substantial reduction in poverty. The city attracted over 2 million visitors last year, generating $560 million in revenue and lifting 98.3% of its population out of poverty. However, Laos as a whole still faces challenges, with nearly 17% of families living in poverty and struggling with inflation and public debt. While tourism offers potential, analysts caution that not all visitors bring economic benefits to the local population, as some tours bypass local businesses, as experts emphasize the importance of improving agriculture and logistics to achieve broader economic development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs are expected to negatively impact global economic growth. The OECD forecasts a slowdown in worldwide growth to 2.9%, a decrease from the previous projection of 3.1%, citing a significant rise in trade barriers and widespread uncertainty. The group also reduced its outlook for the U.S. economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and warned of rising inflation risks. Despite Trump's claims that tariffs are boosting the U.S. economy, recent data indicates a contraction in the first three months of the year, as the OECD suggests that the UK should consider raising tax revenues to strengthen public finances.

          <p>Mount Etna, located on the island of Sicily, Italy, is Europe's largest and most active volcano, with over 500,000 years of eruptive history. It is a stratovolcano, characterized by steep inclines and multiple vents, and is one of the best-monitored volcanoes globally. While it has been continuously erupting for thousands of years, volcanologists can pinpoint new eruptions multiple times a year, as the volcano is in a state of persistent activity. Mount Etna poses a threat to nearby populations due to debris and dust, with past lava flows reaching the eastern seaboard of Sicily, but the volcanic soil also supports diverse flora and fauna, making it a natural laboratory for ecological studies.</p>

Opponents call it a trophy hunt driven by bloodlust rather than science, reintroducing practices like bear baiting and using dogs to chase and corner the animals. Critics argue the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) is using outdated data to justify the hunt, with the most recent population estimate over a decade old. Concerns also stem from a previous hunt in 2015, which ended prematurely due to excessive killings and illegal baiting.</p>

          <p>Male beauty standards are undergoing a shift, influenced by the manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces, focusing more on hypermasculinity than attracting women. Trends like shaving off eyelashes and mewing reflect a desire to impress other men, often accompanied by misogyny. This contrasts with feminist efforts to empower women to define their beauty independently of male approval, as some men are experiencing body dysmorphia due to the pursuit of extreme and often contradictory beauty standards. Ironically, the pursuit of nonsensical and often contradictory beauty standards have led young men to the same place that young women have long found themselves: with crippling body dysmorphia.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has been classified as an England and Wales project, sparking anger in Wales. The £6.6bn line will see no tracks laid in Wales, but because of the way it has been classified, it means the country will not benefit from any extra cash. Politicians argue that this classification denies Wales significant funding that could transform its own rail network. The UK government said the project is funded through its "rail network enhancements pipeline", which it said was funding projects in Wales.</p>

          <p>Even if humanity quits fossil fuels, achieving climate goals requires addressing the food system, which accounts for one-third of global emissions. Agriculture's extensive land use contributes to deforestation, water shortages, and biodiversity loss, as the world needs to produce more food with less land to sustain a growing population. Solutions involve dietary changes, technological innovations, and policy shifts, but food and climate solutions lag behind energy and climate efforts. Addressing this challenge requires personal and political changes as significant as transitioning away from fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>Millennials are entering midlife facing unique challenges, including economic instability, career reevaluations, and a sense of not having achieved traditional milestones. Unlike previous generations, many millennials cannot afford the typical trappings of a midlife crisis, such as a new sports car or abandoning family life. Instead, they seek opportunities for personal growth, such as fitness journeys, career changes, or self-discovery. Economic factors, such as entering the workforce during financial crises, have contributed to a sense of disorientation, as millennials learn to accept that their lives may not resemble those of their parents.</p>

The BSW won 4.981% of the vote, narrowly missing the 5% required to have representation in the Bundestag. The party argued that its placement on election ballots and the failure to carry out a recount had violated its right to equal opportunity. If the BSW had overcome the 5% hurdle, the new coalition government of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the center-left SPD would have not had a majority.</p>

          <p>A Navarre, Florida, sandwich shop employee, Eleanor Coffee, helped authorities save a domestic violence victim who had allegedly been kidnapped by her abusive boyfriend. Coffee found a note in the store bathroom that read “HELP!” with a woman’s name, a phone number and an address for a nearby home. Deputies then obtained a warrant to search the address mentioned in the note at Jersey Mike’s before encountering a woman at that home “who confirmed she authored the note and detailed a prolonged period of abuse”. The boyfriend, Jordan Williams, was booked with various felonies, including kidnapping, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and battery by strangulation.</p>
