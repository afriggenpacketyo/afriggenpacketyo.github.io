          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, declined to 2.7% in August, marking its third straight month of decrease and the lowest level since November 2024. This figure aligned with economists' expectations and comes as the significant surge in rice prices begins to soften, though they remain at historically high levels. The data is being closely watched as the Bank of Japan is expected to announce its latest interest rate decision, with most analysts predicting the central bank will hold rates steady for now.

          <p>The owner of a popular Los Angeles cookie shop, Fleurs et Sel, is experiencing a significant financial burden due to U.S. tariffs on imported ingredients from countries like France and Japan. Lara Adekoya reports that her monthly supply costs have increased by several thousand dollars, a cost she is currently absorbing rather than passing on to her customers. The case highlights the broader impact of the tariffs on small businesses, with legal challenges arguing the tariffs are illegal and could give the president unlimited authority to impose them.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Stephen Colbert strongly defended his peer Jimmy Kimmel, whose show was suspended by ABC, calling the move "blatant censorship" and labeling President Trump an "autocrat." Colbert dedicated his show to the principle of free speech, a sentiment echoed by former host David Letterman, who called ABC's decision "ridiculous" and an attempt to appease an authoritarian administration. The controversy arose after Kimmel linked the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement, prompting pressure on the network.</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents in central Berlin were evacuated after an unexploded World War II bomb was discovered in the Spree River during construction work. Authorities established a 500-meter security perimeter in a densely populated area, which includes several embassies, and set up emergency shelters for those displaced. The bomb, located under four meters of water, is scheduled to be defused by a disposal team in the early morning, with ship and subway traffic halted until the area is secured.</p>

          <p>Experts at Forestry England are forecasting a particularly spectacular autumn display of colorful leaves across the UK, thanks to the very warm and sunny summer. The favorable weather allowed trees to produce higher levels of sugar in their leaves, which in turn creates brighter red, orange, and gold pigments as the green chlorophyll fades. While some trees experienced a "false autumn" due to drought stress, recent rainfall and the overall conditions are expected to result in one of the most flamboyant seasonal displays in recent years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that the broadcast licenses of television networks critical of his administration should potentially be revoked, citing what he perceives as overwhelmingly negative coverage. His comments came a day after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's show, a move praised by the president and influenced by pressure from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC's charter explicitly prohibits the commission from censoring broadcast material based on viewpoint, making the president's remarks a significant challenge to First Amendment protections for the press.</p>

          <p>According to a food industry analyst, American consumers are facing rising grocery prices and the phenomenon of "shrinkflation," where product sizes decrease while prices remain the same. The expert identifies three primary drivers: climate change impacting crop locations, labor shortages, and the Trump administration's tariffs, which have significantly increased the cost of imported goods like coffee. This economic pressure is altering consumer behavior, leading more shoppers to choose store brands, seek deals, and buy in bulk to manage their household budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses are the future of computing, envisioning a more natural user interface based on voice, sight, and gestures. His comments coincide with the reveal of the new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display and a neural wristband for control. The new device allows users to record video and send messages, representing a significant step beyond the company's previous audio-only smart glasses and positioning Meta in a growing market alongside competitors like Google, Snap, and Apple.</p>

          <p>A House committee has unanimously passed a bipartisan amendment requiring greater congressional oversight of the U.S. government's efforts to combat human trafficking. The move follows reports that the Trump administration has significantly reduced staff at the State Department's anti-trafficking office and failed to publish a legally mandated annual report on the issue. The amendment directs the State Department to report on the impact of these staff reductions and to consult regularly with Congress to ensure accountability on this critical human rights issue.</p>

          <p>First Amendment scholars are expressing alarm that the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) pressure on ABC, which led to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, may constitute illegal government coercion known as "jawboning." The practice involves officials pressuring private entities to stifle speech, effectively creating censorship by proxy. Experts note the direct line between the FCC chairman's public threats of "additional work for the FCC" and the network's subsequent decision to pull Kimmel's show, creating what they call a prime example of government overreach.</p>
