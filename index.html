          <p>The Trump administration's conflict with the judiciary intensified after the FBI arrested a county circuit judge in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, accusing her of obstructing immigration authorities. Judge Hannah Dugan allegedly helped Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, an undocumented immigrant previously deported, evade arrest at her courthouse. This incident is part of a series of actions by the administration against judges perceived as challenging its immigration policies. The case raises concerns about the separation of powers and the potential for political interference in judicial proceedings.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that a one-minute exposure to a specific sound frequency may help prevent motion sickness. The study found that a 100 Hz sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing symptoms like lightheadedness and nausea. The experiment involved volunteers exposed to the sound before riding a swing, driving simulator, or car, with 70-80% reporting alleviated symptoms. This finding could offer a non-pharmaceutical solution for motion sickness, particularly relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicles.</p>

          <p>China is taking a more assertive stance towards the Trump administration during his second term, reacting to tariffs with countermeasures and rallying international support. Unlike Trump's first term, where leader-level diplomacy was prioritized, China has become more fiery in its rhetoric, attacking American "bullying." This shift may reflect a hardening of attitudes based on experiences during Trump's initial term, signaling a potentially more contentious relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, has revoked a Biden administration-era policy that restricted subpoenas of reporters’ phone records in criminal investigations. Bondi said federal employees who leak sensitive information to the media are engaging in conduct that could be characterized as “treasonous.” While the department would continue to employ procedural protections, the move comes as Trump has escalated his attacks on the US media landscape.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reverses Termination of Visas for Foreign Students</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is restoring visas for hundreds of foreign students who had their legal status abruptly terminated. The announcement follows lawsuits filed by students who were stripped of their right to study in US universities. Many affected students appeared to have participated in political protests or have had previous criminal charges. While visas are being restored, ICE still maintains the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons.</p>
