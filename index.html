          <p>The Mashco Piro, an uncontacted indigenous tribe in the Peruvian Amazon, are increasingly encountering outsiders due to encroaching logging and mining activities. A new report warns that half of the world's uncontacted groups could be wiped out within a decade without greater protection. Local villagers, while fearing the Mashco Piro's arrows, also express deep respect and concern for their "brothers in the forest," advocating for an extended protected reserve to safeguard their way of life and prevent disease exposure.</p>

          <p>Pizza Hut is closing half of its 132 UK restaurants after being bought out of administration for the second time this year, reflecting a significant decline in its market position. The chain's traditional all-you-can-eat buffet model has become unsustainable due to soaring food and staffing costs. Increased competition from dominant takeaway rivals like Domino's and a surge in high-quality independent pizzerias offering more modern options have further eroded Pizza Hut's appeal, especially among younger consumers.</p>

          <p>As winter approaches, many UK households are delaying turning on their heating to save money, opting for blankets and extra layers instead.

          <p>Hurricane Melissa has strengthened into a Category 1 storm and is forecasted to intensify further into a major hurricane by Sunday, posing a severe threat to the Caribbean. The storm is expected to bring "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic early next week, with rainfall totals potentially reaching nearly three feet in some areas.

          <p>Manchester United has secured their third consecutive victory, beating Brighton 4-2, signaling a potential turning point under coach Ruben Amorim. Despite Amorim's cautious optimism, the team's improved form is attributed to a squad better suited to his system, strong individual performances, and a more stable goalkeeper. The article notes that a forgiving fixture list, with fewer midweek games, provides an opportunity for continued progress and a sustained recovery.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people protested in Valencia, Spain, one year after floods killed 229 individuals, demanding the resignation of regional leader Carlos Mazon. Demonstrators criticized Mazon's administration for issuing a flood warning more than 12 hours after the national weather agency's highest alert, leading to accusations of negligence. A judicial investigation into the emergency response is underway, highlighting the ongoing public anger and demand for accountability for Europe's worst flood-related disaster since 1967.</p>

          <p>An analysis article questions President Trump's stated rationale for deploying a massive US naval force to the Caribbean, ostensibly for drug interdiction efforts targeting Venezuela. The article argues that Trump's claims about Venezuela's role in fentanyl production are misinformed, as Mexican cartels are the primary source. It suggests that the extensive military deployment is disproportionate to the actual drug threat from Venezuela and that the true motive may be regime change.</p>

          <p>A new AP-NORC poll indicates a notable drop in President Donald Trump's favorability among Hispanic adults, falling from 44% to 25% since the start of his second term. This decline is accompanied by increased belief that the nation is heading in the wrong direction and reduced confidence in his handling of the economy and immigration. The shift is particularly significant given Hispanic voters' crucial role in his 2024 re-election, with his hardline immigration policies directly impacting Latino communities.</p>

          <p>Deadly protests have erupted in Ladakh, India, driven by demands for greater autonomy, statehood, and job quotas for local residents. The unrest stems from unfulfilled promises made after the region was carved out as a separate union territory in 2019, leading to widespread unemployment and a deep sense of mistrust in New Delhi. Locals, who have historically supported the Indian armed forces, feel alienated and hurt by accusations of being "anti-national," underscoring the challenge for India to rebuild trust in the strategically vulnerable border region.</p>
