            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an agency under Elon Musk, from accessing Social Security records, citing privacy concerns. Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander stated that unlimited access to sensitive information like medical and financial records would betray the government's commitment to citizens' privacy. The order prevents DOGE from accessing personally identifiable information, installing software on SSA computers, or altering SSA systems, although limited access may be granted with written permission. This ruling extends a previous temporary block and allows the Trump administration to appeal.</p>

This second state visit is seen as a potential boost for the strained relationship between the US and UK, particularly given Trump's differing views on Ukraine and trade. The visit, potentially occurring in September, carries risks but is viewed as a vital use of British soft power to influence Trump's policies.

The decision escalates opposition to offshore wind, as the project already had federal permits and had broken ground. Critics argue the approval was rushed, but others note a thorough environmental review.

Attorneys for the brothers fought with prosecutors, who oppose their release. The judge postponed the hearing to weigh requests from both sides, including a motion to recuse the DA's office and a review of a risk assessment report. The hearing was intended to decide whether the brothers should receive a new sentence that could allow their freedom after three decades in prison.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists at Fudan University have unveiled "Poxiao," the fastest flash memory ever created, capable of erasing and rewriting data in 400 picoseconds. The prototype, though small, shatters speed barriers of modern storage by 100,000 times. This advancement in electron physics may blur the line between memory and computing. The research team aimed to accelerate flash memory, harnessing its advantages while addressing its speed limitations, potentially revolutionizing AI computing power.</p>

Vessel owners could be eligible for remission of the fees if they provide proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order. Bulk exports like coal or grain will be exempt.</p>
