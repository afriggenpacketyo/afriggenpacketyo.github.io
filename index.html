          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another strike on a boat in the Caribbean, marking the sixth such attack in the region since last month. Unlike previous incidents which resulted in at least 27 fatalities, this strike on a semi-submersible vessel is the first known to have survivors. A Navy helicopter transported the survivors to a U.S. Navy ship, though the exact number of individuals involved remains unclear. The Trump administration has justified these actions as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels, a claim that has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has described a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel connecting Russia and Alaska as "interesting." The pitch was made by a Russian investment envoy, who suggested the 70-mile link could symbolize unity and be built for a fraction of traditional estimates using new technology. This development comes as Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin plan to meet to discuss the Ukraine war, raising concerns for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article notes significant engineering challenges and The Boring Company's recent regulatory violations.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the possibility of the U.S. supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, potentially in exchange for Ukrainian-made drones. However, Trump expressed hesitation about depleting the U.S. arsenal, stating he hopes the war can be resolved without such an escalation. The meeting occurred shortly after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he plans to meet in Budapest. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for continued pressure on Russia to achieve peace.</p>

          <p>Amid market volatility and shifting interest rates, many are considering annuities for retirement planning due to their guaranteed income streams. The article identifies fixed annuities as the safest current option, offering predictable returns shielded from market downturns, with many providing rates between 5% and 6%. It also discusses Multi-Year Guaranteed Annuities (MYGAs) for their locked-in rates and Single Premium Immediate Annuities (SPIAs) for lifetime income. The best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal title or conferred honors, a decision made in consultation with the King and the Royal Family. The move follows renewed public scrutiny stemming from a posthumous memoir by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an accuser of the late Jeffrey Epstein, who alleged she was sexually trafficked to the prince. In his statement, Prince Andrew cited the need to prevent the continued accusations from distracting from the work of the monarchy. He reiterated his vigorous denial of the allegations against him.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is calling on Israel to promptly open all border crossings into the Gaza Strip to combat a growing famine, stating that scaling up aid delivery will take time. Since a recent ceasefire, the UN has managed to deliver nearly 3,000 tons of food, but acknowledges this is insufficient to "flood Gaza with food" after months of access restrictions. UN humanitarian head Tom Fletcher confirmed that aid, including food, medicine, and fuel, is finally moving at scale. The effort to deliver aid remains a difficult task amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Representative Lance Gooden has formally requested the Department of Justice to investigate the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) for its alleged connections to Antifa. In a letter, Gooden expressed concern that the group's activities may extend beyond legal defense to supporting extremist violence, posing a threat to civilians and law enforcement. This call for a probe comes as the Trump administration has intensified its focus on Antifa, which the President has declared a "domestic terrorist organization." The NLG has countered that antifascism is an idea, not a formal organization that can receive funding.</p>

          <h2>Editorial: Trump Administration is Weaponizing the Justice System Against Political Foes</h2>

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that the U.S. is shifting from the rule of law, where the justice system restrains executive power, to rule by law, where it is used as a weapon by the executive. The piece cites the recent criminal charges against high-profile Trump critics like John Bolton, Letitia James, and James Comey as evidence of this dangerous trend. The editorial suggests these actions are part of a broader slide towards "competitive authoritarianism," where democratic institutions are systematically manipulated for political ends. President Trump's open calls for retribution against his opponents are seen as a direct assault on the core principles of American democracy.</p>

          <p>In response to pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices, Genentech will begin selling its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to some consumers at a significant discount. The new program is designed to help uninsured or underinsured patients by offering the single-dose antiviral treatment for a $50 cash price, a 70% reduction from its list price. The medication will be available through select online pharmacies, including Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company and Alto Pharmacy. This move makes Genentech the latest pharmaceutical company to adopt a direct-to-consumer sales model to improve access and affordability.</p>

          <p>President Trump is cementing his architectural legacy with several construction projects at the White House, most notably a new $250 million ballroom being privately financed by donors. The project has drawn scrutiny from Democrats, who are introducing bills to ban donor names from being displayed on White House grounds and to prohibit federally funded construction during a shutdown. At a dinner for the project's financial backers, Trump also revealed plans for his next endeavor: a large triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial. The House Oversight Committee has opened a preliminary probe into the ballroom's financing, questioning the sources of donations.</p>

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon is releasing her first adult fiction novel, a thriller titled "Gone Before Goodbye," co-written with author Harlan Coben. The book centers on a skilled female surgeon, a character Witherspoon says was inspired by her desire to see heroines defined by their unique skills rather than their sex appeal, a critique she developed from watching James Bond films as a child. Witherspoon, who founded the production company Hello Sunshine to champion complex female stories, says she still sees a "gap" in Hollywood for such roles. She and Coben collaborated closely on the novel's development and writing process.</p>

This partnership differs from Apple's MLS Season Pass, as the F1 content will be included in the existing Apple TV subscription without an extra fee.

          <p>The New York Republican state committee has suspended its Young Republicans chapter after leaked messages revealed members engaging in racist, antisemitic, and violent rhetoric. The decision was unanimous, with the state chair declaring that such "vile language" has no place in the party. The leak, published by Politico, has led to significant backlash, with the Kansas GOP disbanding its youth group and several individuals implicated in the chats losing their jobs or political roles. The controversy has sparked condemnation from conservative figures who warn against associating the party with such hateful behavior.</p>

          <p>In addition to requesting long-range missiles, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing the Trump administration for increased intelligence sharing to aid in targeting Russia's energy infrastructure. This strategy aims to cripple the main source of income for Moscow's war effort, with U.S. intelligence support already enabling successful strikes on Russian refineries. The discussions come as both Ukraine and Russia target each other's energy sectors ahead of winter. This focus on intelligence sharing represents a more aggressive, albeit less overt, form of U.S. support, allowing Ukraine to use its own drones more effectively deep inside Russian territory.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive and prolonged Russian air incursions into the airspace of NATO countries like Poland and Estonia have been met with a firm and unified response from the alliance. This resolve, which included scrambling jets and establishing a new coordinated defense initiative called Eastern Sentry, may have backfired on Vladimir Putin's attempts to intimidate and divide NATO members. The article suggests a rare alignment between President Trump and European leaders on pressuring Russia, potentially creating urgency for Putin ahead of a planned summit with Trump. The events underscore a growing European consensus on the need for stronger, integrated defense systems against Russian provocations.</p>

Jasmine Beverley held a funeral in 2022 and received an urn of ashes, only to be informed by police in March 2024 that the ashes were not her son's and his body had been found at the premises. Former undertaker Robert Bush has pleaded guilty to fraud in her case and three others involving unborn babies.

The author argues that Trump is actively "fomenting civil war" by deploying U.S. troops to Democratic-run cities under the pretext of fighting crime, an act seen as political intimidation. This move, combined with efforts to politicize the military and use the justice system to punish critics, is presented as evidence of a leader provoking domestic conflict. The piece warns that these actions are designed to normalize military presence on American streets and intimidate political opposition.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war suggests that the U.S. economy might struggle more than China's if all trade were to cease, despite a significant trade deficit. China has responded to U.S. tariffs with its own countermeasures, such as restricting rare-earth mineral exports and halting purchases of U.S. soybeans. Furthermore, Beijing has successfully redirected exports to other regions like Africa and Southeast Asia, reducing its dependency on the U.S. market. China is also decreasing its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, though experts note that the deep economic interdependence between the two nations remains resilient.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a sell-off after two U.S. regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, reported issues with bad or fraudulent loans, sparking fears about the health of the wider banking sector. Shares of major UK and European banks fell sharply before recovering slightly, while the FTSE 100 index closed lower. The jitters are compounded by recent high-profile corporate failures in the private credit market and warnings from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon about potential hidden risks. The market turbulence drove the price of gold to a new record high as investors fled to "safe haven" assets. (not investment advice)</p>
