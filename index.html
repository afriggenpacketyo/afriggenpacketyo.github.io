        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two American citizen children, ages four and seven, were reportedly deported to Honduras along with their mother, according to the family's lawyer, adding to concerns about American citizens being caught up in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies. The deportations occurred on the same day as another incident where a two-year-old American citizen was sent to Honduras with her undocumented mother, raising questions about parental choice and family separation. While President Trump's border czar denied any American child was deported, lawyers for the families contend the mothers were not given the option to leave their children in the United States. The incidents have sparked legal and ethical debates about the treatment of families in immigration proceedings. Optimism Score: 30</p>

          <p>The NFL launched an investigation after Shedeur Sanders, who was drafted by the Browns in the fifth round, was subjected to at least two prank calls during the NFL Draft, one of which was revealed to have been made by the son of the Falcons defensive coordinator, Jax Ulbrich. Ulbrich apologized to Sanders for the childish and selfish act, and the Falcons also issued a statement condemning the behavior and apologizing to the Sanders family. Sanders downplayed the impact of the calls, describing them as childish and something he doesn't feed into, while his new head coach called the perpetrators morons.

          <p>A letter written by Titanic survivor Col. Archibald Gracie days before the ship's sinking sold for nearly $400,000 at auction due to its eerie foreshadowing. In the letter, Gracie noted the ship was fine but he would withhold judgment until the end of the journey. Gracie survived the sinking by clinging to a lifeboat and later wrote a book about the disaster, but died months later from related health issues. The auction house believes the letter's high value reflects continued public interest in the Titanic's story and the personal accounts preserved through memorabilia. Optimism Score: 50</p>

          <p>Israel conducted an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs, targeting what it claimed was a Hezbollah store of precision-guided missiles, despite a ceasefire agreement in place. The Lebanese presidency condemned the strike, urging the US and France to press Israel to cease its attacks, warning that such actions undermine stability and threaten regional security. Israel stated that the missile storage constituted a blatant violation of understandings and posed a threat to its civilians. The UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon expressed concern that the strike generated panic and fear of renewed violence. Optimism Score: 25</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval rating is declining as he approaches his first 100 days in office, with new polls indicating growing skepticism among Americans regarding his sweeping policy changes. The polls reveal that a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's performance, with his approval rating hovering between 39% and 45%, the lowest for a newly elected president at this milestone in over seven decades. These ratings reflect a significant shift from the initial boost in favorability Trump experienced upon returning to the White House in January. The data suggests increasing public unease with his administration's direction. Optimism Score: 40</p>

Investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes confirmed the ships' identities, dispelling earlier beliefs that they were pirate vessels. The Danish government banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1792, but the country didn't abolish slavery until half a century later, in 1847, according to the museum.

The law allows the government to seize land without compensation in certain circumstances, leading to accusations of racism and prompting South Africa to appoint a special envoy to Washington to address the concerns.
