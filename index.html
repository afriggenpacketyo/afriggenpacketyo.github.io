          <p>Three climbers from Renton, Washington, lost their lives in a climbing accident in North Cascades National Park. The Okanogan County Sheriff’s Office and Search and Rescue responded to the incident near North Early Winters Spire after receiving reports of a fall. A group of four climbers was descending a steep gully when an anchor failed during rappelling, causing three of them to fall to their deaths. The fourth climber managed to self-extricate and contact law enforcement, while the Snohomish County Helicopter Rescue Team assisted in recovering the deceased. The investigation into the accident is ongoing, and the sheriff’s office expressed condolences to the families and friends of the victims.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching an emergency task force and considering flight reductions to address ongoing safety and efficiency concerns at Newark Liberty International Airport. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed recent telecommunications issues to the previous administration's handling of air traffic control relocation. The task force will include experts from the FAA, Verizon, and L3Harris to identify and resolve the root causes of the disruptions. The FAA will also meet with airlines to discuss potential flight reductions to alleviate congestion, with United Airlines already cutting some flights. These measures aim to improve the airport's infrastructure and prevent future outages, ensuring safer and more reliable travel for passengers.</p>

Ticketmaster will also provide buyers with information on their position in the queue and real-time updates on ticket availability and pricing. The company has faced criticism in the past, particularly after its site crashed during a presale event for a Taylor Swift tour.

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in ten years, driven by recovery in the oil and gas sector and strong performance in technology and finance.

Despite the economic progress, poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty, and inflation is expected to stay above 20%. President Bola Tinubu's government has implemented economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the currency, but these measures have increased the cost of living for many Nigerians.</p>

However, experts caution that gold prices are subject to fluctuations, and previous surges have been followed by significant declines.

The focus is shifting to reducing visceral fat, which is linked to various chronic diseases. GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing this type of fat and improving metabolic health.

Students are granted access to OpenAI's ChatGPT Edu to assist with surgery preparation and improve patient communication. The program ensures HIPAA compliance to protect student and patient privacy. Faculty members say that AI tools save time and enable deeper exploration of knowledge. The integration of AI is viewed as essential for future doctors to learn how to use the technology safely and effectively.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration has engaged Elon Musk's tunneling firm, the Boring Company, to assess the costs and progress of Amtrak's Frederick Douglass Tunnel program. The project, aimed at constructing a new tunnel connecting Baltimore to Washington and Virginia, faces potential cost overruns. The Boring Company claims it can build the tunnel more efficiently and at a lower cost. However, the talks have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to Musk's various business ventures and his role as an advisor to President Trump.</p>
