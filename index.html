        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior White House official indicated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are likely to speak this week following recent trade tensions. Discussions come after disagreements over the scaling back of tariffs and accusations of undermining previous agreements. The U.S. has accused China of delaying critical mineral exports, while China criticized the U.S. for issuing warnings against using Chinese chips, leading to heightened uncertainty in bilateral economic relations. The leaders' conversation aims to address these issues and potentially stabilize the trade relationship between the two countries. Optimism remains that a resolution can be reached to avoid further economic friction.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear a case concerning a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be counted if received up to 14 days after Election Day. The central question is whether the plaintiffs have the legal standing to challenge state regulations regarding federal elections. Republicans argue that counting late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes, while Illinois officials maintain that their deadline does not affect the plaintiffs' likelihood of success in any race. The court's decision could impact the ability of candidates to challenge state election laws in federal court.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, erupted on Monday, releasing a lava fountain and a large ash cloud over Sicily.

Authorities blocked off the summit area to tour groups as a precaution, but there were no immediate reports of danger to the local population. Mount Etna frequently erupts, sometimes covering nearby towns in volcanic dust, but typically without causing major problems.</p>

Amazon disputes these findings, stating that changes would negatively impact customers and sellers, however the investigation is ongoing to determine the legality of Amazon's practices.

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May, contrasting with a decline in sales across Europe. The increase is primarily attributed to the popularity of the revamped Model Y SUV and recent price campaigns. Despite this rebound, Tesla's European sales have suffered due to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities. Norway's strong EV incentives and infrastructure contribute to its leadership in electric vehicle adoption, creating a favorable market for Tesla.</p>

The judge stated that Coskun's actions were "provocative and taunting" and motivated by a deep-seated hatred of Islam and its followers. Coskun's legal fees are being covered by organizations that intend to appeal the verdict, arguing it infringes on free speech.</p>

Newark has experienced radar and radio communication failures, leading to understaffed and overworked air traffic controllers.

The issues include staff retention, training, infrastructure problems, and insufficient funding for maintenance, highlighting the need for drastic changes in air traffic control system management.</p>

The cyber attack is expected to take a £300m bite out of profits, with issues continuing into July, prompting M&S to accelerate digital transformation plans to reinforce cyber defenses.</p>
