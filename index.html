          <p>Hertz announced a strategic partnership with Amazon Autos to sell pre-owned vehicles online, aiming to bolster its retail operations and profitability. Customers can browse thousands of used cars, complete purchases digitally, and pick up vehicles at Hertz locations, with plans for nationwide expansion. This collaboration enhances Hertz's visibility in car sales and expands Amazon's burgeoning autos business, which previously sold only new vehicles. The move is part of Hertz's "Back-to-Basics Roadmap" to revitalize its business after a 2020 bankruptcy and a failed EV strategy.</p>

          <p>A CNBC Fed Survey suggests President Trump will likely nominate Kevin Hassett as the next Federal Reserve chair, despite respondents ranking former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh as more qualified. The survey highlights concerns about Fed independence if Hassett, a close economic advisor to Trump, takes the role, given Trump's pressure for rate cuts. Experts anticipate two Fed rate reductions this year but also high inflation, with the Fed balancing political pressure and economic indicators. Current Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming Jackson Hole speech is highly anticipated for clues on future monetary policy.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has unveiled a controversial plan to cut the number of professional rugby clubs from four to two, deeming it a "radical step" necessary to secure the sport's future in Wales. This proposal puts Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys, and Scarlets at risk, with the WRU considering four models, favoring two equally funded clubs. Chief Executive Abi Tierney acknowledges the emotional impact but stresses the need for change, with a final decision expected in October after a consultation period. The move faces fierce opposition from three of the existing regions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts identify four major factors expected to impact mortgage rates this fall: the Federal Reserve's policy signals, inflation and labor market data, investment activity in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds, and broader geopolitical and economic changes. While the Fed's direct rate changes don't immediately affect mortgages, its future projections are crucial. Persistent inflation or strong job growth could lead to higher rates, whereas cooling inflation or slowing job growth might see rates decline. Overall, experts largely anticipate a modest decrease in mortgage rates by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has demanded the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, following a call by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte for a criminal investigation into Cook's mortgage records. Trump's Truth Social post linked to a report on these allegations, which the Fed has not commented on. This marks an expansion of Trump's attacks on the central bank beyond Chairman Jerome Powell, as he continues to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates. Cook, a Biden nominee, recently voted to keep rates unchanged.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reportedly shelved his plans to launch the "America Party," less than three months after its announcement, opting instead to prioritize his various business ventures. Sources suggest Musk also aimed to avoid siphoning voters from the Republican Party and maintain ties with Vice President JD Vance. While the idea is currently paused, allies indicate a potential revisit closer to the 2026 midterms. This decision follows a period of public feuding between Musk and President Donald Trump, which has since appeared to cool.</p>

          <p>Florida farmers are significantly cutting crop production, with some reducing by as much as 65%, due to a severe shortage of migrant workers driven by fears of increased deportations under President Trump's immigration policies.

The costs associated with legal H2A visa workers are also rising, making them unaffordable for many.

          <p>KSDP, a public radio station in Sand Point, Alaska, faces decimation due to federal funding cuts, threatening a crucial community anchor in a remote Aleutian Island fishing town. With 70% of its budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the station provides essential local news, emergency alerts, and sports commentary, filling a critical media gap. General Manager Austin Roof anticipates significant changes, including the likely closure of its far-reaching AM signal. This situation highlights how federal cuts disproportionately impact rural communities, potentially leaving them without vital local information and services.</p>

          <p>China's crude oil imports remained robust in July, primarily driven by increased shipments from Russia, which became its top source, supplying nearly a fifth of total imports. Concurrently, China's purchases of crude oil from the United States have been suspended for a second consecutive month. This shift highlights China's strategic energy procurement, prioritizing Russian oil amidst global market dynamics. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Malaysia were also significant crude oil suppliers to China last month, contributing to a 2.8% increase in overall crude imports for the first seven months of the year.</p>

          <p>A tragic bus crash in western Afghanistan killed 78 people, including women and 17 children, after a collision involving a bus carrying Afghan migrants, a truck, and a motorcycle. The truck was transporting petroleum, leading to an immediate and fatal fire. The migrants were recently deported from Iran as part of a large-scale operation following heightened regional tensions, facing significant hardships during their transfer. Afghan authorities have arrested the head of the transportation company involved, halting its operations pending investigation. This marks one of Afghanistan's deadliest traffic accidents in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate rose to 3.8% in the year to July, marking its highest level since January 2024, primarily due to significant increases in air fares and food prices. This figure remains above the Bank of England's 2% target, strengthening expectations for a slower pace of interest rate cuts. The Office for National Statistics attributed the jump in air fares to the timing of school holidays, while food price rises were noted across various staples. This persistent inflation continues to strain household finances, particularly for low-income families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of August 20, 2025, national average mortgage rates stand at 6.64% for 30-year fixed loans and 5.82% for 15-year loans, with refinance rates slightly higher. While rates are elevated compared to a few years ago, experts suggest potential relief if the Fed pauses rate hikes. Borrowers can secure better rates by strengthening their credit profiles and shopping around among different lenders. Understanding loan terms, fees, and calculating monthly payments are crucial steps before locking in a rate, ensuring the chosen option aligns with financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed "steady progress" in relations with China, agreeing to resume direct flights and boost trade, while India's Foreign Minister visited Moscow. These diplomatic efforts come amid growing friction with the U.S., particularly after President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Indian goods, citing Russian energy imports. India views these tariffs as unjustified and continues its Russian oil purchases. Experts suggest India's outreach to Beijing and Moscow is an attempt to balance diverse partnerships, protect its strategic autonomy, and use multilateral forums, rather than solely a reaction to U.S. actions.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to save money, with current leading accounts providing returns higher than the inflation rate, and allowing savers to lock in high rates for the term. As of August 20, 2025, national average CD yields are lower than top rates, which can reach over 4% APY, especially from online banks due to lower overhead costs. Short-term CDs, typically six months to one year, often have higher interest rates due to an inverted yield curve. Experts suggest laddering CDs to take advantage of these higher short-term rates while saving long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

This unprecedented move, framed by Trump as addressing "out of control" crime despite data showing a 30-year low, is seen by critics as politically motivated.
