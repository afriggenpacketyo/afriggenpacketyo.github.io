        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Casey Michel's New York Times article argues that President Trump's family is exploiting his office for financial gain, similar to past administrations and officials who overlooked foreign influence in American politics. The article highlights the Trump family's various ventures, including the Executive Branch club, cryptocurrency deals, and Jared Kushner's investments with foreign autocrats. Michel draws parallels to the Clinton Foundation, which faced scrutiny for accepting donations from foreign regimes while Hillary Clinton was in office. The article concludes by advocating for legislation to prevent politicians and their families from profiting from foreign dealings and for stricter enforcement of counter-kleptocracy measures. </p>

          <p>CATL, the world's largest EV battery maker, is diversifying into clean technology ahead of its Hong Kong IPO, aiming to become a leader in China's green energy sector.

CharGo plans to deploy thousands of units globally, targeting Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe by 2026. CATL's EV battery business remains its largest revenue source, but energy storage systems are growing, with net profit increasing despite lower lithium prices. </p>

          <p>Dan Richards' New York Times article contrasts the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. Europe's revitalized night train network aims to compete with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns and supported by EU infrastructure plans. In contrast, the U.S. prioritizes cars and air travel, neglecting investment in rail infrastructure and focusing on niche transportation projects. The article advocates for revitalized railways in America, emphasizing their potential to foster community, connection, and a shared sense of purpose. </p>

          <p>A rare clue at a 1993 Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for Jeanie Childs' killer. Investigators initially suspected Arthur Gray, who lived with Childs, but he had an alibi and his footprints didn't match. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that kept repeating itself. Investigative genetic genealogy linked the DNA to Jerry Westrom, who was later convicted of the murder after his footprints matched those at the scene. </p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, moving away from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This approach involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include the extension of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. Chinese contractors would have exclusive rights to construct and operate the railway for a minimum of 25 years after completion to recoup their investment through toll fees. </p>

The plan would suspend access to comprehensive services for undocumented adults over 19, while those with "unsatisfactory" immigration status would face monthly charges.

          <p>Elton John has branded the government as "absolute losers" over its plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, calling the move a "criminal" act against artists. He feels "incredibly betrayed" by the decision to allow AI firms to use artists' content without payment. The government rejected proposals to force AI companies to disclose their training materials, prompting criticism from the music industry. Sir Elton warned that the plans would "rob young people of their legacy and their income" and threatened legal action if the government does not change course. </p>
