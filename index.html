          <p>The White House has stated that National Guard members deployed to Washington, D.C., may carry weapons to protect federal property and support law enforcement, though they will not be making arrests. This represents a change from earlier guidance, which indicated troops would be unarmed. The deployment is part of a presidential initiative to address crime in the capital, a move that has drawn protests from some residents who point to recent data showing a decline in violent crime.</p>

          <p>The late Charlie Munger, former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, revealed that he stopped carrying most insurance policies once he became wealthy enough to cover potential losses himself. He argued that "all intelligent people" should self-insure against risks they can afford, thereby avoiding the inefficiencies and fraud inherent in the insurance industry. Munger's philosophy highlights a significant divergence in financial strategy between the ultra-rich and the average person, for whom such risks would be financially catastrophic.</p>

          <p>For individuals over 60, cardiologists strongly recommend incorporating salmon into their diet to support cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. As the heart is a muscle, consuming adequate protein is crucial for maintaining its strength and function with age, making omega-3-rich fish an excellent dietary choice.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK High Street, with standalone stores set to reopen years after its previous collapse. Now owned by online retailer Asos, the brand aims to recapture its former "cool" by appealing to both nostalgic millennial shoppers and a new Gen-Z demographic. While facing a challenging retail environment and competition from fast fashion, Topshop's management believes there is a gap in the market for its unique "London girl" aesthetic.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has died in Aberdeen at the age of 105. As a flight lieutenant in 1944, he earned the UK's highest military honor for his bravery during an attack on a German U-boat, where he sustained 72 injuries but successfully destroyed the submarine. Remembered as a great RAF icon, Cruickshank rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions simply as his duty.</p>

          <p>For investors holding significant cash reserves while waiting for a market downturn, having a clear plan is crucial to overcome the fear that often accompanies a bear market. Financial experts advise against investing a lump sum all at once, suggesting instead a strategy of buying in smaller increments over time. If a significant decline occurs, quality dividend stocks and large-cap technology companies are often recommended as potential areas to deploy capital for long-term growth.

          <p>Following deadly sectarian clashes in July, hundreds of people in the southern Syrian city of Sweida held a demonstration demanding self-determination for the Druze minority. Protesters accuse the Syrian government of siding with Bedouin Sunni tribes during the recent violence, which killed around 1,600 people, many of them Druze civilians. The protest marks a significant shift, with activists noting it was the first time the slogan of self-determination has been prominently used by the community in Syria.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is tightening the requirements for legal immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship by expanding the definition of "good moral character." A new policy from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services instructs officers to conduct a more "holistic assessment" that goes beyond a simple criminal background check. The directive includes scrutinizing factors like "adherence to societal norms" and even lawful but "inconsistent with civic responsibility" actions, a move critics argue is designed to create more grounds for denial.</p>
