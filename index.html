          <p>Dr. Gladys Maestre is conducting critical research in South Texas, where nearly 20% of people over 65 suffer from memory loss, significantly higher than the national average. Her study, supported by a new $3 billion state bill pending voter approval, explores genetic, environmental, and generational factors like trauma and poverty. Maestre's work, including blood testing for biomarkers, aims to identify at-risk individuals for early prevention programs. The widespread impact of dementia is evident in families like the Johonnetts, highlighting the urgent need for answers.</p>

The unrest, primarily led by young demonstrators known as Gen Z, stems from chronic electricity and water cuts, alongside widespread poverty. Rajoelina, who also sacked the energy minister, acknowledged public anger and apologized for governmental shortcomings. He announced a three-day timeframe to form a new government, though he gave no indication of stepping down himself.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the 33-year-old founder of Frank, was sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. The bank acquired her fintech startup in 2021 for $175 million based on overstated customer numbers. Javice, found guilty of fraud and conspiracy, expressed remorse in court, but Judge Hellerstein emphasized the need for deterrence. She also faces $22.36 million in forfeiture and $287 million in restitution, remaining on bail while appealing. JPMorgan discovered Frank had fewer than 300,000 real customers, not the five million claimed, after the acquisition.</p>

          <p>Thomas Jacob "Jake" Sanford, a 40-year-old Iraq War veteran, has been identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on a Latter-day Saints church in Grand Blanc, Michigan. Authorities state Sanford drove into the church, fired an assault rifle, and started a fire, killing four people and injuring eight before being fatally shot by police. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt indicated that Sanford "hated people of the Mormon faith," a sentiment echoed by a city council candidate who had recently spoken with him. Sanford reportedly struggled with drug issues post-deployment.</p>

          <p>As a potential government shutdown looms on October 1, hundreds of thousands of federal employees face delayed pay or layoffs, but members of Congress will continue to receive their salaries. This is due to Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution, which mandates their compensation, and a permanent appropriation established in 1983. Most members earn $174,000 annually, unaffected by funding lapses. While essential federal employees work without immediate pay and non-essential ones are furloughed, lawmakers' pay is legally insulated from the shutdown's financial disruptions.</p>

          <p>A looming government shutdown on October 1 would force active-duty military personnel and deployed National Guard members to continue serving without immediate pay. Civilian Defense Department employees deemed essential would also work unpaid, while others face furloughs. Although a 2019 law guarantees back pay for all government employees after a shutdown, military members require separate legislation to ensure continuous pay. Credit unions like Navy Federal and USAA plan to offer special loans to affected service members. The Defense Department has outlined priority missions, including border security and Middle East operations, to be supported by unused funds.</p>

The settlement explicitly states it is not an admission of liability or fault.

          <p>The federal government faces a potential shutdown on October 1 if Congress fails to pass new funding, marking the 15th such event since 1980. A shutdown occurs when agencies cannot spend money unauthorized by lawmakers, leading to a halt in non-essential functions and furloughs for many federal employees. While essential services like Social Security and military operations continue, staff reductions can delay services and potentially lead to mass layoffs, as indicated by a recent OMB memo. The last shutdown in 2018-2019 cost the economy $11 billion, highlighting the significant financial and operational disruptions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has renewed his threat to impose a 100% tariff on all films not made in the U.S., claiming the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries.

The proposal raises questions about its application to streaming services and the definition of an "American-made" movie.

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's new 20-point Gaza peace plan suggests it overstates the likelihood of "eternal peace," despite some significant developments. The plan proposes Hamas release hostages for Palestinian prisoners, Israeli withdrawal, and reformed Palestinian Authority governance, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. However, fundamental disagreements persist, with Hamas unlikely to disarm and Israel's government factions potentially opposing troop withdrawal. Experts believe Netanyahu might be counting on Hamas's refusal, which would give Israel Trump's "full backing" to continue military action, making an immediate end to the war unlikely.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's ChatGPT is expanding into e-commerce with a new "Instant Checkout" feature, enabling users to purchase products directly within the chat interface. Initially partnering with Etsy sellers, ChatGPT will soon integrate with Shopify, offering access to over a million vendors like Glossier and SKIMS. This move into "agentic commerce" allows ChatGPT to act as a shopper's agent, processing transactions with merchants paying a small fee. While currently limited to single-item purchases, this innovation aims to streamline online shopping by allowing users to go from product discovery in AI conversations to checkout in a few taps.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have announced a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, urging Hamas to accept it. The proposal includes an immediate end to military operations, Hamas releasing 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of two dozen others within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. The plan mandates no governance role for Hamas and outlines an "economic development plan" for Gaza, with Israel eventually withdrawing forces. Trump stated he would fully back Netanyahu if Hamas rejects the deal, while British PM Keir Starmer welcomed the initiative.</p>
