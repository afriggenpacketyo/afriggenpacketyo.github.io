          <p>President Trump voiced strong disapproval of Vladimir Putin's intensified attacks on Ukraine, labeling the Russian leader as "absolutely crazy" amidst a surge in drone and missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. Despite past expressions of a good relationship with Putin, Trump expressed frustration over the escalating violence and called out the needless killing of people and destruction of cities. While acknowledging Trump's shift in tone, the Kremlin downplayed his remarks, while some European leaders expressed hope that Trump's anger would translate into concrete action, such as imposing stricter sanctions on Russia. Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, reflecting a complex and evolving stance on the conflict.</p>

          <p>Seventeen Greek coastguards have been charged in connection with the 2023 migrant shipwreck off the coast of Pylos, the deadliest such disaster in the Mediterranean Sea in a decade. The charges follow claims that the coastguard's actions contributed to the sinking of the Adriana fishing vessel, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of migrants. Despite Greek authorities denying these allegations, an investigation revealed inconsistencies in the official account of events. Survivors of the shipwreck, who had previously accused the coastguard of causing the vessel to capsize during a towing attempt, have expressed relief and a sense of vindication following the announcement of the charges.</p>

          <p>Online travel booking data indicates that holidaymakers from countries heavily impacted by President Trump's trade tariffs are increasingly avoiding travel to the United States. Trivago has reported double-digit percentage declines in bookings from Japan, Canada, and Mexico, with Germany also showing a significant decrease. Concerns over an uncertain economy are also prompting UK and US travelers to opt for domestic holidays, with London and Edinburgh being top destinations for British tourists. This "Trump slump" is raising concerns within the $2.6tn tourism industry, as preliminary figures show a decline in overseas visits to the US.</p>

          <p>Rep. Nanette Diaz BarragÃ¡n is urging the FCC to implement multilingual Wireless Emergency Alerts for natural disasters, expressing concern over delays under the Trump administration. This follows deadly fires in Los Angeles affecting communities with limited English proficiency. BarragÃ¡n and other members of Congress have signed a letter to FCC Chair Brendan Carr, emphasizing the need for life-saving information in multiple languages. The FCC had previously approved rules for alerts in more than a dozen languages, but the publication of the order in the Federal Register, a step needed to trigger implementation, has been delayed.</p>
