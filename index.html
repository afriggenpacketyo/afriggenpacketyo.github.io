          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that federal agents have taken into custody the family of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attempted murder in the fire attack on demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. Authorities are investigating whether Soliman's family had any prior knowledge of or supported the attack. The suspect, described as an "illegal alien" and "terrorist" by Noem, will face prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. The investigation aims to determine the extent of the family's involvement or support in the "heinous attack," as Noem continues to pray for the victims and their families. The incident has sparked concerns about potential domestic terrorism and immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>The White House addressed concerns over Acting FEMA Director David Richardson's alleged "jokes" about being unaware of the hurricane season's start, dismissing them as misinterpretations. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt affirmed that FEMA is taking hurricane season seriously, despite reports based on leaked meeting information and jokes. Richardson's comments followed an internal review suggesting FEMA was "not ready" for the 2025 hurricane season, a claim the DHS spokesperson denied. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Ed Markey criticized Richardson's competence, while former FEMA official Dan Stoneking argued the Trump administration is relying on the previous administration's plan due to staffing shortages. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to transgender inmates while they challenge President Trump's executive order restricting such treatments. Judge Royce Lamberth granted a preliminary injunction sought by three transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The lawsuit argues that the executive order violates the Administrative Procedure Act by arbitrarily depriving inmates of medically necessary treatments. The judge found that the administration provided no adequate explanation for treating gender dysphoria differently from other mental health conditions. </p>

Investors are willing to pay more for CrowdStrike's earnings due to its faster growth potential and software subscription model, which leads to higher margins. While both companies are leaders in the cybersecurity industry and are considered long-term holdings, CrowdStrike is seen as having more growth potential.

Documents obtained by CBS News indicate that the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and other vessels named after prominent leaders are also on the renaming "recommended list." Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi criticized the potential name changes as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality.

          <p>Los Angeles Opera concluded its season with a new production of Verdi's "Rigoletto," featuring a violent and politically disquieting interpretation. Baritone Quinn Kelsey's performance as Rigoletto was praised for its intensity, set against a backdrop of mob rule inspired by films of Federico Fellini and Luis Buñuel. Despite some shortcomings in the set design, the cast's strength and James Conlon's conducting contributed to a compelling performance. Lisette Oropesa's portrayal of Gilda and René Barbera's performance as the Duke also garnered positive reviews. </p>

          <p>With above-normal temperatures expected this summer, Americans are likely to face higher electricity bills. Home electricity bills are projected to reach a 12-year high, impacting lower-income households the most.

Other tips include using indoor plants for shade, closing curtains during the day, and unplugging unused appliances. State governments and utility companies may offer assistance programs to help reduce energy costs. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering longstanding U.S. immigration policy. The proposal would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a difficult timeframe to meet given current backlogs. Asylum seekers would also be required to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit. Advocates express concerns that the change could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and drive them to work illegally. </p>

Trump's growing frustration with Putin, particularly regarding the bombardment of cities, has emboldened some Republicans to speak out on the conflict. The bill, backed by Graham and Senator Richard Blumenthal, could serve as a tool to increase pressure on Russia and its enablers. </p>
