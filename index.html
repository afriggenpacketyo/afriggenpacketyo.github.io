        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration were a key factor in the central bank's decision to delay interest rate cuts. Speaking at a forum, Powell explained that the tariffs led to upward revisions in inflation forecasts, prompting the Fed to adopt a "wait and see" approach to monitor their economic impact. He stressed the importance of the Fed's political independence, asserting that their decisions are made to ensure macroeconomic stability for all Americans without political influence. This stance comes amid public criticism from President Trump regarding the Fed's interest rate policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Republican tax-and-spending package aims to permanently enact President Trump's 2017 tax cuts while introducing new breaks and significantly altering social safety nets. Key provisions include raising the SALT deduction cap, increasing the child tax credit, and creating a "bonus" deduction for seniors. The bill also proposes overhauling student loan programs, cutting funding for Medicaid and SNAP, and eliminating clean energy tax credits. These changes could have a broad financial impact on millions of American households if the legislation is enacted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republican-led spending bill, if passed, would cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid, potentially leaving nearly 12 million people uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The legislation introduces strict new work requirements for beneficiaries and limits states' ability to fund their Medicaid programs, which could be devastating for rural hospitals that heavily rely on this federal funding. Critics, including the American Nurses Association, warn these changes could lead to hospital closures and reduced access to essential healthcare services in already vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>Following the Senate's narrow passage of President Trump's large-scale spending bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a significant challenge in securing its approval in the House. Several conservative members have already voiced opposition to the Senate's version, citing its higher price tag, increased debt ceiling, and what they consider insufficient budget cuts. With a razor-thin majority and a self-imposed July 4 deadline, any further Republican defections could derail the legislation. The outcome remains uncertain as the bill returns to the lower chamber for a final vote.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited a new migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, which he dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," intended to house up to 3,000 detainees. The administration claims the surrounding swampland, inhabited by alligators and other wildlife, will serve as a natural deterrent to escape. The facility has drawn strong opposition from environmental groups, local officials, and residents over concerns about its impact on the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. The administration stated the center is part of a broader strategy to crack down on illegal immigration and encourage self-deportation.</p>

While acknowledging the legal uncertainty of such a policy, he stated he would pursue it "in a heartbeat" if legally permissible. This proposal follows a memo from a Trump-appointed Justice Department official granting U.S. attorneys wider discretion in denaturalization cases.

          <p>France has enacted a sweeping new law that bans smoking in most public areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in an effort to "denormalize" tobacco use. The move aims to protect public health, particularly children, as over 200 people in France die from tobacco-related illnesses daily. Violators of the new ban face fines up to 700 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. While smoking has been illegal in restaurants and bars since 2008, this law extends the restrictions significantly, with sidewalk cafÃ© terraces remaining one of the last public refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>Retailer Nordstrom will be closing its Santa Monica Place store in August as part of a broader strategy to adapt to the shift towards online shopping. The store has been an anchor of the downtown Santa Monica mall for about 15 years. While the company cited a focus on its digital channels and surrounding stores, the closure also occurs amidst ongoing concerns about public safety and crime in the Santa Monica area. This move is part of a larger trend of major retailers, including Macy's and Walmart, restructuring their physical store networks.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team defeated England by 24 runs in Bristol, taking a commanding 2-0 lead in their five-match T20 series. After an early stumble, India recovered to post a strong total of 181-4, thanks to impressive half-centuries from Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur. In response, England's batting lineup faltered early and could not recover, managing only 157-7 despite a notable 54 from Tammy Beaumont. The result highlights England's ongoing batting struggles and India's growing confidence ahead of the upcoming 50-over World Cup.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis's announcement that he will not seek reelection has ignited a fierce, wide-open race for his North Carolina Senate seat in 2026. On the Republican side, potential candidates include the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who has received his endorsement, and several congressmen. For the Democrats, former Governor Roy Cooper is strongly considering a run and is seen as a top contender, though former U.S. Representative Wiley Nickel has already entered the race. The open seat presents a key opportunity for Democrats to flip a seat in the closely divided Senate.</p>

          <p>A revamped CDC advisory panel, which now includes members known for vaccine skepticism, has voted to recommend against the use of flu vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. This recommendation, which the CDC must still approve, targets a substance long criticized by the anti-vaccine movement despite numerous studies finding no evidence of harm. While only a small percentage of the U.S. flu vaccine supply contains thimerosal, public health experts worry the move could reduce vaccine availability and reinforce unfounded fears, potentially leading to fewer vaccinations.</p>
