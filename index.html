          <p>Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is projected to win a crucial by-election in the Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot, ensuring his return to the House of Commons. Poilievre secured a commanding lead with over 80% of the vote in the conservative stronghold, a special election called after the previous MP stepped aside. This victory comes four months after his party's defeat in the general election and allows him to re-enter parliament ahead of a mandatory party leadership review scheduled for January.</p>

          <p>In a question-and-answer session, Formula 1 experts address various fan inquiries, dismissing the idea of artificially wetting tracks as it would compromise the sport's purity. The discussion highlights aesthetically celebrated cars like the 1990 Ferrari 641, once displayed in the Museum of Modern Art, and the current McLaren MCL39. The article also explains the technical differences between a car's performance in qualifying versus a race, attributing it to how peak tire grip can mask a car's deficiencies over a single lap. Finally, it clarifies the strict FIA rules governing engine and gearbox replacements.</p>

          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery has successfully reached its £3.8 million fundraising target to acquire Dame Barbara Hepworth's sculpture, "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red." The 1943 piece, which had been in private ownership, was placed under a temporary export ban due to its cultural significance. The campaign received widespread support, including over 2,800 public donations and major grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund. The rare wooden carving will now go on permanent public display in the artist's home city of Wakefield.</p>

          <p>The landmark 113-year-old Kiruna Church in Sweden is being moved 5 kilometers to a new site to make way for the expansion of the world's largest underground iron ore mine. The massive relocation project, financed by mine operator LKAB, involves lifting the 672-ton wooden structure onto remote-controlled trailers for a two-day journey. While celebrated as an engineering feat, the mine's expansion has drawn criticism from the indigenous Sami community, who warn that it threatens their traditional reindeer migration routes and livelihoods. Thousands of residents are also being relocated as mining activity weakens the ground beneath the original town center.</p>

The visit signals a continued thaw in relations, which had deteriorated after a deadly 2020 border clash. Discussions covered a range of topics including trade, border stability, and global developments, with both sides expressing a desire to move forward from a difficult period. This rapprochement occurs as India's relationship with the United States faces new challenges, particularly over trade tariffs and foreign policy.</p>

The National Bureau of Statistics data highlights the economic pressures facing young people in the country. In response, Beijing has initiated several campaigns aimed at providing support services, including career guidance and training opportunities, to help jobless youth secure employment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Sky News analysis, the diplomatic situation regarding the war in Ukraine has worsened, pushing peace further away. The consensus among allies was that maximum pressure, including sanctions on Russia's oil industry and an immediate ceasefire, was necessary to compel Vladimir Putin to relent. However, President Trump's recent reversal on these key points has lessened that pressure, seemingly aligning more with Moscow's position. This shift has put immense pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to consider ceding territory in exchange for vague security guarantees, a development viewed with skepticism in Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev commented that European leaders failed in their attempt to influence President Donald Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. In a social media post, Medvedev stated that the "anti-Russian warmongering Coalition of the Willing failed to outplay @POTUS on his turf," suggesting Europe ultimately deferred to Trump's position. He also questioned how Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would present the outcomes of the talks, particularly on territorial concessions and security guarantees, upon his return to Ukraine. The comments follow a summit where Trump offered U.S. support for Ukraine's security in a potential peace deal.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has agreed to participate in a trilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite the absence of a ceasefire.

The change in stance occurred after Trump's recent meeting with Putin, raising questions about what concessions, if any, Russia has made.

          <h2>Revamped US Open Mixed Doubles Event Sparks Controversy and Excitement</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Open has revamped its mixed doubles competition, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, and Novak Djokovic with a shorter format and a $1 million prize. The move is intended to elevate the event's profile and draw more fan interest, but it has polarized the tennis community. While some praise the initiative for its promotional value, many doubles specialists, like Jamie Murray, have criticized it as a "glorified exhibition." They argue it devalues the Grand Slam title and redirects significant prize money away from career doubles players to singles stars who are already top earners.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized artificial intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were transported to Australia in the 19th century. A team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals deported from Anglesey for crimes ranging from theft to trampling on turnips. The AI profiles were created using detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and, where available, photos of modern-day descendants. The project sheds light on a period when an estimated 162,000 convicts were sent to Australia, with many never returning and instead forging new lives and families.</p>

          <p>A woman who was sexually assaulted on a Qatar Airways flight to London has been denied compensation from the UK's Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS). The perpetrator was convicted and jailed in the UK, but her application was refused because the crime occurred on a foreign-registered aircraft. Although UK law was amended in 1996 to allow for the prosecution of such crimes, the compensation scheme was not updated accordingly. Her lawyers are now calling on the Justice Secretary to close this legal gap, arguing it is irrational to prosecute an offender in the UK but deny their victim access to compensation.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the recent White House summit suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin's influence over President Donald Trump was significant, despite his absence. Key moments highlighted this dynamic, including Trump's sudden reversal on the need for a ceasefire, a position that now aligns with Moscow's. Furthermore, Trump interrupted the meeting with European leaders to take a phone call with Putin, reinforcing the perception that Russia's perspective was being prioritized. These actions suggest that any forthcoming peace proposal is likely to be heavily shaped by the Kremlin's objectives, with Moscow aiming to maintain leverage by negotiating a settlement before any ceasefire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing travel trend, dubbed "coolcations," is seeing tourists avoid Europe's traditional summer hotspots in favor of cooler, quieter, and off-peak destinations. This shift is driven by concerns over record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires that have plagued southern Europe. Data from the European Travel Commission shows declining interest in popular Mediterranean destinations, while travel to Nordic countries, the Baltics, and alpine regions is increasing. While this trend may alleviate overtourism, it poses economic challenges for southern European nations heavily reliant on summer tourism, forcing the industry to adapt to a changing climate.</p>

          <p>A former coach at an elite U.S. gymnastics academy, Sean Gardner, has been arrested by the FBI on a federal child pornography charge, years after allegations of sexual abuse first surfaced. Gardner was suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022 following reports that he sexually abused at least three young gymnasts at Chow's Gymnastics in Iowa and secretly recorded others in Mississippi. Despite the suspension, his disciplinary case remains unresolved by SafeSport, and he was able to secure a hospital job in 2024. The case highlights ongoing concerns about the slow and opaque process for investigating abuse allegations in Olympic sports.</p>

          <p>While the United States is experiencing significant declines in its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has surged to a record 15 million colonies, solidifying its position as the world's top apiary producer. According to Chinese researchers, the key difference lies in management practices. The U.S. model often involves large-scale, clustered operations with thousands of hives and minimal intervention, making them more vulnerable to collapse. In contrast, Chinese beekeeping typically involves smaller, family-run apiaries with more intensive, hands-on management that allows for quicker responses to potential threats.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that the European Union's failure to take decisive action against Israel's conduct in Gaza is rooted in structural racism and a lingering colonial mentality. The author contrasts the EU's swift and severe sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine with its paralysis regarding Gaza, where it has not suspended its trade agreement with Israel despite alleged human rights breaches. This disparity, the article contends, reflects a dehumanizing logic that is also applied to racialized Europeans and refugees. The author calls for an urgent reckoning within the EU to confront these double standards to restore its credibility.</p>

Collier is protesting both the new congressional maps and the requirement to be escorted, which she views as an infringement on her right to oppose government actions.

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied preliminary injunctions for USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson, effectively ending their hopes of playing this season. Both players had sued the NCAA, arguing that its Five-Year Rule, which limits eligibility, violated antitrust laws by restricting their NIL earning potential. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility rule was not "commercial in nature" and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny. The decision deals a significant blow to both teams, who had recruited the players for starting roles and offered them substantial NIL compensation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 4-3 walk-off loss to the Colorado Rockies, with defensive miscues playing a central role in the defeat. Right fielder Teoscar Hernández made two costly plays, including a throw to the wrong base that allowed a run to score and a failure to secure a catch in the ninth inning that set up the game-winning hit. Following the game, shortstop Mookie Betts, a six-time Gold Glove winner in right field, met with manager Dave Roberts and president Andrew Friedman. The meeting has fueled speculation about potential defensive adjustments, including possibly moving Betts back to the outfield.</p>
