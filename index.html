          <p>The Senate has finalized its version of a major tax and spending package, incorporating several of former President Trump's key policy goals. The 940-page bill includes extensions of the 2017 tax cuts, new temporary tax breaks, and a controversial $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling. After negotiations, a "revenge tax" provision targeting foreign investment was removed, while a deal was reached to raise the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. The bill also contains significant cuts to Medicaid and eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with a series of significant wins for conservative states and former President Trump's assertions of executive power. While lacking a single blockbuster ruling like in previous years, the court's 6-3 conservative majority expanded states' rights on issues like transgender medical treatments and online age-verification laws. The court also reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural victory for the Trump administration. This term reflects a strong "states-rights" style of conservatism and a judiciary grappling with the scope of presidential authority.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, a well-preserved 9,000-year-old city in modern-day Turkey, suggests it may have been a matrilineal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring tended to remain in their birth homes. The findings, which also show females received more grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures.</p>

          <p>In the week following the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, descriptions of the mission's success have varied among officials, sparking questions about the extent of the damage. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed the program was "obliterated," subsequent intelligence reports and statements from other aides presented a more nuanced picture. Leaked assessments suggested the setback to Iran's program might only be temporary, and officials later acknowledged the difficulty in confirming damage to the deeply buried Fordo facility. The administration's focus also shifted to crediting the strikes with achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.</p>

          <p>Large-scale protests, led by students, took place in Belgrade as tens of thousands of demonstrators demanded early parliamentary elections. The rally is the latest in a series of actions against populist President Aleksandar Vucic, which began after a deadly rail station collapse last year blamed on government negligence. Protesters have issued an ultimatum, threatening a campaign of civil disobedience if the government does not call for a snap vote. President Vucic has rejected the demands, blaming "foreign powers" for fueling the unrest, while his supporters held a counter-demonstration.</p>

          <p>Concerns over press freedom in Kenya are growing following a harsh government response to recent anti-government protests, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries.

Journalists and activists report being targeted with violence and legal threats under a controversial cybercrime law.

This emerging strategy aims to energize conservative voters and defend Republican congressional majorities.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their tour of Australia with a decisive victory over the Western Force, scoring eight tries in a high-scoring match. The win was tempered by an injury concern for Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who left the field with a tight hamstring. The team's performance showcased an ambitious, attacking style of play, with fly-half Finn Russell's creativity on full display. While the high penalty count in the first half was an issue, the overall start to the tour was considered positive as the team prepares for its next match in Brisbane.</p>

          <p>Lockheed Martin, in partnership with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, has successfully completed a complex flight test of its Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR). During the test, designated FTO-26a, the LRDR system detected, tracked, and discriminated a live, air-launched ballistic missile target that was equipped with countermeasures. The test, conducted over the north Pacific Ocean, successfully demonstrated the advanced radar's ability to distinguish a genuine threat from decoys and other clutter. This marks a significant milestone for the missile defense system's capabilities.</p>
