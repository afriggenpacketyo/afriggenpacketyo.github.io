          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is furthering discussions with Cypriot leaders regarding Cyprus's potential role in the India-Middle East-Europe trade corridor, a venture intended to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative. Modi's visit to Cyprus is seen as a message to Turkey, a rival neighbor that has openly supported Pakistan over India in recent cross-border hostilities. The proposed trade link, known as the IMEC, aims to connect India with Europe via sea and railway. A memorandum of understanding was reportedly facilitated between the National Payments Corporation of India and the Eurobank of Cyprus to introduce UPI services for cross-border transactions. Optimism remains about the potential for stronger trade relations between India and Europe. </p>

          <p>Shares of French fashion house Kering experienced a 7% increase following reports that Luca de Meo, an industry outsider, has been appointed as the group's CEO. This comes as Kering, the owner of brands like Gucci and Saint Laurent, undertakes a turnaround effort. De Meo, known for his successful turnaround of Renault, brings experience in brand management and marketing. Challenges remain for the luxury sector, with Kering facing declining sales at Gucci, which constitutes nearly half of the group's revenue. Despite the challenges, the potential for brand rejuvenation and steady revenue generation offers a positive outlook for the company. </p>

          <p>European leaders are showing renewed interest in Southeast Asia amidst Washington's aggressive tariff policies, but experts caution that existing regional trade dynamics make it challenging to displace the influence of the U.S. or China. French President Emmanuel Macron has advocated for stronger ties between Europe and the Indo-Pacific, drawing parallels between China's actions in the South China Sea and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While Europe offers Southeast Asia an alternative to hedge against overdependence on either China or the United States, economic ties remain crucial for the region. Without significant reforms and increased trade, it will be difficult for Europe to compete with established trading partners in Southeast Asia. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland is set to export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a current lack of incinerator capacity to handle the additional demand created by the ban on biodegradable municipal waste. While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites, the short-term impact will be an increase in emissions from transporting waste to England. The long-term strategy involves reducing household waste generation and increasing recycling rates, but domestic recycling rates have seen minimal improvement in the past decade. </p>

          <p>As anti-ICE protests continue in major U.S. cities, a retired FBI agent suggests that those engaging in violent actions may face federal charges, potentially labeled as 'domestic terrorism'. The Department of Justice emphasizes that it will charge the most serious provable offenses, with nothing 'off the table'. The government may use existing laws to file charges such as arson, assault on federal officers, destruction of property, or conspiracy. Law enforcement analysts attribute the escalating riots to a core group of organized agitators who infiltrate peaceful protests to provoke violence. </p>

The measures include making it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip) in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The prime minister insists that the system is not working and needs reform. Proposals include tightening eligibility for Pip, which could affect up to 1.3 million people across England and Wales, potentially pushing an extra 250,000 people into relative poverty. </p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of this century due to global warming. Warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart and drift downstream, refreezing and accumulating in colder areas, leading to ice jams. These localized hazards can cause destructive flooding, damaging downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. The study emphasizes that climate warming is shifting the geographic distribution of ice jam hotspots downstream. </p>
