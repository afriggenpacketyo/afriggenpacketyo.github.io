        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) reveals that the recent power outage and fire that shut down Heathrow Airport was caused by an electrical substation problem first identified seven years ago. The issue involved moisture entering electrical components, leading to a short circuit and subsequent fire at the North Hyde substation. This catastrophic failure disrupted power for nearly 67,000 customers and affected around 270,000 passenger journeys. Heathrow Airport has criticized National Grid for failing to maintain its infrastructure and cited outdated regulations as contributing factors to the incident.</p>

          <p>A large fire and multiple explosions occurred at a fireworks facility in Esparto, California, prompting a significant emergency response. The blaze, which began Tuesday evening, burned over 70 acres and destroyed an outbuilding, though no homes were lost. Authorities issued a one-mile evacuation order around the site, and officials urged the public to avoid the area for several days. Fortunately, no injuries have been reported as of late Tuesday night, and the cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the State Fire Marshal's arson and bomb team.</p>

To facilitate the signing, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will now be a free agent. The article also details other significant league transactions, including Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's record-setting $285 million extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new version of a major domestic policy bill proposed by the Trump administration includes a significant boost for the semiconductor industry, increasing tax credits for US-based chip manufacturing from 25% to 35%. This measure aims to incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to expand their advanced production facilities within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The legislation, which still needs to pass the House, reflects Washington's ongoing efforts to onshore the chip supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. Analysts suggest the threat of tariffs combined with these enhanced credits will likely accelerate domestic investment from major chipmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

Simultaneously, Ukraine is attempting to pin down elite Russian troops in the northeastern Sumy region to prevent their redeployment to the east.

          <p>As copper emerges as a critical mineral for the global green energy transition, China is strategically increasing its investments in Africa to secure its supply. Chinese companies are heavily funding mining and processing facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, and are now expanding their focus to Botswana. This move is driven by the essential role of copper in technologies like EVs and solar power, as well as by Western restrictions on Chinese access to mineral assets in other regions.

The last-minute concession to scrap proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) has angered both rebels and loyal MPs.

          <p>An opinion piece co-authored by Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz argues that the G7 has undermined global tax fairness by agreeing to exempt U.S. multinational corporations from a previously agreed-upon 15% minimum tax rate. The authors contend this deal prioritizes corporate profits over public interest, re-igniting a "race to the bottom" on tax rates and disadvantaging non-U.S. companies. They criticize the decision for weakening the landmark Pillar Two agreement, which was designed to curb tax avoidance by large corporations. The article calls for a rejection of the G7 deal and a renewed push for a more equitable international tax system through the UN. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo could be finalized in time, while Japan's government stated it would not make concessions that could harm its agricultural sector.
