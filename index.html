          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will resume cryptocurrency investing this year, reversing its 2023 decision to halt crypto services due to regulatory concerns. This move follows new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, signaling a more favorable environment for banks engaging with digital assets. SoFi plans to integrate crypto and blockchain capabilities across its product areas, reflecting a broader trend of financial institutions exploring crypto opportunities under the Trump administration. The company's Q1 results exceeded expectations, prompting it to raise its 2025 revenue and earnings guidance.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term and his policies toward Canada, including tariffs and annexation threats, have significantly altered the Canadian election. Initially, the Liberal Party was trailing far behind the Conservatives, but Trump's actions sparked anger among Canadians, leading to a boycott of American products and a surge in support for the Liberals after Justin Trudeau's resignation and Mark Carney's election as the new leader. Carney's experience in navigating international financial crises is seen as an asset in countering Trump's rhetoric, while the Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has struggled to address the challenges posed by the Trump administration. This shift highlights the impact of international relations on domestic politics.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars announced plans to cut costs by 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) and withdrew its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026 due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter.

          <p>Economists are criticizing President Trump's economic policies, particularly his use of tariffs, for failing to stimulate growth and potentially reigniting inflation. Surveys suggest a slowdown in the U.S. economy, with concerns that tariffs will disrupt supply chains and increase costs for consumers. While the White House defends its "America First" policies, economists warn of a possible recession due to the impact of tariffs and inconsistent policy decisions. Consumers express skepticism about Trump's ability to lower prices, and businesses cite tariffs as a source of disruption. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease some tariffs on automakers to prevent them from being doubly impacted by import duties on car parts, steel, and aluminum. Automakers will still face a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts, but will be reimbursed for the 25% import duty on steel and aluminum. General Motors postponed its first-quarter conference call to assess the potential impact of these tariff changes, while Ford CEO Jim Farley praised Trump's decision.

Homan's claim stems from the administration's decision to designate certain gangs, including MS-13, as terrorist organizations. El Salvador's president has stated he has no intention of sending Abrego Garcia back to the United States, while a federal judge has ordered a deadline for the Trump administration's response on its efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

          <p>A large fire that spread from an electricity substation to a block of flats in north-west London has been brought under control by the London Fire Brigade (LFB). Approximately 80 residents were safely evacuated, and no injuries have been reported. The fire, which broke out at about 05:30 BST, sent large clouds of grey smoke into the air, and the cause was determined to be a "fault on a piece of equipment" in the UK Power Networks substation. The substation remained operational, and there were no interruptions to the electricity supply.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to travel to Michigan on the 100th day of his second term to demonstrate his commitment to American manufacturing. He will visit Selfridge Air National Guard Base and speak at a rally in Macomb Community College. The trip comes at a time when many people are growing dissatisfied with his economic agenda, as his expansive tariffs have hurt the stock market and contributed to a drop in his approval rating. Trump aims to send a message that he is working for Americans left behind by globalization and will highlight the support of the United Auto Workers for his tariff policies.</p>

Carney vowed to stand up to the US and has agreed to begin negotiations with President Trump about a new economic and security relationship. The Liberals may introduce legislation focused on securing Canada's economy in the face of US tariff headwinds, including a tax cut for middle-class Canadians and speeding up approval for key energy and mining proposals. It remains uncertain whether the Liberals will secure a majority government.</p>

          <p>Nearly a month into the US President Donald Trump’s self-proclaimed “ Liberation Day ” trade war, Washington has retreated, at least temporarily , on tariffs against most nations – even admitting its sky-high duties on Chinese imports are unsustainable. Trump has extended multiple olive branches to start negotiations with President Xi Jinping Yet Beijing’s resolve remains unshaken: no negotiations unless the tariffs are lifted. China’s response has been measured, almost restrained. Its strategy seems to hinge on forcing the US to negotiate as an equal, trading concessions for a “big deal” to de-escalate tensions.</p>
