          <h2>York MP Advocates for Reconsideration of Alcohol Ban at Football Stadiums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:09:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luke Charters, the MP for York Outer, is calling for a re-evaluation of the 1985 legislation that prohibits alcohol consumption in view of the pitch at English football matches. Charters argues that the ban creates an inconsistency, as fans of other sports are permitted to drink while watching games. He suggests conducting trials, similar to those in the women's game, to assess the potential impact of lifting the restrictions, particularly in lower leagues, while maintaining family-friendly zones. The Football Supporters Association supports the MP's proposal and welcomes such trials.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the use of taxpayer money to fund religious schools, citing the proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma as a focal point. The author expresses concern over the Catholic Church's history of sexual abuse cases and questions the need for public funding given the church's existing wealth. Drawing a parallel to Pontius Pilate's actions, the piece warns of the potential for corruption and tyranny when secular power exerts control over religious life, advocating for the separation of church and state as a safeguard against theocracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can successfully survive and thrive in the wild, offering hope for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into restored and artificial wetlands in Mexico City, revealing they gained weight, hunted effectively, and avoided predators. This is significant because it indicates that axolotls can adapt to man-made environments, which could help mitigate habitat degradation and climate change impacts. The success of this reintroduction effort is particularly meaningful for Mexicans, as axolotls are an important part of their culture and history.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers claim they can track advanced U.S. stealth radars with centimeter accuracy using modified commercial detection gear. According to a peer-reviewed paper, commercially available spectrum analyzers can pinpoint emissions from U.S. low-probability-of-intercept radar (LPIR), even through electronic jamming. This development could potentially alter the dynamics of electronic warfare. LPIR is used in U.S. air and missile defense systems and fitted on stealth bombers, fighters, submarines, and drones.</p>

          <p>Cases of whooping cough are on the rise in the United States, with health officials preparing for another challenging year. According to preliminary CDC data, there have been 8,485 reported cases in 2025, doubling the number compared to the same period last year. Experts attribute this increase to declining vaccination rates and a cyclical pattern of the disease. The disease is more dangerous for babies, so vaccination is recommended for pregnant mothers. Pennsylvania and Michigan are among the states most affected, with efforts focused on tracking and managing cases amid limited resources.</p>
