          <h2>Abercrombie & Fitch Reports Mixed Q2, Hollister Sales Surge Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 08:45:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a mixed fiscal second quarter, with its namesake brand's sales growth slowing, while the teen-focused Hollister brand surged by 19%, leading to a 7% overall sales increase. The company exceeded Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, prompting an upward revision of its full-year revenue outlook to 5-7% growth. Despite this, Abercrombie's profit outlook for the current quarter is weaker than anticipated, partly due to a near-doubling of tariff costs, now projected at $90 million, affecting goods from key Asian manufacturing regions. The retailer is actively pursuing new growth avenues, including expanding into categories like athleisure and bridal, and forming strategic partnerships such as becoming the NFL's first official fashion partner. This diversification aims to bolster sales and maintain relevance in a challenging consumer market, though analysts note the brand still faces questions about sustained growth.</p>

          <h2>CBS News Analysis Shows Violent Crime Decline in D.C. Following National Guard Deployment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 08:42:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis of Washington, D.C., crime data indicates a significant nearly 50% reduction in violent crime during the three weeks after President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement, when compared to the same period in the previous year. The review also highlighted substantial drops in burglaries and car thefts. Contrary to some suggestions, the analysis found that federal agents were primarily deployed in areas with historically higher crime rates, including violent and gun-related offenses. The White House reported over 1,000 arrests and 115 firearms seized, yet local police data revealed a pre-existing downward trend in crime. D.C. Council members, however, voiced concerns that the heavy federal presence was deterring local businesses and scaring residents, while some community leaders lauded the deployments for improving public safety.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Mortgage Demand and Rates Remain Stagnant Despite Fed Governor's Dismissal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 08:42:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. mortgage demand remained largely unchanged last week, with total application volume falling by a slight 0.5%, as the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage held at 6.69%. While refinance applications decreased by 4%, purchase applications rose by 2%, marking the strongest week for homebuying demand in a month, albeit from a low base. This modest increase suggests prospective buyers are becoming less rate-sensitive, encouraged by growing inventory and cooling home-price growth in various regions. Interestingly, mortgage rates showed no immediate reaction to President Trump's announcement of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's dismissal, an event that some analysts believe could pave the way for a more aggressive stance on interest rate cuts from the White House.

          <h2>Italian Farmers Install Turnstiles to Manage Overtourism in Dolomites, Charging Access to Paths</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 08:40:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italian farmers in the Dolomites have resorted to installing turnstiles on popular mountain paths, charging visitors around $5 for access, as a direct response to surging tourist numbers and overtourism. This measure, implemented since early July, aims to protect private land and meadows from being damaged by constant foot traffic and picnicking, which impacts the grass needed for hay. Locals, including the president of the Alto Adige Alpine Club, expressed strong opposition to influencers who they believe misrepresent the mountain's true nature for commercial gain. While tourist arrivals in the region have increased significantly, local authorities have yet to decide on a broader strategy, leaving farmers to manage the immediate impact and highlighting the growing tension between tourism and local livelihoods.</p>

          <p>A recent Realtor.com report indicates a significant rise in U.S. homeowners delisting their properties without a sale, with figures up 38% since early 2025 and 48% year-over-year, signaling growing seller frustration. This trend suggests a potential deadlock in the housing market, as many homeowners, often locked into lower mortgage rates, are reluctant to reduce their asking prices despite a cooling market. Although the supply of homes for sale has increased, high prices and elevated mortgage rates continue to deter buyers, resulting in stagnant sales. Experts note that sellers' price expectations, influenced by the pandemic housing boom, are slow to adjust to current market realities. This dynamic keeps buyers and sellers apart, prolonging a holding pattern in the market, with some regions like Miami showing particular resistance to price reductions.</p>

          <p>Canada Goose's New York-listed shares climbed over 15% in premarket trading after CNBC reported that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the winter-clothing manufacturer private. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have reportedly submitted verbal offers, valuing the company at around $1.35 billion, calculated at eight times its 12-month average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Bain Capital, with Goldman Sachs advising, is currently holding off on a decision, anticipating additional offers. This development marks a substantial gain for Bain Capital, which acquired control of Canada Goose in 2013 for approximately $250 million, highlighting a strong return on investment despite the company's market value being significantly lower than its 2018 peak.

          <p>The Indus water dispute between India and Pakistan has escalated, with India theoretically suspending the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after a deadly attack in India-administered Kashmir, linking water flow to Pakistan's credible action against cross-border terrorism. New Delhi has rejected a recent ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that generally directed India to allow unrestricted water flow to Pakistan, citing the court's lack of jurisdiction and legitimacy. Experts warn of a potential "broader Asian hydro-politics axis," with Pakistan likely to internationalize the issue and India possibly accelerating infrastructure development to increase pressure. The rivers are crucial for millions in Pakistan, especially for agriculture, and while official diplomatic channels are frozen, informal back-channel engagement focusing on technical fixes is seen as the only hope for de-escalation, underscoring the deep political mistrust.</p>

          <p>A devastating incident at a Colorado dairy farm led to the deaths of six workers, including a teenager, due to gas exposure in an underground manure pit, highlighting the extreme dangers of this agricultural practice. The tragedy, reportedly caused by the accidental release of hydrogen sulfide from decomposing cow manure, is not isolated, with similar fatal incidents occurring across the U.S. This grim reality exposes significant gaps in labor law and enforcement within the agricultural sector, as farms are often exempt from stringent OSHA safety standards, including those for confined spaces. Critics attribute these regulatory loopholes to "agricultural exceptionalism" and powerful industry lobbying, arguing that without comprehensive reforms and better funding for safety oversight, more such preventable deaths are inevitable in one of America's most hazardous industries.</p>

The industry is also plagued by labor abuses, including "sweatshop" conditions and organized crime, leading to worker exploitation and violence.

          <p>UK energy regulator Ofgem has announced a 2% increase in the energy price cap, effective October, which will raise the typical annual household bill by £35 to £1,755. This rise, slightly exceeding analyst expectations, comes as families already face increasing food costs. The hike is attributed to higher energy transmission costs and additional government support measures for vulnerable consumers, which are funded through increased standing charges for all billpayers. Campaigners warn that this means another winter of high energy prices for many households, exacerbating existing energy debt. Consumers are advised to explore fixed-price deals, which can be significantly cheaper than the variable rate, and to seek available financial support to mitigate the impact of rising costs.</p>

Analysts suggest that if successful, this move could allow Trump to gain a majority on the Fed board, potentially influencing monetary policy and pushing for aggressive interest rate cuts.

          <p>OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, released a report touting AI's economic benefits in California, including job creation and increased productivity for its nine million weekly users in the state. The report showcased AI's applications in wildfire forecasting and assisting doctors and farmers, with a significant user base among younger demographics. This release coincides with heightened scrutiny over AI safety, including a lawsuit alleging ChatGPT coached a teen on suicide methods and a letter from attorneys general warning companies about harmful content for children. While the Trump administration favors deregulation, California is considering guardrails that could significantly impact the industry, balancing economic opportunity with safety concerns and potential job displacement.</p>

          <h2>New Study Reveals Billionaires Pay Lower Effective Tax Rate Than Average Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 07:58:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by University of California, Berkeley, economists reveals that individuals on the Forbes 400 list paid an average effective tax rate of 24% from 2018-2020, significantly lower than the 30% rate for other U.S. taxpayers. This disparity is partly attributed to President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which reduced the effective rate for the wealthiest from 30% to 24%, and further benefits from a new "big, beautiful bill." The economists argue that lower tax rates on capital gains and business income, combined with the ability to avoid realizing individual income, allow billionaires to circumvent progressive income tax structures. The findings bolster calls for a U.S. wealth tax to address widening inequality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Reform party's ambitious migration plan, aiming to deport 500,000-600,000 "illegal migrants" within five years, faces significant questions regarding its feasibility, cost, and legal challenges. The plan proposes building secure facilities for 24,000 people monthly and using "cutting edge data fusion" for identification, but this scale far exceeds historical achievements and would require an estimated £12 billion for construction alone. Legal experts warn that proposed changes to human rights laws and fast-tracking removals could conflict with basic legal principles and the European Convention on Human Rights, potentially leading to constitutional challenges and international repercussions. The plan's practical implementation, including dealing with planning disputes and securing international cooperation for returns, also presents substantial hurdles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As UK energy bills are projected to increase by £35 annually in October due to a rise in the energy price cap, households are urged to adopt several strategies to manage their costs. Consumers are advised to explore fixed-rate energy deals, which currently offer savings of about 15% compared to variable rates, though checking for exit fees is crucial. Opting for direct debit payments, especially with a smart meter, can also lead to savings. Additionally, a range of financial support is available for low-income individuals, including the £150 Warm Home Discount and hardship grants from energy suppliers. Practical measures such as optimizing heating by turning down combi boiler flow rates, using energy-efficient appliances, and adopting mindful consumption habits like shorter showers can further contribute to reducing overall energy expenditure.</p>

          <p>Long-term U.S. Treasury yields continued their upward trend, with the 30-year yield rising to 4.924%, as financial markets reacted to President Trump's escalating efforts to gain control over the Federal Reserve. Investors are concerned that a politically compromised Fed might prioritize short-term interest rate cuts, as desired by Trump, potentially at the cost of long-term inflation management, thereby driving up long-term borrowing costs. This market anxiety follows Trump's controversial move to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who is reportedly planning to file a lawsuit challenging her dismissal. Analysts, like Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI, have warned that such political interference in the central bank's autonomy could trigger a "potential riot in the bond market," signaling significant apprehension about future economic stability.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Pakistan's remote Chitral district, a unique inheritance practice called "chiro bash," or junior right, dictates that the family home is passed down entirely to the youngest son. This custom, also known as ultimogeniture, ensures that parents are cared for in their old age and promotes family continuity, contrasting with Western primogeniture where the eldest inherits. While older siblings often establish their own lives, the youngest remains rooted in the ancestral village. Though some older siblings may feel resentment, and women sometimes challenge the practice under Islamic law, "chiro bash" has endured for centuries. However, modern life and Shariah-based inheritance laws are now exerting pressure, making its long-term survival uncertain as younger generations seek education and work outside their villages.</p>

          <p>St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Willson Contreras has been suspended for six games by Major League Baseball after an on-field outburst during an argument with home plate umpire Derek Thomas. The incident, which also led to the ejection of Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol, involved Contreras throwing his bat—which inadvertently hit his hitting coach Brant Brown—spiking his batting helmet, and tossing a bucket of bubble gum from the dugout. Contreras, who is appealing the suspension, stated he did not understand why he was ejected, claiming he only argued balls and strikes without using disrespectful language. However, crew chief Jordan Baker confirmed that both Contreras and Marmol were ejected for "saying vulgar stuff" to Thomas and that Contreras made physical contact with the umpire, leading to the disciplinary action and an undisclosed fine.</p>

          <p>Conservative MSP Graham Simpson has announced his defection to Reform UK, making him the party's only representative in the Scottish Parliament and the second MSP to leave the Scottish Conservative group in a week. Simpson, who has served as an MSP for Central Scotland since 2016, stated his decision was driven by a desire to "create something new, exciting and lasting" with Reform. This move underscores the Scottish Conservatives' challenges ahead of next year's Holyrood election, as Reform UK appears to be gaining momentum. The defection coincided with Reform leader Nigel Farage's visit, during which he reiterated the party's controversial plan to deport 600,000 migrants over five years, a policy gaining traction in public opinion amidst rising concerns about immigration in Scotland.</p>

The company's local commerce operating profit decreased by 75.6%, and its operating margin significantly narrowed by 19.4 percentage points. This sharp decline was attributed to a substantial 27% increase in the cost of revenue, mainly driven by higher courier incentives, alongside a 51.8% jump in selling and marketing expenses and a 17.2% rise in research and development spending.
