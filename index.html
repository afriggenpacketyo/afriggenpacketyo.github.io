Kim Jong Un deemed the accident an intolerable "criminal act" caused by carelessness and ordered an immediate investigation and restoration of the vessel, emphasizing the political importance of the repair.

The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, creates new breaks, ends green-energy subsidies, and boosts military and immigration enforcement spending, while tightening eligibility for food and health programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt.

Despite India's attempts to attract businesses relocating from China, Trump has suggested Apple should move production to the U.S. instead of India. Indian officials are working to negotiate a reduction in tariffs, but uncertainty remains due to Trump's unpredictable approach, which has previously involved conflating trade with geopolitical issues.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the eight men placed on the deportation flight had serious criminal records and were from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan, and Vietnam. The flight landed in Djibouti, and the judge ordered the government to provide the deportees with "reasonable fear" interviews.</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are urging the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses the airlines of "misleading" passengers and creating "confusion" at check-ins. They argue that additional charges for hand baggage that do not match airline guidelines breach EU consumer law. The groups are seeking an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, demanding sanctions and advocating for a standard luggage allowance within the ticket purchase.</p>

          <p>A major accident occurred during the launch ceremony of a new North Korean warship, which Kim Jong-un denounced as a “criminal act.” The 5,000-ton destroyer lost balance during launch, crushing some sections of its bottom, preventing it from exiting the shipway. Kim Jong-un declared the incident a “criminal act caused by absolute carelessness” and vowed to hold officials accountable. The accident comes after Pyongyang unveiled another 5,000-ton destroyer-class vessel last month. South Korea’s military said the stricken warship was lying sideways in the water after the failed launch.</p>

          <p>Immigration continues to be a challenging issue in UK politics, with successive governments struggling to address public concerns. Figures are expected to show a fall in net migration, but the issue remains politically sensitive. The 1968 Race Relations Act and Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech marked a turning point, shifting voter allegiance based on attitudes toward immigration and race. While overall attitudes toward immigration may be softening, concerns persist about its impact on public services and competition for jobs.</p>

He played a video showing an exhibit during a protest of several crosses lining a road - claiming they were burial sites for murdered white farmers.

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats call "the nuclear option." These waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn these waivers, but government watchdogs disagree. Voting down California's waivers could impact cities and states nationwide, as 16 additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards. Environmental groups are concerned about the unprecedented use of the Congressional Review Act.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's welcoming of Afrikaner refugees based on claims of violence and discrimination, some Afrikaners say the claims are untrue. Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp states that there's no sign of a white genocide, citing that Whites are economically the strongest group in South Africa. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein agrees, saying the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government but rather a dysfunctional government and a need for land to be shared by both Black and White. These comments come amid President Trump's continued support for a controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners.</p>
