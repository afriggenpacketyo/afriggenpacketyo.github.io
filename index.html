          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to secure enough votes in the first parliamentary vote to become German chancellor, marking an unexpected setback. Merz needed 316 votes but received only 310, halting the parliamentary session for discussion. A second vote must occur within 14 days, requiring an absolute majority. The Social Democratic Union, along with its sister party, won the largest share of votes in Germany's February election and was set to form a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party. </p>

          <p>DoorDash's acquisition of Deliveroo for £2.9 billion underscores the diverging fortunes of US and UK stock markets. The article points out that DoorDash's greater financial power, fueled by its access to US capital markets, enabled the takeover. Companies are increasingly shunning the London Stock Exchange for US listings due to higher valuations and greater investor demand. The article also touches on the government's "Edinburgh Reforms" aimed at making UK listings more attractive, but highlights the continued trend of UK companies being acquired by US firms.

          <p>The UK government is considering restricting visa applications from nationalities deemed likely to overstay and seek asylum, including Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. This crackdown aims to address the issue of individuals entering the UK legally on work or study visas before claiming asylum. Labour's plans to reduce migration involve stricter measures against small boat crossings and training programs to decrease reliance on migrant workers.

          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a surge following the announcement of better-than-expected first-quarter sales, despite a 2% revenue decline adjusted for currency. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to subdued consumer demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. The company reaffirmed its 2025 outlook, projecting full-year sales between 4.2 billion euros and 4.4 billion euros, while closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and potential impacts from tariffs.

          <p>Hamas has stated that there is "no point" in further ceasefire talks after Israel approved an expanded offensive in Gaza. The Israeli military said the aim of the operation is to return hostages and decisively defeat Hamas, potentially involving displacing the majority of Gaza's population. A senior Hamas official said the group would not engage with new proposals while Israel continued its "starvation war." The UN Secretary General warned that expanded ground operations would lead to more civilian deaths and destruction.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on films made in "foreign countries" has created confusion and potential damage in Hollywood. The article argues that the proposal, which is vague and lacks clear implementation details, is primarily intended to "prank the liberal media" rather than help the American film industry. The author suggests that the mere threat of tariffs will cause unease and stall production plans, even if the policy is never fully implemented. The piece highlights the complexities of the globalized film industry and the challenges of defining and imposing tariffs on films.</p>
