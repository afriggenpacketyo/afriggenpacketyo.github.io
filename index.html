        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's GDP experienced a 0.1% contraction in the first quarter, marking the first decline since late 2020, primarily due to a significant drop in construction activity. The Bank of Korea had previously warned of a potential GDP growth slowdown for 2025, citing weakened domestic demand and exports due to political uncertainties and unfavorable trade conditions. The country has been grappling with impeachment trials of former leaders and ongoing trade war challenges, including tariffs on key exports to the U.S. Despite these challenges, a South Korean trade team is engaging in talks with the U.S. to seek mutually beneficial outcomes.

          <p>Elon Musk expressed a desire to scale back his involvement with the federal government, acknowledging the strain of his current situation. While he intends to continue advocating for lower tariffs, he recognized that his influence on President Trump's decisions is limited. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has faced opposition from Democrats, cabinet secretaries, and G.O.P. lawmakers due to proposed cuts affecting constituents' services and jobs. This shift in tone suggests a recalibration of Musk's role in Washington, moving away from his previous assertive approach to government reform.</p>

While macroeconomic uncertainties and tariff policies may create demand volatility, SK Hynix anticipates continued spending on AI from Big Tech, fueled by open-source AI models and sovereign AI projects.

Trump asserts that a deal to end the war was 'very close' but Zelenskyy's stance prolongs the conflict. This comes as the U.S. administration, through Vice-President JD Vance, outlines a vision for a deal that would 'freeze the territorial lines' close to their current positions, requiring both Ukraine and Russia to cede territory. Ukraine maintains that it will not relinquish Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, as it violates their constitution.</p>

          <p>Former England striker Eni Aluko suggests that male broadcasters like Ian Wright risk limiting opportunities for female pundits in women's football. Aluko acknowledges Wright's support for the women's game but emphasizes the limited number of available positions. She advocates for greater awareness among men to ensure that women are not blocked from pathways into broadcasting in the growing field of women's football. Aluko believes men need to be mindful of the finite opportunities available in the evolving landscape of women's sports media.</p>

The trial involved oral immunotherapy, gradually increasing his tolerance to peanuts under medical supervision. This treatment has transformed his life, reducing anxiety around food and travel, and demonstrating the potential for adults with serious allergies to desensitize their immune systems. While successful, experts caution against attempting this at home due to the risk of severe allergic reactions.</p>

The research attributes a significant portion of the total cost to five major companies: Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP.

          <p>Victims of murder and stalking are advocating for the creation of restricted zones where offenders would be required to live after being released from prison. They argue that current exclusion zones, which prevent offenders from entering areas where victims live, are insufficient and place undue burden on victims. Some experts raise concerns that such restrictions could violate offenders' human rights. The Ministry of Justice maintains that exclusion zones and other strict conditions are in place to protect victims and that offenders who break the rules face imprisonment.</p>
