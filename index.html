        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven men in Rochdale have been found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over a five-year period, from 2001 to 2006. The victims, groomed from the age of 13, were treated as "sex slaves" and subjected to repeated sexual assault. The abusers plied the girls with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes, also providing them with places to stay due to their troubled home lives. Some of the men worked on market stalls or as taxi drivers, with the gang leader, Mohammed Zahid, known as "Boss Man," giving the girls free underwear from his lingerie stall in exchange for sexual favors for himself and his friends. The trial at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court concluded with unanimous guilty verdicts after three weeks of deliberation. The gravity of the crimes underscores the vulnerability of children in exploitative situations. The author's tone is somber and reflective of the seriousness of the crimes committed. </p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a downturn and oil prices surged after Israel launched a military strike on Iran. S&P 500 futures contracts fell by 1.1%, while U.S. benchmark crude oil jumped by 7.3%. Markets in Asia and Europe also sank, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 falling 0.9%. According to analysts, the primary channel through which this escalation could impact the global economy is through higher oil prices. The attack involved airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, prompting Iran to respond by firing over 100 drones at Israel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun sending termination notices to approximately 500,000 foreign nationals who had received temporary stays under the CHNV program, which was open to applicants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. These individuals are being encouraged to "self-deport immediately." This action follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing DHS to order CHNV participants to leave the country, even while they challenge the program's revocation. The DHS is offering travel assistance and a $1,000 bonus to immigrants who agree to "self-deport" using the Home Mobile App. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused the Biden administration of having "lied to America" in a statement regarding the revocation of the CHNV program.

          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting the "heart" of Iran's nuclear program, resulting in the deaths of senior military figures, nuclear scientists, and civilians. The strikes included the targeting of the Natanz nuclear facility, causing significant damage. In response, Iran launched approximately 100 drones towards Israel, leading to a state of emergency being declared. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation, called Operation Rising Lion, aimed to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's survival. The global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported no increase in radiation levels at the Natanz plant and called for maximum restraint.

          <p>Bhoomi Chauhan, a business administration student, narrowly missed her Air India flight to London Gatwick by just 10 minutes due to heavy traffic.

Airline staff denied Ms. Chauhan boarding due to her late arrival, leading to initial frustration. She later received a call informing her of the plane crash, which she described as a "miracle" for her. This is a story of a near miss with tragic consequences for hundreds of others. </p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a highly valued perk, are becoming increasingly rare as more companies adopt hybrid work schedules. Experts suggest that the rise of work-from-home Fridays has led to the phasing out of summer Fridays. Traffic data indicates fewer workers are commuting on Fridays compared to mid-week. Despite this trend, a survey reveals that summer Fridays remain the most valued summer benefit among employees, who believe it improves productivity and morale.

          <p>President Trump plans to display military might on the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, raising concerns about the celebration of the country versus the glorification of its leader. This contrasts with George Washington's approach, who resisted attempts to turn his visits into military displays. Washington favored parades that honored the artisans and tradespeople, representing a constitutional republic based on the will of the people, dedicated to advancing prosperity and protecting liberty. The current president's eagerness for military spectacles should serve as a warning to Americans concerned about their basic rights.

          <p>The traditional "religious right" is being replaced by a new movement under President Trump, one that prioritizes American nationalism over traditional religious values. This new movement seeks to bend the church to the will of American nationalism, resembling the church-state relations in Soviet Russia. Trump's Religious Liberty Commission reflects this shift, focusing on the nation's history and institutions as the means by which religion can sustain itself. The movement is characterized by a cross-faith coalition united by a shared sense of cultural siege, particularly around issues of gender, sexuality, and race. The author's tone is critical, warning against the radical transformation of American religion and society. </p>

          <p>Other MLB owners may admire the Angels' strategy of drafting and quickly promoting college stars to the major leagues more than the Dodgers' approach of acquiring high-priced talent. The Angels' roster includes eight first-round picks, all 25 or younger, who spent limited time in the minor leagues. This approach contrasts with the Dodgers, who rely on expensive acquisitions like Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman. While the Angels' approach is cost-effective, there is no evidence it leads to winning, as the team has not had a winning season in 10 years. The author's tone is analytical and contrasts the two team-building approaches. </p>

          <p>Private schools have lost a High Court challenge over the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. Lawyers argued the policy was discriminatory and breached human rights law. The government defended the policy, saying it would raise Â£1.8bn a year to spend on state sector standards. The court found that while the legislation does interfere with some human rights, there is a broad margin of discretion in deciding how to balance the interests of those adversely affected by the policy against the interests of others who may gain from public provision funded by the money it will raise. </p>
