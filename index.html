          <p>A shooting occurred early Sunday morning at a residence hall on the Oklahoma State University campus, resulting in multiple victims being hospitalized. The incident reportedly followed a large, off-campus party, with the violence taking place after attendees returned to the Carreker East residential hall. Authorities have stated there is no ongoing threat to the public but have not yet confirmed if any suspects are in custody. The investigation is continuing, and police have asked students who do not live in the building to avoid the area.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it has received credible intelligence suggesting Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This action would represent a severe violation of the recently brokered ceasefire agreement. Hamas has denied the claims, calling them "false allegations" and accusing Israel of supporting rival armed groups. The warning comes after a video surfaced showing Hamas executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, highlighting ongoing internal power struggles and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>Thieves executed a rapid, seven-minute robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning, stealing jewelry of what officials call "inestimable heritage and historical value." The perpetrators reportedly used a basket lift and a disc cutter to break into the Galerie d'Apollon while tourists were already inside the museum. The museum was subsequently closed as police launched an investigation into the professionally-executed heist. The suspects fled the scene on motorcycles, and authorities are working to recover the stolen items.</p>

          <p>A commentary by former New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow addresses the severe crisis facing local journalism in the United States, with over 3,200 newspapers having closed since 2005. The article argues that the decline of these outlets, which provide essential community-level reporting from school sports to local government accountability, erodes social cohesion. This loss of local news is linked to increased political polarization, as communities lose the connective tissue that reminds residents of their shared interests. The piece emphasizes the shift in viewing local news from a struggling industry to an essential public good.</p>

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended his recent comments labeling the nationwide "No Kings" protests against President Trump as "hate America" rallies. In an interview, Johnson clarified that his criticism was aimed at the message of the protesters, not the individuals themselves, citing what he described as violent rhetoric seen in photos and videos from the events. He also stood by his remarks linking elements like antifa and pro-Hamas sentiment to the modern Democratic Party, pointing to what he perceives as a rise of Marxism within the party.</p>

          <p>The Haskell Free Library and Opera House, a unique institution straddling the border between Derby Line, Vermont, and Stanstead, Quebec, is facing new access restrictions imposed by the Trump administration. For over a century, the library has allowed patrons from both countries to mingle freely, but new rules now require Canadian visitors to report to a legal U.S. port of entry before using the library's main entrance. The changes were implemented following security concerns in the area, transforming a symbol of unity into one marked by division, though the library remains committed to its mission.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from actor Tim Curry's upcoming memoir, "Vagabond," recounts a surreal experience during the height of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show's" cult success. Curry describes being accused of being an imposter by a theater employee while trying to watch a midnight screening of the film in New York. After being confronted and told he didn't even look like himself, he proved his identity with his passport, only to theatrically walk out of the cinema. The anecdote serves as an introduction to his reflections on a life spent as a professional "vagabond" and career "imposter."</p>

The peace plan calls for a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" to manage public services, but its implementation is challenged by ongoing violence and Hamas's efforts to retain power.

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he declined to speculate on the upcoming November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability challenges facing the country. The proposal comes as Labour aims to fulfill its campaign promise to lower average bills by £300 by 2030, a goal Miliband says can only be achieved through a transition to home-grown clean energy. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household approximately £86 per year.</p>

The charges focus on specific conduct over a significant period, making it a serious national security matter rather than a purely political one.

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood won his eighth European tour title with a two-shot victory at the DP World India Championship. Finishing with a final round of 65, Fleetwood stated that his main motivation throughout the day was to win so his eight-year-old son, Frankie, could run onto the 18th green to congratulate him for the first time. Fleetwood started the final round two shots behind the leader but surged ahead with a series of birdies around the turn. The victory continues a strong season for the Ryder Cup star, marking his second win in his last two contended tournaments.</p>

          <p>Zhu Guangyao, China's former vice-minister of finance, expressed confidence that the country's economy will achieve its growth target of around 5% this year. Speaking at a conference in Beijing, he projected that China can maintain an annual growth rate of 4.5% to 5% for the next five years. This sustained growth would provide a solid foundation for achieving the government's long-term goal of "socialist modernisation" by 2035. Zhu's optimistic forecast comes as the nation's leaders prepare for a key party meeting to set economic priorities amid ongoing rivalry with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Americans across the country are feeling the financial strain of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, reporting significant price increases on everyday goods from groceries to car tires. A recent study by S&P Global estimates that U.S. consumers will absorb over $900 billion in additional costs in 2025 due to the policy. Many individuals report cutting back on non-essential purchases, altering their shopping habits to find lower prices, and facing empty shelves for certain products. The personal accounts detailed in the article contradict administration promises that the tariffs would make living more affordable for everyday Americans.</p>

          <p>Georgia is experiencing its largest-ever demand for electricity, primarily driven by the rapid construction of datacenters for artificial intelligence. The state's main utility, Georgia Power, has requested a massive increase in energy generation, with about 80% of the new capacity intended for these datacenters. This has sparked concerns among consumer advocates and environmental groups about significant utility rate hikes for residential customers and an increased reliance on fossil fuels. Public hearings are scheduled to address the nearly $16 billion plan, which has become a contentious issue ahead of state regulatory commission elections.</p>

          <p>A Chinese robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has experienced a significant spike in orders, which it attributes to U.S. clients rushing to purchase products before President Trump's threatened 100% tariffs take effect. The Suzhou-based company, which makes components for humanoid robots, received over 1,000 new orders in a single week as customers sought to stockpile inventory. The company's factories are now working overtime to meet the sudden demand. This surge highlights how the administration's trade policies are creating short-term market distortions and prompting preemptive actions from businesses concerned about future supply chain costs.</p>

          <p>AI safety-focused startup Anthropic finds itself in a dual challenge: competing with the larger, well-funded OpenAI while also clashing with the U.S. government over AI regulation. David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, has publicly criticized Anthropic for what he calls a "regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering," contrasting it with OpenAI's closer partnership with the White House. Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI staff with a mission to build safer AI, has advocated for stronger regulations and opposed the administration's efforts to block state-level AI rules.
