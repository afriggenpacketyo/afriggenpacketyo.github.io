          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, was recaptured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin had impersonated a corrections officer to escape, triggering a nearly two-week manhunt involving helicopters, drones, and K9 units, with assistance from a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders thanked law enforcement for their efforts, highlighting the Trump administration's support. Hardin's capture brings relief to the community, which had been on high alert due to concerns about his potential to harm others.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been returned to the U.S. to face charges of illegally transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a conspiracy to transport migrants from Texas. The decision to pursue the indictment led to the resignation of a federal prosecutor concerned about political motivations. The alleged conspiracy spanned nearly a decade, involving the transport of thousands of individuals, including some MS-13 members, and Abrego Garcia's attorney has called the charges an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) rejected a proposal to impose surcharges on gas-powered appliances aimed at improving air quality. The measures would have added fees to the sale of gas furnaces and water heaters, incentivizing manufacturers to meet sales targets for electric alternatives. Board members opposing the measure argued it would penalize residents by raising appliance costs, while proponents emphasized the need for tough decisions to improve air quality and avoid federal penalties.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's proposal to limit state-funded healthcare for undocumented immigrants is facing strong opposition from Latino legislators. The plan would freeze Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented individuals over 19 in 2026 and impose monthly premiums starting in 2027. Legislators argue that the proposal sets a dangerous precedent and expressed disappointment that it would cut long-term care and dental benefits. They are urging Newsom to maintain access to Medi-Cal for all state residents.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump poses a significant threat to the Republican Party due to Musk's financial capacity to disrupt the political landscape. He could fund primary challenges against Republicans supporting Trump's agenda or even launch a new political party. By funding third-party candidates in key swing states, Musk could exploit the narrow margins in national elections. While he may not win outright, his influence could shift the balance of power.</p>
