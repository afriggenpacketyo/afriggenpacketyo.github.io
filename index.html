            <p>A house explosion in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, resulted in the death of David Howard, 53, prompting a major incident declaration. Emergency services responded to the scene on John Street, where Howard's body was recovered from the debris. The explosion destroyed one terraced house and partially collapsed two others, damaging eight additional properties and 20 cars. Thirty-five houses were evacuated, and while most residents have returned, temporary accommodation is being provided for those still unable to do so as the investigation into the cause of the blast continues.</p>

            <p>Following an attack by Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi on three prison officers at HMP Frankland, the government has suspended kitchen use in high-security prison units. Abedi, who was serving a life sentence, used hot oil and makeshift blades from cooking trays to injure the officers, two of whom remain hospitalized. The Ministry of Justice has launched a full review of the incident, and Abedi has been moved to a separation center at HMP Full Sutton. The Prison Officers' Association is calling for stricter control and removal of cooking facilities in separation centers to prevent similar incidents.</p>

            <p>Israel is seizing large areas of the Gaza Strip, incorporating them into security zones and reducing the territory accessible to Palestinians. More than half of Gaza is now off-limits, particularly in the south, where a buffer zone is being created along the border with Egypt, effectively cutting off Rafah from neighboring Egypt. This move has sparked criticism, especially given Rafah's role as a shelter for displaced Palestinians and a crucial entry point for aid.

            <p>A disabled parent reflects on how her experiences with disability prepared her for the challenges of early parenthood, arguing that disability culture can foster creativity and flexibility in caregiving. The author interviewed disabled and nondisabled parents, finding that disabled parents often had an easier time adjusting to the demands of early parenthood due to their familiarity with bodily limitations and the need for creative problem-solving. Embracing imperfection and accepting help are presented as valuable lessons for all parents, regardless of disability status, leading to more compassionate and effective caregiving.</p>

To optimize your profile, use ChatGPT to generate sample professional summaries by inputting your resume and writing samples to capture your personality.

The government's intervention follows concerns that Chinese owners intended to halt steelmaking, jeopardizing the UK's economic security.
