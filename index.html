          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new genome editing technology called programmable chromosome engineering (PCE). This new tool makes it easier and more efficient to edit large DNA fragments in higher organisms, particularly plants. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this advancement could revolutionize crop improvement and the treatment of genetic diseases. The technology is also expected to accelerate the development of artificial chromosomes, which have significant potential in synthetic biology.</p>

The city government is supporting this trend with its "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, aiming to streamline event approvals and enrich cultural offerings. This boost in consumption is seen as a vital stimulus for the domestic economy amid deflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that robotics could experience its "ChatGPT moment" within the next one to three years. He defines this milestone as a robot's ability to perform a novel task, like cleaning an unfamiliar room, without prior specific training for that environment. Speaking at the World Robot Conference, Wang expressed that while hardware is advancing, the "AI for embodied intelligence" is the main bottleneck. He suggested that generative world models might be more promising for achieving this breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles officials are urging residents in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to severely limit water usage, including flushing toilets, due to a major water service outage. The crisis began when a critical water control valve broke, affecting about 9,200 households during a heatwave and prompting a boil water advisory. Efforts to repair the valve and refill a 10-million-gallon tank are being hampered by continued water consumption, which officials warn could delay the full restoration of service, currently targeted for Monday morning.</p>

          <p>Northern China, including Beijing, has once again been struck by severe flooding during its traditional rainy season, marking the fifth major flood disaster in the region since 2012. This year's event is considered unusual because the late July storms primarily impacted the northern parts of the capital. This is in contrast to previous major floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern areas. The recurring and shifting nature of these extreme weather events raises concerns about the city's preparedness.</p>

The piece highlights the growing deployment of nuclear-capable weapons in Europe and criticizes the lack of public outcry over the increasing risk of extinction.
