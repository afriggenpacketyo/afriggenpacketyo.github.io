          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have created an AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, that mimics the human brain's efficiency by only activating necessary neurons. This design allows it to learn from less than 2% of the data required by conventional systems and run up to 100 times faster on certain long-text tasks. The system operates entirely on China's homegrown MetaX chip platform, a significant development as the U.S. restricts exports of advanced AI hardware like Nvidia's GPUs. This innovation underscores China's push for technological self-sufficiency in the critical field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Oracle's shares soared by 27% in after-hours trading, driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business, despite narrowly missing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates. The company reported a massive 359% increase in its remaining performance obligation, a measure of future contracted revenue, now totaling $455 billion. Key new contracts, including a significant deal with OpenAI and the integration of Google's Gemini models, are fueling investor confidence in Oracle's ability to compete in the AI-driven cloud market. The company forecasts substantial growth, aiming for $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in fiscal year 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel launched a "precise strike" on a residential building in Doha, Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leaders who were meeting to discuss ceasefire negotiations. While the intended targets reportedly survived, Hamas confirmed that six other individuals, including a Qatari security official and the son of a chief negotiator, were killed. The attack, which involved 15 Israeli fighter jets, has been condemned by Qatar as a reckless violation of international law. The Israeli government has taken full responsibility for the operation, which complicates ongoing peace efforts and regional diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court will review the legality of global tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, setting a major test for presidential economic authority. The court agreed to an expedited hearing in November to decide on lower court rulings that found the president exceeded his power by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact the levies. The case was brought by small businesses and several states, arguing that the power to impose tariffs belongs to Congress. The outcome could have significant implications, potentially forcing the refund of billions of dollars and affecting numerous trade deals.</p>

          <p>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith has stated that Congress will "respond accordingly" if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's global tariffs. While expressing his close collaboration with the administration on the policy, Smith did not commit to passing the tariffs through a formal legislative process. This highlights a potential political dilemma for Republicans, who might be forced to choose between supporting a president popular with their base and appeasing constituents who are generally unfavorable towards tariffs.

          <p>The Trump administration has released its "Make America Healthy Again" report on chronic illnesses in children, which has drawn sharp criticism from health and environmental advocates. The report, championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., avoids direct restrictions on pesticides and ultra-processed foods, instead focusing on overhauling the vaccine injury system and reviewing psychiatric medication prescriptions for children. Critics, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and environmental groups, argue the report favors agricultural and chemical industry interests while ignoring key health drivers like environmental hazards. They contend its deregulatory proposals could undermine children's health rather than protect it.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted the Trump administration an emergency request to temporarily halt a lower court order, allowing the continued freeze of billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The administration argued that being forced to spend the funds, which expire at the end of the month, would pose a "grave and urgent threat" to presidential authority in foreign policy. Aid groups have sued the administration, warning that the cuts could have lethal consequences for global health missions. This temporary stay sets the stage for a major Supreme Court test of the president's power to control public funding against the will of Congress.</p>

          <p>Key inflation reports for August, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are anticipated to show a slight acceleration in prices, with economists forecasting a 0.3% monthly increase. This would push the annual headline CPI rate to 2.9%, largely driven by price hikes on tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader service-sector inflation. Despite the increase, analysts believe the Federal Reserve is still likely to proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Policymakers are expected to focus on the weakening jobs market and view the tariff-related price jumps as temporary, one-off events. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Sébastien Lecornu as the new prime minister following the collapse of the previous government in a no-confidence vote. The 39-year-old Lecornu, who was serving as Defense Minister, is France's fourth prime minister in just over a year, highlighting the country's ongoing political instability. His immediate and primary task is to negotiate a national budget with France's fractious political parties, an issue that has toppled his predecessors. Lecornu, a former conservative who joined Macron's centrist movement, is seen as a loyalist tasked with navigating the legislative deadlock.</p>

          <p>Stage 16 of the Vuelta a España cycling race was shortened by 8 kilometers due to disruptions from pro-Palestinian protests targeting the Israel-Premier Tech team. This is the latest in a series of protests that have affected the race, but organizers have firmly stated they have "No Plan B" and are determined to finish the event in Madrid as scheduled. Race director Javier Guillen condemned the disruptions as illegal and emphasized that sports should be a unifying force. Despite the interruptions, the race continues, with Jonas Vingegaard retaining the overall lead.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in "Breaking Bad," was briefly detained by Los Angeles police following a dispute over a parking spot. The incident occurred while Cruz was washing his car, and he asked three women who parked very close to him to move their vehicle to avoid it getting wet. According to his agent, the women refused and began recording him, at which point Cruz turned with the hose, inadvertently splashing them. The women reported an assault, leading to his five-hour detention, but his agent expects the case to be dropped.</p>

          <p>The Italian journalist who pointedly excluded actress Ayo Edebiri from a question about the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements has defended her actions amid online backlash. At a press event, the journalist directed her question to Edebiri's white co-stars, Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield, asking what was lost in the "politically correct era" now that the movements "are done." Edebiri interjected to state the work of these movements is not finished. The journalist, Federica Polidoro, later released a statement decrying cyberbullying and defending her right to ask "uncomfortable" questions, while pushing back against accusations of racism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a federal charge against Decarlos Brown Jr., the man accused of fatally stabbing 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina. Brown is now charged with causing a death on a mass transportation system, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or death. The unprovoked attack has drawn national attention, with officials citing it as a result of "soft-on-crime policies." U.S. Attorney Russ Ferguson stated the federal charge was pursued because the act created widespread public fear about using public transit.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its air attacks on Ukraine, including a strike on a key government building in Kyiv with what Ukrainian officials identified as an Iskander cruise missile. Although the missile failed to detonate, the attack signifies a clear escalation and a direct targeting of Ukraine's capital. Simultaneously, a Russian glide bomb killed more than 20 civilians queuing for pensions in the eastern Donbas region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the "savage" attacks and reiterated his urgent call for more advanced air defense systems to counter Russia's increasingly large and deadly drone and missile assaults.</p>

          <p>Israel's airstrike targeting Hamas leadership in Doha is being interpreted as a strong signal that its government remains committed to a military victory over a negotiated ceasefire. The attack occurred as Hamas leaders were reportedly meeting to discuss the latest U.S.-backed peace proposal, undermining ongoing diplomatic efforts. This action suggests Israel may be prioritizing the elimination of Hamas leaders over securing a deal for the release of remaining hostages, a move praised by some Israeli politicians but feared by hostages' families. The strike significantly complicates the roles of mediators like Qatar and casts doubt on the future of any diplomatic resolution.</p>

          <p>The recent Israeli airstrike in Doha highlights the complex and often precarious role Qatar plays as a key international mediator. The Gulf state has successfully negotiated deals in conflicts involving Iran, Afghanistan, and Sudan by maintaining relationships with a wide array of state and non-state actors, including Hamas and the United States. This diplomatic balancing act allows it to serve as an indispensable "partner for peace," but also exposes it to significant risks, as seen with the Israeli strike and a previous Iranian missile attack. The incident underscores the dangers Qatar faces while facilitating crucial but volatile geopolitical negotiations.</p>

          <p>Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who led controversial immigration raids in Southern California, has been deployed to Chicago to lead a new enforcement blitz. This move signals an expansion of the Trump administration's strategy of using Border Patrol agents for interior enforcement, far from the nation's borders. Bovino is known for his visible role in "Operation At Large," which involved arrests in major cities and was criticized for its tactics. His arrival in Chicago coincides with plans for an "Operation Midway Blitz," escalating the administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants in the U.S. interior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that a new tax law will result in varied benefits across the United States, with residents of some states receiving larger cuts than others. Residents in high-income states like Wyoming are projected to see the largest average tax reduction, while those in lower-income states such as Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest. The disparity is driven by provisions that favor higher earners and business owners, as well as an increased cap on state and local tax deductions that benefits those in high-tax areas. The typical filer nationwide could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
