          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York man, faces federal hate crime charges for allegedly assaulting Jewish counter-protesters at anti-Israel demonstrations in New York City between 2024 and 2025. The Department of Justice's indictment details three separate incidents where Bazrouk allegedly targeted Jewish individuals, including kicking a college student and punching another in the face. Law enforcement discovered antisemitic messages and pro-Hamas propaganda on Bazrouk's phone, indicating a clear bias. If convicted, Bazrouk could face up to 30 years in prison, marking the first federal hate crime charges connected to the anti-Israel protests on college campuses since October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits but cautioned that ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China could negatively impact global container market volumes. The company's underlying EBITDA increased by 70% compared to the previous year, reaching $2.71 billion. However, Maersk revised its 2025 global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4%, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. This adjustment reflects concerns about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese products and subsequent retaliatory measures from Beijing on U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, a move aimed at calming investors concerned about global tariffs. The agreement, details of which are still emerging, could involve the UK lowering tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies. This development follows the UK's recent free trade agreement with India, signaling a broader effort to expand global trade ties post-Brexit.

          <p>The article discusses the upcoming International Boxing Hall of Fame inductions and questions the selection process, highlighting potential oversights. It compares the credentials of inductee Vinny Pazienza with fighters like Jermain Taylor, Kelly Pavlik, and Gerry Cooney, who have never been on the ballot despite arguably more significant achievements. The article also points out the omission of non-fighters like Alan Hopper, Cedric Kushner, and Al Haymon, who have made substantial contributions to the sport. The author criticizes the current system, suggesting that the review and screening committees wield too much power, and that many electors lack sufficient knowledge of boxing history.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has spent months nurturing his relationship with President Trump, which has culminated in an imminent trade agreement with the United States. This deal is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. The details of the agreement were not yet clear and could prove contentious with farmers and other interest groups in Britain. Britain, even under a center-left Labour government, has escaped the harsh criticism that Mr. Trump has trained on the European Union and China, both of which he accuses of ‚Äúripping off‚Äù the United States in their trade relationships.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% decline in net profit for the fiscal year 2025, attributing the downturn to uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The report indicates that U.S. trade policies could reduce Toyota's operating profit by 180 billion yen, with the company factoring in the impact for the initial two months.

Nintendo's forecasts are based on U.S. tariff rates effective April 10, with potential duties of 46% on consoles manufactured in Vietnam. President Shuntaro Furukawa noted that additional tariffs could decrease demand in the U.S., potentially impacting profits by tens of billions of yen.</p>

While President Trump alluded to the agreement on social media, details remain limited, with expectations pointing towards a more specific deal to reduce tariffs on certain goods rather than a comprehensive free trade agreement. Shadow business and trade secretary Andrew Griffith welcomed the deal as a "Brexit benefit" but emphasized the need to reverse Labour's policies that negatively impact businesses.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling closer economic cooperation between the two countries. The agreement would be the first deal announced since Trump imposed tariffs on America‚Äôs trading partners, later pausing them temporarily to allow for trade negotiations. Details of the agreement are still unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing British taxes on U.S. technology companies. The announcement could be a significant win for both countries.</p>

The floods were caused by rainfall made about 9% more intense and 40% more likely by human-caused climate change, the World Weather Attribution (WWA) study found.</p>
