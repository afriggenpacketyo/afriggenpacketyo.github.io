          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that the United States might extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if they continue to negotiate in good faith. Bessent's remarks, made during a congressional hearing, indicated the administration's willingness to prolong negotiations with countries actively seeking trade deals. Japan is one such partner, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba scheduled to meet with President Trump during an upcoming Group of Seven summit in Canada. The administration remains focused on securing trade deals with Japan, South Korea, and the European Union, but will unilaterally send out letters to less important countries to inform them of trade deals. This article discusses the potential extension of tariff pauses and the ongoing trade negotiations involving the United States and its key partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Multiple U.S. officials have indicated that Israel is in a state of readiness to initiate an operation within Iran. This development coincides with U.S. concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against American sites in Iraq, which prompted the State Department to advise non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq due to heightened regional tensions. Despite these concerns, President Trump's Middle East envoy plans to proceed with a sixth round of talks with Iran regarding the country's nuclear program. The Trump administration seeks a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, but disagreements persist over uranium enrichment. The article states that Israeli officials and White House spokespeople declined to comment. The current situation remains delicate, with ongoing negotiations and potential military actions creating uncertainty in the region. </p>

          <p>Asif William Rahman, a former CIA analyst, has been sentenced to 37 months in prison for leaking classified documents related to Israel's plans to strike Iran. Rahman pleaded guilty to two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act. He used his security clearance to print, photograph, and disseminate top-secret documents, which were later circulated on social media. Israel carried out air strikes on Iran last October, targeting military sites in several regions, in response to missiles launched by Tehran weeks earlier.

          <p>Eight female college athletes have appealed the House v. NCAA antitrust settlement, claiming it violates Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education. The athletes argue that the settlement, which allows direct payments from universities to athletes, will unfairly distribute $2.7 billion in back pay, depriving female athletes of $1.1 billion. They contend that the calculation of past damages is flawed and would cause irreparable harm to women's sports. The appeal, filed by Hutchinson Black and Cook, will be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, highlighting ongoing concerns about gender equity in collegiate athletics.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Spending Review seeks to balance long-term capital spending with immediate needs, reflecting a gamble on public patience. The review prioritizes infrastructure projects aimed at transforming the public realm and boosting economic potential, while limiting day-to-day spending. This approach contrasts with the typical critique of short-termism in politics, as the government bets on long-term gains amid volatile politics and widespread economic unease. The government is seeking to badge this moment as a turning point, and the success of the review hinges on the electorate's willingness to wait for the promised benefits.</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure to increase its military spending from 2% to 3.5% of GDP. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, emphasizing that reassessment by a new administration is standard practice. The Aukus pact, aimed at countering China's growing influence, involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines from the US and the UK sharing cutting-edge technology. The review's outcome could impact the future of the trilateral security alliance.</p>

Combined with its vast offshore yuan holdings and Chinaâ€™s restricted cryptocurrency use, the law raises hopes that Hong Kong could secure a prominent spot in the stablecoin market.

This discovery, published in Nature, offers insights into how tyrannosaurs evolved to become powerful predators in North America and Asia. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, weighing about 750kg compared to an adult T.rex, which could weigh eight times that.</p>

          <p>The House is moving closer to approving President Donald Trump's $9.4 billion spending cut package, which would codify cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency. The package would allow the White House to claw back billions of dollars already approved by Congress from agencies like USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. While the procedural vote passed along party lines, the final vote may face resistance from Republicans concerned about targeting popular programs. House Speaker Mike Johnson's narrow Republican majority means he can only afford to lose a few votes to pass the package.</p>
