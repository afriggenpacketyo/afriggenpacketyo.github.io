          <p>Heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico, a mountain village still recovering from recent wildfires. The fires left the landscape unable to absorb the water, leading to dangerous conditions. Video footage showed a house being swept away by the rushing, muddy water, and at least five people required rescue. This event highlights the ongoing vulnerability of the community to extreme weather following the destruction of natural vegetation by previous blazes.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has declared that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to take this step. The announcement, made amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israel. The United States also voiced its rejection of the decision, calling it a reckless move. This development marks a significant shift in European foreign policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer, allegedly by undocumented immigrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the policies endanger citizens by releasing criminals, while immigrant advocates argue the laws are crucial for public safety by encouraging crime reporting. The suit escalates the Trump administration's ongoing conflict with cities that have adopted sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>A rescue operation is in progress in northern British Columbia, Canada, to free three miners trapped underground following a mine collapse. The workers are located in a refuge chamber with access to air, food, and water, but communication was lost after a second groundfall. The mining company, Newmont, is using specialized drones and remote-controlled equipment to assess the debris and plan a safe extraction. The incident occurred at the Red Chris copper and gold mine, where production has been suspended during the rescue.</p>

          <p>Three career officials fired from the Department of Justice have filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi, claiming their terminations were unlawful. The plaintiffs, including a veteran prosecutor who handled January 6 cases, argue they were dismissed without cause via memos citing presidential authority, violating standard civil service protections. They are seeking reinstatement and back pay, asserting that the firings were arbitrary and part of a broader pattern of politically motivated dismissals within the agency. The lawsuit highlights growing tensions over the independence of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has become the first to experimentally observe the effects of quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness and that some thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive phenomenon is linked to how bending the material alters electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear and tear.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress and pop star Renée Rapp reflected on her reputation for being unfiltered and outspoken during media appearances. The "Mean Girls" star admits that while she finds traditional media training boring, she initially felt insecure when her candid personality became a viral trend. She also discussed the pressures of the music industry and the depression she experienced from being overworked. Her new single, "Leave Me Alone," was born from this frustration and serves as a witty response to those who have tried to tone her down.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four traders convicted in the Libor rate-rigging scandal are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a major UK Supreme Court ruling that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo. The court's decision has opened the door for others prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office for manipulating inter-bank lending rates, a practice at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis. The lawyers for the four men stated their intent to appeal but offered no further comment at this time.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old DACA recipient, Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez, is being detained and faces expedited deportation after he accidentally drove across the U.S. border into Mexico while working as a rideshare driver. Despite immediately attempting to return and presenting his DACA documentation, he was arrested for what the government calls "self-deportation" and an illegal re-entry attempt. His attorney claims border officials tried to solicit an $800 bribe. Hernandez-Rodriguez now faces removal to El Salvador, a country he left as a child, while his wife is expecting their second child in California.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis suggests the 2028 Democratic presidential primary is unofficially underway, as several potential candidates are increasing their media visibility. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are appearing on a diverse range of podcasts and shows, including those with conservative or non-traditional audiences. This shift in media strategy appears to be a direct response to the party's 2024 loss, with a focus on reaching new voters and adopting a more moderate, sometimes left-punching, tone on cultural issues. The early moves signal an effort to redefine the party's message and appeal.</p>

          <p>A record-long heatwave is scorching Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F), about 10°C above the seasonal average. The extreme heat is causing problems for the region's famed reindeer, which are fleeing to roads to escape mosquitoes, and disrupting the local tourism industry built around a cool, wintery image. Scientists point to the event as another clear sign of accelerating climate change in the Arctic, which is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. Even Santa's workshop in Rovaniemi is adapting to the unseasonable conditions.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8.4 billion merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, transferring control of assets like CBS and Paramount Pictures. The approval followed Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit with Donald Trump and came with commitments from Skydance to address conservative grievances and appoint an ombudsman to review bias complaints. The decision was condemned by the FCC's sole Democrat, who called it a deal linked to the Trump settlement that would erode press freedom by imposing controls over newsroom judgment.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major tech companies like Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are actually underspending on artificial intelligence, not overspending as some on Wall Street fear. He argues that the AI race is a "winner-take-all" situation, and increased investment is necessary to secure a dominant position, similar to how Google won the search engine market. Citing Alphabet's strong earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI infrastructure, Cramer believes the spending is urgent and justified to build the most profitable AI systems.

          <p>Food and technology companies are accelerating the development of natural food colorings as the industry moves away from synthetic dyes. The shift is driven by a recent FDA decision to ban Red Dye No. 3 and phase out other petroleum-based dyes amid health concerns. Firms like Fermentalg are using microalgae to create stable blue pigments, while others source colors from specially grown carrots and potatoes. While natural alternatives can be more expensive and present stability challenges, major food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to reformulate their products.</p>
