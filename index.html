          <p>As France commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Nazi surrender, WWII survivors recount their harrowing experiences during the German occupation. Genevi√®ve Perrier, Esther Senot, and Ginette Kolinka share memories of fleeing, arrest, deportation to concentration camps, and the struggle to rebuild their lives after the war. The article highlights the importance of preserving these stories for future generations and the initial indifference faced by survivors upon their return to a liberated France. Their narratives emphasize the need to remember the Holocaust and the dangers of hatred and discrimination.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister appears less far-fetched after Reform UK's recent electoral gains, challenging the dominance of traditional parties. The article suggests Reform's success reflects public disillusionment with the current political system, posing a potential existential threat to Labour. The Conservative Party faces a race to regain credibility, while Reform aims to prove its ability to govern effectively. This shift in the political landscape underscores the depth of public dissatisfaction and the potential for a significant realignment of British politics.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a fundamental shift in the structure of his second term. Unlike potential candidates who represented a more moderate Republicanism, Vance embodied the MAGA movement and a willingness to challenge established norms. This choice, Klein contends, indicated a move away from a coalition government to a "royal court" where loyalty and adherence to Trump's agenda are paramount. The article posits that this shift has eliminated the checks and balances that tempered Trump's first term, leading to a more uninhibited and potentially reckless presidency.</p>

          <p>Increased payroll taxes in Kenya are causing hardship for salaried workers as the government struggles to manage its staggering foreign debt. The tax hikes, part of President William Ruto's efforts to raise revenue, have reduced take-home pay and increased the cost of living. With much of the population working in the informal sector, the tax burden falls disproportionately on those with formal employment. This has led to widespread discontent and fears of further unrest, exacerbated by reports of corruption and mismanagement.</p>
