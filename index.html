          <p>A Florida man, Hung Trinh, was arrested in North Fort Myers after allegedly shooting his neighbor's cow five times for wandering onto his property. The Lee County Sheriffâ€™s Office responded to reports of animal cruelty and found the calf with gunshot wounds to its guts, chest, and rear leg, leading to its euthanasia. The cow's owner claimed Trinh had previously threatened to shoot the animals, expressing anger over livestock jumping the fence. Detectives obtained a search warrant and located the .22 caliber gun allegedly used in the shooting on Trinh's property, resulting in charges of animal cruelty and grand theft of a commercial farm animal.

          <p>The United Kingdom, France, and Canada have issued a strong condemnation of Israel's military actions in Gaza, urging an immediate halt to the offensive and calling for a ceasefire. The joint statement criticizes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to extend military control over Gaza, deeming the humanitarian suffering intolerable and the response disproportionate. These countries also emphasize the need for the release of hostages and criticize the limited amount of food allowed into Gaza as wholly inadequate. Netanyahu has responded by accusing the leaders of offering a prize for the October 7th attack, while the EU has also expressed concerns about violations of international law.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Venezuelans, reversing a lower court's block. This decision removes deportation protection for Venezuelans who previously were allowed to live and work legally in the United States due to unsafe conditions in their home country. Former President Biden had extended the protection policy for Venezuelans for 18 months, just a few days before Trump returned to the Oval Office in January, citing ongoing crises in the South American nation under the rule of Nicolas Maduro. Activists have criticized the decision as xenophobic and discriminatory, while the Homeland Security Department has praised it as a win for American safety.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish jail in New Orleans, prompting a large-scale manhunt and raising serious questions about the facility's security and oversight. The inmates, facing charges including murder and armed robbery, broke through a hole in a cell wall and crossed Interstate 10 on foot, leaving behind a taunting message. The jail has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 due to issues like overcrowding and understaffing, with reports of non-functional cameras and defective locks. The governor has demanded answers, and three employees have been suspended as an investigation is underway, highlighting broader failings within the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian man residing in Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, was arrested after allegedly driving his car the wrong way on an expressway in central Japan, causing a collision with multiple vehicles. The incident occurred on the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kameyama, Mie Prefecture, where the man is accused of failing to report an accident after hitting two vehicles. The wrong-way driving resulted in a pile-up involving four vehicles, including a large truck, and minor injuries to four women in their 40s to 60s. Police suspect the man may have made an illegal U-turn on the expressway and continued driving the wrong way for about 10 kilometers.</p>

Failure to win could jeopardize their future in Europe and limit their ability to invest in new players, while success would alleviate financial pressures stemming from the club's debt.

Despite President Trump's frustration with the peace process, the outcome of the war has significant implications for U.S. influence and security. Putin's ambitions extend beyond Ukraine, seeking to undermine the post-Cold War order and diminish America's global power. Abandoning Ukraine would embolden Russia, destabilize Europe, and strengthen an axis of upheaval involving China, Iran, and North Korea, ultimately increasing the challenges Washington faces.</p>

          <p>The number of billionaires in the UK has slightly decreased, but their collective wealth continues to rise, according to the UBS Billionaire Ambitions Report. While the UK remains ahead of many European peers, it trails Switzerland and Germany in billionaire rankings, with over two-thirds of UK billionaires being self-made. However, some of the wealthiest residents are relocating abroad due to the abolition of the non-dom tax status, moving to countries such as Switzerland, the UAE, Singapore, and the United States. Globally, billionaire wealth is booming, with Western Europe and the UAE seeing significant increases.</p>

          <p>The United States has sent 68 migrants from Honduras and Colombia back to their countries in what the Trump administration is calling voluntary deportations. The migrants received $1,000 debit cards and a chance to apply for legal entry into the U.S. in the future. The program is paired with increased detentions, but Honduran officials don't expect a significant increase in self-deportations. Some migrants cited increasing hostility and difficulty working in the U.S. as reasons for returning home.</p>

The process is complex, with Republicans facing internal divisions and Democrats preparing to file amendments. The House could vote on the bill at any time, day or night, as they push to get the measure across the finish line.</p>
