          <p>Keegan Bradley clinched the Travelers Championship by a single stroke, dashing Tommy Fleetwood's hopes for his first PGA Tour title. Fleetwood, who held a three-shot lead going into the final round, faltered on the 18th hole with a missed par putt, opening the door for Bradley's birdie. Bradley, who will captain the USA at the Ryder Cup in September, seized the opportunity, securing his victory and leaving Fleetwood "gutted." Fleetwood reflected on the disappointing finish, lamenting the worst possible outcome after leading with three holes to play.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that the United States attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, describing it as a "spectacular military success." According to a U.S. official, B-2 bombers deployed Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, also known as "bunker busters," during the mission, while a U.S. Navy submarine launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at targets inside Iran. Following the strikes, Trump addressed the nation, emphasizing the operation's success and hinting at potential regime change in Iran, saying, "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." This action marks a significant escalation in the tensions between the U.S. and Iran, with uncertain implications for the region. The strikes were purportedly aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to launch strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities was based on his belief that Iran is close to developing nuclear weapons, a view not entirely aligned with the U.S. intelligence community's assessment. While intelligence agencies maintain that Iran suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003, CIA Director John Ratcliffe has presented briefings emphasizing Iran's uranium stockpiles and clear efforts to build a nuclear weapon. Israel has also supported Trump's view, with Prime Minister Netanyahu asserting that Iran was close to weapon development. The U.S. strikes, along with prior Israeli attacks, were driven by a sense of opportunity to weaken the regime and neutralize its proxy forces, according to officials.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican Representative Kat Cammack faced delays in receiving treatment for an ectopic pregnancy due to concerns among medical staff about Florida's six-week abortion ban. Cammack, who opposes abortion, blames "fearmongering" by pro-abortion groups for the reluctance, despite the procedure being legal under the state's statutes. She had to show staff the state law and attempt to contact the governor's office before eventually receiving the necessary medication. Cammack hopes her experience will encourage bipartisan cooperation to ensure women receive necessary care during miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, emphasizing that her treatment was not an abortion.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, experts analyzing satellite imagery suggest that while damage was inflicted, Iran's nuclear program is far from destroyed. Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies notes that key elements, such as stocks of highly enriched uranium, appear untouched. David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security concurs, stating that significant amounts of enriched uranium likely still exist, potentially moved before the strikes. Despite claims of obliteration by the Trump administration, experts believe the program could be reconstituted, emphasizing the need for international inspections and diplomatic agreements.</p>

          <p>General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, outlined the U.S. military operation, codenamed 'Operation Midnight Hammer,' which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities.

According to the Pentagon, the bombers flew over the Atlantic Ocean, carrying "bunker buster" bombs to strike Iran's nuclear enrichment facility at Fordo. The operation also included Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from a U.S. submarine toward the nuclear site near Isfahan, resulting in a coordinated surprise attack on multiple sites.</p>

          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth by lowering energy costs for UK businesses. The plan includes a British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme that will cut costs for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from green levies. It also aims to speed up energy grid connections for new factories and projects. Prime Minister Starmer described the strategy as a "turning point" for the UK economy, supporting key industries and creating over one million new jobs. Conservative critics, however, argue the plan is an admission of the high costs of net zero, requiring taxpayer subsidies to prevent business failures.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for crude oil. This call follows Iran's warning that it "reserves all options to defend its sovereignty" after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Blocking the Strait of Hormuz could have significant consequences for the global economy, potentially causing oil prices to surge. Rubio argued that closing the strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it would halt the country's oil exports to China, its most important customer. The U.S. retains options to address any attempt by Iran to close the strait, with the U.S. Fifth Fleet stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the Persian Gulf.</p>

The police will impose conditions on the protest to prevent disorder, damage, and serious disruption, with breaches of the law dealt with robustly. This comes after Palestine Action activists sprayed two military planes with red paint at RAF Brize Norton, protesting the UK's support of Israel.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump discussed the need for Iran to return to negotiations following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. They agreed on the grave risk posed by Iran's nuclear program to international security and reiterated that Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. Starmer warned of a "risk of escalation" in the Middle East and emphasized efforts to stabilize the situation and find a diplomatic solution. The UK has been moving assets to the region to protect its interests and those of its allies.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, there are three potential pathways for escalation: "finishing the job" with further military action if the initial strikes were insufficient, a cycle of violence triggered by Iranian retaliation, and a broader conflict resulting from unforeseen consequences. The extent of damage to Iranian facilities remains uncertain, and Iran could either rebuild its nuclear program or retaliate against U.S. forces or international shipping lanes. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's lack of understanding of the potential consequences and its limited diplomatic options.</p>

          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no specific, credible threats, the bulletin warns of potential low-level cyber attacks and possible attacks by cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government. The Department of Homeland Security emphasizes the possibility of increased threats in the form of cyberattacks, acts of violence, and antisemitic hate crimes. U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple Iranian-backed plots since 2020, and the conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is bracing for a response from Iran following President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. While the Iranian government downplayed the impact, U.S. military officials said the strikes caused “extremely severe damage and destruction.” The main question among Trump administration officials is how Tehran will respond militarily and with the remnants of its nuclear program. Despite the dramatic nature of the air raid, few in Washington expressed an appetite for a prolonged U.S. war with Iran and echoed Israel’s interest in a truce.</p>

The Pentagon said it will take time to fully assess the effect of the attack, though it appears all the sites sustained "extremely severe damage." The U.S. says Israel was in "full co-ordination" with them in planning the strikes, while Iranian officials confirmed the facilities were struck but denied it had suffered a major blow.

          <p>Following the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global trade route, facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. The U.S. Secretary of State said an Iranian effort to block the strait "would be a suicidal move," likely driving backlash from a sizable group of powerful countries. The U.S., with its 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain, has long pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.</p>

Thomas Massie argued there was "no imminent threat to the United States" authorizing the strikes and that Congress should have debated the issue before any action was taken. Top Democrats say Trump illegally ordered the strike without Congressional approval, escalating the risk for American troops in the region.</p>
