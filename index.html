        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's export growth in May fell short of expectations due to a sharp 34.5% drop in shipments to the U.S., marking the steepest decline since February 2020. This decrease significantly impacted overall exports, although shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa saw increases. Imports also declined by 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, while China's trade surplus increased by 25% to $103.2 billion. The decline in exports to the U.S. is attributed to tariffs, despite a recent trade truce, and volumes of cars and ship exports increased while smartphones and home appliances decreased.

The ban restricts nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from entering the U.S. Unlike the initial 2017 ban, this one is broader and includes non-Muslim majority countries, though critics argue it disproportionately affects non-white countries. The ban has been met with less outrage than the original, overshadowed by protests in Los Angeles over deportation raids.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling it an ahistoric act based on false pretenses. The board argues that there was no legitimate emergency requiring federal intervention and that the deployment was politically motivated. The decision to invoke a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code on Armed Services is seen as an overreach of presidential power and a dangerous escalation of tensions. The board suggests that Trump's actions are creating the very chaos they were purportedly designed to prevent.</p>
