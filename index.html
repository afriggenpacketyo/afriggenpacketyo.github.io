          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in Delaware against American social media personality Candace Owens. The complaint centers on an eight-part series by Owens that alleges Brigitte Macron was born male and that the couple are blood relatives, claims the Macrons call "verifiably false and devastating lies." The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and punitive damages, accusing Owens of building her brand on provocation and misinformation. A spokesperson for Owens framed the lawsuit as an attack on American First Amendment rights by a foreign government.</p>

          <p>The European Union and the United States are engaged in critical trade negotiations ahead of an August 1 deadline, after which U.S. tariffs on EU imports could rise to 30%. While there are signs a deal involving a 15% baseline tariff rate might be reached, EU officials remain cautious, stating the final decision rests with President Trump. In the absence of a guaranteed agreement, the EU is preparing countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and potentially deploying its "Anti-Coercion Instrument." This tool could restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, limiting public tenders and foreign direct investment. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite mixed results in its investment banking unit and challenges from a stronger euro, the bank expressed confidence in meeting its full-year targets. The positive earnings report, driven by factors like increased volatility in foreign exchange, caused the bank's shares to rise by over 5% to near ten-year highs. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration's "American AI Action Plan" also seeks to remove regulatory hurdles for AI innovation and support the deployment of U.S. AI technology abroad.

          <p>In the first half of the year, vehicle manufacturing in the United Kingdom fell to its lowest point in over 70 years, not counting the COVID-19 industry halt. Data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) shows a 7.3% drop in car output and a 45% plunge in van production. The decline is partly attributed to uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some firms to slow production, though a recent deal may restore some confidence. While production of electric vehicles saw a slight increase, the SMMT expressed concern over the industry's overall state and uncertainty surrounding new government EV grants.

This has resulted in an estimated 40% of the nation's waste-to-energy capacity sitting idle.

Despite the warning from a regional Jesuit official who called Dickerson a "poor risk for ordination," he was eventually ordained in 1980 and was later accused of abusing more children. The revelations raise questions about the judgment of Arrupe, who is currently a candidate for Catholic sainthood, and the order's handling of priests known to be predators.

          <p>In a move to address its aging population and stimulate the economy, China plans to provide monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens. The electronic vouchers, valued between 500 and 800 yuan, are intended to help cover costs for elderly care services such as meal assistance, rehabilitation, and day care. This policy marks a rare use of direct fiscal support by Beijing, which has typically avoided cash handouts. The program, which will be piloted before a nationwide rollout, targets disabled seniors and aims to ease the financial burden on families while fostering growth in the services sector.

The ruling overturns one of the most high-profile outcomes of the financial crisis and raises questions about potential compensation and the possibility of appeals from other convicted traders. The decision is also fueling calls from senior politicians for a public inquiry into the broader scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods.
