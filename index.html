CEO Peter Stern stated the new "cross training series" is designed to facilitate a multi-disciplinary approach to wellness, combining cardio and strength training. This strategic shift focuses back on hardware innovation to attract a wider member base and capitalize on the crucial holiday sales season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing relief after President Trump's administration struck a deal with Pfizer, which includes a three-year exemption from drug-specific tariffs in exchange for lower U.S. drug prices and domestic manufacturing investments. This agreement is seen as a template for other major drugmakers, many of whom have already announced new U.S. investments. The deal provides much-needed certainty, signaling a potential shift away from punitive tariffs and toward negotiated pricing agreements. As a result, shares for Pfizer and several other pharmaceutical companies rose following the announcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in overall U.S. auto sales for the third quarter, largely driven by record sales of electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush purchases to take advantage of a $7,500 federal EV incentive that expired in September. GM's EV sales more than doubled, while Ford's increased by 30% compared to the same period last year. Industry analysts expect a temporary slowdown in EV sales following the incentive's expiration, but some automakers like Hyundai are already offering new discounts to maintain momentum.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's head of policy, Zia Yusuf, has claimed that Nigel Farage's publicly funded security detail was cut by 75% by parliamentary officials for "inexplicable reasons." The party states that private donors are now funding additional security to compensate for the reduction. This claim comes amid heated political rhetoric between Reform UK and the Labour Party, with Yusuf accusing Prime Minister Keir Starmer of inciting violence against Farage. Commons authorities have declined to comment on the specific case but stated that security arrangements for MPs are based on a rigorous risk assessment process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its homepage blaming the "Radical Left" for the impending government shutdown, prompting an ethics complaint. The watchdog group Public Citizen filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, calling the message a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities. The message claimed the Trump administration wanted to keep the government open, while accusing opponents of making excessive demands. This incident raises questions about the politicization of government agencies and the enforcement of federal ethics laws.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can continue in her role while it considers a case regarding her potential termination by President Donald Trump. The decision defers the administration's request to fire Cook until after oral arguments are heard in January 2026. President Trump has sought to remove Cook based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, raising concerns about political interference with the Federal Reserve's independence. This ruling allows Cook to participate in upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meetings, where key decisions on interest rates will be made.</p>

Harris noted that while the broader Silicon Valley population may still lean Democratic, a vocal and influential minority is promoting a political agenda that threatens democratic norms.

          <p>Jellycat, the maker of popular plush toys, plans to pay a £110 million dividend to its owners after its pre-tax profits more than doubled to £139 million in 2024. The company's success is attributed to the viral popularity of its quirky, cuddly toys on social media and a growing trend of adults purchasing toys for themselves. The London-based firm has seen a massive 66% increase in revenue as it keeps up with high demand in 80 countries. To further its brand, Jellycat has also launched immersive pop-up "experiences" in major cities like London, New York, and Paris.</p>

          <p>The attorneys general of five states have filed a lawsuit against Zillow and Redfin, accusing the real estate companies of anticompetitive practices in the online apartment rental market. The suit, which follows a similar action by the Federal Trade Commission, centers on a deal where Zillow allegedly paid Redfin $100 million to shut down its competing rental advertising business and transfer clients. The states argue this agreement unlawfully insulates Zillow from competition, which could harm both advertisers and renters searching for apartments. Both companies have disputed the allegations, claiming their partnership is pro-competitive and beneficial for consumers.</p>

          <p>During the government shutdown, the National Park Service (NPS) will keep many parks partially open but will furlough more than half of its 14,500 employees. Park roads, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to the public. Parks that collect entrance fees will use that revenue to provide basic services like sanitation and law enforcement. However, parks without fee collection will have minimal staffing and no visitor services, including closed restrooms and a halt to maintenance. Conservation groups warn this approach puts parks and visitors at risk, recalling damage and sanitation issues that occurred during the 2018-2019 shutdown.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after his death was ruled a suicide, Colorado officials are conducting a "case review" of the investigation into the death of renowned journalist Hunter S. Thompson. The review was initiated at the request of his widow, though authorities have stated that no new evidence has prompted the re-examination. Thompson, famous for his "gonzo" journalism style and books like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in 2005. The local sheriff's office hopes that having an outside agency provide a fresh look will offer transparency and peace of mind to his family and the public.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced a significant price increase for its top-tier gaming subscription, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, raising the monthly cost by 50% from $19.99 to $29.99, effective immediately.

Microsoft justifies the price hike by citing added value, including access to over 400 games, numerous day-one releases, improved streaming quality, and a new rewards program.

          <p>As of today, every general practitioner's office in England must provide patients with the ability to book appointments online throughout the workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM. The government-mandated change is designed to end the "8am scramble" where patients rush to get through on busy phone lines. However, the British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors' union, opposes the move, warning that an "online triage tsunami" could overwhelm practices and potentially put patients at risk. The BMA has formally entered a dispute over the system, which could lead to protest actions by GPs.</p>

The votes were repeats of Tuesday's failed attempts, with one bill being the Democrats' proposal and the other a "clean" Republican stop-gap measure. Congressional leaders from both parties continue to publicly blame each other for the impasse, with no clear path to a resolution yet emerging. The continued legislative stalemate means hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs and a disruption in government services.</p>

Bell has worked to remodel her bowling action over the past year to add more variation and now embraces the pressure of opening the bowling against the best batters.

          <p>A recent case in Kerala, where a 16-year-old boy was allegedly sexually assaulted by 14 men, has drawn attention to the taboo subject of sexual violence against boys in India. Experts and survivors state that deeply rooted societal notions of masculinity, which portray men as strong and dominant, make it difficult for male victims to speak out or be believed. This culture of silence and stigma often leads to shame, isolation, and a reluctance to report abuse, leaving the experiences of male survivors largely invisible. Advocates are calling for stronger enforcement of gender-neutral laws like the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act to protect all children from abuse.</p>
