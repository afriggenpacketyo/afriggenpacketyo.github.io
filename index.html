          <p>China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has completed its eighth "intensive" sea trial, according to state media reports. The tests included trials and flights of the ship-borne fifth-generation J-35 stealth fighters, which are designed for catapult launch. The Fujian, the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Armyâ€™s third carrier, is equipped with advanced electromagnetic catapults, significantly enhancing the Chinese navy's offshore defense and long-distance sea escort capabilities.

          <p>Venezuela is holding an election for governor and legislators to represent Essequibo, a territory internationally recognized as part of neighboring Guyana, a move that is escalating a long-standing border dispute. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is using this election to galvanize nationalistic sentiment and shore up support for his government amid internal dissatisfaction. Most countries and the 125,000 residents of Essequibo identify as Guyanese, but Venezuela claims the region based on historical grounds. Guyana has tightened border security, and the United States has expressed strong interest in protecting Exxon Mobil's investments in Guyana's oil reserves, further complicating the situation.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This expectation arises after his predecessor's dismissal due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice, which angered consumers. The survey also reveals that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The public's response reflects concerns over rising living costs and the government's efforts to stabilize the rice supply.</p>

          <p>China is developing new stealth technology designed to be effective against both infrared and microwave detection systems, enhancing the capabilities of high-speed aircraft and missiles. The technology addresses the challenge of military assets operating in high-temperature environments, where thermal radiation across the infrared spectrum can be easily detected. This advancement represents a significant step in China's efforts to enhance its military capabilities and counter modern battlefield surveillance techniques. The material may be used as a stealth material that is effective against both infrared and microwave detection.</p>

          <p>A recent attack on a fertility clinic in Palm Springs has brought attention to the fringe movement of anti-natalism, which posits that procreation is immoral due to the inevitability of death and suffering. This perspective, popularized by philosopher David Benatar, has gained traction online amid anxieties about climate change and AI. While anti-natalism remains marginal in mainstream philosophy, it has influenced various online communities and even seeped into pop culture, raising complex ethical questions about the value of existence.</p>

          <p>Russia targeted Ukraine overnight with one of its largest drone and missile barrages of the war, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens in hourslong attacks on cities and villages across the country. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia launched 69 ballistic and cruise missiles along with 298 attack drones, adding that about two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones were shot down. The overnight strikes further underscored how months of diplomacy aimed at brokering a cease-fire have failed to yield a breakthrough.

However, the economy is more vulnerable and less resilient than it was a couple of years ago, and the political instability has left businesses shaky.

          <p>An essay explores the changing landscape of literary fiction, noting the decline in prominence of young, straight, white male novelists and the rise of female and diverse voices. The author, Ross Barkan, discusses the reasons behind this shift, including a potential lack of interest from the publishing industry and a changing focus among young male writers. Barkan argues that the absence of these perspectives in contemporary fiction may lead to a limited portrayal of the experiences and challenges faced by young men today. Barkan also mentioned how publishers were less interested in straight male fiction, however he did not consider himself a victim and stated that he has had a successful career.</p>
