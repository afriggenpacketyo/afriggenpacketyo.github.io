          <p>The chief executive of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, has stated that the company has the potential to become the most valuable in the UK. This ambition is driven by a strategy to power the energy-intensive artificial intelligence sector using the company's small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Having already secured deals with the UK and Czech governments, Rolls-Royce aims to dominate the future market for SMRs, which are seen as a key energy source for data centers. This plan is part of a dramatic turnaround that has seen the company's share price increase tenfold since January 2023.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant travel trend is emerging as Czech tourists are increasingly opting for Poland's Baltic coast for their holidays, shifting away from their long-favored destination of Croatia. Factors driving this change include a desire for milder summer climates and more affordable prices compared to the increasingly expensive Croatian Riviera. The introduction of a direct train line from Prague to Polish coastal cities has further fueled this trend, with Polish media and officials welcoming the "Czech invasion." This shift also reflects a broader Czech admiration for Poland's recent economic development and infrastructure improvements, which have seen it surpass the Czech Republic in some areas.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season by the end of the week. The storm, which developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, has already caused flooding and at least eight fatalities in the region. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center, Erin is projected to move west and could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain, prompting vigilance as the hurricane season intensifies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new interim guidance encouraging police forces in the UK to consider releasing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases. This change aims to counter misinformation and public speculation, particularly in an age of rapid social media spread. The move follows criticism of forces for withholding such details in sensitive cases, including one involving the alleged sexual assault of a child in Warwickshire. While the government supports greater transparency, the final decision remains with individual police forces, who must balance public interest with the need to ensure a fair trial.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a significantly altered annual State Department report on global human rights, softening criticism of allies like El Salvador and Israel while increasing censure of countries like Brazil and South Africa. The report, delayed for months, reflects a shift towards an "America First" ideology, omitting sections on LGBTQ+ rights and downplaying the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Human rights groups and former officials have criticized the document for prioritizing political agendas over factual reporting, noting that the changes align with the administration's foreign policy objectives rather than providing an objective assessment of human rights conditions worldwide.</p>

Foreign journalists are largely barred from independently accessing Gaza, forcing international media to rely on local Palestinian journalists who face immense danger. This media blockade complicates efforts to report on the severe humanitarian crisis, with the UN and other groups accusing Israel of obstructing a clear view of the war's impact.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Juneau, Alaska, have issued urgent evacuation warnings for parts of the city as they brace for potentially record-breaking floods from the Mendenhall Glacier. The flooding is caused by an annual event where water from the Suicide Basin, a side basin dammed by the glacier, breaks through the ice dam and flows into Mendenhall Lake and River. This year's glacial outburst is predicted to surpass previous records, threatening hundreds of homes located near the river. While temporary barriers have been installed, the event highlights the growing and immediate dangers posed by climate change-induced glacial retreat in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to participate in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders from NATO countries. This call is being held just days before Trump's high-stakes, in-person summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The preparatory meeting, convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is an effort by European and Ukrainian leaders to ensure their perspectives are considered ahead of the direct U.S.-Russia talks. European allies have expressed concerns about being sidelined and are pushing for Ukraine's direct involvement in any negotiations concerning its future and the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Four years after the collapse of property giant China Evergrande, millions of Chinese homebuyers are still suffering the consequences, with many living in unfinished or substandard homes. The developer's debt crisis triggered a wave of frozen construction projects across the country, leaving people who had prepaid for their properties in a state of financial and personal limbo. Many are still waiting for their homes to be completed, while others have moved into apartments that are mere shells, lacking basic utilities and failing to meet safety standards. The situation highlights the long-lasting human impact of China's real estate market turmoil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report highlights the severe and often overlooked health risks that climate change poses to pregnant women, newborns, and children, particularly in the world's poorest regions. Researchers found that extreme heat, air pollution from fossil fuels, and malnutrition from crop failures are linked to higher rates of preterm births, stillbirths, and infant and maternal deaths. The analysis concludes that one billion children are already at an "extremely high risk" from these effects. The report stresses that these dangers will worsen with rising global temperatures, undermining public health gains and threatening the well-being of the most vulnerable populations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is actively taming expectations for the upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, framing the meeting as a "listening exercise" rather than a forum for a definitive peace deal. This shift in tone comes as European allies and Ukraine express concern that Trump might push for a peace agreement involving territorial concessions from Kyiv. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt emphasized that only one side of the conflict will be present, suggesting the goal is for Trump to better understand the situation. This downplaying of the summit's potential outcomes signals the complexity and low probability of a major breakthrough.</p>

          <p>China has announced it is ceasing all engagement with Czech President Petr Pavel after he met with the Dalai Lama during a personal visit to India. Beijing condemned the meeting as a "provocative action," stating it lodged serious protests and firmly opposes the engagement. The meeting marked the first time a sitting Czech president has met with the Tibetan spiritual leader. This diplomatic fallout underscores the sensitivity of issues related to Tibet for the Chinese government and its willingness to take strong diplomatic action against leaders who engage with figures it considers separatists.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's air force has stated that its stepped-up air strike campaign has killed 592 armed militia members in the northeastern state of Borno over the past eight months. The offensive targets insurgents from Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), who have destabilized the region for years. The Chief of Air Staff reported that the operation, bolstered by advanced aircraft, has also destroyed hundreds of vehicles and logistics hubs belonging to the militant groups. While the military claims significant success, some analysts note that it is difficult to independently verify these figures amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>U.S. authorities are secretly embedding location tracking devices in select shipments of advanced artificial intelligence chips to prevent their illegal diversion to China, according to sources with direct knowledge. This law enforcement tactic is part of a broader effort to enforce strict export controls aimed at limiting China's access to high-end semiconductor technology. The trackers, hidden in server packaging, help authorities build cases against smuggling networks. The measure reveals the extent of the U.S. government's campaign to control the flow of critical technology amid escalating tech tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>France, the UK, and Germany have warned that they are prepared to trigger "snapback" sanctions against Iran if it does not re-engage in diplomatic talks over its nuclear program. In a letter to the United Nations, the European powers stated they would reinstate the U.N. sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, if a solution is not found by the end of August 2025. This move follows increased regional tensions and Iran's significant advancements in uranium enrichment since the U.S. withdrew from the accord. The threat of sanctions is a high-stakes effort to pressure Tehran back to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is floating the idea of providing rebate checks to Americans, using the substantial revenue generated from its tariffs on imported goods. President Trump confirmed that a rebate for people of a certain income level is being considered, alongside using the funds to pay down national debt. Following the president's comments, Senator Josh Hawley introduced the American Worker Rebate Act, which would formalize the payments to help offset the higher consumer prices that result from the tariffs. The proposal's implementation would depend on congressional approval and the actual amount of tariff revenue collected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced the expansion of live facial recognition (LFR) technology, deploying ten new vans across seven police forces in England. These vans are equipped with cameras that scan faces in public and compare them against watchlists of wanted suspects for serious crimes like homicide and sexual offenses. The government cites the technology's success in London, where it led to 580 arrests in one year. However, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have called the expansion alarming and a move towards a total surveillance society, raising significant concerns about privacy and the lack of a robust legal framework.</p>
