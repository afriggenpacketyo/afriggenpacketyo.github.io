        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's export growth slowed for the second consecutive month, according to recent government data, due to the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. The country's exports grew by 2%, which aligned with analysts' estimates but marked the slowest pace since October of the previous year. The article notes that Japan is currently subject to a 25% levy on its auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S., and also faces 'reciprocal' tariffs of 24% that have been temporarily suspended. The slowdown in exports has contributed to a contraction in Japan's real gross domestic product, highlighting the economic challenges posed by trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed his chief spokesman to lead a review of the U.S. military's 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, aiming to ensure accountability among senior military officials. This decision is unusual, suggesting skepticism that military leaders would hold each other accountable. The review will include former Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller, who previously criticized senior military officials for their handling of the withdrawal. The article points out that the review's scope will likely exclude broader decisions leading up to the withdrawal, such as the Trump administration's deal with the Taliban, and the collapse of the Afghan military.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant in Florida is facing a $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the U.S. after a 2005 removal order, according to CBS News. ICE is charging the 41-year-old woman $500 for every day she has remained in the country since the order was issued. The article highlights that this enforcement aligns with the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which has rarely been enforced historically. The woman's attorney is appealing the fine, arguing that her client was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S. and that she is the mother of three U.S. citizen children.</p>

          <p>Japan's Agriculture Minister Taku Eto resigned after making an inappropriate comment about rice amid a national rice shortage and soaring prices. Eto stated that he had "never had to buy rice" because supporters gave it to him, sparking public outrage. The article explains that rice is a staple food in Japan, and Eto's comment struck a nerve in a country where retail rice prices have doubled since last year.

          <p>Many states do not require schools to have specific emergency plans for students with disabilities, leaving them feeling left behind and at risk during crises. One student with rheumatoid arthritis recounted her traumatic experience during a school shooting, where she was the last to exit the classroom and had guns trained on her due to needing her cane. The article highlights that more than 7.5 million U.S. public school students live with a disability, and a CBS News analysis found that nearly 6.3 million of them live in states without required specific emergency plans.

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a first-of-its-kind waiver for Nebraska to ban purchases of soda and energy drinks through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), starting next year. The article explains that the decision marks a sharp shift in nutrition policy, as the federal government has previously rejected states' efforts to impose such restrictions. Nebraska will regularly survey participants to evaluate changes in their spending habits and examine retailer data to assess reductions in purchases of soda and energy drinks. Other states are also seeking similar waivers.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has found that red meat studies with industry links were more likely to report favorable results than those without them. The review, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, suggests that conflicts of interest may shape the way people understand the health consequences of eating red meat. The article notes that studies funded by the sugar and alcohol industries have similarly downplayed the health risks associated with their products. The findings raise concerns about the credibility of nutrition science and the influence of financial interests.</p>

          <p>China and the US have reached a tariff truce, offering hope for resolution on fentanyl and other issues. The better-than-expected results from their Geneva negotiations sent ripples of confidence through financial markets. Though the US has scaled back its tariffs on Chinese goods from the prohibitive 145 per cent – effectively a trade embargo – the remaining cumulative tariffs hovering around 50 per cent still cast a long shadow over bilateral trade. The truce signals that neither side is willing – nor prepared – to sever economic ties completely.</p>

Palo Alto Networks has reached an inflection point in customer adoption for the security products that are critical to its future growth in the cloud-computing and artificial intelligence eras. The company is uniquely positioned to win due to its best-in-class tools and a broad product portfolio that allows it to provide an all-encompassing "platform" solution to cybersecurity.</p>
