        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Allen, representing Northern Ireland, executed a remarkable 147 maximum break at the World Snooker Championship, making him only the 11th player to achieve this feat at the Crucible. Despite this incredible moment, Allen faced a significant deficit against Chris Wakelin, trailing 12-4 and nearing defeat. This break marked Allen's second 147 of the season and the fifth of his career, earning him a potential £45,000 prize, which would be split if another player achieves a maximum break during the tournament. The event was hailed as "absolutely phenomenal" by snooker legend Stephen Hendry, despite Allen's precarious position in the match.</p>

          <p>Judge Hannah Dugan of Wisconsin was arrested by the FBI on obstruction charges for allegedly interfering with the arrest of an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, by ICE agents at her courthouse. Dugan is accused of intentionally misdirecting agents and escorting Flores-Ruiz through a non-public exit to evade arrest; Flores-Ruiz was previously deported and illegally re-entered the U.S. According to witness accounts, Dugan became visibly angry upon learning of the planned arrest and confronted the agents before assisting Flores-Ruiz. Dugan was charged with two counts of obstruction and released after her initial court appearance, with her arraignment set for May 15.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As collections resume for defaulted student loans, the U.S. government has the power to seize federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits to recover debts. Social Security recipients may have up to 15% of their monthly benefit reduced, with a minimum of $750 a month protected, while the entire federal tax refund can be seized. Borrowers can avoid collection activity by getting out of default through income-driven repayment plans or loan rehabilitation, and are advised to request retroactive forbearance to cover missed payments. The Education Department is emailing borrowers about the new policy.</p>

          <p>The Swampbuster provision, a 40-year-old federal regulation requiring farmers to preserve wetlands on their property to remain eligible for federal crop insurance, is facing renewed challenges. Jim Conlan, an Iowa landowner, is spearheading an effort to alter the rule, arguing it represents government overreach, while conservationists defend Swampbuster as crucial for preventing habitat destruction. The provision has been upheld by both Republican and Democratic administrations, but faces increasing scrutiny from those who view it as an infringement on property rights. The outcome of this challenge could significantly impact the conservation of wetlands across the country.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges in New York. Prosecutors stated that Santos defrauded voters and donors by fabricating his background, leading to his expulsion from Congress.

As part of his plea deal, Santos agreed to pay over $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture for crimes including making false financial disclosures, soliciting forged documents, and fraudulently obtaining unemployment benefits.</p>

          <p>Online scammers are increasingly using "wrong number" text messages, often aided by AI, to trick phone users into providing personal information and financial account access. These seemingly harmless messages are designed to validate active mobile numbers and build relationships for future scams, including "pig butchering scams" that target life savings. Consumers lost $470 million to scams originating from text messages in 2024, a five-fold increase from 2020, and AI is making these scams more efficient by tailoring texts and combing through social media profiles.

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a volatile trading day, ending a three-day relief rally fueled by hopes of de-escalation in the trade war, as mixed signals from the White House regarding potential trade deals created uncertainty. Several companies, including Intel, Eastman Chemical, and Skechers U.S.A., cited trade-related uncertainty as a factor making it difficult to provide financial forecasts. While the U.S. stock market lost some steam, a decline in 10-year Treasury yields and a strengthening U.S. dollar provided some relief, with analysts projecting a potential economic rebound next year as businesses adapt to tariffs and the Federal Reserve introduces rate cuts.

Aid agencies and foreign governments have voiced alarm over the deteriorating situation, with the WFP reporting that food prices have skyrocketed by 1,400% since the ceasefire collapsed. Israel has consistently denied that Gaza faces a food crisis, claiming that aid vehicles entered Gaza during the 42-day ceasefire.</p>

          <h2>Consumers Weigh Options Amid Tariffs: Buy Now, Stock Up, or Delay Purchases</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are reacting to tariffs by rushing to buy new vehicles ahead of price increases, while others are delaying major purchases due to uncertainty. A NielsenIQ survey found that 35% of U.S. consumers plan to postpone major purchases like homes or cars because of tariffs, compared to 7% who plan to buy early to avoid higher prices. Despite this, the auto sector has seen a surge in sales, with consumers trying to save money before tariffs take effect, while other sectors have not seen widespread stockpiling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis indicates that tariffs imposed by President Trump would disproportionately harm lower-income U.S. households, with taxes for the poorest 20% rising about four times more than those in the top 1%. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) found that tariffs would impose a tax increase equal to 6.2% of income for the bottom 20% of households, compared to 1.7% for the top 1%. Economists argue that tariffs are a regressive policy, hurting those at the bottom more than those at the top, as they raise the price of essential goods like food and clothing.</p>
