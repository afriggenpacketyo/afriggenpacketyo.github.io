          <p>Thousands of Ukrainians protested in Kyiv against a new law they fear will undermine the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies, NABU and SAPO. Critics, including activists and some EU officials, argue the bill grants excessive power to the prosecutor general, potentially harming Ukraine's fight against corruption and its chances for victory. This internal political turmoil unfolds as Ukrainian and Russian officials prepare for a third round of talks in Istanbul, though expectations for a major breakthrough on a ceasefire remain low on both sides.</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a significant trade deal that includes lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%. President Trump announced the agreement, stating it also involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and opens Japanese markets to more American goods. The deal is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and has already caused a surge in Japanese automaker stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Opposition groups in Eswatini are expressing outrage over a deal with the United States to accept deported foreign nationals whom their home countries refuse to take back. The largest opposition party has labeled the agreement "human trafficking disguised as a deportation deal," raising concerns about transparency and safety. This comes after the U.S. flew five men convicted of serious crimes to the small African monarchy, which has stated it is prepared to receive more deportees.</p>

          <p>This article revisits Stanley Forman's iconic 1975 photograph that captured a 19-year-old woman and a 2-year-old girl falling from a collapsed fire escape during a Boston apartment fire. The haunting image, which won a Pulitzer Prize, led to the woman's death but the child's survival. The photo's widespread publication shocked the public and directly spurred the city of Boston to enact new, stringent regulations requiring regular inspection and certification of all fire escapes, a legacy of safety born from tragedy.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck that emerged from the sands of Sanday, one of Scotland's Orkney Islands, has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich 250-year-old history. Through a combination of scientific dating and community-led archival research, archaeologists determined the ship was originally an HMS Royal Navy frigate that fought in the American War of Independence before becoming an Arctic whaling ship. The vessel was ultimately wrecked in a storm in 1788, with all crew members surviving.</p>
