        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Irish-language rap group Kneecap performed a contentious set at the Glastonbury Festival, drawing a massive crowd. The performance included chants against UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had deemed their appearance inappropriate. This controversy stems from a pending terrorism charge against one member for allegedly displaying a proscribed flag, a charge the band calls politically motivated. During their set, the group also voiced strong support for Palestine and criticized the UK's arms sales to Israel, mixing hedonistic electro-rap with pointed political statements.</p>

Grossi stressed the urgent need for diplomatic engagement and the return of IAEA inspectors to verify the status of Iran's nuclear material and activities, warning that a military solution is not a definitive one.</p>

          <p>The sudden death of Indian billionaire Sunjay Kapur after he reportedly swallowed a bee during a polo match has raised questions about rare cardiac reactions. Medical experts explain that while extremely uncommon, a sting inside the throat can trigger anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. This can lead to a phenomenon known as Kounis syndrome, where the allergic reaction causes a heart attack, even in individuals without pre-existing heart disease. The article clarifies that this is not a common risk for the general public and typically affects those with known venom hypersensitivity.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya, which resulted in 19 deaths, have intensified concerns over press freedom and freedom of expression. Security forces reportedly used live ammunition on demonstrators, and the government attempted to ban live media coverage of the events, an order that was quickly revoked by judges. Journalists and activists report being targeted with violence and legal threats, with critics arguing the government is using a 2018 cybercrime law as a weapon against dissent. The unrest, largely driven by dissatisfied youth, signals a deepening rift between the populace and the state.</p>

National figures, including Donald Trump, have labeled Mamdani a communist and are linking his progressive platform to the national Democratic agenda to energize their base. While some progressive Democrats have embraced Mamdani, moderates have been more critical, creating an internal party dynamic that Republicans aim to exploit ahead of upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that Yelp's introduction of a "Black-owned" business tag coincided with a decline in average ratings for these establishments in the Detroit area. Researchers suggest the increased visibility may have led to more "cross-cultural" interactions from Yelp's predominantly white user base, resulting in reviews that reference stereotypes of slow or rude service. The study highlights how well-intentioned digital initiatives can have unintended negative consequences, adding another challenge for Black-owned businesses that already face significant hurdles in securing funding and support.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of housing markets projects that several U.S. cities will experience modest increases in home values during the second half of 2025. Among the top cities identified are Rochester, Buffalo, and Utica in New York, as well as Atlantic City, New Jersey. The forecasted growth is slight, with the highest projected three-month change being only 0.70% for Rochester. The report provides a snapshot of markets expected to see stable to minor appreciation, which is relevant for potential buyers and sellers navigating the current real estate landscape.

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its food products by the end of 2027. This move aligns the company with other major food producers like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have made similar commitments amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of synthetic dyes. While many of Smucker's products, such as Uncrustables, are already free from these additives, the change will affect items like sugar-free jams and some products from its recently acquired Hostess brand, including Twinkies and Snoballs.</p>

          <p>South Africa's coalition government is under severe strain after the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), withdrew from a national dialogue initiative. The move came after President Cyril Ramaphosa dismissed a DA member from a deputy minister post. The DA has accused Ramaphosa of double standards for not acting against alleged corruption within his own African National Congress (ANC) party. This public clash threatens the stability of the fragile government, which was formed just over a year ago after the ANC lost its long-held parliamentary majority.</p>

This low-cost, high-impact strategy provides a blueprint for smaller militaries to counter the airpower of larger nations. The attack imposes significant financial and strategic costs on Russia and demonstrates that even well-defended, distant assets are now vulnerable to asymmetric drone warfare.</p>
