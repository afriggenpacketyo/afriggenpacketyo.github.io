          <p>Germany is planning to tighten its border controls with several thousand additional police officers as soon as the new coalition government assumes office next week. Incoming Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that stricter border checks and an increased number of entry denials would be among the first decisions made. Dobrindt received support from regional interior minister Tobias Strobl, who promised even tighter border checks by state police, including the use of surveillance drones. The coalition agreement includes turning away asylum seekers from German borders in coordination with European neighbors.</p>

          <p>Sudan's military reported that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attacked Port Sudan, the government's temporary seat of power, with suicide drones, marking the first time the city has been targeted in the two-year conflict. The army stated that Osman Digna Air Base, a goods warehouse, and some civilian facilities were hit, resulting in limited damage but no casualties. The RSF has expanded its drone attacks on army-held areas since losing control of other regions, including most of the capital, Khartoum. The civil war in Sudan erupted two years ago amid a bumpy transition to democracy following the 2019 fall of Omar al-Bashir's rule.</p>

          <p>Meghan McCain faced criticism for blaming the parents of Michael Gloss, an American who died fighting for Russia in the Ukraine war, questioning the fitness of the mother, a CIA deputy director, to hold her position. Gloss, the son of parents who both served in the U.S. Navy, had embraced leftist ideologies and expressed anti-American sentiments before joining the Russian army. The author of the opinion piece argues that McCain's criticism reflects a lack of understanding of the challenges of raising teenagers, referencing the parable of the prodigal son and empathizing with the Glosses' situation.</p>

          <p>Japan and China have exchanged accusations regarding airspace violations near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. Japan claims a Chinese helicopter entered its airspace, prompting the scrambling of fighter jets, and lodged a protest with the Chinese ambassador. China, in turn, alleges that a Japanese civilian aircraft illegally entered the airspace of the islands and was expelled by a helicopter. Both countries have expressed strong dissatisfaction and protested the other's actions, further straining their bilateral relations.</p>

Reform has demonstrated effective campaigning and a strong brand, but must now prove its ability to govern effectively.
