        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the US, burdened by debt and increased competition from weight loss injections like Ozempic and Mounjaro. The company plans to restructure its debt, writing off $1.15 billion while continuing operations without impacting its members. WeightWatchers acknowledges a rapidly changing weight management landscape due to the popularity of these injections, but aims to continue offering its weight-loss programs, telehealth services, and workshops. The company states that the bankruptcy plan has the support of its lenders, ensuring a smooth transition during this 'significant transition'.</p>

          <p>As of May 7th, U.S. travelers are now required to present a Real ID or another acceptable form of identification, such as a passport, for domestic air travel. Despite initial concerns about delays, many airports experienced normal or even lower-than-usual wait times, with a significant percentage of travelers prepared for the new requirement. The TSA has extra staff on hand to assist travelers and clarify acceptable forms of ID, advising passengers to arrive at least three hours early if they lack a Real ID. While the deadline has passed, individuals can still apply for a Real ID, but should be wary of potential scams and only apply in person at the DMV.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has abandoned some of the most aggressive proposals to cut Medicaid costs, revealing divisions within the Republican party regarding funding for President Trumpâ€™s domestic agenda. House Republicans have decided against lowering federal payments to states for working-age adults enrolled through the Affordable Care Actâ€™s Medicaid expansion and are also likely to reject a shift to flat fee payments per person. This retreat underscores the difficulty Republicans face in achieving their spending cut targets while securing enough votes for passage, with ultraconservatives expressing their opposition and insisting on deficit-neutral reconciliation bills.</p>

          <p>Michael Pitt, known for his role in "Boardwalk Empire," has been arrested and indicted in Brooklyn on multiple charges including sexual abuse, criminal sex act, assault, and strangulation. The charges stem from alleged incidents occurring in 2020 and 2021, with the indictment detailing several instances of alleged sexual assault and physical violence against unnamed individuals. Pitt pleaded not guilty and was released until his next court date in June. His attorney asserts the claims are baseless and suspiciously raised years after the alleged incidents, claiming to have exonerating evidence that will lead to the case's dismissal.</p>

          <p>Tensions have escalated dramatically between India and Pakistan following Indian missile strikes into Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Pakistani territory, resulting in numerous casualties. India claims the strikes targeted militant infrastructure linked to a recent massacre of tourists, while Pakistan has condemned the action as an act of war, vowing retaliation. Both countries have reported casualties and engaged in security exercises, heightening fears of further conflict. International concern is mounting, with the U.S. urging de-escalation and offering assistance, while the U.N.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to eliminate dozens of National Park Service grants, including programs focused on climate change and diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.). According to an internal document, these cuts could save $26 million by terminating grants to universities, state historic preservation offices, tribes, and youth corps. The proposed eliminations include climate resiliency studies, watershed protection efforts, and improvements to accommodate children with disabilities. Critics argue that these cuts are penny-wise and pound-foolish, sacrificing valuable knowledge and expertise while saving relatively little money, and that eliminating climate change studies will harm the park-visiting public.</p>

The attraction aims to blend Disney's signature entertainment with the cultural essence of Abu Dhabi, hoping to attract visitors from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

          <p>Ford Motor is raising prices on the Maverick, Bronco Sport, and Mach-E models produced in Mexico, citing higher U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles as a contributing factor. The price increases, reaching up to $2,000 per model, affect vehicles built after May 2, with the tariff being a 25% duty on vehicles assembled abroad. Ford expects to absorb some of the tariff costs, estimating a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit this year, and has withdrawn its full-year financial guidance due to economic uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's trade policies. Higher tariffs could raise the price of foreign-made cars by $2,000 to $12,000, depending on the model.</p>

Pritzker's office dismissed Noem's visit as a publicity stunt, accusing her of performing for Fox News rather than focusing on homeland security, and highlighting Latino Unity Day in Illinois as a counterpoint to Noem's message.</p>

The Fed will keep the federal funds rate in its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has remained since the last rate cut in December. The central bank signaled rising economic risks, stating that "uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further," while also noting that the jobless rate has stabilized.

The study also highlights a partisan divide, with Democrats more likely than Republicans to believe that videos of police violence against Black people can hold police accountable.

The article contrasts Buchanan's approach with Obama-era liberalism and highlights his focus on hierarchy and traditional values, while also noting similarities between Buchanan's worldview and that of Donald Trump, particularly regarding nationalism and skepticism toward international cooperation.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold interest rates steady as uncertainties surrounding the global economic outlook increase, particularly due to President Trump's aggressive trade strategy. Policymakers cautioned about rising risks of higher unemployment and inflation, while reiterating that they would carefully assess incoming data and the evolving outlook. Despite pressure from Trump to cut rates, the Fed has remained cautious, citing heightened uncertainty. The decision follows a recent contraction in US GDP, raising concerns about a potential recession amid Trump's tariffs and threats of tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the United States would halt bombing the Houthis in Yemen, claiming the group had "capitulated" to the U.S. Additionally, the administration is closely monitoring developments between Pakistan and India following recent exchanges of fire.

          <p>The deadline for travelers to show Real ID for domestic flights has arrived, but the lack of enforcement raises questions about the Trump administration's true intentions. Despite warnings of delays, the TSA is advising travelers that they may expect delays in the future but are not enforcing the requirement today. The article suggests that the administration's focus may be on immigration enforcement rather than security provision, using the threat of Real ID as a tool to target undocumented migrants. This shift in emphasis may lead to confusion and skepticism about the necessity of Real ID, potentially undermining efforts to enhance security.</p>

          <p>Stephen Curry will miss at least the next three games of the Golden State Warriors' playoff series against Minnesota due to a strained hamstring. The injury occurred during Game 1, where Curry scored 13 points in 13 minutes before leaving the court. The Warriors are preparing to play without their star guard, who has a history of playoff injuries. While the team has overcome such absences in the past, this year's roster is considered weaker than previous championship-winning teams, making Curry's absence a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have approved an amendment authorizing the sale of thousands of acres of federal public land in Nevada and Utah. The proposed land sales and exchanges are primarily aimed at building affordable housing near Las Vegas, Reno, and St. George, Utah. Supporters argue that the high percentage of federal lands impacts local governments' ability to manage resources and promote economic development. Democrats and environmentalists criticize the amendment as part of a broader push to transfer federal public lands to state or private entities, potentially benefiting wealthy interests.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, prospective home equity borrowers have an opportunity to analyze their options. Historically, home equity loans were favored during rate pauses due to their fixed rates. However, the current climate suggests a potential rate cut in the near future, making HELOCs, with their variable rates, a potentially better option. The average HELOC interest rate is currently lower than home equity loan rates, and HELOCs have seen more significant rate drops recently, offering potential savings. Borrowers should carefully compare both options and consider their ability to manage variable payments.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady could pave the way for lower mortgage rates later in the year, but it's not guaranteed. While this pause sends a positive signal to the markets, mortgage rates respond to a broader mix of economic factors, many of which remain uncertain or volatile. Factors influencing mortgage rates include inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty. Homebuyers and homeowners should stay informed, prepare financially, and be ready to act quickly to secure competitive mortgage rates.</p>
