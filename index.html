          <p>A public inquiry has begun into the horrific Southport attack of July 2024, where three young children died and ten others were seriously injured at a dance studio. Sir Adrian Fulford, the inquiry chairman, characterized the event as one of the most egregious crimes in the nation's history, noting the perpetrator's "deteriorating and deeply troubling behavior." The inquiry will unfold in two stages, initially scrutinizing Axel Rudakubana's past dealings with relevant agencies to identify any missed opportunities. The second phase will delve into the broader phenomenon of young people drawn into extreme violence, aiming for sensible and achievable recommendations.</p>

          <p>This article details the current average mortgage and refinance interest rates as of July 7, 2025, with 30-year mortgages averaging 6.80% and 15-year at 6.00%. It acknowledges the difficulties faced by homebuyers and those seeking to refinance due to prevailing high rates and limited housing supply. However, it emphasizes that securing favorable options remains possible, particularly for applicants with strong credit profiles. Financial experts anticipate potential relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes. The article advises consumers to enhance their credit, compare offers from various lenders, and carefully evaluate loan terms and associated fees to optimize their financial decisions.

          <h2>"Revenge Savings" Trend Emerges Amid Economic Anxiety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 09:25:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by Intuit Credit Karma indicates that 44% of Americans are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," modifying their financial behaviors based on their feelings about the economy, regardless of personal financial changes. This trend has fueled a shift from "revenge spending" to "revenge saving," driven by anxieties concerning rising prices and potential recession. Financial experts advocate for intentional saving over emotionally driven habits, suggesting a structured approach. Key steps include thoroughly assessing one's financial situation, practicing "reverse budgeting" by earmarking savings first, and establishing separate accounts for distinct financial objectives. Consistently increasing savings rates, even marginally, is advised to harness the power of compounding and enhance long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders have co-signed an open letter to Sequoia Capital, urging the prominent venture firm to publicly condemn partner Shaun Maguire's recent controversial remarks. Maguire, a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, posted on X that Muslim Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani "comes from a culture that lies about everything" and is advancing an "Islamist agenda." The signatories demand an apology to Mamdani and Muslim founders, an independent investigation into Maguire's past conduct, and the implementation of a zero-tolerance policy against hate speech and religious bigotry. Sequoia Capital has not commented, while Maguire has stated the attempts to silence him will only embolden him, underscoring significant political and ethical divisions within the tech investment sector.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for taxpayers struggling to pay their IRS bills, a common challenge in the current economic climate marked by rising costs and stagnant wages. It strongly advises against ignoring tax liabilities, as this can lead to severe collection actions such as wage garnishments or bank levies. The article details several available tax relief options, including long-term IRS payment plans for debts up to $50,000, repayable over 72 months, or short-term plans offering 180 days. It also explains the Offer in Compromise, a settlement for a lower amount for those facing financial hardship, and the "Currently Not Collectible" status, which delays collection. Furthermore, penalty abatement options, like the "first-time abate" waiver, are highlighted for eligible taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

A German aircraft involved in Operation ASPIDES, an EU mission aimed at protecting commercial ships from Houthi militia attacks, was targeted with a laser by a Chinese warship. The German Foreign Office publicly declared this act "entirely unacceptable," citing the endangerment of German personnel and disruption of the operation. The incident, which took place earlier in the month, forced the aircraft to abort its mission and return to base, though it landed safely.

          <p>Digital bank Monzo has received a substantial £21 million fine from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) due to severe deficiencies in its anti-financial crime measures, specifically between October 2018 and August 2020. The investigation uncovered that Monzo's inadequate address verification allowed it to accept customer applications listing "implausible" addresses, including 10 Downing Street and Buckingham Palace. This oversight led to the onboarding of high-risk customers, some based outside the UK, revealing a significant lapse in the bank's financial crime controls. The FCA also noted that Monzo repeatedly breached requirements by opening accounts for high-risk customers between August 2020 and June 2022. Monzo's CEO, TS Anil, asserted that these issues have since been resolved, emphasizing the bank's commitment to combating financial crime within the sector.</p>

          <p>Malaysia, a diverse Muslim-majority nation, is increasingly contending with the rise of religious conservatism and the growing influence of Islamic-oriented political parties. The opposition Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition, which includes the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), achieved significant electoral success in 2023, advocating for policies aligned with conservative Islamic ideology, such as hudud and stricter social norms. This "green wave" reflects a notable surge in support among younger and more conservative Malay voters, posing a substantial challenge to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration. Experts debate whether this trend is primarily political posturing or a deeper, long-term shift that could impact the country's multi-religious and multi-ethnic identity. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey indicated strong support among Muslim Malaysians for Sharia as official law.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers report a significant breakthrough in military communication, developing a "telepathy" radio system that enables high-speed data transmission without emitting any active signals. This innovation, led by senior engineer Liu Kaiyu of the Aerospace Information Research Institute, could render People's Liberation Army combat units effectively invisible in electronic warfare scenarios. Traditionally, military radios pose a dilemma: crucial communication risks broadcasting user locations, exposing forces to interception, jamming, and missile strikes. The new system, detailed in the Journal of Radars, allows platforms like tanks, warships, and aircraft to send extensive data while maintaining absolute radio silence. This development offers a substantial strategic advantage, potentially redefining the landscape of modern electronic warfare.</p>

In response, the children's commissioners for all four UK nations have jointly urged the government to immediately abolish the two-child benefit cap and implement annual increases in all child-related benefits, stressing that children cannot afford to wait. Critics, including Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier, have corroborated the grim living conditions described. While the government is developing a child poverty strategy, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that lifting the cap would cost £3.4 billion annually but could lift 500,000 children out of poverty.</p>

          <p>Studies reveal a distinctive trend in adolescent suicide rates in China, where youth from more affluent families with highly educated parents face a higher risk of self-harm, a pattern that diverges from global norms. This alarming finding is largely attributed to the immense academic pressure exerted by parents who are intensely focused on their children's success. Although factors such as loneliness, parental neglect, and poverty also contribute to suicidal ideation, particularly among "left-behind" children in rural regions, the article underscores the profound influence of these unique parental expectations.

          <p>Belgian sprinter Jasper Philipsen, who was wearing the green jersey, has crashed out of the Tour de France during its third stage after a high-speed collision with Frenchman Bryan Coquard. Philipsen suffered a broken collarbone and at least one rib, forcing his withdrawal from the race. This incident underscores the significant risks inherent in the Tour's initial week, where riders, particularly sprinters, exhibit an "extreme willingness to take risks" due to the scarcity of flat stages. In response to such dangers, cycling's governing body, the UCI, has implemented new measures this year, including a "yellow card" system for rider misconduct and an extended finish zone for flat stages, allowing crashed riders to be credited with the same time as their group.</p>

          <p>In the Dutch fishing village of Urk, a new foundation named Identiteit Gezocht is leveraging advanced DNA technology and artificial intelligence to locate and identify fishermen lost at sea decades ago. This initiative offers renewed hope to families, such as Jan van den Berg's, whose father vanished 70 years prior. The foundation's approach involves mapping sunken vessels, analyzing historical weather patterns and ocean currents, and utilizing AI to search for relevant press articles detailing bodies washed ashore. The Netherlands is a leader in this field, having exhumed 90% of unknown bodies and stored their DNA profiles in a European database. Supported by volunteers and donors, the foundation strives to provide long-awaited answers and closure to hundreds of families affected by these unresolved losses.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration recently issued an email that experts deem misleading, asserting that President Trump's "one big beautiful bill" would eliminate federal income taxes on benefits for nearly 90% of older Americans. Tax experts refute this claim, clarifying that the legislation, which introduces a new $6,000 senior deduction, cannot directly alter Social Security tax provisions due to restrictions within the budget reconciliation process. While this deduction may indirectly lower tax liabilities for certain middle-income seniors, it is unlikely to eliminate taxes for the majority and is projected to weaken the program's financial standing by reducing tax revenue. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates these tax changes will cost the Social Security program approximately $30 billion annually, potentially accelerating its projected insolvency date.

Netanyahu further affirmed Israel's intention to maintain security control over the Gaza Strip, appearing to dismiss the prospect of Palestinian statehood.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent declaration of new tariffs on 14 countries, with a significant focus on Asian economies, is widely interpreted by analysts as an indirect strategy to exert pressure on China within the ongoing trade rivalry. These tariffs, slated to commence on August 1, aim to compel nations such as Japan, South Korea, and various Southeast Asian countries to forge trade agreements with the U.S. These deals could potentially include clauses that seek to limit China's involvement in regional supply chains. The article specifically discusses "trans-shipping" as a tactic for tariff evasion, referencing Vietnam's recent agreement with the U.S. as a potential model for future negotiations. Experts remain divided on whether other Asian nations will adopt similar strategies, considering their substantial trade relationships with Beijing and the perceived unpredictability of Trump's trade policies.

          <p>Yorkshire Water has enacted the UK's first hosepipe ban of 2025, impacting over five million customers starting this Friday. The measure is a direct response to the region experiencing its driest and warmest spring on record, resulting in critically low reservoir levels, currently just over 50% capacity—significantly below the average for early July. The ban strictly prohibits using hosepipes for activities such as garden watering or car washing, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. The Environment Agency had already declared a drought across the region last month, and Thames Water has also warned its customers of impending restrictions. Public reaction is mixed, with some customers acknowledging the need for conservation while others criticize the company's high leakage rates.</p>

Upon arrival, doctors gave Montalvo a dire 15% chance of survival. However, due to the hospital's efficient stroke protocol, he received clot-busting medication within minutes and underwent a subsequent procedure to clear the brain clot.

          <p>Norman Tebbit, a highly influential cabinet minister during Margaret Thatcher's government and a steadfast ally, has passed away at the age of 94. Throughout the 1980s, he served as chairman of the Conservative Party and headed key departments, including trade and industry and employment, playing a pivotal role in enacting laws designed to curtail union power. Lord Tebbit and his wife sustained injuries in the 1984 IRA Brighton hotel bombing, an incident where his stoicism and courage earned widespread admiration. Tributes from across the political spectrum have lauded his strong convictions, direct approach, and profound impact on British politics. Former colleagues underscored his critical contribution to Margaret Thatcher's policy successes and his remarkable personal resilience in the face of severe adversity.</p>
