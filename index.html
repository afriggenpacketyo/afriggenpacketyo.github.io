          <h2>Indian Markets Remain Resilient Despite Tensions with Pakistan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 04:59:36 EDT</div>

          <p>Despite recent military strikes by India within Pakistani territory, Indian markets have shown remarkable resilience, driven by strong domestic demand, structural reforms, and solid macroeconomic fundamentals. Investors remain optimistic about India's growth prospects, viewing any market dips as momentary pauses rather than derailments. The progress in India's trade talks, including a free trade agreement with the U.K., further bolsters market confidence. The country is expected to be among the first in the region to strike a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. before the third quarter of 2025, further strengthening India's economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of 2025, anticipating the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical giant had previously reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales for Wegovy, leading to a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast. However, the end of a drug shortage ruling by the FDA is expected to allow sales to pick up again later in the year. CEO Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen expects compounding to be knocked off, so to say, and we get that business growth going forward.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander is set to return to the stage after a 17-year hiatus, making her UK theatre debut in a West End production of Ibsen's 'The Lady from the Sea.' Vikander, who grew up around theatre due to her mother's stage acting career, will play the lead character Ellida, a sea-loving woman torn between her current marriage and a former lover's return. The play, adapted and directed by Simon Stone, will run for eight weeks at London's Bridge Theatre, also starring Andrew Lincoln.

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amid trade concerns. The measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with initiatives for consumption and elderly care. However, some analysts suggest that borrowing may be insensitive to interest rates, limiting the measures' impact on domestic credit demand. These broad stimulus announcements showed the officials were acting with greater urgency to bolster the economy and the easing depreciation pressure on Chinese yuan has created more desirable condition.</p>

          <p>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. has announced a memorandum with Foxconn to supply electric vehicles, with plans to launch them in Australia and New Zealand by the second half of next year. Taiwanese automaker Yulon Motor Co. will undertake manufacturing of the EVs in Taiwan. This agreement with a contract manufacturer is significant for the Japanese auto industry, which has traditionally been hesitant to outsource manufacturing outside the automotive sector. Separately, Mitsubishi Motors will launch new EVs supplied by Nissan Motor Co. based on its next-generation Leaf, targeting the North American market in the latter half of 2026.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to tariffs, which have significantly increased the cost of bicycle wheels and other parts. The company, which imports about 90% of its bikes from China, has already paid millions in tariffs. The company has cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May. The tariffs are making it financially unviable to manufacture and assemble bikes in the U.S. due to high labor costs.</p>

The Indian government stated its forces targeted multiple sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while Pakistani officials reported casualties and vowed retaliation. The strikes, occurring after a militant attack that killed 26 civilians in Kashmir, have heightened tensions and raised concerns about potential escalation.

          <p>The Catholic Church has declared that priests will face excommunication if they adhere to a new Washington state law mandating clergy to report confessions of child abuse to law enforcement. This is due to the Church's stance on the absolute seal of confidentiality, which requires priests to keep anything learned in confession a secret. The Archdiocese of Seattle has stated that its policies already require priests to be mandatory reporters unless the information is received during confession. The U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division has opened an investigation into the law for possible violations of the First Amendment's religious protections.</p>

Although overall EU fossil fuel imports from Russia have fallen since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas rose by 18% in 2024.

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Switzerland later this week, signaling a possible dÃ©tente in the escalating trade war between the global superpowers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet Beijing's lead economic representative, He Lifeng, potentially paving the way for broader trade talks. Investors and global policymakers will be looking for any signs of an off-ramp, as the ongoing trade war threatens a global recession. At the moment, Chinese goods into the U.S. face tariffs of 145% , and U.S. goods into China are subject to 125% tariffs .</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan appear closer to the brink of conflict after New Delhi launched a wave of missile strikes overnight, targeting what it said were terrorist camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The strikes, which India dubbed "Operation Sindoor," hit multiple locations including Bahawalpur and Muridke, and reportedly killed dozens of militants. Pakistan condemned the action as an "act of war," saying it had caused civilian casualties and put its military on high alert. The attacks were in retaliation for a brutal assault on 22 April in Indian-administered Kashmir, where militants killed at least 26 Indian tourists and wounded dozens more.</p>

          <p>AMD has cautioned that U.S. restrictions on sales to China are projected to result in a US$1.5 billion revenue loss this year, overshadowing an otherwise optimistic outlook. This guidance is due to an export restriction imposed in April that targeted AMD's MI308 chips. Despite this, CEO Lisa Su remains confident in overall demand for AI infrastructure and expects new chips to boost sales in the second half of the year. The company had said last month that it expected to record an expense of about US$800 million because of the new export rules.</p>

          <p>In a landscape shaped by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, various countries are forging new economic partnerships. While the U.S. explores potential trade agreements with Canada and China, other nations are advancing bilateral deals. The U.K. and India have agreed on a trade agreement to remove tariffs on most items within a decade, and ASEAN and China are set to negotiate improvements to their free-trade agreement. These developments suggest that growing protectionism in the U.S. may be incentivizing other countries to strengthen economic ties among themselves.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, with the Indian defence ministry said the strikes were part of a "commitment" to hold those responsible for the 22 April attack which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead "accountable". But Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as "unprovoked", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the "heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished". Pakistan's military says it has shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone.</p>
