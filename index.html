          <p>British singer Lola Young, 24, has reassured fans she is recovering after collapsing on stage during her performance at the All Things Go Festival in New York. The incident, captured in social media videos, occurred while she was performing her song "Conceited." Young had previously told the audience she was dealing with a "sensitive matter" and had cancelled another show a day earlier. Following the collapse, fellow performer Doechii led the crowd in a chant of support for the "Messy" singer, who is a rising star from the Brit School.</p>

          <p>The Des Moines school board has placed Superintendent Ian Roberts on paid administrative leave after he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Federal agents allege Roberts, who previously competed in the Olympics for Guyana, is in the country illegally and subject to a final removal order from 2024. School officials stated they were unaware of any immigration issues, as background checks conducted during his hiring process did not reveal any problems. Roberts had affirmed he was a U.S. citizen on official forms, and the district is now reviewing its hiring procedures while he retains legal counsel.</p>

          <p>Iraqi President Abdullatif Jamal Rashid has declared his country "100% safe and secure," signaling a new phase focused on infrastructure and economic development as U.S. troops prepare to draw down. In an interview, Rashid emphasized Iraq's desire for independence in its decision-making, balancing relationships with both the United States and Iran. While he downplayed the influence of Iranian-aligned militias and stated ISIS cells are no longer a major threat, some U.S. commanders and analysts express concern that a premature withdrawal could create a security vacuum. Rashid is focused on attracting foreign investment to rebuild the nation after decades of conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is pioneering a new industrial model, termed a "pull" system, to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of car manufacturing. This approach inverts the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. Under the new model, the final assembly stage pulls components from suppliers only as they are needed, aiming to lower costs, improve quality, and increase flexibility. Researchers believe mastering this scalable production method is crucial for dominating the rapidly growing global space industry, which is projected to see exponential growth in orbital launches.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 09:59:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores close and shopping center vacancy rates rise, small and local business owners are finding unprecedented opportunities to lease prime commercial real estate. According to a Cushman & Wakefield report, the national vacancy rate for shopping centers increased to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2025, softening demand and slowing rent growth. This has allowed independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to negotiate more favorable terms, such as flexible lease lengths and lower rents.

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems for repeatedly promoting false claims about the company's machines following the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement, filed in a Washington D.C. federal court, remain confidential. As Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani was a key figure in spreading conspiracy theories alleging the election was rigged. This marks Dominion's third major settlement over election lies, following a $787.5 million agreement with Fox News in 2023 and a $67 million settlement with Newsmax, holding purveyors of the misinformation financially accountable for their statements.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has highlighted the proliferation of AI-powered "nudify" apps and websites, which allow users to easily create nonconsensual, sexually explicit deepfakes from social media photos. The report focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who discovered a male friend had used a service called DeepSwap to generate such content of them and over 80 other women. Because the images were not distributed, the women found they had little legal recourse, exposing a significant gap in current laws. They are now advocating for state-level legislation to hold the platforms enabling this form of digital abuse accountable for the real emotional trauma it causes.</p>

Speaking from a boat off the Greek coast, she emphasized that the mission's purpose is to show solidarity when governments fail to act.

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain limiting beliefs prevent many people from increasing their earnings, even when they desire to do so. The first is the false notion that one should already know how to make more money, which creates shame and prevents them from seeking help or learning new skills like salary negotiation. Another is the belief that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the necessity of patience and consistent effort. Finally, the tendency to procrastinate by telling oneself they will start "later" is a major obstacle, as the perfect time never arrives and prevents meaningful action.</p>

The initiative is a core component of Labour's ambitious goal to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's new town developments, aiming to create entire communities, not just housing units.</p>

The hostility grew so intense that state police were brought in to escort his group, and several fans were ejected.

          <p>A California proposal to redraw the state's congressional map, known as Proposition 50, is creating a fierce political battle in the conservative-leaning first district, currently represented by Republican Doug LaMalfa. The plan, a Democratic response to gerrymandering in Texas, could create five new Democratic seats and potentially flip LaMalfa's district. If passed in a special election, the redrawn map would combine rural areas with more liberal communities, prompting strong opposition from Republicans who fear diminished representation. The outcome of this fight could have significant implications for control of the U.S. House of Representatives after the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>An American expatriate who helps others move abroad has identified several common misconceptions about relocating to another country. Contrary to popular belief, living abroad is not always cheap, as costs like housing are rising globally. Another myth is that Americans are unwelcome; in reality, anti-tourism sentiment is often about affordable housing shortages, not expats who integrate. While loneliness is a concern, communities can form quickly, though deep friendships take time. The idea that life abroad is a perfect escape is also false, as bureaucracy and personal challenges still exist, and it is important to remember that one's first move doesn't have to be permanent.</p>

          <p>A new court filing from legal watchdog groups alleges that children are being held for prolonged periods in an ICE detention facility in Dilley, Texas, under inhumane conditions. Monitors report shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation due to lights being left on all night, and inadequate access to hygiene supplies and medical care. The facility, run by private contractor CoreCivic, is described as a "prison-like environment" where families face emotional distress and children suffer from a lack of proper education. The filing warns that these conditions violate the Flores settlement agreement, which sets minimum standards for the detention of immigrant children.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's massive spending on AI infrastructure, including recent deals with Nvidia and Oracle valued in the hundreds of billions, is raising concerns among some analysts about the sustainability of its business model. The company's strategy involves a complex web of interconnected partnerships where partners are also investors, such as Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which in turn helps fund data centers built around Nvidia's GPUs. While CEO Sam Altman defends the high costs as necessary for innovation, critics see parallels to the vendor financing patterns that contributed to the dot-com bubble, questioning if the ecosystem is becoming too self-referential to be sustainable.

The author expresses concern over the normalization of deploying the National Guard in cities, purges of government officials deemed disloyal, and direct attacks on the integrity of the electoral process. The piece asserts that the Constitution's power relies on active defense and that complacency is dangerous. It calls for a robust, multi-level strategy, from grassroots protests to legal challenges, to counter these threats and protect the rule of law before the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing threat of fires in cities, the United States has made remarkable progress in fire safety over the last four decades. Since 1980, the per-capita civilian fire death rate has decreased by approximately two-thirds, and the total number of reported fires has been cut in half. This success is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements, including the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinkler systems. Other key factors include the implementation of safer furnishing standards, a major decline in cigarette smoking, and enhanced electrical and heating safety codes, all of which have combined to make buildings far less vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is scheduled for sentencing after being convicted on two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution. The charges stemmed from a trial where prosecutors detailed how Combs orchestrated and paid for travel for sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers, which he would watch. While he was acquitted of more serious charges like sex trafficking and racketeering, he still faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. Prosecutors are recommending a sentence of at least four to five years, while his defense team is arguing for a sentence of 14 months, which would result in his immediate release due to time already served.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second referendum on the introduction of a national electronic identity card system, after a similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses previous objections by ensuring the system is entirely optional and state-run, with data stored locally on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents maintain fears about potential privacy erosion and data tracking. Early projections indicate a tight race, with the final result too close to call as the nation weighs convenience against its long-held tradition of protecting citizen privacy.</p>

His leadership has been challenged by high-profile resignations and controversy over unpopular policies, leading to public dissatisfaction and internal criticism.

As political uncertainty and corruption claims mount, Argentina's currency has come under severe pressure.
