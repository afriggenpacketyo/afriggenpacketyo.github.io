            <p>Senator Marco Rubio indicated that the U.S. might withdraw from mediating peace between Russia and Ukraine if progress isn't achieved soon, emphasizing that it's "not our war." This statement followed talks in Paris involving U.S., Ukrainian, and European officials, with a follow-up meeting planned in London. Rubio's remarks contrast with the Biden administration's stance and Zelenskyy's warnings about Putin's expansionist intentions. The U.S. and Ukraine are also nearing a deal for U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral resources, intertwined with Trump's peace initiatives.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen refuted claims of a staged photo-op involving margaritas during his visit to El Salvador to meet with deported immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, stating that neither he nor Garcia consumed the drinks. Van Hollen accused President Bukele and the Trump administration of attempting to divert attention from a constitutional issue. The controversy surrounds Garcia's deportation, which Democrats argue violated due process, while the Trump administration cites Garcia's alleged gang ties and domestic abuse. Van Hollen also revealed U.S. funding to El Salvador for detention operations and pledged to oppose further appropriations.</p>

            <p>President Trump and his administration are reportedly exploring options to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. This consideration follows Trump's criticism of Powell's monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rates. A Supreme Court ruling affirms Congress's authority to create independent agencies, limiting the president's power to remove board members except "for cause." Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, is being considered as a potential replacement, though he has reportedly advised Trump to let Powell finish his term. (not investment advice)</p>

The previous COVID.gov page provided resources for testing, treatment, and vaccination. The new page also questions the efficacy of social distancing, masking, and lockdowns, criticizing the response from New York officials.

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, after meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, reported that Garcia was "traumatized" by his experience at the CECOT supermax prison. Garcia was deported to CECOT due to an administrative error. He said he felt sad about being in prison because he had not committed any crimes. He has since been moved to another prison with better conditions. Van Hollen faced challenges trying to meet with Abrego Garcia. He said the Trump administration is trying to make this case all about MS-13, when in fact, the judge in the case has said they have not provided substantial or any significant evidence to back up their claim.</p>

            <p>New York Yankees second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. has been suspended for one game and fined by Major League Baseball for his ejection during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays and for violating the league's social media policy. Chisholm was ejected for arguing a called third strike and subsequently posted a critical message on X, which he later deleted. MLB's regulations prohibit the use of electronic devices during games and the display of content that questions the impartiality of umpires. Chisholm has appealed the suspension, allowing him to continue playing until a resolution is reached.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered the transfer of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish Tufts University student detained by immigration authorities in Louisiana, to Vermont for a hearing regarding her detention. Ozturk's lawyers claim her detention was retaliation for an op-ed she co-wrote in the student newspaper. Ozturk is among several individuals with ties to American universities who have had their visas revoked or been stopped from entering the U.S. after being accused of supporting Palestinians. Her lawyers are challenging the legal authority for ICE's detention and argue that it violates her constitutional rights.</p>

            <p>Despite a recent mineral deal framework between the U.S. and Ukraine and initial positive peace talks, the situation remains uncertain due to threats from President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio to withdraw from brokering a ceasefire. This threat suits the Kremlin more than Kyiv, as Ukraine relies on the support of its allies to counter Russian aggression. While Moscow claims to strive for peace, it continues deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities. The White House has paused military aid to Kyiv while improving relations with Moscow, aiming to push both sides toward a peace agreement.</p>

The Clippers and Nuggets split the season-series at 2-2, but Kawhi Leonard didn’t play in any of them.</p>

The White House has indicated that Abrego Garcia is "never coming back." The Supreme Court could clarify what the administration is compelled to do for Abrego Garcia.</p>
