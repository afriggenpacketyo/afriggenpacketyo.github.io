          <p>Liverpool Football Club paid a heartfelt tribute to forward Diogo Jota, who tragically died in a car crash at age 28, during their Premier League opening match at Anfield. Fans and the club honored him with a mosaic, a moment of silence, and songs, with his family reportedly in attendance for the emotional occasion. The team will wear a "Forever 20" emblem on their shirts for the entire season, and the number 20 shirt has been retired in his memory.</p>

          <p>A new Deloitte report reveals that the average cost of a packed school lunch has risen to $6.15, a nearly 3% increase from the previous year, driven by broader grocery price inflation. While staples like milk and bananas are more expensive, some items such as white bread and tomatoes have seen price decreases, offering slight relief. The report notes that families are adapting by switching to store brands and cutting other expenses, and that cafeteria lunch prices are also up, prompting the USDA to increase funding for school meal programs.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling hundreds of flights, impacting tens of thousands of travelers, ahead of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations stalled, with key issues being wages and unpaid labor time. The airline responded with a lockout notice and has started a gradual suspension of operations, expecting to be completely grounded by Saturday if no agreement is reached. Customers on canceled flights are being offered full refunds and assistance with alternative travel options.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a simple, barebones electric pickup truck with a starting price that could be significantly lower than the U.S. average vehicle price. The company's strategy is to minimize manufacturing costs on the base model and allow owners to customize it with over 100 planned accessories. While the company initially advertised a sub-$20,000 price with federal tax credits, the expiration of those incentives raises questions about its competitiveness in the market against other models under $30,000.</p>

          <p>Airlines are finding summer profitability more challenging as travel demand patterns evolve, forcing carriers to reduce August flight schedules. Travelers are increasingly flying earlier in the summer or shifting European trips to the fall, while last-minute bookings add to unpredictability. This has led to domestic capacity cuts and higher fares for consumers. In response, airlines like American and Southwest are adjusting their future peak season schedules to better align with new trends, such as earlier school start and end dates.</p>

          <p>Michael Johnson, founder of the new Grand Slam Track circuit, has announced that the 2026 season will not proceed until all athletes from the inaugural 2025 season are paid. The upstart league, which attracted top talent with promises of high prize money, is reportedly in debt for millions in appearance fees and winnings. Johnson attributed the financial crisis to promised investment failing to materialize and stated that his top priority is clearing these debts before moving forward with the venture.</p>

          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's justification for placing the Washington, D.C. police under federal control finds his claims about crime to be misleading. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities, and the rate has dropped significantly in 2024. The article points out that recent data from both the D.C. police and national sources show a downward trend in violent crime, contrary to the administration's narrative of an out-of-control crisis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering taking a government stake in the struggling chipmaker Intel to bolster national security and reduce reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing. The news caused Intel's stock to climb over 6%. While the structure of such an intervention is unclear, it could involve funds from the CHIPS Act. A tech analyst described the move as essential, comparing the strategic importance of domestic chip production to ensuring a domestic supply for a nuclear arsenal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of Muriel Spark's most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," delves into the author's exploration of influence, adolescence, and faith. The story follows a group of schoolgirls in 1930s Edinburgh who are profoundly shaped by their eccentric and charismatic teacher, Jean Brodie. The article highlights how the narrative, told primarily through the girls' recollections, investigates their moral education and their teacher's godlike role in their lives, culminating in one student's conversion to Catholicism as a final act of separation from her mentor's authority.</p>

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska, Ukraine and its European allies are watching closely, with each party bringing distinct objectives to the table regarding the war. Russia likely seeks an end to U.S. financial support for Ukraine and a peace deal that solidifies its territorial gains, potentially by presenting a deceptive offer to President Trump. Conversely, Ukraine insists on the complete withdrawal of Russian forces from its territory and has rejected the idea of ceding land, setting the stage for a complex and high-stakes diplomatic encounter.</p>
