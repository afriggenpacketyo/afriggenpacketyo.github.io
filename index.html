        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting federal immigration raids in Los Angeles to proceed. The 6-3 decision allows agents to continue making stops based on a combination of factors, which critics argue amounts to racial profiling. The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration's aggressive deportation strategy, while dissenting justices warned that the decision places constitutional freedoms at significant risk. The legal challenge against the raids will continue in lower courts, but this ruling allows the controversial enforcement actions to resume immediately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is launching new immigration enforcement surges in Chicago and Boston, escalating federal action in Democratic-led cities. The Chicago initiative, named "Operation Midway Blitz," is explicitly framed as targeting "criminal illegal aliens" who the DHS claims are protected by Illinois' sanctuary policies. Similarly, the operation in Massachusetts, dubbed "Patriot 2.0," follows a previous crackdown and specifically calls out Boston's sanctuary laws. These moves are part of a broader administration strategy of deploying federal agents to cities with policies it opposes, raising concerns among local leaders about militarization and due process.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian has laid off approximately 200 employees, equivalent to about 1.5% of its workforce, as it prepares for shifting market conditions. The company's restructuring comes ahead of the expiration of federal EV tax credits at the end of the month, a policy change expected to dampen consumer demand. The layoffs are part of a broader industry trend, with other automakers also adjusting production and staffing levels in anticipation of a slowdown. Rivian is simultaneously preparing to launch its more affordable R2 SUV model next year to compete in a tougher economic climate.</p>

          <p>The federal trial for Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump at a Florida golf course last year, began with jury selection on Monday. Routh, who is representing himself, faces multiple charges including attempted assassination and assaulting a federal officer, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege he meticulously planned the attack and was armed with an AK-47-style rifle before being intercepted by a Secret Service agent. The trial is being overseen by Judge Aileen Cannon, with opening statements expected to commence later this week.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has finalized a deal to resolve the long-standing succession battle for control of its global media empire, which includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Under the agreement, Lachlan Murdoch will secure control of the business, while his three older siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will each receive $1.1 billion for their shares. This arrangement effectively ends the legal and personal conflicts over the future of the company following Rupert Murdoch's retirement. The deal ensures leadership continuity and solidifies the conservative direction of the media conglomerate under Lachlan's leadership.</p>

          <p>Economists anticipate that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will issue a significant downward revision to U.S. job growth figures, potentially showing that hiring was weaker than initially reported by hundreds of thousands of jobs. This preliminary benchmark revision, covering the 12 months through March 2025, provides a more accurate count by incorporating comprehensive business data. A large revision could alter perceptions of the economy's strength and influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. The adjustment comes amid a broader slowdown in the labor market and political scrutiny of economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House has vehemently denied the authenticity of the letter and the signature, calling it a fabrication and part of a defamation campaign.

          <p>With the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage approaching a one-year low, financial experts are offering guidance on how prospective homebuyers can secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score, as higher FICO scores directly correlate with lower interest rates offered by lenders. Additionally, providing a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, reduces the lender's risk and can lead to more favorable loan conditions. Homebuyers are also encouraged to consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, which may offer lower initial rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances that allow for delaying enrollment or receiving financial assistance. The most common scenario is for individuals who are still working past age 65 and are covered by a creditable employer health plan, which allows them to postpone Part B enrollment without penalty. For those with limited income and resources, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or qualifying for Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the monthly premiums.

          <p>For savers with a substantial amount like $40,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing key trade-offs.

In contrast, a high-yield savings account provides more liquidity and easy access to funds, but its interest rate is variable and likely to fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates.

          <p>Reach, the media company that owns major UK newspapers like the Daily Mirror and Daily Express, has announced it will eliminate 321 jobs as part of its largest-ever reorganization. The company plans to create 135 new roles as it shifts its focus toward video content, increased use of artificial intelligence, and sharing more content across its various national and regional titles. The National Union of Journalists criticized the move, expressing concern that the redundancies will further damage morale and that jobs are being replaced by AI tools rather than reinvestment in journalism.</p>

The Assembly serves as a crucial platform for international dialogue and can initiate processes that lead to binding treaties.

          <p>Following a weak August jobs report, financial markets are now pricing in a near-certainty of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. While a standard quarter-percentage-point reduction is the most likely outcome, traders see a small but non-zero chance of a more aggressive half-point cut. The disappointing labor data has intensified pressure on the central bank to ease monetary policy to support the slowing economy. However, with inflation still above the Fed's target, most analysts believe the bar for a larger cut remains high, making the smaller adjustment the probable course of action.

          <p>France has been plunged into political crisis after Prime Minister François Bayrou's government was defeated in a confidence vote in the National Assembly. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's controversial budget proposal aimed at tackling the nation's massive debt, which included unpopular measures like scrapping national holidays and freezing welfare payments. Lacking a majority, his government was brought down by a coalition of left-wing and hard-right opponents. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint a new prime minister, his fifth in under two years, or dissolve parliament and call for new elections.</p>

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve reveals that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to the lowest level since the survey began in 2013. The August data reflects a significant downturn in sentiment about the labor market, with respondents indicating a sharp drop in the perceived probability of securing new employment after a job loss. This finding aligns with other economic indicators showing that hiring has slowed dramatically, effectively ending the "Great Resignation" trend.

Instead of showing the race's host city, Newcastle, and the River Tyne, the medals depicted the nearby rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. Approximately 60,000 runners received the incorrect medals and t-shirts. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company admitted the error, joking that it made the items "the most unique" in the event's history and a true celebration of the entire region.</p>
