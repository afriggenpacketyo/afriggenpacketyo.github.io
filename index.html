          <p>A shooting at the American Fish Company, a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, resulted in three fatalities and at least five injuries. Authorities have described the attack as "highly premeditated," stating the shooter opened fire from a boat before attempting to flee. A suspect, identified as Nigel Max Edge, was later apprehended by the U.S. Coast Guard and faces numerous charges, including three counts of first-degree murder. Officials have assured the public that there is no longer a threat following the swift arrest.</p>

          <p>The reported death of Joanne Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur, in Cuba has drawn widespread reactions from New Jersey political figures, who lamented that she was never brought to justice. Chesimard was convicted for the 1973 murder of State Trooper Werner Foerster but escaped from prison in 1979 and was granted asylum in Cuba. While Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Governor Phil Murphy issued statements honoring Trooper Foerster's memory, Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill has notably remained silent on the matter.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have voted to approve a government proposal for a voluntary electronic identity card system, with a slim 50.4% majority. This decision comes after a similar plan was rejected in 2021 over concerns that private companies would control the data. The new, approved system places the data storage and management entirely in government hands, with information stored only on users' smartphones. Supporters believe it will simplify online transactions, though opponents still harbor concerns about privacy and potential data tracking.</p>

The government designated Palestine Action as a terrorist organization in July, making public support for the group a criminal offense.

With neither side appearing willing to concede, a shutdown seems imminent, which sources suggest the White House may welcome to exercise executive power and reduce government spending.</p>

          <p>The Zombies, a key band from the 1960s British Invasion, are being celebrated for their lasting impact on rock music, decades after their initial success proved elusive. Known for hits like "She's Not There" and "Time of the Season," the band struggled financially and disbanded before their seminal album "Odessey and Oracle" gained recognition. That album is now considered a classic, and the surviving members were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Their story is one of artistic perseverance, with their unique sound eventually earning them a place in rock history.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Iowa's largest school district, has been placed on paid administrative leave after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Federal agents claim Roberts is in the country illegally, lacks work authorization, and was subject to a final removal order from 2024. The Des Moines school board stated it was unaware of any immigration issues, noting that background checks conducted during his hiring process revealed no problems. Roberts, who previously competed in the 2000 Olympics for Guyana, has retained legal counsel.</p>

          <p>Amid skepticism about official government economic data, alternative sources suggest a more uneven and complex inflation landscape than the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicates. While data from sources like Truflation and Adobe show consumer prices may be lower than reported, leading indicators from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) suggest rising costs for businesses. These alternative metrics, which track real-time prices for commodities, online goods, and business expenses, point toward potential future inflationary pressure despite current moderation.

          <p>China is developing a new industrial manufacturing system designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the same efficiency and consistency as automobiles. This "pull" system contrasts with the traditional "push" model of aerospace production by having final assembly pull components from suppliers only as they are needed. The goal is to lower costs, increase flexibility, and reduce delays in response to a projected exponential growth in global space activity. By mastering scalable space production, China aims to secure a dominant position in the future of the space economy.</p>

          <p>An increase in shopping center vacancies, driven by the failure of large chain stores, is creating rare real estate opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national vacancy rate rising, landlords are becoming more flexible, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to secure prime locations they were previously priced out of. While overall rents are still rising, the rate of increase has slowed, and some small business owners are successfully negotiating more favorable terms, such as flexible leases and rent-free periods, to establish a physical presence.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in the $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed against him. The suit was based on numerous false statements Giuliani made about the company's voting machines in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. As Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani was a prominent figure in promoting the baseless conspiracy theory that the election was rigged. This marks Dominion's third major settlement related to election lies, following substantial payouts from Fox News and Newsmax for their roles in amplifying the misinformation.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation highlights the alarming rise of AI-powered "nudify" applications and websites that allow users to easily create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes from social media photos. The report focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who discovered a friend had used such a service, called DeepSwap, to generate sexualized images of them. Because the images were not distributed, the women found they had no legal recourse, exposing a significant gap in current laws' ability to address the harm caused by this emerging technology.</p>

          <p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg has rejected claims that her participation in a Gaza-bound humanitarian aid flotilla is merely a publicity stunt, stating that no one would risk their life for attention. Thunberg is aboard one of 52 boats aiming to deliver aid and send a message of solidarity to Palestinians, challenging what she calls Israel's "illegal and inhumane siege." The flotilla has recently faced suspected drone attacks, which Thunberg condemned as violations of international law. Israeli authorities have previously intercepted similar missions and have stated they will not allow this one to reach Gaza.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced that a taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The initiative aims to create entire new communities with affordable housing, schools, and infrastructure, emulating the post-war Labour government's successful new town developments to address the country's housing needs.</p>
