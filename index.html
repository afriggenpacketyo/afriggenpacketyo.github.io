        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to boost their collective crude oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This increase is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels per day and is a continuation of the group's strategy to gradually unwind voluntary supply cuts. The decision was reportedly influenced by a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories. This move accelerates the pace of production hikes seen in previous months, signaling confidence in summer demand despite recent price volatility from geopolitical tensions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors are examining the popular belief that drinking soda, particularly Coke, can cure migraines, a condition affecting millions of Americans. Experts suggest that the caffeine in these drinks can act as a nerve disruptor and constrict blood vessels in the brain, which may provide temporary relief for some individuals. However, they caution that caffeine can also be a migraine trigger for others and that relying on sugary sodas is not a healthy long-term solution. Healthier alternatives like organic coffee, watermelon with salt for electrolytes, and magnesium are recommended for managing migraine symptoms more effectively.</p>

          <h2>Reverend William Barber's 'Poor People's Campaign' Confronts Modern Political Landscape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverend William Barber is leading a revived "Poor People's Campaign," a national moral movement using nonviolent protest to challenge systemic poverty and injustice in the United States. Rooted in a tradition of faith-based activism, the movement organizes protests and civil disobedience to oppose policies that cut social services like Medicaid and food assistance, which Barber terms "policy murder." The campaign aims to build a broad "fusion" coalition of poor and working-class people across different backgrounds to create a moral force for political change. This article questions whether this approach, which focuses on moral witness, can effectively counter the current political climate.</p>

          <p>FICO, the leading credit scoring company, has announced it will begin incorporating "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loan data into its credit score models, a change that will impact millions of consumers. For users who make their payments on time, this could help build a positive credit history, especially for younger individuals or those with limited credit. However, the change also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively affect credit scores, similar to traditional credit cards and loans. While the new scoring model will be available in fall 2025, experts note that widespread adoption by lenders may be slow.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed the existence of the Old Glory Club (OGC), a network of far-right, men-only clubs with at least 26 chapters across 20 U.S. states. The organization reportedly includes hundreds of members, among them active and former military personnel, lawyers, and prominent antisemitic influencers who use their platforms to promote extremist ideologies. The OGC and its affiliates aim to build offline social networks to support members and advance a political agenda, raising concerns among extremism experts about a new breed of organized hate. Experts warn that the group's presence and the professional backgrounds of its members could pose a significant national security threat.</p>

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry industry, which produces 75% of the U.S. supply and is central to the state's identity and agrotourism, is facing a combination of severe threats. Climate change is causing more volatile weather, including early thaws followed by damaging frosts and unusual hailstorms, which significantly reduce crop yields. Additionally, farmers are struggling with rising land prices due to development, labor shortages for harvesting and processing, and the economic impact of tariffs. These challenges create a precarious situation for the multi-generational family farms that form the backbone of this vital specialty crop industry.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have potential as a cancer-fighting agent. The findings, published in the journal Nature, indicate that the drug could help combat cancer by strengthening the immune system's dendritic cells. These crucial anti-tumor cells often become depleted or impaired as cancer progresses. According to the researchers, sildenafil appears capable of reversing this process and restoring the cells' function, potentially opening the door to a new form of tumor immunotherapy strategy.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Sean 'Diddy' Combs's acquittal on racketeering and sex trafficking charges should not be seen as a full exoneration, as the trial brought disturbing details of his behavior to light. Combs was still found guilty of transporting for prostitution, and his own defense team conceded that he was a domestic abuser, referencing a 2016 video showing him violently assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. The article criticizes the defense's strategy of portraying the events as mere kink and framing accusers as financially motivated. It concludes that despite the verdict, the trial has thoroughly vindicated the belief that Combs engaged in violent and controlling behavior.</p>

It also criticizes past U.S. policy for restricting Ukraine's use of long-range weapons, arguing it hampered their defense against Russia.

The piece refutes this by listing numerous legal and social rights won by the feminist movement, from property ownership to protections against domestic violence. It criticizes the movement's proponents for ignoring these historical gains and for promoting a lifestyle that even they often do not fully adhere to.</p>

Vance has also become a key defender of Trump's foreign policy, notably shifting his own stance to support the president's decisions regarding conflicts in the Middle East. His active involvement across various policy areas signals his influential position as a key operator and potential successor within the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>A new member appointed to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Vicky Pebsworth, has a decades-long history of anti-vaccine activism. Pebsworth, a registered nurse, has publicly argued for years that vaccines caused her son's autism, a claim refuted by extensive scientific research. She has been the volunteer research director for the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization central to the modern anti-vaccine movement. Her appointment by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is part of a broader overhaul of the committee, raising significant concerns among medical experts about the future of federal vaccine policy and public trust.</p>

          <p>Writing from Tehran, a social researcher describes how 12 days of Israeli attacks have shifted public opinion in Iran, fostering a sense of national unity even among those who oppose the regime. Initially, some Iranians were glad to see the IRGC targeted, but as civilian casualties mounted, a shared sense of patriotism and resentment toward foreign aggression grew. The author argues that the West's support for Israel and perceived double standards have shattered any remaining trust among ordinary Iranians. This has led to a dangerous shift where the idea of developing a nuclear weapon is gaining traction as the only reliable deterrent against future attacks.</p>

          <p>Democrats are positioning themselves to leverage opposition to President Trump's major tax and spending bill as a key issue for the 2026 midterm elections. They are focusing their messaging on the legislation's nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which they frame as a 'cruel' assault on the healthcare of millions of Americans. While polling shows the bill is unpopular, Republicans plan to highlight provisions like work requirements and argue the tax cut extensions are necessary for economic growth. The political battle will likely hinge on which party can more effectively frame the debate around the tangible impacts of healthcare cuts versus tax policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's plan to host a UFC event on the White House grounds is more than a publicity stunt; it is a form of 'authoritarian theatre.' The author, a journalist with experience covering Russian MMA, draws parallels between Trump's use of the sport and Vladimir Putin's, highlighting how both leaders leverage the spectacle to project a strongman image. The long-standing relationship between Trump and UFC CEO Dana White has intertwined the UFC's culture of machismo and defiance with MAGA mythology. The author contends that this move represents a dangerous blending of entertainment and confrontational politics, reflecting a broader shift towards authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>This column reflects on the cultural significance of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, embodied by its 17-time champion, Joey Chestnut. The author describes the event as a bizarre mix of elite sport, grotesque spectacle, and punkish satire, a mirror held up to a culture of extreme consumption. The article suggests that while the contest can be seen as a mockery of American excess, it also reflects a deeper dysfunction in the relationship with food, freedom, and abundance. In an era of sponsored famines and weight-loss drugs, Chestnut's performance is presented as an honest, if disgusting, reflection of our times.</p>

          <p>This article explores the long-standing scientific debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently, using visual illusions as a case study. One recent study suggests that people from 'carpentered' Western environments are more likely to see rectangles in an illusion, while rural Namibians see circles. However, another study convincingly debunks this 'carpentered world' hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion. The author, a neuroscientist, argues that perception is an active construction by the brain, not a direct reflection of reality, which makes perceptual diversity between and within groups not only plausible but expected.</p>

WISE operates on a 'cost-neutral' model for councils, retaining a percentage of the fines it issues, which critics argue incentivizes aggressive enforcement.

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's sweeping 'liberation day' tariffs is set to expire, raising concerns of a new trade assault that could further fuel inflation. While the administration has secured a few narrow agreements with countries like the UK and China, the broad '90 deals in 90 days' goal has not materialized. Businesses are already grappling with the costs of existing tariffs, and economists warn that reimposing the steeper universal rates will pass more costs to consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has noted that tariffs inevitably impact consumer prices, a reality that contrasts with the president's insistence that they are paid by other countries.
