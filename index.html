            <p>A theatrical production, *The Lost Lionesses*, inspired by the unofficial England women's team that competed in the 1971 Women's World Cup, is "coming home" to Bedfordshire after a successful run in London. The play, written by Nicole Lockwood-West, pays tribute to the pioneering team and their manager, Harry Batt, who faced opposition from the Women's Football Association. The story highlights the team's journey, playing before 90,000 fans in Mexico, and culminates in the Lionesses' Euro 2022 victory, showcasing the progress of women's football. The play is being performed at The Place, Bedford, from April 15-19, and celebrates a piece of local history that had been forgotten.</p>

            <p>British actress Aimee Lou Wood, known for her role in *The White Lotus*, has criticized a *Saturday Night Live* (SNL) sketch that parodied her character, calling it "mean and unfunny." The sketch, which depicted Wood's character Chelsea with exaggerated prosthetic teeth and a pronounced accent, was seen by the actress as "punching down" and misogynistic. Wood expressed disappointment that the joke centered on her teeth, diverting attention from her work. She clarified that her criticism was directed at the concept of the sketch, not the actress who portrayed her, Sarah Sherman, and acknowledged receiving numerous messages of support following her posts.</p>

            <p>Recent social media posts and news articles have misrepresented a Canadian Supreme Court ruling on a provincial law commemorating civilians killed during the 2009 Sri Lanka military offensive. Contrary to claims that the court struck down the law and suggested "no genocide" took place, the Supreme Court upheld the Tamil Genocide Education Week Act. The decision dismissed an appeal seeking to nullify the law and did not rule on whether mass murder occurred in Sri Lanka. The court affirmed the law as constitutional, clarifying that it was not asked to determine whether a genocide occurred.</p>

            <p>Andrew Buen, a former Colorado sheriff's deputy convicted of criminally negligent homicide in the 2022 death of Christian Glass, is scheduled to be sentenced. Glass, a 22-year-old experiencing a mental health crisis, had called 911 for help prior to the incident. Buen's conviction followed a second trial, with a previous jury convicting him of misdemeanor reckless endangerment but failing to reach a verdict on murder and misconduct charges. The case, which garnered national attention, led to changes in officer training regarding mental health crises; Glass's parents were awarded a $19 million settlement.</p>

            <p>Mario Vargas Llosa, a towering figure in Latin American literature and Nobel Prize winner, has died at the age of 89 in his native Peru. With over 50 works, Vargas Llosa was known for his depictions of authoritarianism, violence, and machismo, making him a key figure in the Latin American Boom literary movement. Initially sympathetic to left-wing ideas, he later became disillusioned and ran for the Peruvian presidency with a centre-right party in 1990. His works, such as *The Time of the Hero* and *The Green House*, explored corruption and social issues in Peru and beyond.</p>

The DOJ filing asserts that the court is being asked to exceed its authority by ordering demands of the El Salvadoran government and dispatching personnel to extract a citizen from its custody.</p>

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time after the city-state's GDP growth for the first quarter fell short of expectations at 3.8%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will reduce the rate of appreciation of its policy band, known as the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER). The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, citing declines in manufacturing and some services sectors, along with the impact of US tariffs and the US-China trade war.

            <p>Washington's plan to exempt some electronic devices from its 125% tariffs has provided a glimmer of hope for Chinese suppliers, but many smaller firms will not be covered. The Trump administration's warning of new "sectoral tariffs" targeting the industry has added further uncertainty. Chinese firms are bewildered and frustrated as they search for a way forward amid the policy swings. The US's move is seen as a recognition of China's crucial role in the global supply chain for hi-tech products.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump warned that exemptions on smartphones and electronics from import tariffs on China will be short-lived, promising future tariffs. He stated that the products are subject to existing fentanyl tariffs and are merely moving to a different tariff "bucket". Trump also announced plans for a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector and the electronics supply chain. His back-and-forth on tariffs has triggered volatility on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 index down more than 10% since he took office.</p>
