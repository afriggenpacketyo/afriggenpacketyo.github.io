          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 10:37:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion purchase of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to Guyana's extensive offshore oil reserves. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, which affirms that corporate-level mergers are not subject to asset-level rights of refusal. The integration of the two companies is expected to result in some headcount reductions as part of ongoing efficiency efforts.</p>

          <p>A new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 will be charged to most nonimmigrant visa applicants entering the United States, as stipulated by the Trump administration's recent legislation. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is paid upon visa issuance, not for denied applications. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with visa terms, such as not overstaying, the process is unclear and expected to take years to implement. Immigration experts and the U.S. Travel Association have noted significant unanswered questions about its collection and reimbursement procedures.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 10:34:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of Michigan's July consumer survey indicates a significant drop in inflation fears, with expectations returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook fell to 4.4% from 5%, while the five-year forecast slid to 3.6%. Despite this decline, survey director Joanne Hsu noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as the figures remain above late 2024 levels. The overall consumer sentiment index saw a slight increase, aligning with market estimates and reaching its highest point since February. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new "no tax on tips" provision, part of President Trump's recent legislation, is creating uncertainty for workers and tax professionals. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 through 2028. Key questions remain about which occupations qualify, as the IRS has yet to release clarifying guidance, and some professions are already explicitly excluded. The effectiveness of the policy is also questioned due to changes in tax reporting thresholds and the common issue of underreported cash tips.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer returns that can outpace inflation, making them an attractive and safe option for savers. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.03% APY, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year terms reaching 4.40% APY. To secure the best rates, experts advise looking at online banks, which have lower overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term options. Laddering CDs of various terms is also a recommended strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Now, as he tries to shut down inquiries into Epstein, his followers are turning on him, demonstrating that the post-truth world he helped create is too unwieldy to control.

          <p>The first known criminal conviction tied to the Post Office's Capture accounting system, a precursor to the notorious Horizon software, has been referred to the Court of Appeal. The case involves Patricia Owen, a former sub-postmistress convicted of theft in 1998, with the referral made on the grounds that her prosecution was an abuse of process. This marks a significant development in the broader Post Office scandal, extending scrutiny beyond the Horizon system. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is examining 27 other cases to see if the Capture software played a role in wrongful convictions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:15:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's content like "Bluey" and "CoComelon" is emerging as a crucial tool for customer retention and profitability. This programming is less expensive to produce and has high re-watch value, which helps reduce subscriber churn—a major challenge for services like Netflix and Disney+. Media companies are finding that while live sports and hit series attract new subscribers, a strong library of kids' content gives families a reason to maintain their subscriptions long-term. This strategy also involves leveraging YouTube, the dominant platform for youth viewership, to drive discovery and engagement.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported a 60% increase in serious water pollution incidents by water companies in England in 2024, with a total of 75 such events. Overall pollution incidents reached a record high of 2,801, more than double the industry's reduction target for 2025. A cross-party committee of MPs described the situation as "woeful," blaming underinvestment and weak regulation. The report comes ahead of a landmark review of the water industry, with critics pointing to Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water as responsible for the majority of severe incidents.</p>

Investigators believe the suspect, Raymond Boodarian, was burglarizing the residence on July 10 and shot the couple when they returned home unexpectedly. In addition to the murder charges, Boodarian is also accused of first-degree burglary, with an arraignment scheduled for August.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a controversial package cutting $9 billion in federal funding, primarily targeting foreign assistance programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote passed narrowly along party lines and now heads to the president's desk. Republicans who supported the bill framed it as a necessary reduction of wasteful spending. However, Democrats and two opposing Republicans argued the cuts undermine U.S. soft power, global health initiatives, and access to information for rural Americans who rely on public media for emergency alerts.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted an injunction, allowing the Trump administration's layoffs of approximately 1,400 Department of Education employees to remain in effect. The staff reduction is part of a broader effort to downsize the agency. A lower court had previously blocked the layoffs, arguing they would hinder the department's ability to perform its duties, including administering student aid. Education advocates have expressed concern that the downsizing will negatively impact students and borrowers, potentially worsening delays in financial aid processing and support services.</p>

          <p>A Vox article explores the profound ethical dilemma facing AI engineers who are offered immense wealth to work at frontier labs like Meta and OpenAI. The author argues that while the technology has potential for good, it also poses existential risks, including the development of deceptive, hostile AI and its misuse for mass violence or surveillance. The piece contends that intense competition and financial incentives often lead companies to sideline safety precautions. It concludes that working in this field is only ethical if one has a defensible plan to mitigate these dangers, as no amount of money is worth hastening a global catastrophe.</p>

The UN has documented dozens of killings, and witnesses report seeing bodies left in the streets and homes being looted and burned. The interim government has blamed "outlaw groups" for the violence and vowed to hold perpetrators accountable, but residents feel abandoned.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults. The diagnosis came after the president noticed swelling in his legs, prompting an examination. According to his physician, the condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing it to pool, but it is considered benign. The doctor's note confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure, and stated that the president "remains in excellent health."</p>
