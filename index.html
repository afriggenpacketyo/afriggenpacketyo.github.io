          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 17:57:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's first-quarter earnings report revealed a significant drop in automotive revenue, plunging 20% year-over-year to $14 billion, contributing to a 9% overall revenue decrease. The company cited factory updates for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and sales incentives as factors impacting revenue and profit. CEO Elon Musk has been dedicating significant time to President Trump's administration, overseeing federal government downsizing efforts, while the company faces challenges from tariffs potentially increasing electric vehicle production costs. Tesla refrained from providing specific growth guidance for the year, planning to revisit it in the Q2 update.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump stated he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before Powell's term ends next year, marking a significant shift from his recent rhetoric. Trump had previously intensified his criticism of Powell, pressuring him to cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth, and even suggesting the possibility of removing him from office. This reversal provides some reassurance to markets concerned about the potential destabilizing effect of undermining the Fed's independence. The statement aims to calm anxieties about the administration's interference with monetary policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, citing concerns about their link to health conditions like ADHD and cancer. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with food companies to eliminate six other dyes commonly used in cereals, snacks, and yogurts. The administration is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives as alternatives, urging the food industry to establish a national standard for transitioning away from petrochemical-based dyes. This initiative builds on previous efforts to ban Red No. 3 and reflects growing concerns about the potential health effects of artificial food dyes.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, claim the Justice Department is failing to provide information ordered by a judge regarding his return to the U.S. They allege the government is narrowing the scope of discovery and asserting unfounded privileges to avoid compliance. The Justice Department counters that it is making a good-faith effort and is in discussions with the Salvadoran government, but diplomatic sensitivities limit disclosure. The case raises questions about the Trump administration's handling of immigration and due process, particularly regarding claims of gang affiliation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year, even with UK inflation expected to be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1%. This projection is due to rising energy and water bills, but the IMF believes the inflation spike will be temporary, allowing for rate cuts. The IMF also downgraded the UK's 2025 economic growth forecast to 1.1% due to global fallout from US trade tariffs, though it remains ahead of forecasts for France, Italy, and Germany. Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasized that the UK's growth outlook is still stronger than other major European countries and pledged to defend British interests in Washington.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is under pressure from investors to refocus on the electric car maker after disappointing first-quarter results showed a decline in sales and profit. Investors are concerned about Musk's focus on his role within the Trump administration and its cost-cutting efforts, as well as the impact of Trump's tariffs on Tesla's business. Analysts suggest Musk's political activities have tarnished his brand and negatively affected demand for Tesla vehicles.

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that U.S. President Donald Trump could find inspiration in China's approach to restoring harmony to its society, which has faced imbalances after decades of economic growth. The author argues that Chinese leaders balance philosophy, power, and pragmatism in policymaking, leading to stability and prosperity. Trump's focus should be on stabilizing America, but his divisive approach is having the opposite effect. The "Make America Great Again" vision has polarized voters, with working-class voters supporting it and university-educated voters opposing it.</p>

          <p>A jury concluded that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial that she claimed damaged her reputation. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun violence that incorrectly linked Palin's political action committee to the 2011 shooting of Gabby Giffords. The Times issued a correction less than 14 hours after publication, and the jury determined that the error was an honest mistake. The verdict reaffirms the principle that publishers are not liable for honest mistakes, though Palin vowed to continue pressing the press to avoid making things up.</p>

The conservative justices expressed concerns about the schools' refusal to allow parents to opt their children out, questioning the feasibility and rationale behind the decision.

          <p>Amid recent stock market volatility, Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett's "simple rule" for investing is to "be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful." This strategy emphasizes taking advantage of market downturns to buy stocks when prices are low. The advice comes as the S&P 500 has experienced significant fluctuations, driven by President Trump's attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and uncertainty about trade policy. Buffett's approach encourages a long-term perspective and a contrarian mindset when navigating market turbulence (not investment advice).</p>

The revamped test will assess deadlifts, push-ups, planks, a two-mile run, and a sprint-drag-carry exercise, potentially reducing the number of women qualifying for these positions. Some studies suggest that targeted training programs should address performance gaps rather than applying identical standards.
