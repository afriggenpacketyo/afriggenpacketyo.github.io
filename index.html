        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence from the city council. Some documents had only a few words visible, making it impossible for police to assess their value in cases like Operation Green Jacket and Operation Bernese. The council defended its actions, citing complex legal rules around sharing personal data to avoid jeopardizing prosecutions. A new, more efficient information-sharing protocol has since been established between the police, the council, and the Crown Prosecution Service to prevent future delays.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has paid tribute to the late Premier Li Keqiang on what would have been his 70th birthday, a customary practice for senior officials. An article from the Institute of Party History and Literature lauded Li as an "outstanding member of the party" and "exemplary leader" who dedicated his life to the state. Li passed away from a heart attack in October 2023, just months after stepping down from his role as premier.

          <p>The UK's financial markets experienced a brief period of turmoil after Chancellor Rachel Reeves was seen crying in parliament, sparking speculation about her job security and the stability of the government's fiscal policy. U.K. bond yields spiked and the pound dropped as traders reacted to the possibility of her departure and the loss of her strict "fiscal rules." Prime Minister Keir Starmer later reassured markets by stating he and the chancellor were "in lockstep," which helped stabilize the currency and bond yields. The incident occurred amid internal party pressure over welfare spending, highlighting the government's precarious political and economic position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After hours of delay and intense negotiations, the U.S. House of Representatives voted narrowly to advance President Trump's signature legislative package for a final debate. The bill, which includes extended tax cuts and increased spending on border security and defense, faced significant opposition from a handful of conservative and moderate Republicans unhappy with changes made by the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump were heavily involved in pressuring holdouts to secure the 219-213 procedural vote. The legislation now moves to a final vote in the House before heading to the president's desk.</p>

The event coincided with a contentious government U-turn on disability benefit reforms, which has created a significant challenge for the chancellor's budget plans.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon that intensifies heatwaves for city dwellers. This effect is caused by heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt, a lack of cooling vegetation, and heat trapped by tall buildings and pollution. Temperatures in these zones can be up to 15 degrees Celsius higher, especially after sunset, posing health risks to residents. Solutions include greening cities with more trees and parks, installing "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight, and using permeable pavements to enhance water evaporation and cooling.</p>

          <p>A new study has shed light on the ancient origins of the Uralic peoples, whose languages, like Finnish and Hungarian, are distinct from the Indo-European family. By combining genetic data from ancient individuals with archeological evidence, researchers traced a migration from Siberia across Eurasia between 11,000 and 4,000 years ago. This migration spread the Uralic language and culture, with genetic markers still present in the approximately 25 million Uralic speakers today. The research supports the theory that the eastern Ural Mountains are the ancestral homeland and details how these groups influenced other cultures with advancements like metallurgy.</p>

          <p>Major Chinese brokerages, including GF Securities and Industrial Securities, are forecasting that Chinese stocks will likely remain stagnant for the remainder of the year due to a lack of significant catalysts. Analysts suggest that while state intervention and a weak economic recovery may prevent a major downturn, sluggish earnings growth and deflationary pressures will continue to weigh on the market. The benchmark CSI 300 Index saw minimal movement in the first half of the year as investors awaited clearer policy signals from Beijing. This cautious outlook contrasts with more optimistic views on Hong Kong stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes a $16 million settlement involving Paramount as a potential act of corporate expedience aimed at gaining favor with Donald Trump's administration, particularly concerning a future merger. The piece draws a parallel between the actions of ancient warlords who displayed symbols of conquest and how modern corporations might engage in strategic appeasement to navigate the political landscape. The author suggests that such moves, while seemingly about resolving a specific issue, can also serve a broader purpose of aligning with powerful figures to secure favorable business outcomes. The article frames the situation as a meeting of coercion and corporate strategy.</p>

The legislation faces opposition from both moderate Republicans, concerned about an estimated 11.8 million people losing insurance, and fiscal conservatives worried about the bill adding $3.4 trillion to the national debt over a decade.</p>

Authorities confirmed that nineteen people were shot in what appeared to be a drive-by incident as patrons were leaving an album release party. This event took place at the same location where another mass shooting occurred in November 2022, when the venue was known as Hush Lounge. Police had previously shut down the nightclub following the 2022 shooting, after which it reopened under the new name. The investigation into the latest incident is ongoing.</p>

After a period of disappointing results, Pochettino has focused on fundamentals, fostering a competitive and cohesive team mentality that was on display in tough matches against Costa Rica and Guatemala. While the team also shows increasing tactical sophistication, the manager has praised the players' newfound urgency and connection, highlighting a scuffle in defense of a teammate as a positive sign.

          <p>Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal secured a landmark 4-3 victory over European champions Manchester City in the Club World Cup, signaling the growing strength of the Saudi Pro League. The win challenges the narrative that the league is merely a destination for aging stars, showcasing a competitive team that succeeded despite missing key players like Neymar and Aleksandar MitroviÄ‡. Al-Hilal, already a dominant force in Asia, has been strengthened by the country's Public Investment Fund and features top international talent alongside a core of Saudi players. The result is seen as a major boost for Asian football and a sign that the gap with Europe's elite may be narrowing.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is reportedly set to receive a controversial call-up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia. He is expected to replace Elliot Daly, who was ruled out with an arm injury. The decision is contentious because Farrell, 33, has not played international rugby for nearly two years and has been sidelined with a concussion for almost nine weeks. Despite his lack of recent game time, coach Andy Farrellâ€”his fatherâ€”had previously confirmed Owen was in contention for the squad due to his vast experience and leadership qualities from three prior Lions tours.</p>

          <p>Wall Street appeared to prioritize positive trade news over a concerning jobs report, with the S&P 500 reaching a new closing high. Markets reacted favorably to a new trade deal with Vietnam that sets a 20% tariff on its imports, a lower rate than previously feared, which benefits companies like Nike and Lululemon. This optimism overshadowed a report from ADP indicating that the U.S. private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 100,000-job gain. The market's reaction suggests investors are currently more focused on factors that reduce corporate costs than on potential signs of economic weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

Newsom criticized the plan, which is part of the "big, beautiful bill" being negotiated in Congress, as "reckless, cruel, and harmful."

One business owner reported paying over Â£54,000 for five phones over ten years, a cost that is pushing his business toward collapse.

          <h2>Essayist Celebrates the Global Evolution of the Spanish Language</h2>

          <p>This opinion essay celebrates the dynamic evolution of the Spanish language, which is spoken by 600 million people worldwide and is constantly being enriched by its diverse speakers. The author contrasts the Spanish-speaking world's general acceptance of regional variations with the more rigid debates sometimes seen among English speakers. While acknowledging that snobbery based on accents still exists, the essay argues that the blending of cultures, particularly in the U.S. and through migration to Spain, has made the language more varied and expressive. The author concludes that this collective, global use is what keeps languages like Spanish and English alive and thriving.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw became the 20th pitcher in MLB history to record 3,000 career strikeouts during a game against the Chicago White Sox. The milestone was achieved in the sixth inning with a called strike against Vinny Capra, prompting a celebration from his teammates and the crowd. Despite Kershaw giving up four runs, the Dodgers staged a three-run rally in the ninth inning, capped by a walk-off RBI single from Freddie Freeman for a 5-4 victory. The historic night for Kershaw was slightly marred by an injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who left the game with a knee sprain.</p>
