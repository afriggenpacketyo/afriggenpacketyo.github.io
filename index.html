          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered its benchmark policy rate to 5.5% from 6%, a larger cut than anticipated and the lowest rate since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth amid global challenges as reasons for the move, which marks the third consecutive rate cut since February. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the previous fiscal quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, a slowdown from the previous year. While the RBI acknowledged limited room for further monetary policy support, it shifted its stance to "neutral" to carefully balance growth and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory, leading to a surge of cheap exports into global markets. This influx of low-cost goods could ease inflationary pressures in some economies, potentially prompting central banks in Asia to decouple from the Federal Reserve and implement further rate cuts. However, concerns are rising in Asia about the potential for these cheap imports to squeeze local industries. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., the production overdrive impacts global markets, creating both opportunities and anxieties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's latest travel ban, targeting foreign nationals from 19 countries, has been met with concern amid a series of restrictive immigration policies. Since his second term began, Trump has suspended the asylum system, ended temporary legal residency for numerous individuals, and moved to restrict student visas. Experts note the ban is likely to face legal challenges and will disproportionately affect those seeking refuge. Critics argue that these measures normalize a pattern of arbitrary racism and xenophobia, disrupting families and communities.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his role in the party's rise. Yusuf, a self-made millionaire, donated £200,000 to Reform and served as a public figure.

While Reform received £2.8 million in donations last year, Yusuf's organizational abilities are missed.

          <p>Dr. Casey Means, President Trump's nominee for U.S. Surgeon General, has criticized the medical and food systems for corruption and special interests. However, Means has promoted numerous health and wellness products, potentially profiting from her recommendations. Experts raise concerns about conflicting interests, given her role in providing scientific health information. Questions arise about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded, could benefit from the administration's health guidance and policies. These business entanglements raise questions about her influence from the wellness industry.</p>

          <h2>MPs Reconsidering Stance on Assisted Dying Legislation</h2>

          <p>Opposition to a bill legalizing assisted dying in England and Wales is growing among MPs, with at least a dozen who previously supported or abstained now likely to vote against it. The Assisted Dying Bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to receive medical assistance to die. Some MPs, like Markus Campbell-Savours, are concerned about protecting vulnerable individuals and ensuring safeguards against coercion. Several MPs have voiced concerns that the bill lacks adequate protections.</p>

          <p>Ispace, a Tokyo-based company, declared its lunar mission a failure after its private lunar lander crashed while attempting a touchdown. Communication was lost with the lander minutes before the scheduled landing, marking the second lunar strikeout for ispace. A preliminary analysis suggests the laser system for measuring altitude malfunctioned, causing the lander to descend too quickly. Despite the failure, ispace plans to continue with more lunar missions, viewing this as a stepping stone to future endeavors.</p>
