          <p>Executives at several major corporations, including United Airlines, NXP Semiconductors, and Charles Schwab, have recently conducted significant stock sales. For instance, United's CFO Michael Leskinen sold shares totaling $2.1 million, reducing his holdings by 55%, while NXP's CFO William Betz sold $1.54 million worth, an 82% reduction in his stake. While investors often monitor such insider transactions for insights into a company's health, the motivations behind these sales can vary widely and are not always indicative of negative performance. This article details these and other major sales from the past week, providing context on the companies' recent stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly praised actress Sydney Sweeney for her American Eagle denim ad campaign, calling it the "HOTTEST ad out there" after learning she is reportedly a registered Republican. The campaign, which uses the tagline "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans," has sparked controversy, with some critics claiming it promotes eugenics or is overly sexualized. In response, American Eagle stated the campaign's focus has always been on their jeans and celebrating individual confidence. The situation has drawn comparisons to Brooke Shields' controversial 1980s Calvin Klein ads, highlighting ongoing debates around advertising, celebrity, and cultural messaging.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The July jobs report has heightened concerns about the U.S. economy, revealing a significant slowdown with only 73,000 new jobs and major downward revisions to previous months. Economists now point to elevated recession risks, citing pressures from tariffs on consumer spending and business investment, despite some outwardly positive GDP figures. The report has intensified political debate, prompting President Trump to dismiss the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner, and increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The weak labor market data, combined with poor housing figures, suggests a period of economic uncertainty ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political standoff is escalating in Texas after Democratic state lawmakers fled to other states to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a contentious new congressional map. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent Democrats from office if they do not return, while the state's attorney general suggested they could be arrested. The proposed map, supported by Donald Trump, could create up to five new Republican-held seats, potentially securing the party's control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms. Democratic leaders are holding events in states like New York and Illinois to protest what they call a partisan power grab.</p>

The England Under-17 player scored one goal and assisted another, continuing a strong summer showing that has fans speculating about his inclusion in the first-team squad for the upcoming season. Ngumoha, who joined from Chelsea's youth academy last year, became Liverpool's second-youngest player ever in an FA Cup match in January. Amid changes in Liverpool's front line, his recent form presents a compelling case for more competitive opportunities.</p>

The decision, which took formal effect this week, was described by Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris as a historic and important moment, urging other European nations to follow suit. The action reflects a growing sentiment among some countries that Palestinian statehood should not be contingent on a final peace settlement with Israel. Israel has strongly condemned the decision and withdrawn its ambassador from Dublin, while Palestinian officials have welcomed the recognition as a significant step toward self-determination.</p>

This suggests that the level of food processing itself, not just the nutritional content, plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management.

          <p>President Trump's dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report showing stalled growth, has drawn sharp criticism from former agency heads and economic groups. Trump alleged without evidence that the data was "faked" and "rigged." A bipartisan group of former BLS commissioners, including one appointed by Trump, called the firing meritless and stated it undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics essential for decision-making. They have urged Congress to investigate the removal and ensure the nonpartisan integrity of the position is protected from political influence.</p>

          <p>A special envoy for President Trump is scheduled to visit Moscow this week, just days before a Friday deadline set by the U.S. for Russia to make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Trump has warned that failure to secure a deal to stop the killing could result in increased U.S. sanctions, potentially including secondary tariffs on Russia's trade partners like China and India. This visit comes amid a noticeable shift in Trump's rhetoric, which has become increasingly critical of Russia's actions and more supportive of Ukraine's defense. Ukrainian officials hope this tougher stance will translate into more tangible support.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation known as the 60% rule significantly impacts senior homeowners using a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), a common type of reverse mortgage. This FHA rule limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds during the first year, unless a larger amount is needed to pay off mandatory obligations like an existing mortgage. While designed to prevent homeowners from depleting their equity too quickly and ensure long-term financial stability, this restriction can pose challenges for those needing a large lump sum for immediate expenses. Understanding this rule is crucial for seniors evaluating their financial options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carmen Reinhart, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at The World Bank, has warned that U.S. recession risks are currently higher than average.

Reinhart also noted that a shift away from globalization, including restrictive immigration policies, could slow population and economic growth, further increasing the likelihood of a recession.

These revisions, which prompted President Trump to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, showed that initial estimates for payroll gains have been revised lower in eight of the last twelve months.

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney's reported Republican voter registration and Donald Trump's subsequent praise of her ad campaign have placed her in a precarious political position. This article explores the potential public relations fallout, noting that celebrity political entanglements often end poorly, especially for stars who are still solidifying their careers. While an endorsement from a popular young actress is a clear benefit for Trump, the risk for Sweeney is significant in a polarized entertainment industry. Analysts suggest that her widespread commercial presence has made her a target, and this political alignment, whether intentional or not, could alienate a large portion of her audience.</p>
