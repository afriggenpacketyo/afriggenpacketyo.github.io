          <p>The White House's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has released its first report identifying poor diet, chemical exposure, lack of physical activity, and overmedicalization as key drivers of childhood chronic disease. The report criticizes ultra-processed foods, pesticides, and the current vaccine schedule, while advocating for improved science and private sector innovation. However, multiple current and former federal health officials have criticized the report for misrepresenting facts and omitting well-known drivers of childhood chronic disease, such as maternal health and preterm birth. The report also faces scrutiny for its approach to vaccines, differing from mainstream public health advice.</p>

          <p>The UN reports that over 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected inside Gaza after a three-day delay at the Kerem Shalom crossing, following an 11-week blockade by Israel. The aid includes essential supplies like flour, baby food, and medical equipment, intended for distribution to a population facing acute hunger and skyrocketing prices. However, the UN emphasizes that this amount is "nowhere near enough" to meet the vast needs of the 2.1 million residents, with warnings of starvation-related deaths and widespread food insecurity. Aid agencies cite insecurity along the approved access route as a major impediment, with concerns over potential attacks by desperate civilians and armed groups.</p>

          <p>A Cessna Citation jet crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego early Thursday morning, resulting in multiple fatalities among those on board and the destruction of several homes. The crash occurred in the Tierrasanta neighborhood, igniting fires that engulfed homes and vehicles, prompting the evacuation of approximately 100 residents. While there were no reports of serious injuries on the ground, the scene was described as a "gigantic debris field" with jet fuel running down the streets. The plane had departed from Teterboro, N.J., with a layover in Wichita, Kan., and was attempting to land at the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when the crash occurred.

The bill, a result of extensive negotiations, includes provisions designed to appeal to both moderate and conservative factions within the GOP. Despite its passage in the House, the bill faces a complex path in the Senate, where several Republicans have indicated the need for significant changes.

          <p>The victims of a fatal shooting outside the Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., have been identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, a young couple who worked at the Israeli Embassy and were planning to get engaged. The Israeli Foreign Ministry and Embassy expressed grief and horror at the devastating loss, remembering the couple as "in the prime of their lives." Sarah Lynn Milgrim's father described her as loving Israel and everyone in the Middle East, while a friend of Yaron Lischinsky remembered him as a morally upright person with a strong sense of justice. Elias Rodriguez is in custody as the suspect in the shooting.</p>

          <p>The US Treasury has confirmed that it will cease production of one-cent coins, commonly known as pennies, beginning next year. The decision comes after a long debate over the cost and usefulness of pennies, which have been in circulation for over two centuries. The Mint estimates that stopping production will result in an immediate annual saving of $56m in reduced material costs. As a result, businesses will need to round prices up or down, and other countries have taken similar measures to discontinue similar coins.</p>

          <p>The public's fascination with WAGs, or wives and girlfriends of professional athletes, is experiencing a resurgence, with figures like Kylie Kelce, Alix Earle, Simone Biles, and Taylor Swift at the forefront. This modern version of WAG-dom has evolved, allowing these women to craft their own public narratives and gain recognition independently. However, the continued use of the term raises questions about defining women by their relationships to men and the potential for them to receive more attention than female athletes. The business of being a WAG is still very traditional and involves affirming a male athlete’s heterosexuality.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its forecast for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, predicting a 60% chance of an "above-normal" season with 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those storms are expected to become hurricanes, and three to five could intensify into major hurricanes. The forecast is influenced by factors including the neutral phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle, warmer-than-average ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear. NOAA officials emphasize the importance of preparedness and technological advancements in forecasting accuracy.</p>

          <p>The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, following a dramatic all-night session and intense negotiations. The 215-214 vote saw nearly all House Republicans supporting the bill, which addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, while all Democrats opposed it. The legislation now moves to the Senate, where it is expected to face resistance. Key provisions include changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, and tax credits for renewable energy.

          <p>The House passed changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) as part of President Trump's tax package, raising the cap to $40,000. The provision, which goes into effect in 2025, phases out over $500,000 and increases annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could face pushback in the Senate, and before 2017, the SALT deduction was unlimited.</p>
