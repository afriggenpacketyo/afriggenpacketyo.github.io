          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decrease in tourism due to inflation, which has raised prices for visitors, with casual trips showing a decline. Convention traffic has remained steady, but the city is seeing fewer international tourists, who tend to stay longer and spend more. Construction and road closures are also causing traffic congestion, leading to some tourists expressing reluctance to return. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of events, and officials remain optimistic about the city's resilience, expecting a positive response to the changing economic landscape.</p>

          <p>The CDC has updated its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, now advising parents to consult with a doctor about whether their children should receive the shots, and removing the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated. This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., contradicting advice from medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics. Public health experts have raised concerns about the process behind the decision, which bypassed the usual transparent discussions. This change could make it harder for parents to get their children vaccinated, and some insurance companies may no longer cover the costs.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that seeks to cut off federal funding to NPR and PBS. The lawsuit alleges that the administration is unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violating the First Amendment through viewpoint discrimination. PBS argues that the executive order aims to alter the content of its programming and retaliates against the network for perceived political slights in its news coverage.

          <p>Rugby league authorities are expressing concerns over the lack of knighthoods or damehoods awarded to players in the sport's 130-year history. Officials and supporters believe their players have been "poorly treated" by the honors system, leading to accusations of snobbery and class prejudice. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has added his voice, noting that other sports, including rugby union, have received such honors regularly. The leader of a cross-party group of MPs suggests the lack of recognition is due to the working-class backgrounds of rugby league stars.</p>

          <p>President Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Japanese company Nippon Steel, claiming it would keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and invest billions in facilities across several states. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, promising a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. steelworker. He stated that U.S. Steel would still be "controlled by the USA," but did not explicitly detail the ownership structure. The announcement comes after Trump previously opposed such a merger, and the Biden administration had blocked the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel over national security concerns.</p>

The government plans to move celebrations to the post-exam period to reduce pressure and promote inclusivity. The tradition, dating back to the 1980s, has become increasingly commercialized, with some bus groups having budgets up to £220,000.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests a link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing rates of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author argues that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has led to nearly impossible standards for parenting. This has resulted in adult children cutting off contact with parents and a heightened fear of not meeting these standards. The author proposes that this fear contributes to the dread many in her generation feel about parenthood.</p>

          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for expelling transgender troops from the military, requiring them to voluntarily leave active duty by June 6, after which involuntary separations will begin. The guidance instructs personnel to intentionally misgender transgender troops, even superior officers, and identifies markers for soldiers suspected of having gender dysphoria. Commanders are expected to initiate medical record reviews based on these criteria, and soldiers will be asked about their identity during routine check-ups. The policy has been criticized for being worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and for potentially jeopardizing veterans' security clearances.</p>
