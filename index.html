          <p>Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian extreme athlete who famously completed the world's first supersonic skydive, has passed away. In 2012, as part of the Red Bull Stratos team, he jumped from a capsule 24 miles above Earth, breaking the sound barrier in a free-fall that captivated a global audience. A former military parachutist and BASE jumper, "Fearless Felix" was known for his death-defying stunts, including leaping from skyscrapers and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil. He said his record-breaking jump from the edge of space made him feel humble, remarking, "Sometimes we have to get really high to see how small we are."</p>

A former reporter, Smith found literary fame with his richly atmospheric thrillers that were praised for their gripping narratives and complex characters.

          <p>Brian Wilson, the visionary songwriter and co-founder of the Beach Boys who crafted the soundtrack of the quintessential California summer, has passed away. Wilson's genius for complex vocal harmonies and sophisticated production resulted in timeless hits like "Good Vibrations" and the critically acclaimed album "Pet Sounds." After a nervous breakdown in 1964, he quit touring to focus on studio work, but his creative ambitions clashed with commercial pressures, leading to severe depression and substance abuse. Following years of struggle and exploitation by a therapist, Wilson eventually recovered to record and perform again, leaving an indelible mark on popular music.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning to Washington, D.C.'s homeless population, stating they must "move out, IMMEDIATELY" and that his administration will provide places for them to stay "FAR from the Capital." This announcement is part of his intensified rhetoric on crime and cleanliness in the nation's capital, which he plans to address in a press conference. The threat follows a recent executive order making it easier for cities to clear homeless encampments. Trump's focus on D.C. crime comes even as Justice Department data shows that violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has defended his government's decision to suspend arms exports to Israel that could be used in its planned Gaza City offensive. Merz stated that while Germany remains committed to Israel's self-defense, it cannot supply weapons to a conflict where a high number of civilian casualties is likely. The move marks a significant policy shift for Germany, one of Israel's staunchest allies, and reflects growing international alarm over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The decision has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative party, while Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed hope that Germany would reverse its course.</p>

          <h2>FDA Faces Turmoil Over Accelerated Drug Approval Process After Patient Deaths</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 13:47:26 EDT</div>

          <p>The FDA's process for fast-tracking drugs for rare diseases is under scrutiny following recent patient deaths linked to a gene therapy from Sarepta Therapeutics. The agency granted accelerated approval for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment in 2023 despite some internal concerns, a move initially hailed as nimble. However, after three patients died from liver failure, the FDA has asked the company to suspend distribution, causing its stock to plummet. This case highlights the profound dilemma the regulator faces in balancing the urgent needs of patients with few options against the risks of approving treatments with limited long-term safety data.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old tourist from New York was fatally shot in the La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. The man was visiting the island with friends to attend one of Bad Bunny's concerts when he was caught in the crossfire of an argument at a local nightspot. Police believe he was an innocent bystander in the incident, which also left two local men injured. La Perla, once known for high crime rates, had become safer and a popular tourist spot after being featured in the music video for "Despacito," but isolated violent incidents targeting tourists have persisted in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's remarkable 13% stock advance last week was primarily fueled by a massive short squeeze, where investors betting against the stock were forced to buy shares to cover their losses. Short-sellers had targeted Apple due to its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential threats from antitrust rulings and tariffs on its products manufactured in China and India. However, a public endorsement from President Trump regarding Apple's U.S. investments and a pivot to Indian manufacturing helped trigger the squeeze. The rally of the $3 trillion company obscured negative trends in the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are closely monitoring a tropical rainstorm in the Atlantic that is expected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the 2025 season by late this week. The system, which formed near the Cabo Verde Islands, is benefiting from warm water and a lack of disruptive wind shear. If it develops as predicted, it will be named Erin. While it is expected to bring heavy rain to the Cabo Verde Islands, current models suggest it will turn northward and remain east of the U.S. coast, though it could still generate rough surf and rip currents along East Coast beaches next weekend.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall and severe flash flooding have forced the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair. The Milwaukee area was hit particularly hard, with some areas receiving up to 10 inches of rain, leading to widespread power outages, road closures, and numerous water rescues. The Milwaukee Fire Department responded to over 600 calls as city crews worked to clear surface water. The severe weather system has impacted several Midwest states, with flood watches and warnings issued for parts of Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Illinois, highlighting the disruptive power of the ongoing storms.</p>

          <p>The Japanese mindfulness practice of 'shinrin-yoku,' or forest bathing, is gaining popularity as a method for improving mental health and focus. The practice involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses to connect with the natural environment. Certified forest therapy guides lead walks designed to help people slow down, disconnect from technology, and be present, which can lower stress levels. Proponents emphasize that the benefits can be achieved in any green space, such as a local park or backyard, and even short, 15-minute sessions of quiet reflection can have a positive impact on well-being.</p>
