          <p>Shein's UK division saw sales increase by 32.3% to £2.05 billion in 2024, with pre-tax profits also rising as the company expanded its physical presence. The fast-fashion giant has been growing its UK footprint with new offices and various pop-up events. Despite this growth, the company acknowledges significant risks from potential supply chain delays, shifting UK regulations, and decreased consumer confidence due to inflation. This financial disclosure comes as Shein pursues a long-awaited initial public offering, having shifted its focus from London to Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key indicators missed expectations, signaling a loss of momentum. Retail sales grew by 3.7%, below the 4.6% forecast, while industrial output also slowed, reflecting persistent weak domestic demand. The property investment sector continued to contract, and urban unemployment edged slightly higher. Economists suggest that the positive effects of earlier government stimulus are fading, raising concerns about whether China can meet its annual 5% growth target without new policy support.

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced it has foiled a coup attempt, arresting several military officers, civilians, and a French national accused of being a foreign agent. The government alleges the plot was supported by unspecified "foreign states" aiming to destabilize the country. This event occurs amidst a broader crackdown on dissent, with critics suggesting the arrests are a tactic to intimidate opponents rather than a response to a legitimate threat. The junta, which seized power in 2020, has recently extended its leader's presidential term and aligned more closely with Russia.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding forecasts despite facing new trade tariffs from the United States. The unexpected resilience was primarily driven by strong exports, which offset some of the domestic economic stagnation. However, economists remain cautious, predicting a potential slowdown in the coming quarters as investment spending softens and the full impact of the tariffs is felt. The Bank of Japan has slightly upgraded its annual growth forecast but warned that global trade policies could negatively affect corporate profits and potentially lead to a recession.

The dark navy SUVs and trucks feature prominent "ICE" lettering and the slogan "Defend the Homeland," part of a broader campaign under the Trump administration. This public rollout coincides with intensified federal law enforcement operations in Washington, D.C., and a significant push to hire more ICE officers with competitive salaries and benefits.

          <p>A man who murdered British expatriate Emma Lovell during a home invasion in Queensland, Australia, will be eligible for release sooner after a successful appeal. The attacker, who was 17 at the time of the 2022 stabbing, had his non-parole period reduced from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence. The court cited his early guilty plea, which spared the family a trial, along with his remorse and troubled upbringing as reasons for the change. The case originally sparked public outrage and led to the implementation of stricter youth crime laws in the state.</p>

Despite data showing a 30-year low in violent crime for 2024, federal agents and National Guard troops have been deployed, establishing checkpoints and clearing homeless encampments. The administration has also increased federal control by appointing the head of the DEA as an "emergency police commissioner" with oversight of the local police department.

Newsom framed the move as a necessary countermeasure to what he called an attempt by Donald Trump to "rig" the upcoming elections. The plan, which would override California's independent redistricting commission, would only take effect if a Republican-led state advances a partisan mid-cycle redistricting plan. This development escalates a national political battle over gerrymandering, with control of the U.S. House of Representatives at stake.</p>

A paper published by the project team claims the drone is significantly superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in use.

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the American steel industry, is experiencing a quiet economic and cultural revival. Entrepreneurs are repurposing abandoned industrial spaces, such as old factories, into new businesses like breweries and flea markets, bringing new life to the city. While the city's population has stabilized after decades of decline, its unemployment rate is now only slightly above the national average. This gradual comeback is being driven by local business owners who are forging a new identity for Youngstown, demonstrating resilience and a future beyond its industrial past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of prioritizing profits over child safety. The suit, brought by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that the platform's lack of effective safety protocols and age verification has created an environment where sexual predators can victimize children. This legal action follows similar lawsuits and criticism against the company for failing to adequately protect its young user base. In response to mounting pressure, Roblox has recently begun rolling out new safety measures, including an AI system to detect endangerment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. For many, tipping is seen as a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, particularly among older respondents. However, a significant portion of people view the increasing prevalence of tipping more as an additional mandatory cost, a sentiment that aligns with broader public concern over rising prices. The survey indicates that few people who have noticed the trend consider it a positive development.</p>

          <p>The UK government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. This campaign addresses growing concerns over Britons seeking cheaper procedures overseas, which can lead to life-altering injuries and burden the NHS to correct botched surgeries. The influencers will advise viewers to consult with a UK doctor, purchase proper travel insurance, and be wary of package deals. The initiative aims to help potential patients make more informed and safer choices when considering medical tourism.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously adopting a completely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had championed the vegan menu as an ethical imperative, cited a decline in business as a key reason for the reversal. The restaurant will now serve select meat and fish dishes, including its classic honey-lavender-glazed duck, in what Humm described as an effort to be more inclusive. The move highlights the significant commercial challenges of high-end vegan dining, even for one of the world's most acclaimed restaurants.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years after the Hamas attacks, Israeli society is deeply fractured over the ongoing war in Gaza, contrary to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's calls for unity. While a majority of Jewish Israelis appear untroubled by Palestinian suffering, a growing minority is protesting the high civilian death toll. The fate of the remaining Israeli hostages is a central, agonizing issue, with their families desperate for a deal, while far-right government members push for total military victory. This internal conflict is creating chasms between secular and religious Israelis and straining the relationship between political and military leadership.</p>

The former president's involvement, along with that of former Attorney General Eric Holder, provides a significant boost to the Texas legislators.

          <p>The United Kingdom is projected to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20%, with almost 100 new facilities planned, largely driven by the growth of artificial intelligence. While the government views this expansion as critical to the nation's economic future, concerns are mounting over the immense strain these centres will place on energy and water resources. Experts warn that the increased electricity demand could lead to higher consumer energy bills. Residents and environmental groups are also objecting to the construction of these large facilities due to their environmental impact, particularly in water-stressed areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is making foreign language films more accessible by digitally manipulating actors' lip movements to match dubbed audio seamlessly. The technology, developed by London-based company Flawless, allows international films to appear as if they were originally shot in the dubbed language, overcoming the traditional disconnect of out-of-sync audio. Independent studio XYZ Films successfully used the tool for the U.S. release of a Swedish sci-fi film, securing a wider theatrical run than was possible with subtitles. This innovation could significantly expand the reach of international cinema in previously resistant markets.</p>
