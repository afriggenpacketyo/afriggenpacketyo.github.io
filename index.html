          <p>The Trump administration has officially implemented a new global trade framework, establishing revised tariff rates on dozens of countries that range from 10% to as high as 41%. A significant new measure includes a 40% duty on all goods determined to have been transshipped through other countries to evade applicable tariffs. The executive order has sparked concern among economists and trade experts, who warn that the continued uncertainty and potential for further increases could disrupt global supply chains and negatively impact markets.

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for individuals who faced potential deportation, with the judge noting the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the terminations were preordained and possibly racially motivated. The decision postpones the expiration of their legal status until at least November, pending further hearings on the matter.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported stronger-than-expected revenue and profit for its second quarter, propelled by healthy growth in its e-commerce and high-margin advertising businesses. Despite the positive results, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to a mixed forecast for third-quarter operating income and only a slight revenue beat from its AWS cloud division. Amazon announced it will increase capital expenditures for the rest of the year, primarily to support surging demand for AI services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Medical experts are voicing concerns over the rising popularity of caffeine pouches among teenagers, a trend that is growing in the U.S. and may spread to other countries. These small, teabag-like pouches are placed in the mouth and deliver a rapid, potent dose of caffeine, with some containing the equivalent of two cups of coffee. Experts warn of the potential for overdose, dependency, and the appeal of youth-friendly flavors, highlighting the risks of excessive caffeine consumption for adolescents.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two key cities that have traditionally powered China's economic growth, are reporting GDP figures that are underperforming compared to their peers. This simultaneous slowdown is being attributed by analysts to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and a downturn in the local property market.

          <p>In an effort to comply with the UK's new Online Safety Act, social media platforms like X and Reddit are restricting access to a wide range of content for users who have not verified their age.
