The Daily Telegraph focuses on government efforts to revamp contingency plans in case of a Russian military attack on the UK, citing experts who warn of vulnerabilities in national infrastructure like gas terminals and undersea cables. The Guardian reports the government is rethinking cuts to winter fuel payments following warnings from Labour activists and a cabinet minister regarding voter concerns in local elections.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Hyrum Baquedano-Rodriguez, an illegally present Honduran national, in Fairfax, Virginia, after local authorities dropped charges against him, including child abduction and home invasion.

He was previously arrested by U.S. Border Patrol in 2018 and released on an immigration bond in 2019. Despite a removal order issued in June 2024, Fairfax County officials dismissed his recent charges, leading to his subsequent arrest by ICE.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's movement to the United States. The release of the memo further undercuts the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act, which has been used only three times before in American history, all during declared wars, and calls into question its criticism of media coverage on the matter. The administration has sent planeloads of Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador with no due process.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has declared a communitywide outbreak of hepatitis A, with 165 cases recorded in 2024, triple the number from the previous year, and seven deaths linked to the outbreak. Historically, infections were largely identified in homeless people, but this year, most cases are among those who aren't homeless, haven't traveled recently, or used illicit drugs. Health officials are urging people to get vaccinated against the highly contagious viral disease, which can lead to liver damage or death. Wastewater data also indicates the outbreak is larger than the confirmed cases suggest, prompting calls for healthcare providers to test for hepatitis A if patients exhibit consistent symptoms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Harvard University that it will end billions of dollars in research grants and other aid unless the school meets a list of demands, including ceding control of the university to the government. Education Secretary Linda McMahon cited the school's rejection of demands from the administration's antisemitism taskforce, prompted by campus protests against Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Harvard is suing the federal government, arguing the funding cuts would have stark consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, and researchers. McMahon's letter also criticized Penny Pritzker, Bill Ackman, Harvard's diversity efforts, and fellowships offered to former mayors Bill de Blasio and Lori Lightfoot.</p>

Researchers emphasize the importance of international pest control strategies to ensure food security in the region.

          <p>Three people died and nine others, including two children, are missing after a small boat capsized off the coast of San Diego, California, in what officials suspect was a migrant smuggling attempt. Four people were rescued and transported to the hospital, while a search continues for the missing individuals. Some of the boat's occupants were reportedly from India, and the incident highlights the dangers of maritime smuggling. Ocean conditions were rough, with 7ft seas reported, and the boat was found to contain life vests and other supplies.</p>

          <p>Attorney Mark Zaid, who has represented whistleblowers across administrations, is suing the Trump administration to restore his security clearance, arguing it was revoked as improper political retribution. Zaid's lawsuit states that the revocation is undermining his ability to fully represent his clients, as he can no longer access relevant classified information. Attorneys for Zaid suspect he came onto President Trump's radar when he represented a whistleblower in 2019 who filed a complaint about Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, leading to his first impeachment.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced it is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing the nonprofit that controls OpenAI to retain its grip on the company. This decision is a victory for critics, including Elon Musk, who argued the company was too focused on profits and had abandoned its early mission to prioritize safety in A.I. development. The new structure will allow the nonprofit to be OpenAI's largest shareholder, though the specifics of the nonprofit's stake and board member selection are still being negotiated. The company's chairman stated that the decision was made after engaging in constructive dialogue with the attorney general offices of Delaware and California.</p>

          <p>One of the largest websites dedicated to deepfake pornography, Mr. Deepfakes, has announced its shutdown after a critical service provider withdrew support. The site, which allowed users to upload and view AI-generated porn videos, was described as the most prominent marketplace for deepfake porn. The shutdown follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes. Experts view the closure as a positive step in combating deepfake abuse, although they acknowledge the issue will likely persist on less mainstream platforms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, echoing the Biden administration's earlier position. This move is notable given Trump's opposition to abortion rights and his appointments to the Supreme Court. The administration's request does not address the merits of the case but argues that the case does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the federal district court in which it was filed. The decision may reflect a cautious political approach to abortion, particularly in light of recent ballot measures supporting abortion rights.</p>

With his attention focused elsewhere, it remains unclear how Trump will react to a potential Israeli escalation. The administration's initial diplomatic efforts to free hostages and reach a long-term settlement have waned, giving Netanyahu more freedom to act.

          <p>As trade tensions with Trump escalate, India is increasingly worried about Chinese 'dumping' of goods like viscose yarn, textiles, metals, chemicals and rare minerals, which has slowed demand for locally produced materials. With Donald Trump imposing high tariffs on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets. The Indian trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods and India also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China.</p>
