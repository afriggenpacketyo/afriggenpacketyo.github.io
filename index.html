          <h2>Scholar Suggests Trump May Use Tactics Beyond Tariffs with China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 02:37:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Wu Xinbo, a scholar at Fudan University, Beijing should anticipate Washington employing alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations, as the Trump administration recognizes the limits of heavy tariffs. Wu suggests that while Trump might continue using tariffs, he'll exercise more restraint due to the mixed results and significant side effects for the US. These alternative measures could span science, diplomacy, and security, requiring China to remain vigilant across various domains. This shift implies a more multifaceted approach from the US in its dealings with China, moving beyond solely relying on tariffs.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz criticized Israel's military conduct in Gaza, calling it "beyond comprehension," following an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinian civilians. The Israeli government's slow response indicates the remarks have resonated deeply, especially given Germany's historical ties to Israel. Merz stressed the need for caution but emphasized that a German chancellor must speak out when international humanitarian law is violated. Experts believe that the ongoing silence from Israeli officials suggests that Merz's comments have stung the political elite and are being taken seriously in Jerusalem.</p>

The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal. If the White House is unsuccessful in its appeal, businesses who've had to pay tariffs will receive refunds on the amounts paid, with interest. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contrasts this with Americans fighting alongside Ukrainians against Russian occupation, emphasizing the ethical difference between fighting occupation and propagating it.

          <p>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell details the dire situation for children in Gaza, where malnutrition and lack of aid are rampant. Russell recounts the story of Miran Mohammad, a 7-year-old injured in an airstrike, highlighting the dangers faced by children. She criticizes Israel's new aid delivery system, facilitated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, for bypassing the UN and potentially worsening the situation. Russell calls for a return to the UN-led aid pipeline with safe and sustained humanitarian access, urging respect for international humanitarian law to alleviate the suffering of children in Gaza.</p>

Manager Ron Washington intentionally walked Aaron Judge twice in the first two innings, leading to the Yankees' only run. The Angels made roster moves, designating Tim Anderson and Chuckie Robinson for assignment, while activating Robert Stephenson and recalling Scott Kingery from triple-A Salt Lake City.</p>

The automaker has stated it will not pass on the cost of the tariff to consumers in the United States.
