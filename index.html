          <p>Jerry Mathers, who played "Beaver" Cleaver, recently reflected on his time on the classic 1950s sitcom "Leave It to Beaver," describing a wholesome and supportive set. He credited his on-screen father, Hugh Beaumont, who was also a Methodist minister, with keeping the cast and crew "on the straight and narrow." Mathers emphasized the family-like atmosphere, noting that most of the crew were parents themselves, which contributed to a fun and caring environment for the child actors. The show's enduring popularity continues to bring him happy memories and connect him with devoted fans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay adapted from a forthcoming book argues that while statistics show Gen Z is having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are not uninterested in the topic. Instead, they are redefining sexuality by rejecting traditional gendered expectations and viewing sex through a political lens, spurred by events like the overturning of Roe v Wade. This generation, the most diverse in terms of identity and orientation, is seen as highly sexually progressive, challenging concepts like virginity and expanding the definition of what constitutes a sexual act. Their activism aims to dismantle traditional structures and reimagine desire for a more inclusive future.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted 51-49 to advance a major Republican legislative package that aims to make former President Trump's tax breaks permanent while cutting spending on programs like Medicaid. The vote followed a tense, hours-long session where Republican leaders worked to secure support from holdouts concerned about the bill's impact on healthcare and the national debt. The legislation, which also includes funding for national security and deportations, now moves to a lengthy debate and amendment process. Democrats have criticized the bill for being rushed and for its potential to increase the number of uninsured Americans.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that many liberals operate within a "misinformation bubble" regarding youth gender medicine, perpetuating claims that are not supported by evidence. The author contends that the assertion "transition or suicide" is a "zombie fact," pointing to a recent admission in a Supreme Court hearing that no studies prove medical transition reduces completed suicides. The piece criticizes organizations like WPATH for allegedly suppressing inconvenient research and relying on political consensus over evidence. It suggests this environment has stifled necessary debate and made American medicine untrustworthy on the issue.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concessions were made after backbenchers raised "substantial" concerns about cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). The changes, which include limiting cuts to new claimants and commissioning a review, have put the government in a "better position" to pass the bill.

While the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality, the ruling means it could take effect in 28 states that have not legally challenged it in as little as 30 days. The administration must still draft regulations for implementation, and legal challenges to the order's merits will continue in lower courts.

While some progressives have embraced Mamdani, moderate Democrats have been more hesitant.

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is repurposing a playbook developed by Democrats to aggressively police universities using civil rights law. The author contends that the Obama administration's expansive interpretation of Title IX to combat sexual assault created a punitive apparatus that threatened free speech and due process. Now, the Trump administration is using Title VI in a similar manner to target universities over alleged anti-Semitism and DEI initiatives, making intrusive demands that undermine academic freedom. The article suggests this cycle of "regulation by intimidation" serves political zealots more than students.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay reflects a significant shift in consumer behavior, particularly among Gen Z and millennials. An economic commentator suggests this trend is a symptom of a "poor-impulse-control economy," driven by stagnant wages, high costs of living, and the normalization of debt. While BNPL offers convenience, it also enables spending beyond one's means, with some seeing it as a psychological buffer against economic precarity. The analysis posits that for many young people, small luxuries financed by debt are an act of agency in an economy that feels inaccessible.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capability to restart uranium enrichment in "a matter of months." Despite recent U.S. and Israeli strikes that caused "severe damage" to nuclear facilities, he clarified that the destruction was not total and Iran's industrial and technological capabilities remain. This assessment appears to temper claims by President Trump that the U.S. had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. The statement underscores the ongoing international concern over the potential for Iran to quickly resume its nuclear activities if it chooses.</p>
