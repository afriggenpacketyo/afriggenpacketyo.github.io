          <p>China has declared it will counteract the United States' restrictions on Chinese-made chips by employing its anti-sanctions law, a move triggered by Washington's prohibition on the use of certain Chinese chips. The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing condemned the US measures as unilateral bullying and protectionism that violates international norms and harms the interests of Chinese businesses. The anti-sanction law, enacted in 2021, allows China to prosecute entities enforcing sanctions against it and demand compensation for incurred losses. China's response signals escalating tensions in the tech sector and a firm stance against what it views as US overreach. </p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after public outrage over his remarks about receiving free rice, which many found insensitive given the country's soaring rice prices. Eto's comments that he never had to buy rice because of gifts from supporters ignited criticism amid widespread concern over rising costs of the staple grain. The resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government faces low approval ratings ahead of elections and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. The incident highlights the political sensitivity of food prices and the government's struggle to address economic discontent. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis reveals that the world's tropical forests experienced a record loss in 2024, primarily due to fires, surpassing land clearing for agriculture for the first time. The destruction of 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests has raised concerns about their resilience in a warming climate, particularly in the Amazon, which experienced severe drought conditions. The burning of these forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, exacerbating climate change. While South East Asia saw a reduction in forest loss due to government policies, the overall trend underscores the urgent need for consistent and effective forest protection measures. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project to expand the country's air defense system, aiming for completion by the end of his term.

Trump stated that the Golden Dome would intercept missiles from anywhere in the world, even from space, using next-generation military technology. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the project as a "game changer" and a generational investment in American security. </p>

Malaysia, a crucial player in the global semiconductor industry, has been caught in the crosshairs of the US-China trade rivalry. While initially seen as a beneficiary of Washington's desire to keep advanced chips out of China's hands, Malaysia now faces uncertainty due to tariffs that could undermine its plans to move into chip design and cutting-edge manufacturing.

          <p>A report indicates that record-breaking global temperatures in 2024 contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with fires sparked primarily by human activity wiping out 2.8 million hectares of old-growth forest. The report emphasizes the amplifying effect of climate change, where drier conditions make forests more susceptible to intense and ferocious fires. While some countries like Indonesia and Malaysia managed to reduce forest loss through prevention efforts and community involvement, the overall trend highlights the urgent need for global action to protect forests. </p>

The city's economy, driven by the service sector and entertainment, has been relatively insulated from the trade war with the United States.

          <p>New emails reveal that a top aide to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Kent, ordered analysts to edit an assessment on the relationship between Venezuelaâ€™s government and the Tren de Aragua gang. Kent sought to insulate President Trump and Gabbard from criticism regarding the administration's claim that Venezuela controls the gang. The final memo still contradicts Trump's claim used to justify deporting accused gang members without due process. The disclosure has raised alarms about the politicization of intelligence analysis, as Kent's interventions aimed to support the administration's policy agenda rather than provide an unbiased assessment. </p>
