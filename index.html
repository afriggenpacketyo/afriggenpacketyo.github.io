While allocations remain small, the adoption of these assets is growing as a way to manage risk beyond traditional stock and bond mixes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing is almost finished to accommodate a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom championed by President Trump. Initially promised not to impact the existing structure, the administration now cites structural reasons for the complete teardown. The project's cost has risen to $300 million, which will be financed by private and corporate donors, including major tech companies, rather than taxpayers. The White House has asserted that it was not legally required to submit demolition plans to the National Capital Planning Commission for this initial phase.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted a pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. The White House stated the pardon was issued because Zhao was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in its "war on cryptocurrency" without allegations of fraud or identifiable victims. The move drew sharp criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called it an act of corruption, linking it to a reported partnership between Binance and a Trump family crypto venture. Zhao expressed his gratitude and pledged to help make America a global hub for crypto and web3.</p>

          <p>New satellite images confirm the complete demolition of the White House East Wing to make way for a $300 million ballroom project initiated by President Donald Trump. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the change in plans, stating that architects and construction companies advised that a full teardown was necessary for a modern and stable structure. This justification comes after the administration initially claimed the project would not interfere with the existing building. The images show the historic wing reduced to rubble, prompting questions about the administration's transparency regarding the project's evolving scope.</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed concern over air traffic controllers taking on second jobs, like driving for Uber, to cope financially during the ongoing government shutdown. As essential employees, controllers are required to work without pay, creating significant financial strain that could impact their focus on a high-stress job. Duffy stated he wants controllers focused on their primary role to ensure air travel safety, acknowledging that staffing shortages are already causing flight delays and cancellations. The shutdown's continuation threatens to further disrupt the national aviation system as workers face mounting financial pressure.</p>

          <p>A new billboard campaign by the organization Unleash Prosperity is highlighting the significant migration of residents and wealth from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey to red states such as Florida and Texas. The campaign, titled "Vote With Your Feet," argues that policies related to high taxes, crime, and schools are driving the exodus. Steve Moore, a former Trump economic advisor and the group's founder, stated that this trend is not just a remnant of the pandemic but a decade-long pattern with significant political and economic implications. The billboards serve as a public warning to lawmakers in these blue states about losing their most valuable resource: their citizens.</p>

In a social media post, Trump also cited discussions with Mayor Daniel Lurie, acknowledging the city's "substantial progress" on crime. This decision marks a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie, who has adopted a less confrontational approach with the Trump administration. The reversal comes after data shows a notable decrease in crime rates and a resurgence in business momentum, largely driven by the AI boom in the city.</p>

          <p>A new scientific report reveals that a record-setting marine heat wave in 2023 caused the "functional extinction" of two foundational coral species in Florida's reef. The prolonged high sea surface temperatures led to the near-total death of staghorn and elkhorn corals, which are critical for the reef's structure and support a quarter of all marine life. Researchers noted the heat stress was so severe that some corals died instantly without even bleaching, a process they described as their tissue "melting."

          <p>Following a severe marine heat wave in 2023, two critical coral species, elkhorn and staghorn, are now considered "functionally extinct" in Florida, according to a new study.

Their disappearance leaves Florida's coastlines significantly more vulnerable to flooding and damage from hurricanes.

          <h2>Germany to Pay Salaries of Local Employees at U.S. Military Bases Amid Shutdown</h2>

          <p>The German government has announced it will cover the October salaries for approximately 11,000 local employees at U.S. military bases in Germany who are at risk of not being paid due to the U.S. government shutdown. A Finance Ministry spokeswoman described the move as a "sign of solidarity" with the U.S. armed forces and their civilian staff. Berlin stated it will initiate an unscheduled expenditure to ensure timely payment and anticipates being reimbursed by the U.S. once the shutdown ends and funding is restored. This action highlights the international ripple effects of the political impasse in Washington.</p>

          <h2>Shares of Toymaker Pop Mart Fall Despite Massive U.S. Sales Growth</h2>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart dropped 9% despite reporting that its third-quarter U.S. sales grew by over 1,200% year-over-year. The decline reflects growing concerns that the craze for its popular Labubu collectible dolls may be waning. Data from a Chinese resale platform shows some figures are now selling at or below their retail price, a sharp reversal from previous sky-high demand. While some analysts see this as a sign of slowing enthusiasm, others suggest it may be due to the company's efforts to increase supply and combat scalping, rather than a true drop in consumer interest.</p>

          <p>A four-year study found that nearly 20% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) among a patient group in Southern California were linked to E. coli strains found in contaminated meat from local grocery stores. Researchers identified turkey and chicken as the most common sources, followed by pork and beef, suggesting that UTIs can be a food safety issue. The study also revealed a significant disparity, with residents of low-income areas facing a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs. The authors call for improved food safety regulations and advise consumers to exercise caution when handling raw meat to prevent infection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to cancel a planned summit with Vladimir Putin in Budapest and impose sanctions on major Russian oil companies marks a significant shift in his approach to Russia. This move from a strategy of engagement to one of pressure reflects growing U.S. frustration with the Kremlin's refusal to compromise on ending the war in Ukraine. Russia has condemned the sanctions as an "unfriendly act," with former President Dmitry Medvedev calling them an "act of war." The reversal indicates that Washington now sees little chance of a diplomatic breakthrough on Ukraine, as Moscow remains determined to achieve its military objectives.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is set to endorse his former political rival, Andrew Cuomo, in the city's upcoming mayoral election. This move aligns Adams with the centrist former governor against the Democratic nominee, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. The endorsement signals a reconciliation between the two powerful figures, who had exchanged sharp attacks before Adams abandoned his own re-election campaign amid a federal corruption case. Cuomo is running as an independent and is attempting to build a coalition of moderate and Republican voters, framing himself as the only candidate who can prevent a progressive takeover of city hall.</p>

          <p>Three Metropolitan Police officers have been dismissed for gross misconduct following a BBC Panorama undercover investigation that exposed disturbing behavior at Charing Cross police station. The officers were secretly recorded making racist, misogynistic, and violent comments, and one was dismissive of a serious sexual assault allegation. During expedited misconduct hearings, the panel chair described their conduct as a "disgrace." These are the first of ten current or former officers facing hearings as a result of the investigation, which has prompted changes in leadership and a review of detention teams across the force.</p>

          <p>The UK government has clarified that its proposed digital ID scheme will not be applied retroactively and will only be mandatory for individuals starting a new job after its implementation, which is planned by 2028. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the digital ID would not be compulsory for accessing essential services like healthcare, and individuals could opt out except for right-to-work checks. The government hopes the system will simplify processes like renting a home or applying to university. However, the plan faces significant public opposition, with a petition to scrap it gathering nearly three million signatures amid privacy and surveillance concerns.</p>

          <p>A group of Republican lawmakers is urging President Donald Trump to confront Chinese President Xi Jinping about Americans they claim are unjustly detained or subjected to exit bans in China. In a letter, the legislators described Beijing as the "world's largest hostage-taker," using these tactics as leverage in diplomatic and business matters. The letter highlights specific cases of imprisoned Americans and detained Chinese citizens with U.S.-based relatives. The appeal comes ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, where stabilizing relations is a key objective.</p>

          <p>The Colombian government has called on the United States to cease lethal attacks on suspected drug-smuggling vessels in international waters, urging respect for international law. The demand follows a U.S. announcement of strikes on two boats that killed five people, bringing the total death toll from such operations to 37. Colombia's foreign ministry stated it "rejects the destruction" of these vessels. The plea comes amid escalating tensions between Colombian President Gustavo Petro and President Trump, who recently exchanged threats after Washington decertified Colombia as an ally in the fight against drugs.</p>

The test occurred during the Friday evening commute, a day before a planned public demonstration for which the freeway was closed. State transportation officials were reportedly unaware that live rounds would be fired during the rehearsal, leading to thousands of commuters unknowingly being put at risk. During the official event on Saturday, an artillery shell exploded prematurely, raining shrapnel on the closed freeway and prompting a Marine Corps investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian is planning to lay off more than 600 workers, representing about 4% of its workforce, as it confronts a challenging market. The company is facing slower-than-expected EV demand, the elimination of federal purchase incentives, and ongoing financial losses, which totaled $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Despite a 32% increase in third-quarter sales, Rivian narrowed its full-year delivery forecast and projected a larger adjusted core loss for the year. The layoffs reflect growing pressure on EV makers as the market adjusts to new economic and regulatory conditions.</p>
