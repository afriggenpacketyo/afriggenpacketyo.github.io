          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump amid the president's calls for lower interest rates. The Fed confirmed the meeting, emphasizing that future monetary policy was not discussed, except to stress that policy decisions would depend entirely on incoming economic data and objective analysis. Powell reiterated the Fed's commitment to setting monetary policy based on careful, objective, and non-political analysis, a move to push back on Trump's pressure. This was their first meeting since Trump began his second term, and comes amid tariff uncertainty and market expectations for the Fed to hold steady on rates until at least September.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the evolving role of the filibuster in the Senate, highlighting how both parties have strategically weakened it over time. Republicans recently maneuvered around the filibuster to pass a bill striking down a California air pollution law, signaling a potential shift in its application. The article explores the historical context, noting Democrats' moves in 2013 to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for most judicial confirmations, and Republicans' extension of that exemption to Supreme Court nominees. Senator John Thune predicts Democrats may use Republican actions as justification to abolish the filibuster entirely when they regain control.</p>

          <p>A Harvard graduate student describes a "devastating" atmosphere of uncertainty on campus due to the Trump administration's efforts to restrict international students. This comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced officials would begin to aggressively revoke visas of some Chinese students, sparking concerns among the international student community. A federal judge in Boston announced she would issue a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's attempts to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students. The university has committed to protecting international students through legal actions, and online learning options could provide a solution if necessary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an 8-0 decision, the Supreme Court has placed new limits on federally mandated environmental impact statements for major projects, potentially expediting infrastructure approvals. The ruling, in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, concerns the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its application to a proposed railway linking Utah and Colorado. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, stated that NEPA should impose only a modest procedural requirement related to the project at hand, not a mandatory study of far-reaching upstream or downstream impacts. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser expressed concerns about the project's risks to Colorado's water resources, while proponents argue the rail line will boost the economy and lower energy prices.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that significant glacial ice loss is inevitable over the next few centuries, even if global temperatures stabilize. Researchers found that glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose about one-third of their mass even if temperatures remained at current levels. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could save twice as much ice compared to a 2.7-degree Celsius warming scenario. The study emphasizes that every tenth of a degree less of warming will help preserve glacial ice and prevent the most severe consequences.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is making leadership changes at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to frustrations with arrest and deportation levels.

          <p>The Supreme Court's decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County places limits on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), potentially making it easier to build infrastructure. The case involved a proposed railroad line in Utah, and the court ruled that environmental impact statements should be more focused and less burdensome. Justice Kavanaugh's opinion emphasizes deference to agency decisions and criticizes the consideration of indirect environmental impacts.
