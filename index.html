          <p>Snapchat will begin charging users for storing photos and videos beyond a 5GB limit in its "Memories" feature, a service that has been free since 2016. The company stated this change will affect a minority of users and allow for further investment in the feature, offering a 100GB plan for a monthly fee. This move has prompted criticism from some long-time users who now face subscription costs to preserve years of saved content, reflecting a broader trend of social media platforms monetizing previously free services.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has officially shut down after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on a funding measure, leading to an immediate lapse in appropriations. The shutdown will result in up to 4 million federal employees, including many essential workers and military personnel, going without pay. Key services like Social Security and Medicare will continue, but others, including national parks and some food safety inspections, will be curtailed, causing widespread disruption and significant economic losses.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has named the first storm of the season "Storm Amy," issuing severe weather warnings for heavy rain and strong winds across the country for Friday and Saturday. Gusts are expected to reach up to 80 mph in exposed coastal areas, particularly in Scotland and Northern Ireland, posing a risk of damage and significant transport disruption. Authorities are warning of potential power cuts, cancelled ferries, and flight delays, as the storm system, which contains remnants of Hurricane Humberto, moves in.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has announced its intention to introduce new legislation that will permanently ban fracking for shale gas in England. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband confirmed the plan at the party's conference, stating that fracking would undermine climate commitments without reducing energy bills for consumers. This move formalizes a long-standing party position and sets up a clear policy contrast with Reform UK, which has advocated for reviving the controversial energy extraction practice.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed his intent to change how international laws, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, are interpreted in UK asylum cases. He aims to prevent foreign nationals from blocking their deportation by arguing that conditions in their home country's prisons or healthcare systems are inferior. Starmer stated that while genuine refugees should be protected, the current application of laws needs to be re-examined to address modern mass migration challenges, specifically citing Articles 3 and 8 as potential barriers.</p>

          <p>Representative Ralph Norman and other Republican colleagues have reintroduced a proposal for a constitutional amendment that would prevent members of Congress from receiving their salaries during a government shutdown. The proposed amendment states that lawmakers would not be compensated for any period in which a lapse in federal appropriations occurs, and they would not receive back pay. The move aims to hold Congress accountable for failing to fulfill its duty to fund the government, aligning their financial situation with that of the many federal workers who go unpaid during such events.</p>

          <p>Veterans and a retired Army general have described Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent address to 800 flag officers as "insulting" and a waste of resources.

The subsequent politically charged speech by Donald Trump, who referred to a domestic "enemy within," was also condemned as a "dangerous, slippery slope" that risks politicizing the U.S. military's leadership.</p>

          <p>The concept of having a "best friend" provides significant psychological benefits into adulthood, offering a deeper level of trust, support, and intimacy that contributes to overall well-being and staves off emotional loneliness. Research suggests that people naturally, if subconsciously, rank their friendships, investing more time and emotional energy into a small inner circle. While the idea of a hierarchy can seem calculating, explicitly recognizing a best friend can strengthen the bond and provide clarity on which relationships to prioritize, ultimately leading to higher satisfaction and resilience.</p>

          <p>European leaders are discussing the creation of a "drone wall," a coordinated counter-drone defense system along the continent's eastern flank, in response to a recent surge in airspace violations by Russian or unidentified drones. Countries like Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states have proposed the system to detect, track, and intercept unauthorized UAVs, viewing it as a necessary defensive barrier. While NATO's Secretary General called the initiative timely, some, like Germany's defense minister, have cautioned that realizing such a complex, cross-border system would take years.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), accusing the agency of unlawfully withholding nearly $34 million in security funding from the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).

Amid a slowing economy, many unemployed workers have entered the gig economy, working long hours for low pay, forcing some to sleep in the cars they rent for work. While companies may temporarily suspend drivers based on negative feedback, critics argue this approach penalizes struggling workers without addressing the root causes of overwork and low pay.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax" has its origins in the magician's incantation "hocus pocus," a phrase popularized in the 1620s as the stage name of a performer named William Vincent. The term "hocus pocus" itself may be a deliberate, playful corruption of the Latin Eucharistic prayer, "Hoc est enim corpus meum." Over time, the phrase became a shorthand for magic and trickery, and the shortened form "hoax" emerged around 1800 to describe a deception or fraud, evolving from stage magic to elaborate public deceptions.</p>
