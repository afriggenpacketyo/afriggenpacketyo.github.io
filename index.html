          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of migrants deported to South Sudan, following concerns that the deportations violated an earlier injunction. The judge, Brian Murphy, expressed concerns about due process and warned of potential criminal sanctions for officials who defied his order. Lawyers for the migrants argued that at least two individuals were informed they would be deported to the violence-plagued South Sudan, a country the U.S. State Department advises against traveling to. The Justice Department stated one migrant was sent to Myanmar, but the destination of the other was classified. </p>

          <p>Corey O’Connor, the son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city under its current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O'Connor positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would get the city working again while it tried to rebuild a tax base devastated by the pandemic downturn in commercial real estate. Gainey, the city’s first Black mayor, faced criticism over constant turnover in police leadership, accusations of fudged budget numbers, and complaints about basic services. O'Connor will face Tony Moreno, the winner of the Republican primary, in the general election in November. </p>

          <p>This article discusses the historical trend of US presidents hiding the true state of their health from the public, with Joe Biden cited as the latest example. A new book alleges that the political and media establishment in Washington covered up Biden’s declining mental health during his presidency. The article notes the recent disclosure of Biden's aggressive form of prostate cancer, suggesting the family may have known about it for a while due to the extensive medical check-ups presidents receive. The author draws a parallel between this practice and that of aging dictators, who also often conceal their declining health. </p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia has sought to end the war in Ukraine on his terms, with recent diplomatic maneuvers defending his approach to negotiate a comprehensive peace deal while continuing to wage war. President Trump said that American economic rapprochement with Russia would come after peace in Ukraine, not before. The Kremlin said that the war in Ukraine had been just one of the issues discussed by Putin and Trump, and that the leaders remained committed to a broader reset. Russia’s offensive has picked up this month after anemic gains earlier this year. </p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumours from weeks to just hours. Surgeons describe the "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing as a "game changer" and say it could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients. The method, developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham, has already been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumour. The new technique has seen results returned in as little as 90 minutes, allowing surgeons to perform more radical surgery, if needed, at the time. </p>
