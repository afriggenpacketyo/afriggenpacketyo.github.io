          <p>A Chinese-led expedition has discovered and documented abundant communities of life at depths exceeding 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. Using a human-occupied submersible, researchers observed fields of tube worms, clams, and bacteria fueled by chemical seepage from the Earth's crust, rather than sunlight. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme high-pressure, dark environments and suggest such chemosynthetic ecosystems may be more widespread than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations in September, following similar moves by the UK and France. The recognition is contingent on the Palestinian Authority implementing significant governance reforms, holding elections without Hamas's involvement, and demilitarizing. The Israeli Foreign Ministry condemned the decision, calling it a "reward for Hamas" and detrimental to ceasefire efforts, highlighting the deep diplomatic tensions surrounding the move.</p>

Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into the open Pacific, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. This directionality, combined with the quake's remote location, meant that while the immediate vicinity in Russia saw significant waves, catastrophic impact was largely averted for other regions.</p>

Baldwin had alleged he was maliciously prosecuted after being charged with involuntary manslaughter, a charge that was later dropped. The judge dismissed his civil suit due to a lack of significant action in the case over a six-month period, though Baldwin's lawyers have 30 days to file a motion to revive it.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of 'Stressful TV': Why Audiences Are Embracing Anxiety-Inducing Shows</h2>

          <p>This article explores the growing popularity of high-stress television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," which immerse viewers in visceral, real-time tension. It argues that audiences are moving away from pure escapism and are instead finding catharsis and satisfaction in hyperrealistic portrayals of workplace anxiety. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be enjoyable as it offers a risk-free thrill, and the realism resonates with viewers who have grown up with anxiety as a constant in their own lives.</p>

Her statement, along with a letter from senior lawyers questioning the plan's legality, adds a powerful and personal perspective to the international debate, highlighting the deep concerns of families directly affected by the conflict.</p>
