            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court's unsigned decision instructs a lower court to clarify its order regarding the administration's role in ensuring Garcia's return. While acknowledging the Executive Branch's deference in foreign affairs, the ruling underscores the government's obligation to address the improper deportation. Garcia's lawyer hailed the decision as a victory for the rule of law, while the Justice Department emphasized the President's authority in foreign policy.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to assist in the return of a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a lower court's order requiring the administration to facilitate the man's release from custody in El Salvador. While the court acknowledged concerns about presidential authority in foreign relations, it emphasized the need to address the improper deportation. The decision underscores the importance of due process and the government's responsibility to rectify its errors.</p>

The project is unique because it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment, following the children of participants in a previous study.</p>

Belton fears the mistake could impact his travel plans and lead to mistaken identity.</p>

The funding is currently used for after-school programs, mental health services, and classroom technology.</p>
