        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovakia and Hungary have voiced strong opposition to the European Commission's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by 2027. These nations, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy, argue that such a move is economic suicide and a threat to the region's energy security. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico specifically warned against building a new Iron Curtain that cuts off Russia, emphasizing the potential for higher energy prices for consumers. Despite recognizing the strategic goal of reducing energy dependence, these countries are wary of the economic consequences of abruptly ending Russian energy imports. Optimism score is 30.</p>

The Switch 2, priced at $449.99 in the U.S., boasts improved features compared to its predecessor, however, Nintendo delayed pre-orders in the U.S. due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where its consoles are manufactured, such as Vietnam.

          <p>Prisons Minister James Timpson is exploring the possibility of using tagging technology more extensively as an alternative to imprisonment, aiming to reduce overcrowding and improve rehabilitation. He insists this approach is not soft on crime, but rather a way to use evidence-based strategies to reduce re-offending rates. The government is meeting with tech companies like Microsoft and Google to explore how technology can aid in monitoring offenders and tackling prison violence. Timpson acknowledges the crisis state of prisons and the need to build more places, but emphasizes the importance of addressing drug addiction, mental health issues, and lack of housing and employment for released prisoners.

          <p>Toyota Motor presented a somber outlook, projecting a 20% decline in operating profit for the fiscal year ending in March, citing headwinds from a stronger yen and a $1.3 billion hit from President Trump‚Äôs tariffs in April and May alone.

          <p>An avatar of Agatha Christie is "teaching" an online writing course, sparking debate about the ethics of using AI to resurrect dead artists. The course uses a "digital prosthetic" made with artificial intelligence and fitted over a real actor‚Äôs performance, based on a script written using Christie's writings and archival interviews. While Christie‚Äôs family supports the project, some ethicists question whether it constitutes a deepfake and blurs the boundaries of consent and authenticity. The representation draws from something ‚Äúclose to her actual writings and her actual words ‚Äî and therefore by her extension, to some degree, her thinking. Optimism score is 50.</p>
