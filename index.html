          <p>A recent Russian drone attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulted in the deaths of at least two people, including a one-year-old baby, and injured 13 others. Residential buildings in western Svyatoshynkyi and south-eastern Darnytskyi districts were partially destroyed and set ablaze after direct hits. This assault comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin has intensified warnings to Western nations against aiding Ukraine. Kyiv officials explicitly stated that Russians are deliberately targeting civilian facilities, urging residents to remain in shelters. The attack underscores the ongoing brutal reality of the conflict and the severe human cost.</p>

The fortunate ticketholders can opt for a lump sum cash payment of $410.3 million each or receive $893.5 million over 30 annual payments that increase by 5% each year.

          <p>An article by Simon Tisdall critiques various world leaders, including Narendra Modi, Emmanuel Macron, and Ursula von der Leyen, for their unsuccessful attempts to curry favor with Donald Trump. Tisdall argues that Trump's relationships are personal and impermanent, suggesting that firm resistance, rather than appeasement, is a more effective strategy. The piece urges Britain's Keir Starmer to learn from these examples ahead of Trump's upcoming state visit, questioning the benefits of his current approach given Trump's actions on global issues.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football team experienced a "full-blown debacle" with a 30-23 loss to UNLV, marking their second consecutive defeat and an 0-2 start to the season for the first time since 2019. The article details persistent problems in both defense, which was slow and often out of position, and an offense unable to sustain drives or capitalize on opportunities. This performance puts increased pressure on coach DeShaun Foster early in his second season, as the team struggles with fundamental issues and faces a challenging path forward.</p>

          <p>After largely focusing on Israeli heroism and the plight of hostages for two years, some Israeli news outlets are starting to report on Palestinian suffering in Gaza, including graphic images of malnourished children. This subtle shift comes amidst unprecedented global outrage over the war and deep divisions within Israel regarding the military offensive. However, international journalists remain largely barred from Gaza, and some Israeli newscasters face backlash for highlighting the humanitarian crisis, with right-wing outlets often cheering Palestinian casualties.</p>

          <p>A joint US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimetre-scale robots using the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles, a phenomenon known as cavitation. The technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then suddenly collapse, generating a strong launching force. This mechanism can propel tiny jumpers 1.5 meters into the air and also enable small pieces of material to swim in water. The study demonstrates cavitation as an efficient new form of propulsion for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>Mount Sinai, a site revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is at the center of a dispute over Egypt's "Great Transfiguration Project," which aims to transform it into a luxury tourism mega-resort. The development, including hotels and shopping bazaars, has led to the demolition of homes and eco-camps of the indigenous Bedouin community, with graves even moved for a new car park. Critics, including UNESCO, express deep concern over the project's impact on the isolated desert landscape and the traditional ways of life, viewing it as insensitive interference.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a new immigration enforcement operation, "Patriot 2.0," in Massachusetts, targeting immigrants who have been released from custody despite ICE detainers. This crackdown, expected to last several weeks, is part of a broader federal push against "sanctuary cities" like Boston, whose mayor, Michelle Wu, has defended policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents. A DHS spokesperson criticized these policies, claiming they harbor criminals, while Wu asserted Boston's status as a safe city built on community policing.</p>

          <p>An initial investigative report into the deadly Lisbon funicular crash confirmed that a cable connecting the two cabins snapped shortly before the derailment. The report by Portugal's air and rail accident investigations bureau stated that a visual inspection conducted hours before the accident found no anomalies in the cable or braking systems. The Gloria funicular, in use since 1914, traveled only about six meters after losing its balancing force before crashing into a building, resulting in 16 deaths and 21 injuries.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using full-scale decoys, including inflatable tanks, plywood artillery, and imitation drones, to trick Russian forces into wasting valuable ammunition and resources. These cost-effective imitations, some of which are flat-pack and quickly assembled by volunteers, are so convincing they can even fool visiting officers. The strategy aims to overload enemy air defenses and divert expensive missiles, with Ukrainian officials noting that about half of recent Russian aerial attacks involve cheap imitation drones. Russia also employs its own array of decoys, including heat-emitting dummies.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is on the verge of becoming the Catholic Church's first millennial saint, with his canonization ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Acutis, who died at 15 from leukemia, was known for creating websites documenting "miracles" to spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." Two miracles have been attributed to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer. His body is preserved in wax in Assisi, Italy, attracting over a million pilgrims, and his story is hoped to inspire faith in young people.</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team experienced another disappointing result with a 2-0 loss to South Korea, extending their summer of experimentation into the fall. Despite head coach Mauricio Pochettino's goal of gaining insights into new players, the team's lackluster performance, marked by poor defensive communication and missed scoring opportunities, raises concerns just months before hosting the World Cup. South Korea, led by Son Heung-min's opening goal, capitalized on US mistakes, leaving the USMNT searching for form as their crucial moment approaches.</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour is stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue, though she will remain global editorial director, with Chloe Malle taking over. Wintour's nearly 40-year tenure was marked by her ability to capture the zeitgeist, notably by featuring pop stars and bridging fashion with entertainment. Her departure raises questions about Vogue's relevance in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, where print magazines struggle for attention. Malle plans to focus on themed, collectible issues, as the brand navigates its future without Wintour at the editorial helm.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end the "de minimis exemption" for low-cost imports. This policy change, which eliminated customs charge exemptions for parcels valued at $800 or less, has caused major operational disruptions, with 88 postal operators suspending service to the US. The Universal Postal Union is implementing new measures to help collect duties, as carriers were unwilling or unable to do so, raising concerns about the impact on international trade and consumers.</p>
