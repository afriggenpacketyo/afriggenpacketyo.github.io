          <p>Hong Kong is actively working to strengthen its connections with emerging markets, highlighted by Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiuâ€™s visits to Qatar and Kuwait, which resulted in 59 memorandums of understanding and agreements to bolster economic and cultural ties with the Middle East. Hong Kong's strategic position as a link between mainland China and the rest of the world is becoming increasingly important as globalization faces fragmentation and arbitrary trade practices. The city's ability to navigate volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) is seen as an asset, especially with rapid technological advancements and the need for a new global consensus. Hong Kong's role is amplified in this evolving landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to postpone the threatened 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, following a "very nice call" with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. The delay aims to provide additional time for negotiations between Brussels and Washington to avert a transatlantic trade war. Von der Leyen stated that Europe is prepared to advance talks swiftly to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The initial tariff threat had caused significant disruption in stock markets, prompting concerns about renewed global economic instability, but the delay offers a window for constructive dialogue.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, people commemorated the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, organizing gatherings in both Houston, where he grew up, and Minneapolis, where he died. Floyd's murder by a police officer sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality, leading to what many called a national "reckoning." His family held a service in Houston near his gravesite, while Minneapolis hosted several commemorations. Civil rights leaders are urging President Donald Trump to continue federal police reform agreements in the wake of Floyd's death, though some reforms appear to be fading.</p>

          <p>The Argentine comic "El Eternauta," a dystopian drama about a group of friends fighting to survive a deadly snowfall, has gained international recognition with its Netflix adaptation. The series, which premiered on April 30, has been renewed for a second season and has resonated deeply in Argentina, where the original graphic novel was written by HÃ©ctor GermÃ¡n Oesterheld in 1957. Oesterheld and his four daughters were "disappeared" during the Argentine military dictatorship, adding historical weight to the story. The comic's themes of resilience and humanity have found renewed relevance amid growing anxiety about the state of Argentine society under President Javier Milei.</p>

          <p>Researchers worldwide are exploring the nature of human consciousness to better understand the potential for artificial intelligence to achieve consciousness. The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led some experts to believe that AI systems may soon become independently conscious, while others remain skeptical. The debate revolves around defining consciousness and determining whether it is solely linked to intelligence and language. Researchers are using various methods, including the "Dreamachine," to study brain activity and identify patterns that explain conscious experiences, with the goal of understanding and potentially guiding the development of AI.</p>

Charities, including the Refugee Council, are urging the government to process claims on a case-by-case basis, citing the impact of the indefinite limbo on individuals and the taxpayer.

The president of the Burgundy Wine Board predicts that French wine producers and US merchants will split the cost of the new import duty between them in order to maintain sales. If Trump increases the tariff on all European Union exports to 20%, the market will almost stop, as happened in 2019 when Trump hit European wine with a 25% import tariff.</p>
