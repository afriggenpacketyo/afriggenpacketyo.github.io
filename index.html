          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new $29 billion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, consisting of 96 million restricted stock shares. This move comes six months after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion package from 2018, a ruling Musk is currently appealing. Analysts suggest the new grant is designed to ensure Musk remains CEO through at least 2030 and to motivate him as the company shifts its focus towards artificial intelligence. The award aims to alleviate shareholder concerns amid recent stock underperformance and increasing competition in the electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month suspension of its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, which were scheduled to take effect this week. This decision follows a July agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at de-escalating trade tensions. The pause is intended to allow for further negotiations to finalize a joint statement and restore stability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The original deal involved the EU removing tariffs on U.S. industrial goods and making significant investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts anticipate that interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) will likely remain stable through August, following the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its key rate steady. Recent data showing a slight uptick in inflation has created uncertainty about when the Fed might resume rate cuts, prompting many banks to maintain current CD yields. While some institutions have begun to slightly lower their rates in anticipation of future cuts, short-term CDs continue to offer more competitive returns than long-term ones. Experts advise savers to compare offers from different banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bartenders in Washington D.C. are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate the city's polarized political climate, particularly since Donald Trump's return to the presidency. Many hospitality workers report a palpable tension, forcing them to act as diplomats to prevent politically charged arguments among patrons. While some bars with progressive identities have faced backlash, others perceived as pro-Trump have also experienced disruptions and staffing challenges. To maintain a neutral and welcoming atmosphere for all customers, many establishments are actively discouraging political discussions, a task that has become a regular part of the job.</p>

          <p>The Trauma & Resilience Initiative, a non-profit in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, that provides mental health support to gun violence survivors, is at risk of closing by December. The organization, which relied on funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), has already ceased its crisis support services after the pandemic-era stimulus money ran out. This situation reflects a nationwide trend where community violence intervention programs are struggling as ARPA funds expire and federal grants are canceled under the Trump administration. The initiative's potential closure threatens a vital community resource that offered an alternative to policing by addressing trauma.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a decade-long investigation, marine ecologists have identified the cause of sea star wasting disease, a devastating illness that has killed millions of sea stars along North America's West Coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacterium, *Vibrio pectenicida*, which causes the stars' limbs to detach before they disintegrate. The discovery is a major breakthrough, as the mass die-off of the sunflower sea star led to ecological imbalances like urchin population explosions and the collapse of kelp forests. Researchers are hopeful that knowing the cause will enable them to develop effective strategies for restoration.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's potential acquisition of Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak may be financially linked to the sale of their own forward, Darwin Nunez, to the Saudi Pro League. Intermediaries are reportedly working on a deal for Nunez to join Al-Hilal, a club also controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which owns a majority stake in Newcastle. While Newcastle rejected an initial £110m bid for Isak, a sale of Nunez would provide Liverpool with significant funds. The situation raises questions among some fans about whether PIF is prioritizing one of its clubs over another.</p>

          <p>India defeated England by just six runs in a dramatic conclusion to the fifth Test at The Oval, leveling the series 2-2. The final day's play lasted only 57 minutes, with the match culminating in a tense chase where England needed 35 runs and India required four wickets. England's hopes were briefly raised by an injured Chris Woakes, who bravely came out to bat with a dislocated shoulder, but Gus Atkinson was ultimately bowled attempting a six that would have tied the scores. The thrilling finale marked the narrowest Test win in England since the 2005 Ashes.</p>

Donated animals are euthanized by trained staff before being used as fodder, a process the zoo says ensures nothing goes to waste. The zoo also accepts horses for the same purpose, provided they meet certain health and transportation safety conditions, and offers a tax deduction for their value.</p>

          <p>Leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, are protesting their exclusion from the CDC's vaccine recommendation process. The groups were notified that their experts are being disinvited from the workgroups of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which review scientific data to help formulate vaccine guidelines. In a joint statement, the organizations called the decision "irresponsible" and "dangerous," warning it will undermine public trust. The move follows the replacement of all 17 ACIP members in June by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>NBC News correspondent Jacob Soboroff will move to MSNBC full-time following the cable channel's spinoff into a new, stand-alone company called Versant. The separation means MSNBC will no longer share editorial resources with NBC News, and talent will generally have to choose one entity. Soboroff is one of the highest-profile names to choose the cable side, a surprising move given that the spinoff is occurring because of the challenging future facing the pay-TV industry. The move reflects an aggressive hiring push by Versant, which is also attracting talent from other major news organizations like CNN and the New York Times.</p>

          <p>Shares of Berkshire Hathaway fell over 2% after the conglomerate reported a 4% decline in second-quarter operating earnings and continued to halt its stock buyback program. A drop in insurance underwriting profits dragged down the overall results, despite gains in its railroad and energy businesses. The company also recorded a significant $3.8 billion loss on its Kraft Heinz stake, an investment Warren Buffett has previously acknowledged was overpriced. With a near-record cash hoard of $344.1 billion, the lack of share repurchases or a major new acquisition has left some investors disappointed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli authorities have begun euthanizing a large group of crocodiles at a long-neglected farm in a West Bank settlement. The reptiles, originally brought to the area as a tourist attraction, were suffering from poor conditions and had become a threat to public safety due to repeated escapes. The business venture failed years ago, and a subsequent plan to sell their skins was halted by a 2012 law protecting the animals. Officials stated the culling was necessary as the crocodiles were being kept inhumanely, with insufficient food leading to cannibalistic behavior, and after significant funds were spent unsuccessfully to secure the dilapidated compound.</p>

          <p>An Irish missionary, Gena Heraty, was among nine people kidnapped from an orphanage near Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The group, which also included seven other employees and a three-year-old child, was taken from the Sainte-Hélène orphanage in Kenscoff during an early morning raid believed to have been carried out by a gang. Ms. Heraty, the facility's director, has worked in Haiti since 1993 and is a celebrated humanitarian. The incident highlights the severe security crisis in Haiti, where armed gangs control most of the capital and kidnappings are rampant, despite the presence of Haitian and international police forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that recent economic data provides Democrats with a significant opportunity to challenge President Trump's economic narrative. With reports showing an uptick in inflation to 2.6% and a rise in unemployment to 4.2%, the positive economic story touted by the White House is facing scrutiny. The author suggests that these figures, combined with the president's subsequent attacks on the Federal Reserve and the firing of the BLS commissioner, create a political opening. The article contends it is time for Democrats to aggressively highlight these issues and frame them as failures of the administration's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia has executed 17 people over a three-day period, bringing the total for the year to 239 and putting the kingdom on pace to surpass its record number of executions. The latest individuals put to death were two Saudis convicted of "terrorist crimes," following the execution of 15 people, mostly foreign nationals, for drug offenses over the weekend. Rights groups have expressed alarm at the spike, particularly for non-violent drug crimes involving hashish, and note that a large portion of those executed are foreigners. The government maintains that capital punishment is necessary to ensure security.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old boy has been sentenced to a 12-month detention and training order for the torture and killing of two kittens near a golf course in Ruislip. The judge described the case as the "most awful offences against animals" she had seen, noting the acts were premeditated. The kittens were found mutilated, with ropes attached to them, alongside blowtorches and knives at the scene. Notes found on the boy's phone detailed his desire to kill a human and that he had killed cats to reduce his urges. The boy received a lifetime ban on owning animals.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has become an unexpected figure in the U.S. political discourse after it was reported she is a registered Republican, drawing praise from Donald Trump. The revelation came amid controversy over her new ad for American Eagle jeans, which some critics on social media likened to Nazi propaganda due to its focus on "blue genes." The situation escalated when Republican senator JD Vance defended her as an "all-American beautiful woman" targeted by Democrats. Public relations experts note the significant risk for a rising star to become entangled in partisan politics, a move that could potentially backfire on her career.</p>

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK. This move gives Nigel Farage's party its first-ever PCC. Announcing his decision, Matthews stated that the "liberal elite" in both major parties had failed the country and that it was time for Reform. The defection adds to a sense of fraying at the local level for the Conservative Party, while providing Reform UK with another institutional foothold. A Conservative MP expressed disappointment, stating the move overturned the democratic voice of those who voted for a Conservative candidate.</p>
