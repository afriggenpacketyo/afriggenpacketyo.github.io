          <p>Star guard Damian Lillard is returning to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he spent his first 11 seasons, after being waived by the Milwaukee Bucks. Lillard shared his enthusiasm on social media with a video tribute and the message "Together Again." The nine-time All-Star is finalizing a three-year contract with the franchise where he is the all-time leading scorer. He is expected to miss the upcoming season while recovering from an Achilles tear, with his combined salary from both teams reaching $70 million for the 2025-26 season.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deceased, identified as detectives Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, were described as elite members of the Arson Explosives Detail. The incident, which represents the largest single loss of life for the department since 1857, is currently under investigation by local and federal agencies. Officials believe the deputies were working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered the previous day when it exploded.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, are in favor of the United States returning to the moon and eventually undertaking a mission to Mars. Support is particularly high among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile endeavor and a source of national pride. The public also tends to believe that the space program contributes, at least somewhat, to technological advancements that benefit society as a whole.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are making significant inroads in the global AI landscape by championing open-source models. The recent releases of DeepSeek's V3 large language model and R1 reasoning model, which rivals OpenAI's technology, have disrupted the industry. This open-source approach, where source code is freely available, fosters collaboration and presents a strong alternative to the closed, proprietary systems of US tech giants. Analysts suggest that this movement poses a more serious challenge to US dominance than previous open-source efforts in other tech sectors.</p>

The clip showed a man and a woman, rumored to be company executives, embracing before abruptly hiding their faces when shown on the venue's large screen. The incident, amplified by a comment from Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin, led to widespread online speculation of an affair. In response, Astronomer announced a formal investigation and appointed a co-founder as interim CEO, stating that leaders are expected to set a high standard of conduct.</p>

          <p>A state audit has revealed that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing. The report highlights a 32% vacancy rate in the last fiscal year, leading the agency to close cases without proper on-site inspections and document cases inadequately. This comes as the agency faces growing responsibilities from climate-related workplace hazards. While Cal/OSHA states it has made recent strides in hiring and operations, workplace safety experts argue that chronic understaffing has crippled its ability to protect California's 19 million workers.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old homeless man, is suing the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment clearing. The lawsuit alleges that city employees acted negligently by failing to check if tents were occupied before flattening them. The incident, which occurred ahead of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, sparked outrage and calls for more humane policies. The family's attorneys describe the death as "tragic and preventable," seeking to hold the city accountable and ensure homeless individuals are treated with dignity.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has altered its practices to ensure that engineers based in China will no longer provide technical support for the company's U.S. defense clients. The change follows a ProPublica report detailing the U.S. Defense Department's reliance on Chinese engineers for its Azure cloud services, raising national security and cybersecurity concerns. The previous system involved U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervising the overseas engineers. In response to the concerns, Microsoft's chief communications officer announced the new policy to ensure no China-based teams assist with DoD government cloud services.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old man, Brycson Gaddis, has been charged with murder and assault on a child causing death after allegedly beating his ex-girlfriend's 5-year-old son, Elyjiah Hearn, to death. Prosecutors say the boy was viciously beaten in a Panorama City apartment, and his body was found the next day in a dumpster. The victim suffered massive injuries, including a broken jaw and fractured ribs. Gaddis, who was not the boy's father, had a warrant for his arrest in a separate domestic violence case at the time of the slaying.</p>

          <p>After a warm and dry spring, pest control experts and entomologists in the UK are predicting a significant increase in wasp populations this summer. While official data is not yet available, the weather patterns have created ideal breeding conditions. Experts note that while social wasps can be a nuisance, they are also vital apex predators in the ecosystem, acting as natural pest controllers. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them by placing a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>The popular cooking show 'MasterChef' is in crisis after both of its long-time presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were sacked in quick succession. An investigation upheld over 40 claims of misconduct against Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact.

Insiders reveal a breakdown in the relationship between the two hosts and a tense period of discussion between the BBC and the show's production company over the fallout.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case remains a central issue for many in the MAGA movement, who view it as evidence of a corrupt "deep state" controlling government and other institutions. This long-held belief, fueled by conspiracy theories like QAnon, has created a political challenge for Donald Trump, who is now facing pressure from his own base to release more information. The case is seen not just as a story of individual crimes, but as a symbol of a shadowy system of elite control. This dynamic has intensified following the administration's recent moves regarding the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is expanding its RSV vaccination program to offer protection to premature babies, a group highly vulnerable to the respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, eligible infants will be offered a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, which offers about 80% protection with a single dose. This new initiative complements the existing program that provides an RSV vaccine to pregnant women. Health officials stated the move will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness by reducing pressures on emergency departments and hospital admissions from the common but highly infectious virus.</p>

          <p>A 2005 incident from Ethiopia is being recalled, where a 12-year-old girl was reportedly rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been abducted by seven men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police reports at the time, three lions chased the men away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found. A wildlife expert speculated that the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for a lion cub's mewing, which could explain why the animals protected her instead of attacking.</p>

          <p>The abrupt cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” by CBS has ignited questions about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While the network cited financial pressures felt across the industry, the timing has raised speculation about political motives, as the move came days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's settlement with President Trump. The decision highlights the format's struggle with shrinking audiences, declining ad revenue, and competition from social media, signaling a potential end of an era for a television institution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered an interaction between a specific gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that could trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The research found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, a molecule produced by gut bacteria overactivates an immune protein called STING, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The study opens the door to developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House has approved a plan to eliminate all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a move that will severely impact member stations, especially those serving rural communities. Tom Michael, general manager of Boise State Public Radio, stated his station will lose 20% of its budget, threatening services in low-population, mountainous areas of Idaho where broadcast radio is a lifeline. While stations are exploring innovative models like regional collaboration, the loss of this public-private partnership funding jeopardizes their ability to serve entire states and could create more "news deserts."</p>
