          <p>President Trump announced a change of plans, sending National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee, instead of Chicago, citing advice from a railroad executive about safety concerns. The decision follows public opposition from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who criticized the use of military personnel as political props. While Memphis's mayor has not explicitly welcomed the troops, he emphasized the need for financial resources for crime prevention and intervention. Trump suggested a Chicago deployment could still happen in the future, leaving the situation fluid.</p>

          <p>Shares of luxury furniture retailer RH declined after the company reported lower-than-expected second-quarter revenue and reduced its full-year financial outlook. The company cited an additional $30 million negative impact from tariffs as a primary reason for the adjustment. CEO Gary Friedman expressed concern over potential new tariffs on imported furniture proposed by the Trump administration, noting that high-quality furniture manufacturing does not currently exist at scale in the U.S. to offset the reliance on imports.

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, prominent conservative speakers have affirmed their commitment to not be silenced by the act of violence. Figures like Heather Mac Donald and Bethany Mandel stated that the killing was an attempt to intimidate conservatives and that they must double down on Kirk's message and methods. They characterized the attack as a result of an increasingly hostile political climate, particularly on college campuses where they believe opposing speech is often equated with hate speech, and called for increased security.</p>

          <p>Shares of Pfizer and Moderna experienced a significant drop following a report that Trump administration health officials intend to link COVID-19 vaccines to the deaths of 25 children. The claim is expected to be presented to a CDC advisory panel and appears to be based on unverified data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This development aligns with recent policy shifts by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has altered vaccine recommendations. Both companies defended the safety of their vaccines, stating that extensive monitoring has not revealed new safety concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Officials have provided a comprehensive overview of the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, culminating in the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. The attack, described as "targeted," involved a single shot fired from a high-powered rifle from a rooftop at Utah Valley University. Investigators utilized surveillance footage, witness accounts, and physical evidence like palm prints and a recovered rifle to track the suspect. The arrest was aided by a tip from the suspect's father, who recognized his son in photos released by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Forty-eight years after anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko died in police custody, South African prosecutors have announced they will reopen a formal inquest into his death. Biko, founder of the Black Consciousness Movement, died from a brain hemorrhage, which his family has long maintained was the result of torture by apartheid-era police. Despite initial claims of a hunger strike, no one has ever been held accountable for his death, and officers involved were denied amnesty. The decision reflects renewed pressure to prosecute apartheid-era crimes and correct the historical record.</p>

          <p>Amid rising inflation and fixed incomes, many seniors are seeking ways to tap into their substantial home equity without taking on new monthly debt. Options like reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their home's value, with the loan repaid only when the home is sold or the owner passes away. Another method is a home equity sharing agreement, where a company provides upfront cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation. These tools can provide liquidity but require careful consideration of long-term trade-offs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is purchasing more shares of Boeing, viewing the recent stock dip as a buying opportunity. The share price fell after the CEO acknowledged delays in the certification process for the 777X aircraft. However, the investment club's thesis remains that such delays are not uncommon and do not alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory, which is the primary driver of the stock's value. The club maintains confidence in the company's turnaround under its current leadership and its improved balance sheet following a recent equity raise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly passed a resolution supporting the "New York Declaration," which calls for irreversible steps toward a two-state solution for Israel and a Palestinian state without the involvement of Hamas.

The vote, which passed 142-10, comes ahead of a summit where French President Emmanuel Macron plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, increasing pressure on Israel.</p>

          <p>The world's largest sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norway, has decided to exclude French mining company Eramet from its portfolio. The decision is based on an "unacceptable risk" that the company is contributing to severe environmental damage and human rights violations at its nickel mining operation in Indonesia. The fund's ethics council cited deforestation, loss of critical habitats, and threats to the survival of an uncontacted indigenous tribe as key reasons for the divestment. Eramet stated it "deeply regretted" the decision and was committed to responsible mining practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has begun using the term "monkeypox" again, reversing its 2022 adoption of "mpox," a name change led by the World Health Organization to reduce stigma. The original name was criticized for being scientifically inaccurate, as the virus is primarily transmitted by rodents, and for its use as a racist and homophobic slur during the global outbreak. Public health experts are baffled by the reversion, suggesting it may be a political move by the Trump administration that could create confusion. The Department of Health and Human Services stated only that "Monkeypox is the name of the viral disease."</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is walking a political tightrope in her dealings with President Trump, who has asserted significant federal control over the city's policing. After Trump declared a "public safety emergency" and deployed federal agents and the National Guard, Bowser has offered a mix of public deference and quiet pushback, a notable shift from her more confrontational first-term stance. While she has credited the federal surge with a drop in crime, she has also criticized the presence of masked ICE agents. This balancing act reflects the reality that DC's self-governance is limited by federal oversight.</p>

          <p>Apple is facing a challenge in China as a growing number of consumers, once devoted fans, are showing waning enthusiasm for new iPhone models. Former loyal customers now perceive the latest releases as lacking significant innovation and feeling "dull" compared to previous game-changing devices. This shift in consumer sentiment is contributing to sluggish sales for the tech giant in one of its most critical markets. The trend suggests a broader challenge for Apple and other multinational corporations as local competition and evolving consumer expectations reshape the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has bluntly predicted that rival budget carrier Spirit Airlines will likely go out of business, stating, "I'm good at math." His comment comes as Spirit filed for its second bankruptcy in under a year, struggling with growing losses, sluggish demand, and rising costs. Kirby criticized Spirit's ultra-low-cost business model, which relies heavily on fees and has been a source of customer frustration, calling it unsustainable. The potential collapse of Spirit could significantly reshape the U.S. airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>
