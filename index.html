          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group has adjusted its full-year production forecast downward to between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles, a reduction from its previous 20,000-unit goal. The company's second-quarter financial results fell short of analyst expectations, with revenue of $259 million against a projected $280 million and an adjusted loss per share of 24 cents. Despite these challenges and slower-than-expected EV demand, Lucid is focusing on cost management and building brand awareness for its upcoming Gravity SUV. The company ended the quarter with approximately $4.86 billion in total liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

The company reported an ARPU of $2.87, slightly below the $2.90 expected by Wall Street, indicating weaker advertising revenue generation per user compared to some social media peers. While daily active users exceeded expectations at 469 million, the company posted a net loss of $262.6 million. Snap did, however, provide a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of analyst estimates, projecting between $1.475 billion and $1.505 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

Drummond was captured in Jackson, Tennessee, following multiple tips from community members who spotted him near a vacant building. He is the prime suspect in the July 29 killings of four individuals, and the related infant was found safely on the same day. Authorities credited the successful capture to strong cooperation between law enforcement and the public, stating it brought a measure of peace to the community. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following comments from President Donald Trump, prediction markets have identified Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh as the front-runners to become the next Federal Reserve chair. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised both individuals, referring to them as the "two Kevins," which caused their odds on the Kalshi prediction market to rise to 35% each. The speculation comes as Trump expresses dissatisfaction with current Chair Jerome Powell's handling of interest rates. The recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler provides Trump an opportunity to appoint a new board member who could later be elevated to the chair position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Comparing Interest Earnings: $10,000 in a 3-Month CD vs. a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 16:15:35 EDT</div>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of the interest earned from a $10,000 deposit in either a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While a CD offers a guaranteed fixed rate, a high-yield savings account provides flexibility with a variable rate that could change with market conditions. Based on current top rates, a high-yield savings account would narrowly earn more over three months, though the difference is negligible and the CD's return is guaranteed. The analysis suggests savers should consider their financial goals and the potential for future interest rate cuts when choosing between the two options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated, with U.S. Senator John Cornyn formally requesting FBI assistance to locate and arrest Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas. The Democrats fled the state to deny a legislative quorum and block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in a way that would favor the GOP in the 2026 elections. This move could create a confrontation between the Trump administration and states like Illinois, where many of the lawmakers have sought refuge. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has also threatened to seek a court order to declare the seats of the absent lawmakers vacant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Delia Ramirez of Illinois has faced significant criticism after a video circulated of her stating she is a "proud Guatemalan before I’m an American" at an event in Mexico City.

In response, Ramirez's office issued a statement defending her remarks, asserting that honoring her Guatemalan ancestry strengthens her commitment to America.

          <p>President Donald Trump's recently enacted spending package includes significant changes to the tax deduction for charitable donations, which will primarily affect high-income earners starting in 2026. The new law introduces a floor, allowing deductions only on amounts exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income, and also caps the benefit for those in the top 37% tax bracket. Financial planners suggest that proactive strategies, such as "bunching" several years of donations into 2025 using a donor-advised fund, could help maximize the more generous tax break before it changes. The legislation also creates a new, limited deduction for non-itemizers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) reveals that parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago. The northern and southern sections of the reef experienced their most widespread and severe coral bleaching events to date, primarily driven by heat stress from climate change. While cyclones and starfish outbreaks also contributed, scientists warn the reef may be approaching a tipping point where it can no longer recover between catastrophic events. The findings underscore the urgent threat that warming ocean temperatures pose to this vital ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research published in JAMA Open Network shows that a cancer diagnosis significantly increases monthly out-of-pocket costs for patients with private insurance, even before they qualify for Medicare. The study found that costs jumped by an average of $592 per month in the six months following a diagnosis. These expenses were also shown to rise as the disease progresses, with stage 4 cancer patients facing an additional $720 per month in costs compared to non-cancer patients. The findings highlight the substantial financial burden of cancer and underscore the need for policy reforms, such as paid sick leave, to support patients. (not investment advice)</p>

Social media users and critics quickly pointed out that a price cut of over 100% would mean the drugs are free and that customers are being paid to take them. The article notes that despite Trump's repeated promises and pressure on pharmaceutical companies, drug prices have not actually decreased. The comments are presented as another instance of the president making mathematically impossible or factually incorrect statements to his supporters. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the market reacted negatively because the results and forward guidance were not as robust as the sky-high expectations Wall Street had set.

This efficiency will not only make advisory firms leaner but also democratize access to high-quality, personalized financial advice for middle-income families and younger generations.
