            <p>Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a summer economic slump following an artificially high start to the year. Businesses are currently stockpiling inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of the tariffs, potentially inflating economic activity in the short term. Goolsbee notes that sectors like the auto industry, heavily reliant on imported parts, are particularly vulnerable. Despite short-term uncertainty, he remains optimistic about the long-term economic outlook, citing steady employment and decreasing inflation. (not investment advice) 70</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes a significant reorganization of the U.S. State Department, potentially closing embassies in Southern Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order aims to streamline operations, project American strength, and align the department with an "American First Strategic Doctrine." Regional bureaus would be consolidated, and diplomatic presence in Canada would be drastically reduced. The order also suggests altering hiring practices to prioritize candidates aligned with the president's foreign policy vision, aiming for full implementation by October 1st. 55</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly interested in attracting wealthy immigrants to the United States, viewing the sale of citizenship as a potential economic strategy. This approach aligns with free-market principles of efficiency but contrasts with the general sentiment against commodifying national belonging. While numerous countries offer residency or citizenship in exchange for investment, Trump's focus on attracting the "uber-rich" highlights his particular economic priorities and his desire to boost the U.S. economy through high-value immigration. 65</p>

            <p>An Israeli investigation into the deaths of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month concluded that there were "professional failures," leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander. The investigation cited poor night visibility and an operational misunderstanding as contributing factors. The military initially claimed the medics' vehicles lacked emergency signals, but video evidence contradicted this. The findings asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members, although the investigation has faced criticism for its limited scope and lack of external oversight. 30</p>

Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week to seek answers about the detention and safety of Abrego Garcia, who was deported in March to the country’s notorious CECOT prison, despite a 2019 court order prohibiting his removal due to safety fears.

The Democratic senator was speaking after returning from El Salvador where he met Kilmar Ábrego García, who was sent to the notorious mega-jail Cecot (Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism) last month. Mr Ábrego García was "traumatised" and fearful of other prisoners while inside the facility, Van Hollen said, adding that he was moved to another facility in the country over a week ago. Van Hollen stressed that he went to El Salvador to ensure both the rule of law and the right to due process before the courts are upheld. 50</p>

According to Congolese police, the fire was likely caused by cooking activities onboard.

While some analysts agree that there could be a short-term uptick in used device sales, they anticipate that most consumers will eventually return to purchasing new tech.
