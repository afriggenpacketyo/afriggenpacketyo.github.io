          <h2>New Jersey Lawmaker Proposes Renaming Delaware Bay</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey has introduced legislation to officially rename the Delaware Bay as "The Bay of New Jersey." The proposal, inspired by a recent executive order changing the Gulf of Mexico's name, aims to better reflect the bay's significance to New Jersey's commercial and recreational fishing industries. The measure would require state agencies to update all official materials with the new name. This move mirrors other recent politically-motivated naming suggestions and seeks to assert state pride over a body of water named in 1610 for a governor of the Virginia colony.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for a ceasefire agreement in the Gaza conflict, urging all parties to "MAKE THE DEAL" and secure the return of hostages. Concurrently, he has intensified his criticism of the ongoing corruption trial against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, labeling it a "POLITICAL WITCH HUNT" that interferes with negotiations. These statements come as an Israeli official indicated plans for Netanyahu to visit Washington, suggesting potential progress on a deal, while the Israeli military orders new evacuations in northern Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. wedding industry is grappling with the financial impact of tariffs on Chinese-made goods, which affect approximately 90% of all wedding dresses sold in the country. Brides are now facing surcharges of 10-15% on their gowns, adding unexpected costs to their budgets and causing some to hesitate on purchases. Bridal shop owners are struggling with the uncertainty, as they must order dresses months in advance without knowing what future tariff rates will be. The tariffs also impact other wedding-related items, and the lack of a domestic manufacturing base for these specialized garments means there are few alternatives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has developed a searchable national citizenship data system, integrating Social Security and immigration databases to allow election officials to verify voter eligibility. The system, created without a public process, is intended to ensure only citizens are voting but has raised significant privacy and legal concerns among experts. While it could streamline verification, critics worry about data accuracy, potential misuse, and the precedent of creating a centralized roster of citizens. The Department of Homeland Security is managing the tool, which has already processed millions of voter records.</p>

Markus SÃ¶der, head of the Christian Social Union (CSU), called for acquiring thousands of drones, new missile systems, and 2,000 Patriot systems to form a protective shield against potential attacks. The call came as German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt visited Tel Aviv, expressing strong support for Israel's recent military actions against Iran's nuclear program.

This sentiment comes as Ishiba urges his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to unite following a poor showing in a recent Tokyo assembly election, driven by money scandals. Despite the dissatisfaction, the LDP remains the most popular party, with rising prices and social welfare cited as the top concerns for voters. The outcome of the July election could reshape the ruling bloc and determine Ishiba's political future.</p>

          <p>Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that Iran could restart enriching uranium within a matter of months, despite recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities. Contradicting claims that the program was "obliterated," Grossi explained that Iran retains the necessary industrial and technological capacities. The IAEA's primary concern is the location of approximately 400 kilograms of uranium previously enriched to 60%, which is just below weapons-grade. This assessment highlights the persistent challenge of monitoring Iran's nuclear capabilities amid ongoing diplomatic and military tensions.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 81 people and injured over 400 in a recent 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near a stadium in Gaza City that was being used as a shelter for displaced people, resulting in at least 11 deaths, including children. Further strikes in the al-Mawasi and Tuffah neighborhoods also led to numerous civilian casualties. These attacks come amid intensified efforts by international mediators to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, though negotiations remain stalled.</p>

          <p>After a six-year legal process, a California jury has convicted Samuel Woodward of the first-degree murder of his former high school classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein. The jury also found true the enhancement that it was a hate crime, motivated by the fact that Bernstein was gay and Jewish. Woodward, who was linked to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, stabbed Bernstein 28 times in a local park in 2018. The verdict ensures Woodward faces a sentence of life in prison without parole. In response to the tragedy, Bernstein's family founded "BlazeItForward," a movement promoting kindness to counter the hate that led to their son's death.</p>

With this investment, the French state becomes the largest shareholder, viewing Eutelsat as a strategic asset for Europe's technological sovereignty and defense communications. However, experts are skeptical about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the consumer market, citing a significant disparity in scale; Eutelsat operates about 650 low-Earth orbit satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600.
