          <p>PBS announced it is cutting approximately 15% of its workforce due to the complete elimination of federal funding for public broadcasting, a move initiated by Republicans in Congress. The cuts, affecting over 100 jobs when combined with other vacant positions and a lost grant, are a response to a 21% revenue hit. PBS Chief Executive Paula Kerger stated that these difficult choices were necessary despite progress in other fundraising areas, impacting all facets of the organization.</p>

          <p>In the contentious New York City mayoral race, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate, bypassing his independent rival Andrew Cuomo. This move came after Cuomo challenged Mamdani to a series of debates and called for incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out. The race has drawn national attention, with President Trump expressing a desire for a one-on-one contest against Mamdani, whom he labeled a "communist."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will soon impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not move their manufacturing operations to the United States. Speaking at a White House dinner with tech industry leaders, Trump indicated that firms like Apple, which have expanded domestic investments, would likely be exempt from the new levies. The move is part of a broader effort to onshore the U.S. semiconductor supply chain, a policy that has already prompted major investments from global chipmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An image showing President Donald Trump with a noticeably swollen face, which circulated widely on social media and was shared by California Governor Gavin Newsom's office, has been confirmed to be fake. A reverse image search revealed the picture is a digitally altered version of an original Associated Press photograph taken in July 2022. Newsom's office acknowledged the image was edited, stating it was posted to mock the president amid unfounded online rumors about his declining health.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to enforce a policy that would prevent transgender and nonbinary citizens from obtaining passports reflecting their gender identity. The court upheld a lower court's injunction, which found the policy was likely rooted in unconstitutional prejudice against transgender Americans. The policy sought to reverse a previous rule that allowed applicants to self-identify their gender or choose a neutral "X" marker, and instead required listing "biological sex at birth."</p>

This potential use case would expand the scope of the e-CNY beyond its current retail and consumer applications, potentially enhancing visibility over transactions.</p>
