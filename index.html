          <h2>CarMax Stock Declines Sharply After Missing Quarterly Expectations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 11:05:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of used auto retailer CarMax fell by over 20%, reaching their lowest price since March 2020. The significant drop followed the company's failure to meet Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue forecasts, with overall vehicle sales declining by 4.1% compared to the previous year. CEO Bill Nash described the quarter as 'challenging,' citing difficult market conditions and inventory depreciation as key factors for the poor performance. The results have also negatively impacted the stocks of other car retailers, which are often viewed through the lens of CarMax's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy's growth for the second quarter was revised upward to a strong 3.8% annualized rate, significantly higher than the previous estimate of 3.3%. This rebound was largely driven by robust consumer spending, which increased at a 2.5% pace, indicating continued consumer confidence despite broader economic headwinds like tariffs. The stronger-than-expected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data suggests the economy remains on solid footing, potentially influencing the Federal Reserve's decisions on future interest rate cuts. Economists note this resilience may temper the central bank's enthusiasm for additional easing in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from UC Berkeley reveals that the climate emergency is worsening California's affordability crisis by imposing significant 'hidden costs' on households. These costs manifest as rising utility bills, lost wages for outdoor workers, and increased healthcare expenses from events like wildfires and extreme heat. The analysis estimates that an average American born in 2024 could face up to $500,000 in additional lifetime costs due to climate change. Researchers emphasize that these are not abstract future expenses but immediate financial burdens already impacting residents and deepening the state's existing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of orchestrating a $112 million Ponzi scheme. The entrepreneurs, known for acquiring bankrupt retail brands like RadioShack and Pier 1 Imports to relaunch them online, allegedly defrauded investors by misrepresenting the companies' financial health. The SEC lawsuit claims that instead of generating profits, the duo used funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier ones and diverted at least $16 million for personal use. The complaint alleges they falsely portrayed the acquired brands as highly profitable to attract investment.</p>

          <p>With children back in school, concerns about head lice are increasing, as infestations are most common among preschool and elementary-aged students. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizes that lice spread through direct head-to-head contact and are not an indicator of poor hygiene. Prevention methods include avoiding the sharing of hats, brushes, and clothing, while treatment options range from over-the-counter medications to professional removal services.

          <p>Russia is facing significant economic strain from its war in Ukraine, prompting the Kremlin to plan tax hikes and spending cuts to address a growing budget deficit. The government announced a value-added tax increase and is expected to reduce non-defense spending, including in social sectors, as plunging oil revenues and sanctions take their toll. The country's budget deficit has swelled to nearly four times its original target for 2025. Analysts suggest these economic woes are creating domestic pressure that could make President Putin more open to seeking a resolution to the conflict sooner than previously anticipated.

This valuation reflects the soaring worth of NFL teams, further evidenced by other recent minority stake sales for the New York Giants and Chicago Bears at similarly high valuations.

CEO Brian Niccol stated the closures target locations where the company cannot create the desired customer environment or achieve financial viability.

          <p>The Australian horror film 'Together' has faced backlash in China after its distributor digitally altered scenes to replace a gay couple with a heterosexual one. Moviegoers who attended advance screenings noticed the changes, which included replacing a man's face with a woman's and removing other references to the same-sex relationship. The film's global distributor, Neon, condemned the unauthorized edit and demanded that distribution of the altered version cease. This incident has sparked criticism over China's censorship of LGBTQ+ content, with many viewers finding the use of AI to distort the original work particularly egregious.</p>

          <p>The title sponsor of the Israel-Premier Tech cycling team has publicly urged the team to change its name to exclude 'Israel' for the next season. The Canadian company, Premier Tech, stated that the 'current situation regarding the team's name is no longer tenable,' following pro-Palestinian protests during this month's Vuelta a España race. The sponsor indicated that its continued commitment depends on the team adopting a new identity and branding. The Israeli-registered team, owned by Israeli-Canadian billionaire Sylvan Adams, acknowledged the discussions and said it is planning its branding for the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed he was the victim of 'triple sabotage' during his visit to the United Nations, citing three equipment failures he says were not coincidental. In a social media post, Trump described how an escalator he was on came to a 'screeching halt,' his teleprompter failed during his speech to the General Assembly, and the sound system in the auditorium was off. He has demanded an immediate investigation by the UN Secretary-General into the incidents. A UN official suggested the escalator stop was inadvertent, but Trump pointed to a report that UN employees had joked about such an action.</p>

          <p>The French navy has successfully intercepted a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa, seizing 9.6 tons of cocaine with an estimated market value of over $600 million. The major operation was conducted by two navy ships following intelligence from anti-drug authorities and British police. This seizure is part of France's long-standing Corymbe naval mission, which aims to enhance security in the Gulf of Guinea. The incident highlights the continued use of this maritime route for large-scale drug trafficking, with French authorities having already seized nearly six tons of cocaine in the region earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Shares of offshore drilling company Transocean dropped significantly on Thursday after the firm announced it would sell 125 million shares at a discounted price. The offering price of $3.05 per share was substantially lower than the previous day's closing price, leading to a roughly 14% decline in the stock's value. The Swiss-based company increased the size of the offering and expects to raise approximately $381 million from the sale.

          <p>The traditional 'bases' metaphor for physical intimacy has become a relic for many in Gen Z, replaced by a complex new vocabulary for navigating relationships. Terms like 'sneaky links,' 'situationships,' and 'cushioning' reflect a dating culture that often prioritizes nonchalance and avoids emotional vulnerability. This article explores how Gen Z's approach to sex and romance is shaped by a desire for autonomy and a fear of public judgment, influenced by growing up online. While this creates more individualized paths, it also introduces stress and confusion, as young people navigate a vast 'buffet' of relationship options with little traditional guidance.</p>

          <p>Scottish football club Rangers has had a difficult start to the season under new manager Russell Martin, failing to win its first five league games. An analysis of the team's performance reveals that Martin's signature possession-based, attacking style has led to vulnerabilities, particularly losing the ball in central areas and being exposed on counter-attacks. Following a heavy defeat in Champions League qualifying, Martin has uncharacteristically shifted to a more pragmatic, defensive 4-2-3-1 formation. This drastic change from his long-held philosophy highlights the immense pressure he is under to secure results at the club.</p>

          <p>A new report alleges that the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was largely unreachable for hours during the deadly floods that struck Texas in July. This communication failure reportedly delayed the deployment of critical search-and-rescue resources in a disaster that claimed over 130 lives. The agency's response was also allegedly hampered by a new policy requiring the Homeland Security Secretary to personally approve any expenditure over $100,000. The report has led to calls for the acting administrator's resignation amid criticism of the agency's slow and ineffective handling of the crisis.</p>

The 2026 tournament is already set to expand to 48 teams, and this further increase would double the tournament's size in just eight years. Proponents argue it would be a fitting way to mark the World Cup's centenary and make the event more inclusive. However, critics, including UEFA's president, have called it a 'bad idea' that could dilute the competition's quality and create logistical chaos for the multi-continent tournament.</p>

          <p>The trial of South Sudan's First Vice President Riek Machar on charges of murder and treason is stoking fears about the nation's fragile peace. Machar's recent suspension by President Salva Kiir has effectively dissolved the unity government formed under a 2018 peace agreement, which ended a devastating civil war. Observers worry the trial is politically motivated and could reignite ethnic tensions between Machar's Nuer supporters and Kiir's Dinka base. With the peace process at risk, the proceedings are seen as a critical test for the country's stability ahead of postponed elections scheduled for 2026.</p>
