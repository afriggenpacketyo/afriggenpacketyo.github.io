          <p>The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has made its first arrests under Florida's new "Halo Law," which creates a 25-foot buffer zone around law enforcement and first responders. Two women, Anita Gibson and Jasmine Jefferson, were charged after allegedly harassing and impeding an officer who was arresting a third individual outside a charter school. Sheriff T.K. Waters stated that while citizens can observe and record from a distance, the law will be enforced when their actions create a safety risk for officers.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden has begun radiation and hormone therapy to treat an aggressive form of prostate cancer that was diagnosed in May. His spokesperson confirmed the treatment plan, noting that the cancer, which had metastasized to the bone, is considered hormone-sensitive, improving the effectiveness of the therapy. This follows a separate procedure in September where Biden had cancerous skin cells successfully removed, with his physician stating at the time that no further treatment was needed for that issue.</p>

          <p>Despite having the world's youngest population, Africa is home to numerous gerontocracies, exemplified by Cameroon's 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who is seeking an eighth term after 43 years in power. This article examines the trend of aging leaders across the continent, including those in Malawi, Ivory Coast, and Equatorial Guinea, who often amend constitutions to extend their rule. This phenomenon creates a stark contrast with the continent's youthful demographics and growing 'Gen Z' protest movements demanding change.</p>

          <p>A peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, brokered with significant involvement from President Donald Trump, is being hailed as a potential turning point in the Gaza conflict. Political analysts suggest that Trump's direct pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a critical factor in achieving the deal. As American political support for Israel's position has shifted, Netanyahu's reliance on the U.S. made him more susceptible to influence from the White House, ultimately leading to the breakthrough.</p>

Wilshere's most recent coaching experience was as an interim coach for Norwich City at the end of the previous season, and a deal with Luton is reportedly close to being finalized.</p>

          <p>In a recent television appearance, President Donald Trump made a mathematically impossible claim regarding future prescription drug prices. While recounting his first-term achievement of lowering drug prices by a fraction of a percent, he asserted that prices would soon go down by percentages far exceeding 100%, including "400 percent, 600 percent, a thousand percent in some cases." A price reduction cannot exceed 100%, as that would imply the cost becomes less than zero, meaning sellers would be paying buyers.</p>
