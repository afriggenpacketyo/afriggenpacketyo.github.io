        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leaked memo revealed discussions within the Labour party regarding potential tax increases, specifically urging Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider raising taxes by £3-4 billion annually. The memo proposed measures such as increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. However, Reeves did not implement these proposals, opting instead for welfare cuts. The Conservatives criticized the memo, suggesting Labour is planning future tax increases, while a government spokesperson declined to comment on the leak.</p>

The win is expected to encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages, highlighting the value of attention to marginalized lives.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for a massive budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing resistance from both conservative and moderate factions. Conservatives seek deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose cuts to state and local tax deductions. Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to build consensus before the Memorial Day deadline. The bill faces challenges in the Rules Committee, but a key conservative holdout has agreed to allow it to advance to the House floor. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Scientists warn that a magnitude 8.0 earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone poses a 15% chance of triggering a 1,000-foot mega-tsunami within the next 50 years, potentially devastating coastal cities like Seattle and Portland. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlights that such an event could also cause coastal land to sink by up to 6.5 feet. Unlike gradual climate events, this earthquake and subsequent tsunami would occur rapidly, leaving little time for adaptation. The most severe impacts are expected in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act into law, making Delaware the 11th state to legalize physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. The law allows mentally capable adults with six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. Patients must be presented with other end-of-life care options and undergo two waiting periods and a second medical opinion. Supporters argue the law provides compassion and dignity, while opponents express concerns about ethical and moral implications.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that US export controls on AI chips to China have been ineffective, as Chinese companies are turning to locally-developed technology. The US restrictions have prompted companies to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers like Huawei and spurred China to invest in its own supply chain. Huang noted that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market has significantly decreased. The US has been attempting to limit exports of advanced chips to China over concerns about military applications and maintaining American dominance in AI.</p>

          <p>The first blood test to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease will be available in the US starting in late June, developed by Japanese company Fujirebio Holdings. The test, cleared by the FDA, detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, and is intended for individuals 55 and older showing signs of the disease. It offers a less expensive and invasive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests. This advancement is expected to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's, potentially improving access to new Alzheimer's drugs.</p>

          <p>China has vowed to use its anti-sanctions law in response to the United States' attempts to ban Chinese-made chips. The Ministry of Commerce condemned Washington’s measures as unilateral bullying and protectionism. The anti-sanction law, passed in 2021, stipulates that anyone implementing or assisting sanctions against China is subject to prosecution and liable for losses incurred. Beijing will closely monitor the US measures and take actions to defend its interests, the ministry stated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New satellite analysis reveals that the world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, primarily due to fires. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests were lost, releasing 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases. The Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, fueling widespread fires. South East Asia bucked the trend with government policies helping to reduce forest loss. The report raises concerns about the resilience of tropical rainforests and their potential to reach a tipping point of irreversible decline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report highlights that record-breaking global temperatures contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide in 2024, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with most of the loss due to fires in the Amazon rainforest. The report emphasizes the amplifying effect of climate change on wildfires, making them more intense and widespread. Indonesia and Malaysia saw decreased forest loss due to fire prevention and stricter deforestation laws.</p>

          <p>The media's focus on young men allegedly driving the rise of the far right is empirically flawed and misses a more significant shift in public opinion among young people. While there is a gender gap in support for far-right parties, young women are turning in greater numbers towards the left. Young people hold more progressive values than previous generations, and the main reason for the gender gap is not a rightwing turn among young men but a sharp leftwing turn among young women. This is a political opportunity for center-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters.</p>
