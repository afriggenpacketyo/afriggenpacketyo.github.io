          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a significant recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The vote was initiated by supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who are frustrated by the KMT's legislative actions, including blocking the defense budget and passing reforms seen as favoring mainland China. The outcome could shift the balance of power in the legislature, where the KMT and its allies currently hold a majority. This election highlights the deep political divisions on the island regarding its relationship with Beijing and its democratic future.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation highlights severe side effects associated with dopamine agonist drugs, such as Ropinirole, prescribed for Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. The article details cases where patients developed extreme compulsive behaviors, including hypersexuality, pathological gambling, and obsessive paranoia, leading to devastating personal consequences like family breakdowns and criminal charges. Despite long-known risks, many patients and their families report not being adequately warned by medical professionals about the potential for such drastic personality changes. The report calls for clearer warnings and greater awareness of the medication's potential to cause life-altering impulse control disorders.</p>

          <p>An investigation has confirmed that an explosion at a training facility, which killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies, was caused by a live grenade they believed to be inert. The deputies had recovered two grenades from a Santa Monica garage the previous day. Authorities have now revealed that the second grenade from that recovery is missing, prompting a wide-scale search. The Sheriff's Department has revised its protocols, stating all explosive devices will now be treated as live to prevent future tragedies. This incident marks the department's largest loss of life since 1857.</p>

          <p>A survey of Friday's UK newspaper headlines reveals a strong focus on international and domestic issues. Several major papers, including The Guardian and The Telegraph, highlight growing political pressure on the prime minister to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move his deputy reportedly supports. The Daily Mail features an interview with a freed British-Israeli hostage, while The Mirror's front page displays a powerful image of a starving child in Gaza. Domestically, The Telegraph campaigns for improved prostate cancer screening, warning that the NHS is failing to diagnose thousands of men in a timely manner.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' World Food Programme has issued a stark warning that almost one-third of people in Gaza are now going entire days without eating. Malnutrition is escalating, with an estimated 90,000 women and children requiring urgent treatment for the condition. The report comes amid mounting international pressure on Israel to lift restrictions on aid, with Germany, France, and the UK issuing a joint call for an immediate end to the humanitarian catastrophe. Israel maintains that it does not restrict aid and blames Hamas for any food shortages within the territory.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step forward in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the preliminary design for a commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. Known as the CFR-1000, this facility will be the country's first gigawatt-level fast reactor, a technology designed to be more fuel-efficient than current nuclear power sources. The project, which is now awaiting final government approval, is part of a global race among major powers like Russia and the United States to develop next-generation reactors. The design was unveiled at an event in Fujian province, attended by top officials from China's national energy and atomic authorities.</p>

In a joint statement, the UK's Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move an act of "transnational repression" and reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights and safety of all individuals in the UK. The bounties are the latest in a series of similar actions by Hong Kong authorities targeting activists abroad under the city's sweeping national security law.

          <h2>UK's Warm and Sunny Spring Leads to Thriving Populations of Some Insects</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable boom for certain insect species, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm weather led to an abundance of aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and created ideal conditions for butterflies to thrive after a very poor season last year. Butterfly conservationists reported an "extraordinary" year for early sightings of numerous species. However, experts caution that the associated lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year due to the drying up of wetland breeding grounds.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago and the state over their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, had alleged that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents were unlawfully thwarting federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins affirmed that the local policies are protected by the Tenth Amendment and do not illegally obstruct federal operations. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both celebrated the decision as a victory for the city's welcoming ordinance and a lawful rejection of the administration's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history when entertainment professionals were persecuted for alleged Communist ties. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. It explores how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals to name names to save themselves, and extended beyond Hollywood to affect ordinary Americans. The display raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and the protection of democracy.</p>

          <p>A Whittier man has been arrested and charged with wire fraud for allegedly conning multiple people he met on dating apps like Tinder and Hinge out of more than $2 million. Federal prosecutors allege that Christopher Earl Lloyd posed as a successful financial manager and vice president of an investment company to gain his victims' trust. He then allegedly convinced them to invest in fraudulent opportunities, promising significant returns and the ability to withdraw funds at any time. Instead of investing the money, Lloyd allegedly used it for personal expenses, including making a down payment on a Lexus.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity for her nine-hour interview with the Deputy Attorney General regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, according to sources. This "proffer immunity" is a common tool used by prosecutors that prevents a person's statements from being used against them directly, encouraging them to speak freely. The meeting was reportedly initiated by Maxwell, who is appealing her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. While her lawyer confirmed no promises of clemency were made, the high-level meeting with a convicted trafficker has been described as highly unusual and has drawn criticism from victims.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is undertaking a critical mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been decimated by disease. After losing about half the population in five years, biologists captured and relocated dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated mountain range. The goal is to establish a new, protected population away from the diseases spread by non-native animals. A recent check on the relocated herd brought good news, as biologists found the sheep surviving and spotted newborn lambs, signaling hope for the species' recovery.</p>

The envoy blamed Hamas, saying its response to the latest proposal showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire" and that the group was not acting in good faith. This breakdown in talks comes amid dire warnings from the United Nations and other aid agencies about catastrophic starvation in Gaza, with reports of children dying from malnutrition. The war, which has been ongoing for 21 months, continues with no clear diplomatic path forward.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a sudden, rapid descent shortly after takeoff, injuring two flight attendants. Passengers reported being lifted from their seats during the maneuver, which the pilot reportedly explained was necessary to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft. The other plane was identified as a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has confirmed it is investigating the incident, which is the second near-miss involving a commercial airliner in the U.S. in a week, raising concerns about aviation safety.</p>

          <p>A feature article examines the validity and flexibility of common daily health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours a night. Experts suggest that while these targets are useful guidelines, strict adherence may not be necessary for everyone. For instance, a kidney specialist argues that for most healthy people, simply drinking when thirsty is sufficient. While the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep is considered crucial, experts advise that adapting exercise goals to fit one's lifestyle is more practical than aiming for a rigid, one-size-fits-all number.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is taking place in women's sport, with researchers focusing on topics previously overlooked, such as the menstrual cycle, breast biomechanics, and female-specific injury risks. The article explores how proper sports bra support can significantly improve performance by altering a runner's stride and how teams are now openly tracking menstrual cycles to manage symptoms and anxiety. It also delves into why female athletes face a higher risk for certain injuries, like ACL tears, and how new training methods aim to mitigate this. This research marks a major shift from a time when female athletes were often treated simply as "mini-men."</p>
