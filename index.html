          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired up to 20 agents who kneeled during a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., in the wake of George Floyd's death in 2020. These agents, many from the Washington Field Office, were photographed kneeling in early June 2020. Sources familiar with the matter indicate that the agents kneeled as a de-escalation strategy when outnumbered by angry protesters, and a previous internal review found their actions were not a political statement. Despite this, some were reassigned earlier this year, leading to these recent dismissals, though the FBI has declined to comment on the controversial decision.</p>

          <p>A Georgia Steak 'n Shake owner, Wayne Robinson, has garnered national attention after erecting a billboard tribute to Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder recently killed. The billboard, reading "Charlie Kirk, 1993-2025: Stand up, speak out, stay bold," quickly went viral, prompting millions of social media likes and a significant increase in customers at Robinson's location and others across the country. Robinson, deeply affected by Kirk's assassination and admiring his work in bringing young people to Christ, hopes to expand this tribute nationally with corporate permission.

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell discussed her highly anticipated new film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," aiming to convey the "primal" and "sexual" feeling she first experienced reading the book as a teenager. Speaking in Brontë's home town, Fennell, known for "Promising Young Woman" and "Saltburn," revealed her intention to fulfill her 14-year-old vision for the story, even incorporating risqué additions she thought she remembered from the novel. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the film, with its "heightened and highly stylised gothic approach," promises a unique and intense cinematic interpretation of the turbulent romance.</p>

          <p>Michele Beckwith, the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento, claims she was fired after instructing Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino to comply with a court injunction that blocked indiscriminate immigration raids in California's Eastern District. A career prosecutor with 15 years in the Justice Department, Beckwith warned Bovino that agents could not arrest people without probable cause, as a federal judge had ruled such tactics likely violated constitutional protections. Her work phone and computer were disabled shortly after her warning, and Bovino's agents proceeded with a raid in Sacramento two days later, illustrating the intense pressure on Justice Department officials to align with administration policies.</p>

          <p>Varun Suresh, a 29-year-old California man, faces a murder charge after allegedly conducting a targeted, vigilante-style killing of David Brimmer, a 71-year-old registered sexual assault offender. Police allege Suresh researched registered sexual assault offenders using Megan's Law, found Brimmer's address, and lured him out by posing as a CPA. Suresh reportedly told police the killing was "honestly really fun" and that he had waited years to commit such an act due to the pain sexual assault offenders cause children. He is currently held without bail, with the case highlighting the severe and tragic consequences of individuals taking justice into their own hands.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to continue freezing over $4 billion in foreign aid, which had been approved by Congress. The 6-3 conservative majority court stated that the "asserted harms" to Trump's conduct of foreign affairs appeared to outweigh the potential harm faced by aid recipients, though it clarified this is not a final determination. Liberal justices dissented, with Elena Kagan arguing the order conflicts with the separation of powers and Congress's constitutional authority over spending. This action is part of the administration's broader effort to drastically downsize US foreign aid operations, which researchers warn could have dire global health and humanitarian consequences.</p>

These developments highlight a significant wave of innovation in China's domestic AI industry, largely spurred by US trade restrictions imposed in 2019 over national security concerns. Beijing is now actively urging its tech giants to cease buying US-tailored chips, intensifying the tech rivalry with Washington.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Minnesota ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent propagator of false election fraud claims, defamed the election technology company Smartmatic. The ruling found that Lindell made 51 specific false claims in documentaries, media appearances, and personal statements, alleging Smartmatic's voting machines rigged the 2020 presidential election in Los Angeles County. While the judge deferred on determining "actual malice," which Smartmatic still needs to prove for damages, the company is seeking "nine-figure damages."

FreshRealm, the distributor, advised Walmart to pull the Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo from shelves after tests detected the listeria in linguine.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers will be without key reliever Brock Stewart for the playoffs after he underwent season-ending shoulder surgery, realizing the team's worst-case scenario for their trade deadline acquisition. Stewart, who had been out since early August with a shoulder problem, continued to feel residual soreness despite a minor-league rehab stint, leading to the decision for a debridement procedure. This injury compounds the Dodgers' bullpen struggles and other player concerns, including Will Smith's fractured hand and Max Muncy's leg bruises. Stewart's absence creates another significant hole in their relief pitching as they head into October, making their path to success more challenging.</p>

Departing the White House, Trump declared, "I think there’ll be others," asserting that his adversaries were "corrupt radical left Democrats." His blunt remarks underscore concerns about the Justice Department pursuing cases against his political opponents, even when evidence is widely considered weak, as was the case with Comey. Trump has recently fixated on potential criminal investigations against New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, signaling a continued politicization of legal processes.</p>

The housing ministry's head of placemaking outlined plans for 12 new towns that will be walkable, environmentally friendly, and feature "gentle density" housing like terraced homes rather than high-rises. TV architect George Clarke notes a significant shift in architectural consensus, with younger architects embracing the King's emphasis on traditional designs, local materials, and community-focused public spaces. These principles aim to create high-quality, sustainable communities, learning from the failures of post-war new towns.</p>

Emily, a stroke survivor, found purpose in pottery but struggled with the performance aspect and engaging with comments, eventually taking a break. Alun, a historian, faced emotional tolls from chasing views and cruel comments about his appearance, though his university's promotion significantly boosted his reach. Danyah, a performer, found content creation addictive and mentally draining. The article highlights the intense demands, self-worth impacts, and unexpected benefits of navigating the lucrative but unforgiving creator economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new round of tariffs, effective October 1, including a 100% tariff on branded/patented pharmaceutical products (with exemptions for US manufacturing plants), 30% on upholstered furniture, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 25% on heavy trucks. These measures are intended to protect US industries from foreign competition and address perceived "flooding" of products. While some experts predict a modest impact on pharma due to existing US production and inventory, the tariffs could increase costs for consumers and homebuilders. Economic data indicates that previous tariffs have already begun to drive inflation, contradicting the president's claims of economic success. (not investment advice)</p>

The program aims to discuss and challenge messaging from the "manosphere," which frequently pressures boys to be physically strong.

Ahead of the Labour Party Conference, Starmer emphasized the need to win this "battle for the soul of this country," reflecting a shift in political strategy. He also plans to enthusiastically embrace digital ID, arguing that public comfort with online data sharing has changed the landscape for state-mandated identification. While acknowledging noisy opposition, Starmer aims to convince voters that Labour can deliver incremental improvements and that embracing Reform would be a significant mistake, setting clear political dividing lines.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has captivated millions for decades. While the widely accepted theory is that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan crashed into the Pacific after running out of fuel, various unproven theories persist, including one suggesting she was captured by the Japanese on a spy mission. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands territory specifically requested the declassification based on "credible, firsthand accounts" of her being spotted on Saipan. However, experts like journalist Laurie Gwen Shapiro dismiss spy theories as "nonsense," attributing the disappearance to simple fuel exhaustion.</p>

          <p>Southern California has witnessed thousands of lightning strikes over the past two days, primarily occurring over the Pacific Ocean about 50 miles offshore, as a low-pressure system moves slowly across the area. The Bay Area alone recorded over 13,000 total lightning strikes, with most hitting during wet conditions and posing little fire risk. A weak low-pressure system is now anticipated to move through Southern California starting Saturday, bringing thunderstorms, winds, and isolated showers, with the highest chances for rain over interior valleys and mountains. A larger trough is expected early next week, bringing cooler temperatures and wet conditions to northern California.</p>
