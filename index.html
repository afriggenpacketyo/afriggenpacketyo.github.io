          <p>Coinbase has emerged as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by its inclusion in the index, positive regulatory news, and new product launches. Analysts point to the passage of the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal framework for stablecoins, as a key catalyst that has negated previous negative narratives surrounding the company. The stock's strong performance is also linked to its close revenue-sharing relationship with Circle Internet Group, which has itself seen massive gains since its recent IPO. Despite concerns over declining trading volumes, the overall outlook remains optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly labeled New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a "communist" following his victory in the primary's first round. Trump's remarks reflect alarm among some business leaders over the potential for the democratic socialist's progressive policies, which include higher taxes on the wealthy and a rent freeze. Mamdani, who defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, responded by encouraging the president to learn about his actual policies aimed at making the city more affordable for its residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled to limit the use of universal injunctions, which are court orders from a single judge that can block a government policy nationwide. The decision, stemming from a challenge to a Trump administration executive order on birthright citizenship, found that such broad injunctions likely exceed the authority given to federal courts by Congress. This ruling is a significant victory for the executive branch, as it curtails a legal tool frequently used to halt presidential policies and will likely shift future legal challenges toward class-action lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Despite earlier concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet triggered a significant rise in U.S. inflation, according to economic analysis. Companies have employed several short-term tactics to mitigate the impact, including pre-ordering goods to build inventory, absorbing costs to avoid price hikes, and using trade mechanisms like foreign trade zones to delay duty payments. Economists caution, however, that these buffers may not last, and that consumers could still see higher prices in the latter half of the year.</p>

The ruling confirmed that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has direct oversight of the U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce, which makes key recommendations on treatments and screenings. This gives the current secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., significant authority, a point of concern following his recent controversial appointments to a vaccine advisory committee.</p>

America is a crucial market for Lotus, and the tariffs threaten the financial viability of its UK-based export operations.</p>

As a result, the difference in interest earned over one year is minimal, just a few dollars, making both options vastly superior to traditional savings accounts. The choice between them therefore depends more on other account features than on the potential for higher returns.</p>
