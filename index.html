          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $9 billion spending cuts package, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The vote, which occurred after midnight, was delayed for hours due to intense debate over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats sought to force a vote on releasing the documents, but Republicans advanced a non-binding resolution instead. The bill, which now heads to the president's desk, represents a legislative victory for the administration, though some senators expressed regret over potential impacts of the cuts.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Lula labeled the move "unacceptable blackmail" and an attack on Brazil's sovereignty, as the tariffs are linked to dropping legal charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro. He also criticized Brazilian politicians supporting Trump as "traitors." The diplomatic dispute intensifies as Trump voices support for Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over an alleged coup attempt.</p>

          <p>Returning to the Hollywood Bowl after a seven-year absence, Colombian artist Juanes delivered a powerful message of unity to the Latino community in Los Angeles. He referenced the fear caused by immigration raids and urged the audience to stay united now more than ever. During the concert, he performed songs from his new album, "Vida cotidiana," along with classic hits like "La camisa negra." The show featured a surprise collaboration with the local band LA LOM and concluded with a mariachi tribute to Mexican culture, honoring the city that launched his U.S. career.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province, identified only as Zhang, has captured local attention by building and successfully operating a seven-meter homemade submarine. Inspired by a television program in 2014, Zhang used 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings to buy steel plates, a battery, and an engine to secretly construct the vessel. Having managed a local dock for years, he fulfilled a lifelong dream of invention. The sleek, black submarine has been seen navigating a quiet river, astonishing local villagers with his creation.</p>

          <p>Stephen Colbert announced that CBS will be ending "The Late Show" in May, marking the conclusion of its final season. The network stated the cancellation is a financial decision, unrelated to the show's content or recent events at its parent company, Paramount Global. However, the timing has sparked skepticism, coming shortly after Colbert criticized Paramount's legal settlement with Donald Trump. Some public figures have called for more transparency, suggesting the decision might be politically motivated.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move follows increasing public pressure and a Wall Street Journal report about a letter allegedly from Trump to Epstein. While Bondi stated her readiness to file the court motion, the release of such transcripts is not guaranteed due to strict federal secrecy rules.

Economists note that while the easing is welcome, persistent inflationary pressures and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs create uncertainty for the nation's economy.

The piece highlights the timing, following a controversial settlement with Trump and the departure of the 60 Minutes chief. It argues that sacrificing a top-rated show and journalistic integrity to secure a pending media merger undermines the network's legacy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna has stated that his department is legally required to comply with federal judicial warrants from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He clarified that these warrants, signed by a judge for criminal charges, are distinct from civil detainer requests, which the department does not honor under sanctuary policies. Luna emphasized that the inmates transferred to ICE are typically sought for significant crimes. The statement comes amid community concern over federal immigration enforcement and a Justice Department request for lists of non-citizen inmates.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic analyzes President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar. The author frames the move as a political win aimed at pleasing his base and health advocates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, the piece argues that the health benefits are negligible, as both sweeteners are metabolically similar and contribute to health issues associated with high sugar consumption. The analysis suggests this focus on specific ingredients is a recurring theme for the administration, creating a sense of action without addressing larger public health problems.</p>

          <p>Dalian Polytechnic University in China has expelled a female student, accusing her of "damaging national dignity" through "improper interactions" with a foreign man. The decision has sparked widespread debate on Chinese social media, with many questioning the university's right to police her personal life and linking it to misogyny and nationalism. The incident is reportedly connected to videos posted by a Ukrainian gamer showing him with an Asian woman. The university's action highlights growing tensions in China around gender bias and nationalistic pressures.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning the current rules and that an announcement on liquid sizes could be forthcoming. This follows the recent policy change that eliminated the need for passengers to remove shoes during standard security screening. Noem envisions a future of airport security where travelers can walk through a scanner and proceed directly to their plane in under a minute.</p>

Unlike the partisan men's game, the women play on a single unified team to raise money for the Young Survival Coalition, which supports young adults with breast cancer. The event, co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz after her own diagnosis, has raised nearly $5 million over 17 years. Participants emphasized the game's importance for setting aside political divisions to support a deeply personal cause.</p>

          <p>A BBC feature details how intensified immigration raids under the Trump administration are profoundly altering life in Southern California. The relentless enforcement has instilled fear in immigrant communities, forcing many undocumented residents into hiding and causing businesses to shutter and community events to be canceled. While the administration highlights the arrest of criminals, many non-criminal immigrants have also been detained. The crackdowns have sparked a fierce backlash from activists and local officials, creating a landscape of anxiety and protest across one of the nation's most populous regions.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK, where it will be melted to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped materials like dust and volcanic ash that can reveal information about a previously unknown period of the planet's history. Scientists hope the analysis will revolutionize understanding of climate change, particularly a mysterious shift in glacial cycles that occurred over 800,000 years ago, providing context for today's rapidly changing climate.</p>
