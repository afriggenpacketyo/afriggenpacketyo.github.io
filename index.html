          <p>An investigation is underway after an explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's training facility killed three deputies. The blast occurred when a grenade, one of two recovered from a garage and believed to be inert, detonated. Authorities are now searching for the second grenade, which is missing but believed to be at the facility. The Sheriff's Department has since revised its protocols, vowing to treat all explosive devices as live to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen have formally requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a complete copy of a "birthday book" compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell. The book reportedly contains messages from numerous powerful figures, including a crude poem allegedly written by Donald Trump, who has denied its existence and is suing over the reports. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight regarding the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>While visiting Scotland, President Donald Trump addressed the ongoing controversy surrounding his connections to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. He dismissed the issue as "not a big thing" and denied any knowledge of conversations between Maxwell and the Justice Department. When asked about a potential pardon for Maxwell, Trump stated it was not the appropriate time to discuss such matters, attempting to shift focus away from the persistent questions about his past association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>A family has filed a lawsuit against two funeral homes after they allegedly received their deceased son's brain in an unmarked, leaking cardboard box. The parents discovered the horrific situation when a foul odor emanated from their car, and the father's hands were covered in brain matter upon moving the box. The lawsuit accuses the funeral homes of negligence and inflicting severe emotional distress, as the family still does not know if their son's brain was ultimately buried with his remains.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi for one game. The suspension was enforced because Messi, along with teammate Jordi Alba, did not participate in the MLS All-Star Game, citing a need for rest. Mas called the punishment "draconian," arguing the league doesn't understand why skipping an exhibition match warrants a suspension. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision but stood by the league's long-standing policy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a significant increase in the populations of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The boom is partly attributed to a surge in aphids, a key food source, which thrived in the warm conditions. However, experts warn that the concurrent lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year, as wetland habitats are drying up, potentially preventing eggs from being laid and surviving.</p>

          <p>As Palestinians in Gaza face a severe starvation crisis, an analysis of the food aid boxes distributed by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns. The boxes primarily contain dried goods like pasta and lentils, which require scarce water and fuel to prepare. Nutrition experts who examined the contents for BBC Verify noted serious deficiencies in key vitamins and minerals. They described the aid as a "first aid" basket that provides calories to prevent acute hunger but could lead to 'hidden hunger' and disease over time.</p>

At President Trump's urging, Texas is considering redrawing its congressional maps to favor the GOP. In response, Newsom is exploring options to counteract this by potentially redrawing California's own maps to favor Democrats, a move that would depart from the state's nonpartisan redistricting process established over the last decade.</p>

          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing a surge in demand that is outstripping global supplies. Driven by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, the demand has been met with smaller crop yields due to heatwaves and a shortage of farmers. This imbalance has led to significant price increases and retailers limiting customer purchases. The situation is further complicated by new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods, which are expected to push prices even higher.</p>
