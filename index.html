        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the reasons behind the apparent rise in autism diagnoses, exploring whether there are genuinely more autistic individuals or if changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness are the primary drivers. The piece highlights that the definition of autism has broadened over time, encompassing a wider range of individuals, including women and adults who were previously undiagnosed. It also addresses concerns about the potential for glamorizing autism in the media while acknowledging the challenges faced by families with non-speaking autistic children, noting the diversity within the autistic community and the tensions surrounding its definition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning significant staff cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), aiming to reduce staffing to levels seen during the Reagan administration, particularly impacting the Office of Research and Development (ORD). This reorganization involves moving some scientific staff into policy-making offices and creating new offices, raising concerns about the EPA's ability to conduct independent scientific assessments of environmental risks. Experts worry that these changes could lead to major cuts in research and undermine the agency's ability to protect Americans from pollution, despite claims that the changes will save money and make the EPA more efficient.</p>

          <p>This article reports on allegations that Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, has been exerting influence over his career decisions. She reportedly "forced her way" into a Dunkin' Super Bowl commercial and demanded to be an executive producer on HBO's "Hard Knocks" when Belichick was being considered as head coach of UNC. Hudson allegedly asked NFL Films for "dailies of the proposed show" and said executives needed to "treat her with respect or they wouldnâ€™t get to use the coachâ€™s â€˜IP.â€™" The report suggests Hudson's involvement extends to communications with UNC staff.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will reduce its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights daily, citing air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the disruptions to a lack of air traffic controllers and recent technology failures, stating that Newark airport cannot handle its scheduled operations. The FAA acknowledged staffing issues were delaying operations, and the airline is urging the agency to establish flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. The Transportation Secretary called for an "all-new air traffic control system."</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst global economic challenges, with the People's Action Party (P.A.P.) widely expected to maintain its long-standing rule.

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antibodies have shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. Current antivenoms are specific to individual snake species, but Friede's mission could lead to a universal antivenom. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target neurotoxins and combined them with a drug, resulting in an antivenom cocktail that protected mice against multiple venomous snakes.</p>
