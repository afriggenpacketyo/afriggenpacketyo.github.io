            <p>The United States and Iran held indirect negotiations in Oman this week to discuss Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, marking the first round of talks since President Trump returned to the White House. The discussions, mediated by Omani officials, focused on safeguarding Iran's national interests and potentially lifting sanctions. While both sides presented their foundational positions, Trump administration officials emphasized the need for Iran to dismantle its nuclear program and prevent weaponization, while Iran seeks sanctions relief. The negotiations are considered a starting point, with the possibility of future talks contingent on sufficient will from both sides.</p>

            <p>The UK government has intervened to take control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, after the Chinese-owned company, Jingye, threatened closure due to substantial daily losses. Emergency legislation was passed to ensure the plant's two blast furnaces continue operating, securing the UK's ability to produce virgin steel, essential for major construction projects. Jingye still owns the site, but the business secretary now has sweeping powers to control management and workers to make sure production continues. The government hopes to find a private investor to save the plant, acknowledging that nationalization is a likely option.</p>

            <p>Big tech companies have received a significant reprieve from the ongoing trade war, as President Trump has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from tariffs imposed on imports from China. Experts had warned that tariffs would lead to a spike in consumer prices, but this move is expected to benefit tech investors and countries in Southeast Asia that rely on tech exports.

The NTSB is investigating the cause of the crash, focusing on the recovery of the main rotor, main gear box, and tail rotor, which could provide crucial clues. Preliminary investigations suggest a rotor may have broken off, leading to the crash, but authorities are also considering other factors like bird strikes or mechanical failure.

            <p>Once a symbol of prosperity, the Indian pot belly is now recognized as a significant health risk, with India facing a ballooning obesity crisis. A Lancet study projects that 450 million Indians could be overweight or obese by 2050, with abdominal obesity being a key concern. This accumulation of excess fat around the belly is linked to chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, and studies show that South Asians tend to have more body fat than Caucasians at the same BMI. Doctors are redefining obesity guidelines to better reflect how body fat relates to early health risks, emphasizing lifestyle changes and intensive management for those with abdominal obesity.</p>

            <p>Weezer performed at Coachella following an incident involving bassist Scott Shriner's wife, Jillian, who was shot by police after being found with a handgun in Los Angeles. The band's set was packed with oldies and covers, and frontman Rivers Cuomo put his arm around Scott Shriner as the latter sang a falsetto vocal line. No one onstage said anything about the incident with the bassist’s wife. The performance served as a welcome break from the band's work in L.A. on a Weezer movie.</p>

            <p>Emergency legislation was rushed through UK Parliament to allow the government to take control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, averting a potential closure. Government officials waited for Royal Assent to implement the law, driven by concerns that the Chinese-owned company, Jingye, was seeking to sell raw materials en route to the plant. The intervention aims to secure the necessary materials to keep the blast furnaces running, but nationalization remains a likely option, and challenges persist in navigating complex international supply chains.</p>

The American maverick, who beat McIlroy to last year's US Open title in a dramatic finish, set up a tantalising Masters Sunday with a three-under 69 to close on 10 under.</p>

            <p>A new study indicates that over three million children died in 2022 due to infections resistant to antibiotics, with children in Africa and South East Asia being most at risk. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) develops when microbes evolve to resist antibiotic drugs, posing a significant public health threat. The study highlights a tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years, potentially worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased use of "watch antibiotics" and "reserve antibiotics" raises concerns about dwindling treatment options for multidrug-resistant infections.</p>

While Trump boasts of his deal-making prowess, critics point to his past business failures and the economic damage caused by his tariff policies. To succeed in negotiations, it's crucial to ensure there is a personal "upside" for Trump, whether through financial incentives or excessive praise. This approach acknowledges that normal rules of statecraft and probity do not apply, and the focus is on securing a deal that benefits him personally. (not investment advice)</p>
