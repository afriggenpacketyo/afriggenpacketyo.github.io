          <h2>Appeals Court Sides with Trump Administration on California National Guard Control</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump likely acted within his authority when federalizing the California National Guard amidst immigration raid protests, indefinitely blocking a lower court order that would have returned control to Governor Newsom. The three-judge panel cited acts of violence during the protests as justification for Trump's decision, stating that protesters had engaged in violent acts against federal officers and damaged federal buildings. The court determined that the law invoked by Trump does not require the governor's consent, effectively allowing the Trump administration to maintain control of the guard as the case proceeds through the courts. This ruling puts a hold on a previous order by a lower court judge who deemed Trump's action illegal. </p>

Coach Mauricio Pochettino maintained the same lineup from their previous win, but the match against Saudi Arabia saw fewer scoring opportunities for the Americans.

He is currently fighting to get his job back, emphasizing his past performance and desire to continue serving as a trooper.

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged following recent monetary easing measures and a trade deal with the U.S., easing some growth concerns. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) remains at 3.0%, and the 5-year LPR is at 3.5%, aligning with Reuters poll estimates. This decision comes after authorities cut lending rates last month for the first time since October, aiming to mitigate the impact of trade tensions. A trade truce between the U.S. and China has provided some economic breathing room, allowing Beijing to support its currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the Trump administration can maintain control of National Guard troops in Los Angeles while California's legal challenge proceeds. The court found that the president has broad authority to deploy the military in American cities, although this power is not "unreviewable." Legal scholars noted that the decision was expected, particularly given the shift in the 9th Circuit's ideological balance. The ruling largely avoids the question of whether the situation in Los Angeles constitutes a "rebellion," focusing instead on the limits of presidential power. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized "ongoing efforts to erase history" during a Juneteenth Celebration Service at a historic African Methodist Episcopal Church in Galveston, Texas. He also appeared to take a veiled shot at his successor, President Trump, referencing attempts to rename military bases named after Confederate officers. Biden recounted his role in making Juneteenth a federal holiday, emphasizing its monumental importance to America's story. Several speakers recognized Biden during the service, with Galveston Mayor Craig Brown presenting him with a plaque for his role in establishing Juneteenth as a national holiday. </p>

          <p>Federal authorities have uncovered and shut down a half-mile-long tunnel connecting a home in Tijuana to a commercial warehouse in San Diego County. The tunnel, equipped with electrical wiring, lighting, ventilation, and a track system, was believed to be used for large-scale contraband transportation. U.S. and Mexican authorities collaborated to shut down the construction site, with Mexican authorities seizing a package containing methamphetamine inside the tunnel. The tunnel ran underneath the Otay Mesa border point and was discovered by Border Patrol agents from San Diego’s Tunnel Team. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold billions of dollars in transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, citing "large-scale irreparable harm" without the injunction. The ruling blocks the Department of Transportation from imposing conditions on funding that require adherence to an Immigration Enforcement Condition. The judge agreed with the states that there is no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation. </p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, with a spike of 101.7% year-over-year. This surge follows a 98.4% increase in April and a 92.1% rise in March, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles. Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, its highest level since January 2023, driven by rising food costs. Rice accounts for approximately 50% of Japan's core inflation, with future inflation trends heavily reliant on food prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers said they denied US immigration enforcement agents access to the parking lot at Dodger Stadium, while ICE denied ever being there. The homeland security presence came as immigrant communities in LA are on high alert. A source told the Los Angeles Times that federal agents met near the stadium for a briefing but departed when photos of their meeting started to spread on social media. Protesters arrived at Dodger Stadium soon after, and a city council member said she had been in communication with Dodgers officials and the mayor’s office. </p>
