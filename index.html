          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to nominate Sergio Gor, a close aide and director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, as the next U.S. ambassador to India. Gor will also serve as a special envoy for South and Central Asian affairs. The nomination comes at a time of strained relations between the two countries, largely due to trade disputes and planned U.S. tariff increases on Indian goods. Trump expressed his full trust in Gor to represent his agenda in the region, while Vice President JD Vance also praised the appointment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Photos of deer with large, bulbous warts are circulating online, following similar sightings of growths on rabbits and squirrels. Experts identify the condition as cutaneous fibromas, caused by a host-specific papillomavirus. These tumors are generally harmless to the deer unless they obstruct vision or eating, and there is no effective treatment for the animals in the wild. The virus is often spread by insect bites or direct contact, and health officials note that the meat from affected deer is still safe for consumption as the fibromas are only skin-deep.</p>

          <p>A tragic tour bus crash in upstate New York has resulted in the deaths of five people, including one child, with over 40 others injured. The bus, returning from Niagara Falls with 51 passengers, reportedly lost control and rolled over on Interstate 90 near Buffalo. According to law enforcement, many passengers were not wearing seatbelts, leading to multiple ejections from the vehicle during the crash. The driver survived the incident, and an investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the accident, which prompted a major emergency response and highway shutdown.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts continue to view NVIDIA as a top investment for exposure to the artificial intelligence sector, with some raising their price targets significantly. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter increased the target to $235, citing the company's strong fundamentals and a smooth transition to its new Blackwell-series chips. The analysis suggests NVIDIA is well-positioned to exceed high market expectations and currently trades at a discount compared to competitors like Broadcom. This sentiment reinforces the view that NVIDIA offers the most direct and promising way to invest in the burgeoning AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported in March and later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee. A federal judge had previously blocked immigration authorities from detaining him upon release, ordering his return to his family in Maryland under supervision. Abrego Garcia expressed gratitude for his release after more than 160 days, though his legal team notes he is "far from safe" as deportation threats remain. His release conditions include supervision, employment, and no contact with known MS-13 gang members.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-based dating advice app called Tea, designed to help women vet potential partners, has experienced a significant data hack, leaking over 70,000 images, including user IDs and selfies used for verification. The leaked data was posted on 4chan and used to create online maps pinpointing the exact home addresses of approximately 33,000 users, causing widespread fear among women who had joined the app for safety. Google has since removed the maps for violating its harassment policies, and more than 10 women have filed class-action lawsuits against the app's parent company.</p>

          <p>The Texas legislature has given preliminary approval to a new congressional map that could add up to five Republican seats, a move initiated after a request from Donald Trump. The map passed the state senate on a party-line vote, though a Democratic state senator has threatened a filibuster to delay its final passage. Democrats have raised concerns that the new districts intentionally diminish the influence of minority voters, but Republicans maintain that the map was drawn based on political performance data, not race. The redistricting effort is expected to face immediate legal challenges under the Voting Rights Act.</p>

          <p>India's Election Commission (ECI) is confronting a serious challenge to its credibility amid allegations from opposition parties of voter manipulation and inconsistencies in electoral rolls. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has accused the ECI of colluding with the ruling BJP party, citing data that allegedly shows over 100,000 fake voters in one constituency. The controversy has intensified following a voter list revision in Bihar that removed 6.5 million names, a process critics say may have disenfranchised many.

The case centered on the company's controversial rule requiring payment within five minutes of entering a car park, a policy that has since been banned. Hannah Robinson was targeted with demands totaling over £11,000 for repeatedly failing to pay within the short timeframe. A judge dismissed Excel's claim, calling its conduct unreasonable and ordering it to pay legal costs, which were directed to charity as Robinson had pro bono representation.</p>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates an emerging political divergence among young people, with young women leaning more to the left and young men more to the right. A 2025 survey found that 20% of young British women identify as left-wing compared to 13% of young men. At the 2024 general election, women aged 18-24 were significantly more likely to vote for Labour or the Green Party, while young men showed more support for the Conservatives and Reform UK. Researchers suggest factors like higher university attendance among women and the influence of social media may be contributing to this growing gender-generation gap.</p>

Both efforts follow a Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the constitutionality of penalizing people for sleeping in public spaces. In San Francisco, the policy has led to a visible reduction in tent encampments and a sharp increase in arrests, but the overall number of people experiencing homelessness has continued to rise.

          <p>A growing number of musicians are discovering that AI-generated albums and songs are being fraudulently released on streaming services like Spotify under their official artist profiles. Folk singer Emily Portman found a fake album titled "Orca" on her page, with music trained to mimic her style, which had fooled some of her fans. This trend of releasing "AI slop" appears to target established but non-superstar artists who may have less power to get the content removed quickly. The incidents highlight a new form of digital identity theft and raise questions about the safeguards on music distribution platforms.</p>

          <p>West Ham manager Graham Potter is under increasing pressure following a dismal start to the season, culminating in a 5-1 home defeat to Chelsea. This loss followed a 3-0 defeat in their opener, meaning the team has conceded eight goals in its first two matches for the first time in its top-flight history. Potter has won just five of his 21 games since taking charge in January, and fans expressed their frustration with boos at the final whistle. With a difficult run of fixtures ahead, concerns are growing about the team's defensive vulnerabilities and overall performance.</p>

          <p>The price of Ether (ETH) reached a new record for the first time since 2021, driven by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that hinted at potential interest rate cuts. During his annual address, Powell noted that the restrictive policy stance might soon need adjustment, which traders interpreted as a dovish signal. The remarks triggered a market repositioning, with about $120 million in short positions on ETH being liquidated in a single hour, further fueling the price increase. The rally reflects renewed momentum in the crypto market as investors anticipate a more favorable monetary policy environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cafes in South Korea are navigating the cultural phenomenon of "Cagongjok," a term for people who occupy tables for long hours to study or work, often with elaborate electronic setups. The issue has become so prevalent that Starbucks Korea recently issued nationwide guidelines to curb extreme cases, such as customers bringing desktop monitors or leaving seats unattended for long stretches. While some independent cafe owners have implemented study time limits or blocked power outlets, others cater to the trend. Experts view the phenomenon as a product of South Korea's hyper-competitive society and a lack of adequate public study spaces.</p>
