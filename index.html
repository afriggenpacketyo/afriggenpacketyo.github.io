          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 13:34:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Education is restarting collections on defaulted student loans, ending a nearly five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent analysis indicates that student loan delinquency rates are at an all-time high, with approximately 20% of borrowers at risk of defaulting. Defaulting on student loans can lead to wage garnishment, withholding of Social Security benefits and tax refunds, and a significant drop in credit scores. Experts suggest prioritizing income-driven repayment plans and improving outreach to borrowers to minimize defaults. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on foreign films has sparked debate about its potential impact on the U.S. and global film industries. Questions remain about whether the tariffs would apply to American film companies producing films abroad, streaming content, and how they would be calculated. Other countries, including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, have voiced concerns about the potential impact on their film industries. The proposal has raised concerns about the future of international film collaborations and the competitiveness of the U.S. film industry.</p>

          <p>Film tariffs are set to form part of trade negotiations between the UK and US after Donald Trump threatened to apply a 100% charge against movies made in foreign countries. Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying "a very fast death". UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being "jobless" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a "knock-out blow".</p>

          <p>Survivors of a plane crash in Bolivia recounted their harrowing 36-hour ordeal in a swamp infested with alligators and anacondas. The plane crashed into a lagoon, leaving the pilot and four passengers clinging to the wreckage. They survived by eating cassava flour and were eventually rescued by fishermen. The pilot speculated that the stench of jet fuel kept the predatory reptiles at bay.</p>
