          <p>Alex Cooper, host of the "Call Her Daddy" podcast, has accused her former Boston University soccer coach, Nancy Feldman, of sexual harassment in her upcoming Hulu documentary, "Call Her Alex". Cooper alleges that the harassment began during her sophomore year, with Feldman focusing on her personal life, asking about her sex life, and touching her leg. Cooper stated that she tried to avoid Feldman, which resulted in reduced playing time. Feldman retired from coaching in 2022, and Cooper claims that university officials dismissed her concerns, with lawyers warning that litigation could be lengthy.

          <p>As protests continue in Los Angeles, the Marines and National Guard personnel deployed will operate under specific rules of force, primarily tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel, not patrolling streets or detaining protesters. Their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition unless needed for self-defense, and they are instructed to de-escalate situations. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell stressed the need for clear communication between agencies to prevent confusion and ensure a coordinated response. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds highlighted the importance of clarifying the rules of engagement, particularly regarding the use of deadly force. The deployment includes 2,800 troops operating under Title 10 status, trained in de-escalation and crowd control, with the rules subject to change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act. The focus remains on maintaining safety and order while respecting the rights of protesters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for the authority to deport immigrants to countries where they may face torture, even if an immigration judge has previously ruled against deportation to those countries. Trump's lawyers argue that if a country provides diplomatic assurances that the deported individuals will not be persecuted or tortured, the administration can deport them without further procedures. This move aims to bypass federal laws and regulations implementing the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits deporting individuals to countries where they risk torture. Critics argue that this undermines due process and violates international human rights obligations. The Supreme Court's decision could significantly impact the rights of immigrants facing deportation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have led to a surge in business for The Rodon Group, a Pennsylvania-based plastics injection molding company that manufactures toys like K'nex. The company has seen demand increase by nearly 50% due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, prompting consumers to seek domestic suppliers. While a U.S.-China agreement reduced tariffs, uncertainty persists due to ongoing trade tensions and legal challenges to Trump's tariffs. The Rodon Group has invested in automation to remain competitive and keep production in the United States, emphasizing the importance of STEM education and workforce development.

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, accusing them of civil extortion and defamation. The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's complaint alleging sexual harassment and retaliation by Baldoni during the production of "It Ends With Us," accusations Baldoni denies. A separate defamation lawsuit Baldoni filed against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, while representatives for Baldoni did not immediately comment, although Baldoni and his production company have the opportunity to amend some of the claims by June 23. The legal battle highlights the complexities of workplace dynamics and the potential for conflicts during film productions.</p>

Critics, including major health advocacy organizations, have condemned the decision, warning it undermines a trusted source of guidance on vaccines and could fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses. Kennedy had previously pledged not to alter ACIP, leading to concerns that the new committee will be filled with individuals who are skeptical of vaccines.

          <p>The article draws parallels between President Trump's federalization of the California National Guard and President Lyndon B. Johnson's similar action in 1965 during the civil rights movement. Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard to protect marchers from Selma to Montgomery after Governor George Wallace refused to provide adequate protection. Similarly, Trump's move to federalize the California National Guard, against the wishes of Governor Gavin Newsom, has sparked controversy. The article also references Eisenhower's federalization of the Arkansas National Guard in 1957 to enforce desegregation, highlighting the historical context of presidential authority over state National Guard forces. The comparison underscores the complex relationship between federal and state powers during times of civil unrest.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to send the National Guard to Los Angeles amid protests against immigration enforcement operations is contrasted with historical presidential responses to civil unrest. Unlike President George H.W. Bush, who sought to address underlying issues during the Rodney King riots, Trump is criticized for inflaming the situation. The article argues that Trump's actions reflect a pattern of division and aggression, using the military to target a Democratic state and undermine its governor. The author suggests that Trump's approach prioritizes his political agenda over the traditional presidential role of calming tensions and ensuring domestic tranquility, raising concerns about the potential for increased violence and the erosion of civil liberties. The president's approach to the situation has been described as pouring gasoline on a fire.</p>

Trump has stated that Los Angeles would be "completely obliterated" without his deployment of the Guard, while the White House has indicated that active duty forces could be used to support federal functions.

          <p>Fifty trucks will spend five months transporting debris from the Lahaina wildfire to a landfill in central Maui, beginning next Monday. The debris, enough to fill five football fields five stories high, is the result of the deadliest U.S. wildfire in over a century, which killed 102 people about two years ago. The trucks will make multiple trips daily, following a route that includes a winding coastal highway and former sugar cane plantation roads to minimize traffic disruption. Maui County has evaluated the debris with the EPA and the Hawaii Department of Health, determining that transporting and storing it at the landfill poses no public health risk, with measures in place to control dust and contain the debris. The effort aims to address concerns from Olowalu residents about the debris remaining in their community permanently.</p>
