        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has raised concerns about the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA), warning that it needs reform. The product, designed for first-home buyers or retirement savings, offers a 25% government bonus but imposes a significant penalty for early withdrawals, which can result in savers receiving less than they initially invested. The committee noted a surge in penalty-bearing withdrawals, suggesting the product may not be working as intended for many. They also criticized the LISA's complex dual purpose and "nonsensical" rules that can negatively affect eligibility for certain government benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has disclosed that the Sinaloa cartel employed a hacker in 2018 to infiltrate Mexico City's surveillance cameras and access phone data. This surveillance was used to track, intimidate, and in some cases, kill potential FBI informants and cooperating witnesses. An inspector general's audit revealed the hacker monitored individuals at the U.S. Embassy, including an FBI official, to identify their contacts for the cartel. The report highlights the growing challenge law enforcement faces from advanced technology being used by sophisticated criminal and terrorist organizations.</p>

The minister reiterated that Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and insisted on its right to enrich uranium, calling a "zero enrichment" demand the "law of the jungle."

          <p>UEFA has delayed its decision on whether Crystal Palace can compete in the next Europa League season, a spot the club earned by winning the FA Cup. The issue stems from multi-club ownership rules, as co-owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified for the competition. The situation is complicated by Lyon's recent demotion to Ligue 2 by French football authorities due to financial issues, a decision the club is appealing. UEFA will wait for the outcome of Lyon's appeal before ruling, leaving Crystal Palace's European fate in limbo.</p>

Sun Belt cities like Phoenix, Miami, and Atlanta, traditionally seen as affordable alternatives, have seen home prices rise even more sharply than in New York or San Francisco over the past decade. The article posits that this is because these cities are now facing the same limits to sprawl and rising NIMBYism that previously afflicted coastal areas. As these cities become more affluent, residents are increasingly using restrictive zoning laws to block new development, threatening to make the housing shortage a truly national crisis.

          <p>An article explores the work of Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, delving into how dogs experience the world primarily through their sense of smell. Horowitz argues that to understand dogs, humans must try to appreciate this olfactory perspective, which is fundamentally different from our visual-centric world. She explains that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are units of information that create a transient, ever-changing map of their environment. This difference in perception also shapes their experience of time, as the fading scent of a person can signify their absence.</p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that the global decline in fertility rates is far more severe and rapid than United Nations projections indicate, meaning the world population could start shrinking much sooner than the currently estimated year of 2084. Researcher JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde points to plummeting birth rates in middle-income countries like Colombia and Chile, which are falling far below the UN's most pessimistic forecasts. The article argues the UN's models are overly optimistic, often assuming that fertility rates will either stabilize or rebound. If current trends continue, the world is already below replacement-level fertility, posing significant economic challenges globally.</p>

          <p>In a sports column, Bill Plaschke laments the current state of the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, framing their struggles as the "Candace Curse." The critique came on the day the team retired the jersey of superstar Candace Parker, whose departure in 2020 coincided with the franchise's decline. The Sparks lost to the Chicago Sky during the celebratory game, a result the columnist sees as emblematic of the team's lack of talent, direction, and championship hopes since Parker left. The article argues that poor management allowed a franchise cornerstone to leave, leading to their current funk.</p>

          <p>Two High Court judges in the United Kingdom have dismissed a legal challenge brought by human rights groups against the government's continued supply of military equipment to Israel. The groups, including the Palestinian organization Al-Haq, argued that providing parts for F-35 fighter jets made the UK complicit in alleged atrocities in Gaza. However, the court ruled that the issue was a matter of national security and foreign policy, which falls under the purview of the executive branch, not the judiciary. The judges stated it was not their place to force the UK to withdraw from the international F-35 collaboration.</p>

          <p>An analysis of projects in Cuba suggests that China is quietly becoming the island nation's most important foreign partner, supplanting its historical ally, Russia. While many of Russia's recent promises for investment in areas like steel and sugar mills have not materialized, China has been pushing ahead with critical infrastructure projects. This includes financing and building dozens of solar parks across the country, which are vital for stabilizing Cuba's collapsed electrical grid. This shift in influence comes as Cuba faces a devastating economic crisis, making China's tangible support a crucial lifeline for the country's struggling economy.</p>

          <p>In a commentary, Robert Reich warns that the technology company Palantir, co-founded by Peter Thiel, poses a significant danger to American democracy. He argues that Palantir's AI-powered platform, chosen by the Trump administration to create a super-database combining personal data from numerous federal agencies, could be used to surveil and punish political opponents. Reich connects Thiel, Elon Musk, and other "tech bro" figures to an anti-democratic movement aiming to consolidate power.

The piece examines the science behind insomnia, the pros and cons of treatments like CBT-I and medication, and questions the dogma of needing exactly eight hours of sleep.

          <p>An article argues that the modern obsession with tracking and achieving high daily step counts is transforming the simple, leisurely act of walking into a source of compulsion and anxiety. While walking is a healthy activity, the cultural pressure to hit arbitrary targets like 10,000 or 20,000 steps, fueled by social media influencers and tracking apps, can become counterproductive. This quantification of movement often leads people to enjoy the activity less and can create a cycle of shame and stress if daily goals are not met. The author suggests this trend is part of a broader, productivity-obsessed culture that medicalizes and optimizes every aspect of life.</p>

          <h2>New US-UK Trade Deal Reduces Tariffs on British Cars, But Steel Levies Remain Unresolved</h2>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has gone into effect, providing a preferential tariff rate for British cars imported into America. The first 100,000 vehicles annually will face a 10% tariff, a significant reduction that has been welcomed by the UK auto industry. However, questions remain over the final levies on British steel and aluminum exports, which are currently set at a 25% tariff. While the UK government aims for 0% tariffs on steel, negotiations are complicated by the U.S. "melt and pour" rule, which affects major producers like Tata Steel. (not investment advice)</p>
