          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has expressed strong confidence that star pass rusher Micah Parsons will participate in the upcoming season opener, despite an ongoing and public contract standoff. Parsons has notably skipped team practices throughout the summer, operating as a training camp hold-in while awaiting a new long-term deal. While Prescott remains optimistic, drawing on his own past lengthy negotiations, teammate Trevon Diggs appeared less certain, emphasizing the collective desire for Parsons to return. This internal team dynamic, centered on a high-profile contract dispute, adds a layer of intrigue to the Cowboys' preparations for the 2025 NFL season.</p>

          <p>Microsoft requested police intervention to remove activists and employees who stormed a building at its Redmond headquarters, protesting the company's alleged work with the Israeli military. The group, 'No Azure for Apartheid,' delivered a court summons to President Brad Smith's office, leading to seven arrests, including two current Microsoft employees. Smith condemned the actions, stating that occupying offices and planting listening devices were unacceptable, while activists demanded Microsoft sever ties with Israel amid claims its Azure software is used for surveillance in Gaza. The company has launched an independent investigation into the use of its technology, acknowledging deep concerns.</p>

          <p>Civil rights advocates, led by the NAACP and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, have filed a lawsuit challenging Texas's newly approved congressional redistricting map. They allege the map is racially biased and constitutes gerrymandering designed to dilute the electoral influence of Black voters, claiming white voters control a disproportionate share of seats despite being a minority. The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the use of these maps, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. This legal battle intensifies the ongoing debate over fair representation and political power in Texas.</p>

          <p>The Trump Justice Department is investigating whether former senior FBI officials mishandled classified documents related to the bureau's 2016 Russia election interference probe, 'Crossfire Hurricane.' This inquiry follows the discovery of thousands of Russia-related documents in 'burn bags' at FBI headquarters, which Director Kash Patel publicized on social media. President Trump has long criticized the investigation as a 'hoax' and 'witch hunt,' with top administration officials questioning Obama-era intelligence leaders' actions. The probe highlights ongoing political tensions and deep partisan divisions surrounding the origins and conduct of the initial Russia investigation, though no criminal charges have yet been filed.</p>

          <p>The small West Tennessee town of Mason is deeply divided over the planned reopening of a shuttered private prison as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center. While Mayor Eddie Noeman supports the project, citing the promise of over 200 new jobs and increased revenue for the financially struggling town, Alderwoman Virginia Rivers and other residents oppose it due to ethical concerns about the mistreatment of detainees in for-profit prisons. The facility, owned by CoreCivic, closed in 2021 under a Biden executive order, but President Trump's reversal allowed its reconsideration. This situation highlights the complex intersection of local economic needs, immigration policy, and humanitarian concerns, with CoreCivic's safety record also under scrutiny.</p>

The brief rebrand, which removed the familiar overall-clad man and 'Old Country Store' text, was part of a broader effort to modernize the chain and attract new generations of customers.

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn an additional $175 million in funding for California's high-speed rail project, marking another significant setback for the state's ambitious and long-delayed initiative. This latest cut follows an earlier cancellation of $4 billion in federal grants, which California is actively challenging in court, calling the decision illegal and politically motivated. The project, initially envisioned to link Los Angeles and San Francisco, has faced substantial cost overruns, with projected expenses now ranging from $89 billion to $128 billion, and a completion date still years away. This action further intensifies the ongoing political clashes between the Trump administration and California Governor Gavin Newsom over state infrastructure and federal funding.</p>

          <p>Kroger, the prominent grocery giant, is laying off nearly 1,000 corporate employees as it undergoes a significant business restructuring aimed at trimming costs and simplifying its operational model. This move follows the failed $24.6 billion merger with Albertsons last year, which was blocked by federal regulators over concerns it would stifle competition and raise consumer prices. The company has faced additional headwinds in recent months, including the abrupt departure of its former chairman and CEO, Rodney McMullen, and ongoing employee strike authorizations over labor practices. Despite these challenges, experts believe Kroger remains viable, having grown its e-commerce business and showing investor confidence with rising share prices.</p>

Major export sectors such as engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics are highly exposed to these new levies.

          <p>A funeral director in Leeds, Amie Upton, has been banned from NHS maternity wards and mortuaries after a BBC investigation revealed she kept deceased babies' bodies at her home, sparking widespread anger. One grieving mother was horrified to discover her deceased son in a baby bouncer 'watching cartoons' in Upton's living room, while another family alleged their stillborn daughter was moved without consent and not properly refrigerated. The distressing incidents highlight the alarming lack of regulation in England and Wales's funeral industry, where no legal requirements exist for body storage or qualifications for directors. Despite police investigations finding no potential crimes, the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust implemented a ban and raised concerns with various authorities, underscoring profound ethical and emotional breaches.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Skeptical Tariffs Will Revive US Furniture Manufacturing</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has expressed strong skepticism that President Trump's proposed tariffs on furniture imports will effectively revive U.S. domestic manufacturing. Cramer argued that the American furniture industry has largely shifted its production overseas due to decades of favoring cheaper import supply chains, and the skilled workforce has either moved on to other industries or retired. He predicted that higher tariffs would primarily lead to price increases for consumers rather than a significant resurgence of local production. While some domestic manufacturers, like Ethan Allen (which produces 75% of its goods domestically), might see a temporary advantage, Cramer questioned the long-term effectiveness and national security relevance of such trade policies for furniture.

          <p>This satirical article humorously posits that a Melania Trump magazine cover might be the ultimate key to appeasing Donald Trump's deep-seated need for cultural validation and recognition, potentially averting hypothetical future political chaos. A time-traveling 'vortex' character desperately attempts to influence past media and award decisions, from Oscars to Saturday Night Live appearances and Kennedy Center Honors, all to make Trump feel 'peace' and appreciated. The piece critiques Trump's perceived obsession with external validation and explores the absurd lengths to which a hypothetical future might go to satisfy his ego, highlighting the superficiality of such desires in the face of significant political events. The narrative playfully questions the impact of minor cultural moments on major historical trajectories.</p>

Analysts predict a slight increase of approximately 1% annually for both gas and electricity between October and December, impacting an estimated 21 million households across England, Scotland, and Wales. Despite government support measures, including an expanded £150 Warm Home Discount, campaigners warn that many families are still struggling with existing energy debt accumulated during a period of high prices.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage applications, a move Cook vehemently denies and plans to challenge legally. This controversial decision escalates Trump's ongoing pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve for lower interest rates, raising significant concerns about the central bank's historical political independence. While global markets initially remained stable, the situation highlights potential long-term ramifications for U.S. economic policy and the composition of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). A potential Supreme Court battle looms over the president's authority to remove a Fed governor 'for cause,' further adding to political and financial uncertainty.</p>

          <p>This analytical article explores how Donald Trump's consistent and prolific use of falsehoods could ultimately undermine his own credibility and the functioning of the government he leads. Citing recent events like the FBI raid on John Bolton's home and the firing of Lisa Cook, the article suggests that such actions, when framed with questionable claims, contribute to a 'fire hose of falsehoods' that breeds public nihilism rather than belief. This erosion of trust, the article argues, could severely hinder the government's ability to operate effectively, impacting critical functions from law enforcement and public safety warnings to international diplomacy. Ultimately, the piece contends that this chronic dishonesty could prove detrimental to the very system Trump seeks to control, as people simply cease to believe anything he says.</p>

His legal team contends he is newly eligible for asylum due to his recent re-entry into the U.S. and the significant risks in the proposed removal countries.

Professor Yang Jingyuan and his team implemented comprehensive strategies, including logging and hunting bans, educating local farmers to become forest protectors, and a year-long process to habituate a monkey group to human presence for scientific study. This ecological turnaround, which saw bare hills transformed into 96% forest cover, demonstrates the profound success of long-term preservation initiatives. The park now balances conservation with responsible tourism, aiming for a population exceeding 2,000 within the next decade, offering a hopeful outlook for this endangered species.</p>
