          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal is churning off the southeastern U.S. coast, prompting the extension of tropical storm warnings up to Surf City, North Carolina. With maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, the storm is expected to make landfall before sunrise on Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, and dangerous surf conditions. As the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Chantal is forecast to produce 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, across the coastal Carolinas.</p>

          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, has claimed his former lover, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker asserted that Monica, the victim's wife, had no knowledge of the murder plot, a statement that could be a bombshell in her upcoming trial. Despite evidence of their affair and communications, Baker was resolute that he acted alone, a claim Monica's defense attorneys hope will establish her innocence.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Monica Sementilli guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2017 death of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued that she and her lover, Robert Baker, plotted the murder for financial gain, staging the crime scene to look like a robbery gone wrong. While the defense maintained she was only guilty of having an affair, key evidence, including her suspicious actions on the day of the murder, led to her conviction and a life sentence.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have demonstrated that genetics play a crucial role in shaping brain criticality, the delicate balance between neural excitation and inhibition that is vital for information processing. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, establishes a link between this brain state and cognitive abilities. These findings suggest brain criticality is a biological phenotype, creating new avenues for understanding brain function and potential dysfunctions in the future.</p>

          <p>In a significant development, a judge dismissed murder charges against Barry Morphew just nine days before his trial for the 2020 disappearance of his wife, Suzanne. Prosecutors filed the motion, stating they needed more time to locate Suzanne's body and were hampered by court sanctions that excluded key expert witnesses due to discovery violations. The dismissal was without prejudice, meaning charges could be refiled if new evidence, such as the discovery of her body, were to emerge in the future.</p>

          <p>Australian police have arrested and charged a 34-year-old man in connection with an arson attack on a synagogue in Melbourne. The man allegedly set fire to the front doors of the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation while worshippers were inside sharing a Shabbat meal. No one was injured in the blaze, which was condemned by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a "cowardly" act of antisemitism, amid a rising number of such incidents in the country since late 2023.</p>
