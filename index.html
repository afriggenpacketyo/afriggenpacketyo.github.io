Musk claims that Apple's App Store policies are anti-competitive, making it impossible for his AI chatbot, Grok, to achieve a top ranking against competitors like OpenAI. He also publicly questioned why his social media platform X and Grok are not featured in the store's "Must Have" section, suggesting political motivations might be at play in their curation.</p>

          <p>Whistleblowers at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned the Charity Commission that the organization is at risk of collapse. The complaint cites a "toxic internal culture" and alleges that Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has threatened to withdraw its £100 million in public funding unless it pivots its focus to defense and national security research. This government pressure has reportedly triggered a governance crisis at the institute, which was already facing internal discontent over job cuts and its research direction.</p>

          <p>England footballer Jess Carter revealed she felt a "sigh of relief" when her white teammates also missed penalties in a crucial shootout, fearing her Black teammate Lauren James would have faced "astronomical" racist abuse if she were the only one to miss. Carter, who was herself a target of online racism during the tournament, spoke about how the abuse made her feel small, invaluable, and even scared to play in the final.

          <p>The three-year-old disappearance of Scottish cyclist Tony Parsons was solved after his killer, Alexander McKellar, confessed to his new girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead.

          <p>President Trump has changed his position on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling a meeting with him "very interesting" and his story "amazing," just days after publicly demanding his immediate resignation. The initial demand was prompted by questions about Tan's ties to China, but after a meeting with the CEO and cabinet members, Trump's tone shifted dramatically. This reversal reflects the administration's complex and often hands-on approach to the semiconductor industry amid the ongoing tech competition with China.</p>

          <p>This article explains the legal basis and potential consequences of President Trump's decision to federalize the D.C. police and deploy the National Guard. While the D.C. Home Rule Act permits a temporary takeover for up to 30 days, the move raises significant concerns given the administration's past use of force against protesters. The action is occurring despite data showing a substantial decline in violent crime, contrasting sharply with the White House's depiction of the city as a lawless zone.</p>

          <p>A new 51-story apartment tower has received approval from the Los Angeles City Council for construction in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The project, planned by a New York developer, is set to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer has not provided a construction timeline, and experts note that high interest rates, tariffs, and labor costs present significant challenges for new large-scale construction projects in the current financial climate.
