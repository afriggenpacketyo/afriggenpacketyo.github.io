          <p>Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed at least 52 people, including 36 in a school serving as a shelter.  The Israeli military claimed the school housed a militant command center, while Palestinian officials reported civilian casualties including a father and his five children. This incident occurred amidst growing concerns over food shortages in Gaza, exacerbated by a prolonged Israeli blockade, with humanitarian aid groups deeming recent aid deliveries insufficient to prevent potential famine.  The controversy surrounding a new U.S.-backed aid system, rejected by UN agencies, further complicates the situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to delay imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9 has provided temporary market relief.  Following a call with EU Commission President von der Leyen, the delay offers a window for further negotiations. However, analysts warn that the potential for a trade war persists, and the six-week period may be insufficient to resolve all issues.  Market watchers anticipate continued volatility, with the outcome heavily dependent on the political will of both parties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British businesses are reportedly "rebranding" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to avoid political backlash, reflecting a broader trend across the Atlantic.  Terms like "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture" are replacing DEI, with leadership roles shifting accordingly.  This trend follows right-wing opposition to DEI initiatives, particularly in the US, where some companies have scaled back commitments.  Experts believe that while a complete rollback is unlikely in the UK, the shift signals a decline in the public celebration of inclusion efforts.</p>

          <p>This article examines the resilience of American democracy in the face of Donald Trump's actions during his second term.  Despite concerns about democratic erosion, the author identifies six key features that contribute to America's resilience: advocacy groups, an independent judiciary, a difficult-to-change constitutional system, a free press, federalism, and strong free speech protections.  These features, while potentially having trade-offs in normal times, offer significant advantages when democracy is under threat. The author concludes that while threats are real, America's democratic institutions are better positioned than many foreign counterparts facing similar challenges.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for a new Memorial Day to honor civilian victims of war, highlighting the disproportionate number of civilian deaths compared to military casualties throughout history.  The author points to the vast number of civilian deaths in conflicts like World War II, the post-9/11 wars, and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan.  The current Memorial Day, focused primarily on military personnel, overlooks the immense suffering of civilians caught in the crossfire.  The proposal aims to provide equal recognition to the victims of war, regardless of their military status.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, initiatives focusing on police officer mental health are gaining momentum.  The killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests highlighted the already poor mental health of officers, leading to increased attention and action.  Several states are implementing dedicated wellness units and funding initiatives for first responders, addressing high rates of depression, PTSD, and suicide within law enforcement.  These programs encompass various approaches, including peer support, specialized training, and therapeutic activities like martial arts and equine therapy.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities, escalating its assault as the United States reduces its involvement in the conflict.  Ukraine reported at least 355 Russian drones and nine missiles used in the attack.  President Trump, while criticizing Putin's actions, has not approved any new military aid packages for Ukraine and has signaled a desire to step away from mediating the conflict.  Analysts suggest Russia is exploiting the U.S.'s reduced support and military assistance to Ukraine, anticipating a prolonged and bloody conflict.</p>
