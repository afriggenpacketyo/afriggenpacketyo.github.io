          <p>Bobby Sherman, the teen idol known for his shaggy mop top and hits like "Little Woman," died at 81 after battling Stage 4 cancer. His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced his death, with family friend John Stamos sharing her message on social media. Sherman gained fame in the 1960s and '70s, appearing on the covers of magazines like Tiger Beat and Sixteen, and starring in TV shows like "Here Come the Brides." After his music career, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, donating his salary and later co-founding a children's foundation in Ghana. Sherman's life was full of purpose, both in the entertainment industry and in public service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Pentagon intelligence assessment, the recent US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities did not eliminate the country's nuclear program, potentially setting it back only by months. The Defense Intelligence Agency's evaluation suggests that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium remains intact. This assessment contradicts President Trump's claims that the air strikes "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, leading the White House to label the assessment as "flat-out wrong" and an attempt to demean the president. The situation remains tense as conflicting reports emerge regarding the effectiveness of the strikes.</p>

          <p>The Independent Women's Forum (IWF) alleges that their tour bus was egged at an event in Santa Fe, New Mexico, during a stop celebrating the 53rd anniversary of Title IX, which featured an appearance by U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The bus, decorated with the slogan "HER GAME HER LEGACY," was reportedly vandalized with eggs, and the IWF filed a police report with security camera footage of the suspect. This incident follows a similar event in July 2024 where an IWF bus was defaced with profanity and anti-woman messages in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The IWF asserts that they will not be intimidated and will continue their tour across New Mexico to advocate for women's sports and sex-based rights.</p>

Norman Foster described the bridge as symbolic of the Queen's role as a unifying force. The publicly funded memorial is expected to cost approximately $62 million, but its development has drawn criticism from some who believe the royal family should fund the project themselves.</p>

          <p>French football club Lyon has been demoted to Ligue 2 due to financial concerns, a decision the club is appealing. The DNGC, which oversees the accounts of French professional football clubs, provisionally demoted Lyon in November and upheld the decision after a meeting with club officials. Lyon, a seven-time French champion, raised funds through player sales and released high earners in an attempt to improve their finances. The club argues that their proven funds and sporting success should guarantee their place in Ligue 1, as they plan to appeal the "incomprehensible" decision.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aiming for an additional $1 billion in savings in the next fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with U.S. ground home delivery volume up 10%. While FedEx stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance falling below expectations, the company's full-year fiscal 2026 guidance includes significant cost-cutting reductions. The company is also planning to spin out its Freight division, with the tax-free spin-off expected within 18 months.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an AI company, secured a legal victory in a copyright case regarding the use of copyrighted books to train its chatbot, Claude. A judge ruled that using legally purchased books for training was "quintessentially transformative" and did not violate fair use doctrine. However, the court also found that Anthropic may have broken the law by downloading millions of pirated books, leading to a separate trial in December. The lawsuit was filed by authors who claimed Anthropic's practices amounted to "large-scale theft," but the company maintains that its training methods are transformative.</p>

The briefing was postponed to include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, but Schumer emphasized the importance of hearing from the original briefers, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, CIA Director, and DNI.

          <p>Kroger, the parent company of Ralphs and Food 4 Less, plans to close 60 stores over the next 18 months. The company announced the closures in an earnings report but did not specify which locations or brands would be affected. This decision represents a $100 million loss for the company but is expected to lead to a modest financial benefit, and employees at the affected stores will be offered positions at other locations. The closures come amid a period of turmoil for Kroger, including a failed merger with Albertsonâ€™s and a recent probe into the conduct of its former chairman and chief executive.

He added that he is committed to being friends with NATO leaders and helping them, but did not provide a clear answer on whether he supports the mutual defense agreement.
