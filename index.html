          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the onus is on China to de-escalate trade tensions due to their significantly larger export volume to the U.S. Bessent highlighted the unsustainability of current tariff levels and noted progress in negotiations with India, suggesting a potential deal soon. He also speculated that European nations are concerned about the euro's strength against the dollar and may cut rates in response. Bessent clarified that the White House will not negotiate trade deals through the press, despite mixed signals from administration officials regarding ongoing discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China is increasingly turning to Brazil for soybean imports, with a significant rise in shipments expected this month. Ningbo Zhoushan Port anticipates a 48% year-on-year increase in ship calls carrying Brazilian soybeans, totaling approximately 700,000 tonnes. This shift underscores China's strategy to reduce reliance on U.S. agricultural imports, evidenced by recent cancellations of American pork orders. The situation is challenging for American soybean farmers, as China remains their largest export market, and tariffs exacerbate the problem.</p>

          <p>Unions find themselves in a difficult position regarding President Trump's tariffs, as they have historically advocated for protectionist policies to save American jobs. While some union leaders, like Shawn Fain of the UAW, have praised Trump's efforts to end free trade, others express concern about the potential harm to the economy and the working class. The mixed reactions reflect the challenge of balancing the desire for job security with the potential negative consequences of broad tariffs, which could lead to a recession.</p>
