          <p>A segment from "CBS News Sunday Morning" highlights the work of Barbara Rae-Venter, a retiree whose passion for genealogy led to a revolutionary crime-fighting technique. By applying genetic genealogy, she successfully identified and helped capture the Golden State Killer, one of California's most infamous criminals. This innovative method has since become a crucial tool for law enforcement, enabling investigators to solve numerous cold cases by tracing family histories through DNA. The article also notes her work in another case involving the sexual assault of a young boy, demonstrating the broad impact of her forensic methods.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in parts of California. The ruling addresses a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling. Separately, President Trump announced plans to impose 30% tariffs on both Mexico and the European Union, citing fentanyl trafficking and trade deficits as justifications. He also authorized law enforcement to arrest individuals believed to be assaulting them during enforcement operations, following recent clashes with protesters.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially announced the imposition of 30% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, scheduled to take effect on August 1. In letters, he cited Mexico's perceived failure to curb drug trafficking and a persistent, non-reciprocal trade deficit with the EU as the primary reasons for the move. This action represents a significant escalation in trade policy, challenging long-standing global trade norms. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed a commitment to finding a solution while also preparing potential countermeasures to protect EU interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report details significant security lapses by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump a year ago. The investigation found that the agency received classified intelligence about a threat ten days prior but failed to share it with other law enforcement partners. The report also highlights procedural errors, including misallocated resources and communication breakdowns, which contributed to the near-fatal security failure. These findings have prompted suspensions for several agents and renewed calls for structural changes within the Secret Service to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of the 'America Party,' a new political entity intended to challenge the two-party system in the United States. He envisions the party winning a small number of congressional seats to act as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. However, political science experts express doubt about its potential for success, citing the entrenched power, resources, and infrastructure of the Republican and Democratic parties. They argue that successful third parties typically disrupt and influence major parties on specific issues rather than winning seats, a role Musk's current approach does not seem to embrace.</p>

The nation is targeting a crewed lunar landing before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development and testing stages. This ambitious timeline puts China in a direct race with NASA's Artemis program, which aims for a 2027 landing but faces technical challenges, such as the need for in-orbit refueling.

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague, the first such death recorded in the state in over a decade. While human cases of plague are rare in the U.S., they most commonly occur in western states where the bacteria circulates among wild rodents. Pneumonic plague is the most virulent form of the infection, affecting the lungs and capable of spreading between people. Officials did not release further details about the victim but reminded the public that the disease is treatable with modern antibiotics if caught early.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted multiple appeals to remove dozens of buildings at Camp Mystic from its 100-year flood map designation in the years preceding the recent deadly flood. These exemptions, granted in 2013, 2019, and 2020, loosened regulatory oversight and insurance requirements for the camp as it expanded in a known flash flood alley. Experts find it disturbing that a facility responsible for children would seek exemptions from basic flood regulations. The catastrophic flood on July 4, which killed at least 27 campers and counselors, was far more severe than the 100-year event standard.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which significantly overhauls the federal student loan system. The new law streamlines the seven existing repayment plans down to two: a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven option called the Repayment Assistance Plan. It also introduces new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and graduate loans and tightens eligibility for Pell Grants. While the White House touts the changes as simplifying a confusing system, some advocates worry that extending income-based repayment timelines to 30 years will force borrowers into debt for longer.

          <p>According to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, securing a significant pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting. The process often requires several weeks of conversations, follow-ups, and documentation. She advises initiating the conversation during a mid-year check-in rather than an annual review, as budgets are often set by then. The goal of the first meeting should be to open the dialogue and present your case, not to get an immediate agreement. Valentine stresses the importance of patience and collaborative discussion, ensuring you schedule follow-up meetings and document the conversation to maintain momentum.</p>

Residents and environmental groups report that rivers like the Kok and Sai have become contaminated with unsafe levels of arsenic and other toxic metals, causing skin rashes and making the water unusable for bathing or irrigation. The pollution is linked to a boom in mining driven by China's demand for rare earth minerals, which are critical for technology and military manufacturing.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering authorizing a new round of funding for Ukraine, a potential policy shift after previously criticizing U.S. spending on the conflict. According to diplomatic sources, the move could be a message to Russia following its recent escalation of missile and drone attacks. The administration has access to nearly $4 billion in leftover presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize Russian assets to fund the aid. This development comes after Trump expressed disappointment with Vladimir Putin and suggested Russia's actions might prompt him to send more defensive weapons to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A book review of "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" explores the factors behind Donald Trump's successful return to power. The book, written by a team of political journalists, argues that Trump capitalized on public frustration with institutional failures, while his legal battles galvanized his base. The review highlights the book's deep sourcing, including interviews with Trump himself, and its analysis of the Democratic campaign's shortcomings. It also touches upon the book's examination of plausible "what-if" scenarios that could have altered the election's turbulent and historic outcome.</p>

          <p>Josh Earnest, who served as White House press secretary for President Barack Obama, recently described the day after Donald Trump's 2016 election victory as his most challenging on the job. Speaking at a journalism conference, Earnest recalled the emotional and somber mood among a visibly demoralized staff. He detailed the difficulty of reconciling the administration's campaign warnings about Trump with the constitutional duty of ensuring a peaceful transfer of power. Earnest shared a poignant moment when President Obama gathered the communications staff in the Oval Office to deliver an early, unifying version of his public address.</p>

          <p>Scientists are concerned that political and regulatory backlash against COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could jeopardize decades of promising research into therapeutic cancer vaccines. These innovative treatments, which use mRNA technology to train the immune system to fight tumors, have shown potential against difficult cancers like pancreatic, brain, and melanoma. However, recent actions by the Trump administration, including funding cuts, research grant freezes, and restrictions on mRNA shots, have created a climate of "tremendous uncertainty." Researchers worry this will stall critical progress and discourage new projects in a field with the potential to revolutionize cancer care.</p>

          <p>A year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned with rock samples from the moon's far side, a scientific debate is ongoing regarding the age of the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. Chinese scientists have proposed an age of 4.25 billion years based on direct analysis of the returned samples, a figure they consider more reliable than previous estimates derived from models or meteorites. However, their findings, submitted to the journal Nature, were reportedly rejected twice by a review panel. The article highlights the tension and differing interpretations within the international planetary science community over this significant geological feature.</p>

          <p>After experiencing chest pains, 13-year-old Micah Clayborne was diagnosed with Danon disease, a rare genetic condition causing severe heart failure that put him "close to sudden cardiac death." The diagnosis was particularly devastating as his mother, Dr. Brittany Clayborne, had also suffered from the same undiscovered condition, requiring a heart transplant years earlier. After receiving his own successful heart transplant, Micah and his mother launched Transplant Teenz, a non-profit virtual community.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's free, unstructured play, which is crucial for their development. While wild animals and, historically, human children engage in constant physical exploration, today's youth are often sedentary due to safety fears and structured environments. Experts suggest this lack of free play can hinder the development of a robust "movement vocabulary," which is essential for preventing injuries and building physical fluency. The author encourages parents to allow for more spontaneous, animal-like play, asserting that it fosters healthier bones, better cognitive skills, and long-term physical resilience.</p>

          <p>Many immigrants in Florida, regardless of legal status, are altering their driving behaviors due to fear of being detained and deported during routine traffic stops. A new state policy grants highway patrol officers the authority to detain drivers based on immigration status, leading to a set of unwritten rules within communities. These include avoiding Spanish-language music or bumper stickers, not wearing work uniforms, and trying to travel only with trusted, legal residents. The climate of fear is causing significant disruption, with some workers reportedly too scared to drive to their jobs at all.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has dismissed concerns that a political dispute over judicial appointments has damaged the country's Federal Constitutional Court. A parliamentary vote on three new judges was abruptly canceled after the conservative CDU/CSU bloc withdrew its support for a candidate from their coalition partner, the SPD, due to plagiarism allegations. Critics from within the ruling coalition accused the conservatives of deliberately undermining democratic institutions. Dobrindt described the postponement as a normal part of the political process and stated he sees no harm done to the integrity of Germany's highest court.</p>

Tassin argues that this financial pressure is often overlooked in mainstream personal finance, which has historically been male-dominated. She proposes a "hot girl detox" exercise, encouraging women to analyze their spending and redirect the saved money toward paying off debt, building savings, or investing.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are raising alarms about the osprey population in the Chesapeake Bay, where chicks are reportedly starving and dying in their nests. Biologist Bryan Watts from The College of William & Mary has documented a sharp decline in the birds' reproductive success, linking it directly to the decline of menhaden, a small, nutrient-rich fish vital to the osprey diet. While the fishing industry disputes the claim, pointing to other factors like climate change, the trend has prompted regulators to consider new management approaches. The situation threatens to reverse one of America's great conservation success stories.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the so-called "Alligator Alcatraz," a new detention camp for immigrants in the Florida Everglades, as a prime example of the Trump administration's performative cruelty. The author argues the camp, erected quickly and toured by Trump for a photoshoot, combines extreme anti-immigrant policy with a vulgar, cinematic style of domination. Despite its stylized branding, the reality of the camp is grim, with reports of inhumane conditions including food infested with maggots, broken air conditioning, and overflowing toilets. The author contends that these conditions are not accidental but rather the point, reflecting a contempt for human life and dignity.</p>

Former chief of staff Michael Coen stated that grant cuts and a lack of supplemental funding requests have left FEMA financially challenged.
