            <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to overhaul the $1.6 trillion federal student loan system, potentially impacting repayment options and loan forgiveness eligibility for millions of borrowers. Experts anticipate the elimination of the SAVE plan, introduced by former President Biden, and revisions to other income-driven repayment plans, possibly ending automatic loan forgiveness under PAYE and ICR. These changes aim to cut red tape and streamline federal student aid programs, but may narrow eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to temporarily pause tariffs on several trading partners, excluding China, has triggered a surge in freight orders after cancellations last week.

Despite the pause, daily tariff collections remain high, and some industries are holding back, awaiting further developments. '(not investment advice)'</p>

            <p>A Meta whistleblower, Sarah Wynn-Williams, testified before senators that Facebook collaborated with the Chinese government to censor posts, undermining U.S. national security. She alleged Meta provided custom-built censorship tools to the Chinese Communist Party and allowed potential access to American users' data. Wynn-Williams claimed CEO Mark Zuckerberg was personally invested in Meta's relationship with China. Meta has denied these allegations, stating they do not operate services in China today.

            <p>A new study reveals that anti-anxiety drugs, specifically benzodiazepines, found in wastewater are impacting the behavior of fish. Atlantic salmon exposed to clobazam showed increased migration success, possibly due to reduced anxiety and increased risk-taking behavior. While this may seem beneficial, experts caution that altering natural behavior can have negative consequences, such as decreased schooling and increased predation risk. The broader issue is the presence of various pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments and their largely unknown effects on wildlife, highlighting the need for further research and responsible chemical management.</p>

Economists anticipate that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, potentially pushing the 2026 COLA to 2.5% or higher.

            <p>The top US commander in the Pacific warned senators that military support from China and North Korea to Russia in its war on Ukraine poses a security risk. China is providing 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the legacy chips to Russia to help Moscow “rebuild its war machine”. In exchange, China is potentially getting help in technologies to make its submarines move more quietly. Senators also questioned both commanders on the US military presence in South Korea, and whether it should be shielded from personnel cuts.</p>

            <p>Penny Mordaunt, a former Conservative cabinet minister, is taking up a part-time paid role with British American Tobacco as a member of its "transformation advisory board". The company says it wants to build "a smokeless world" by moving smokers to smokeless alternatives. All former ministers are expected to seek advice from Acoba (the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments) on any job they want to take up two years after leaving government. Acoba advised her to have "no direct engagement with government on behalf of the company as to do so would raise significant risks under the government's rules".</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences has unveiled genetically modified wolves with traits from long-extinct dire wolves, claiming it has created “the world’s first successfully de-extincted animal”. The company has created novel animals for whom humans are now morally accountable — a responsibility that the nascent field of de-extinction, which insists it is an ally of conservation, has not shown itself prepared to fulfill. Critics point out that de-extinction not only requires keeping surrogate mothers from a closely related species in captivity and often confinement but also performing embryo transfer, an invasive procedure.</p>

            <p>China's National Film Administration announced it will reduce the number of American films allowed to be shown in China, amid escalating trade tensions with the United States. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters at a Thursday briefing that America was using "tariffs as a weapon to exert maximum pressure and seek selfish gains.". Officials in China said the United States' "abuse [of] tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favorability towards American films."</p>

            <p>Nintendo may be preparing to sell the Switch 2 at a loss due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Nintendo may be looking to make as many Switch 2 units as it can in Vietnam (it's manufacturing about a third of the consoles there) during the 90-day freeze on higher tariffs and ship as many as possible to the US. With a 10 percent tariff, Nintendo may reluctantly eat that cost, even if that means losing money on each sale. Unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has not historically sold its consoles at a loss with the aim of making up for that with sales of pricey software .</p>

            <p>Financial anxiety is increasing among Americans across all income levels, with nearly half reporting more stress than a year ago, according to a CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll. Inflation, high interest rates, tariffs, and potential layoffs contribute to the pressure, leaving even six-figure earners struggling to keep up. While lower-income Americans experience higher stress levels, a significant portion of higher earners also report financial hardship. Discretionary spending is declining as more household budgets go to essential spending.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has admitted he has still not spoken to Donald Trump since the US president brought in trade tariffs, with government sources saying the UK was not given any advance warning of this week’s changes to US tariffs. The president’s partial reprieve bringing the base tariff rate down to 10% helped other nations that had been given higher tariffs, some of which had planned retaliation, such as the EU. Starmer told reporters during a visit to Cambridgeshire: “I don’t think having a strong relationship with the US has given us no advantage whatsoever."</p>

Experts testified about the potential confusion of different standards across states and evidence linking the time transition to increased health risks. The committee is looking for a thoughtful solution to this issue, and the Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time.</p>

Yet in the long run, if tariffs stick, analysts say that car prices would likely go up by thousands of dollars. Tariffs, indirectly, will drive up used car prices. Some shoppers are hurrying up, others are stepping back. Connecticut car shopper Angelica DeLeon is facing that daunting used vehicle market now.

            <p>President Trump privately acknowledged his tariff plans could cause a recession but aimed to avoid a depression, according to sources cited by the Wall Street Journal. Despite this awareness, he was willing to accept "pain" over the policy. His reversal powered a sharp comeback in the stock market, with the S&P 500 registering its best day since 2008. The bond market decline contributed to Trump's decision. A driver of Trump's alterations was the rising role of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in advising on trade policy, according to the Journal, which cited people close to the situation.</p>

            <p>Major League Baseball owners and Commissioner Rob Manfred's office have begun privately contemplating what a new league economic structure could look like as the league heads toward a new Collective Bargaining Agreement with players, according to people familiar with the matter. The league's current CBA expires on Dec. 1, 2026. If MLB owners are ultimately successful in forcing through a salary cap, it would end decades of limitless spending that's led to increasingly disproportionate spending between teams in the league. The remaining three major sports leagues in the U.S. — the National Football League, the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association — all have salary caps.</p>
