          <p>The U.S. swim team broke the world record for the 4x100 mixed relay at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore, highlighting a strong day for the American swimmers. Katie Ledecky also secured another victory, maintaining her undefeated streak in the 800-meter freestyle, a record she has held since the 2012 Olympics. The wins, which also included a gold for Gretchen Walsh in the 50-meter butterfly, marked a significant turnaround for the team at the championships.

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a prominent Fox News personality and staunch supporter of President Trump, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The confirmation passed with a narrow 50-45 vote, officially appointing her to one of the country's most powerful prosecutorial roles, which she had been holding on an acting basis. Her appointment follows the collapsed nomination of a previous candidate and has been praised by President Trump, who criticized Democrats for attempting to delay the process.

          <p>Celebrating its tenth anniversary, Ethereum has transformed from a radical experiment into a fundamental component of the global financial system, now valued at over $420 billion. Initially a bare-bones network, it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and is increasingly integrated into Wall Street, with major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank building on its platform. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledges the immense growth but warns against the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption continues. The platform's stability and programmability are cited as key reasons for its adoption by traditional financial entities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of a July jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected hiring. The report also included a significant downward revision for job creation in May and June, which the president described as a "major mistake." The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who warn that it threatens the integrity of nonpartisan federal economic data and sets a dangerous precedent. The administration defended the firing, citing concerns about the accuracy of recent data revisions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's ruling that officials must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals. The decision stems from sweeps conducted by the Trump administration that were found to have potentially relied on factors like race or speaking Spanish, which violates the Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that these factors alone do not justify a stop. While advocates praised the ruling for protecting civil rights, the administration criticized the decision as judicial overreach undermining immigration enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has launched an investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, which restricts the political activities of federal employees. The probe was initiated following a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into former President Trump were politically motivated and intended to interfere with the 2024 election. Smith, who was appointed by the previous administration to oversee probes into Trump, resigned in January before the new term began. Both cases he led resulted in charges but were later closed.</p>

This unconventional approach aims to build a grassroots movement, but the party cannot field election candidates until it officially registers a name with the Electoral Commission.

Although Hojlund has publicly stated his desire to remain at the club, the potential sale is seen as a move to ensure compliance with Premier League financial regulations.

The platypus, named Winston, died en route from Australia to the UK in 1943, with rumors attributing its death to shock from a nearby German U-boat attack. However, archival research by Australian academics has revealed a more mundane cause: the creature likely died from heatstroke. Logbooks from the ship showed that water and air temperatures climbed well above the safe threshold for the species as the vessel crossed the equator.</p>

          <h2>Criminals Exploit TikTok Trend with Dangerous Counterfeit Labubu Dolls</h2>

          <p>An investigation has uncovered a large-scale criminal operation producing and distributing dangerous counterfeit Labubu dolls to capitalize on a viral TikTok trend. Trading Standards officers raided a London facility, seizing thousands of fake dolls that pose a serious choking hazard to children due to easily detachable parts. The popularity of the authentic dolls from parent company Pop Mart has created a lucrative market for fakes, which are often sold at a fraction of the price but are made with unsafe, potentially toxic materials. Authorities warn consumers to be wary of deals that seem too good to be true.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators at protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers in several English cities, including London and Manchester. The demonstrations reflect growing tensions over the government's use of hotels for asylum accommodation, a practice it plans to phase out. Police imposed special restrictions in London to keep the opposing groups separated. The events occurred as the Home Secretary announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to reduce the number of people housed in the system.</p>

          <p>Shayna Glassman, the daughter of a man who was harassed by David Berkowitz, has formed an unlikely relationship with the "Son of Sam" killer, visiting him regularly in prison. Her father, Craig Glassman, was Berkowitz's downstairs neighbor in 1977 and was targeted with threatening letters and a fire outside his door. Shayna, who was only four when her father died, says visiting Berkowitz is her way of connecting with her father's story and legacy. She describes her relationship with the incarcerated killer as complex, driven by a need to understand a figure from her past.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players' mentality, effort, and ego following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their first league match of the season. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and lambasted what he described as a "mentality problem" rather than a tactical one. The unusually harsh and early public critique from the new manager has raised concerns among pundits and fans about the team's cohesion. This marks the third consecutive season that Rangers has failed to win its opening league game.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters, incumbent Matt Hayball and rookie James Burnip, are battling for a single NFL contract. This annual "brutal ritual" for the Saints pits former Australian rules football players against each other for a lucrative spot on the final 53-man roster. Both athletes are graduates of the ProKick Australia academy and maintain a friendly rivalry despite the cut-throat nature of the competition. The Saints' preference for Australian punters highlights the value NFL teams place on their unique skills.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a sharp return from the injured list, but the team lost 4-0 to the Tampa Bay Rays. In his first start in nearly four months, the two-time Cy Young winner recorded eight strikeouts over five innings, showing flashes of his ace potential. However, he surrendered two home runs to Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, both of which took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's strong performance was seen as a promising sign for the Dodgers' postseason rotation.</p>
