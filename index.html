          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to combat a flesh-eating parasite, the New World screwworm, which is infecting their livestock and other animals. The outbreak has prompted the United States to suspend all cattle imports from Mexico, creating significant economic pressure. While a U.S.-supported plant to produce sterile flies for eradication is being built, it will not be ready until next year, leaving ranchers to face soaring medicine costs and a lack of government support on their own.</p>

Washington is also seeking the removal of the U.K.'s digital services tax, creating a potential area for negotiation and compromise between the two allied nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a UK first, the Welsh government will provide people with conditions like coeliac disease with pre-loaded debit cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system offers an alternative to the traditional method of obtaining food on prescription from a pharmacy, giving individuals more choice and convenience. The move aims to de-medicalize the process and help offset the significantly higher cost of gluten-free products compared to their standard counterparts, which can be a major financial burden.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in China has achieved a scientific first by directly observing and measuring quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not consistently increase with the material's thickness and, in some cases, even decreased. This counterintuitive finding is linked to how bending the material alters electron energy levels and could have profound implications for designing future nanodevices with ultra-low power consumption and minimal wear.</p>

          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe has publicly supported the declassification of a highly sensitive 2017 House Republican report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The release, overseen by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, has been criticized by Democrats for potentially risking intelligence sources and methods. The administration frames the move as a commitment to transparency, while critics view it as a politically motivated effort to undermine the findings of the original Russia investigation.</p>

          <p>Princeton, a city north of Dallas, has been named the fastest-growing in the U.S., with its population more than doubling from 17,000 to 37,000 in just a few years. This explosive growth, driven by relatively affordable housing, has created severe growing pains for the once-small town. The city's infrastructure is strained, forcing officials to temporarily halt new construction to catch up on building essential services like roads, water lines, and sewer systems to support the thousands of new residents.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former players from Canada's world junior hockey team of charges that they sexually assaulted a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, the judge stated that she did not find the accuser's evidence to be "credible or reliable," concluding a high-profile, eight-week trial that centered on the issue of consent. Following the verdict, the National Hockey League confirmed the players remain ineligible to play pending the league's own review of the case.</p>
