          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8% in the third quarter, aligning with analyst predictions, despite a persistent and worsening real estate downturn. Fixed-asset investment, including property, unexpectedly fell, with property investment itself declining 13.9% year-on-year through September. Conversely, industrial production surpassed expectations with a 6.5% increase, though retail sales growth slowed. The nation also maintained its benchmark lending rates and showed resilience in exports, even as deflationary pressures continued. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of people participated in "No Kings" rallies across the U.S. and worldwide, protesting President Trump's policies, which Republicans labeled "Hate America" events. Demonstrators expressed outrage over immigration crackdowns, deployment of National Guard troops, and perceived authoritarian actions. While largely peaceful, some tensions arose in Portland, leading to tear gas deployment. Organizers reported higher turnout than previous similar events, emphasizing a "fierce love for our country" as their motivation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump accused Colombian President Petro of being an "illegal drug leader" and threatened to cut U.S. funding and impose major tariffs on Colombia, alleging his failure to stop drug production. Petro refuted the claims, asserting his role as a primary opponent of drugs. The article also touches on George Santos's post-commutation interview, a Republican-backed campaign by soft-drink companies against health movements, and Portland residents mocking Trump's description of their city as "war-ravaged" amidst National Guard deployment attempts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded to the global "No Kings" protests, dismissing them as "a joke" and claiming participants were "not representative of this country." He asserted he is "not a king" and works diligently to "make our country great." Despite concerns of violence, the demonstrations in cities like New York and Washington D.C. remained largely peaceful, with no reported arrests.

The 2011-15 plan prioritized "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, giving China a near monopoly in renewables and rare earths.
