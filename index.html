          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, many Americans are considering their options for relief. This article explores the possibility of negotiating directly with creditors as an alternative to hiring a debt relief company. It outlines the challenges and benefits of this DIY approach, emphasizing the need for persistence, preparedness, and a solid understanding of debt laws. The summary also notes potential pitfalls, such as negative credit score impacts and tax consequences from forgiven debt, which require careful navigation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to seek a long-term extension from Congress for the federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. The initial control, permitted under the Home Rule Act for up to 30 days with congressional notification, was enacted to address what the president described as a crime crisis. For the takeover to continue beyond this period, it would require a joint resolution from both the House and Senate, a move the president expressed confidence in securing from Republican lawmakers.</p>

          <p>An outburst flood from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier has caused record-breaking flooding in Juneau, Alaska, with the Mendenhall River cresting at an unprecedented 16.65 feet. The event, driven by climate change-related glacial retreat, prompted evacuations as rising waters threatened homes and infrastructure. This has become a recurring issue since 2011, with this year's flood surpassing previous records and highlighting the ongoing risk to the community. Authorities have installed temporary barriers, but a long-term solution is still years away.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles reported its busiest month in its 117-year history, processing over one million container units in July. This surge was driven by companies "front-loading" imports of Chinese goods to get ahead of anticipated tariff deadlines imposed by the Trump administration. While this created a short-term boom, industry experts note that the peak season started and slowed earlier than usual. The uncertainty around tariffs is particularly impacting retailers and importers of lower-cost items, leading to concerns about future trade volumes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will begin suspending flights in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, who issued a 72-hour strike notice. The union, CUPE, stated that contract negotiations stalled after the airline refused to address key issues like wages and unpaid work. The airline claims the union's demands are "exorbitant" and has warned of a complete cessation of flying by Saturday, which could affect 130,000 daily customers during the peak summer travel season. Customers are being advised to check their flight status.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to include nearly all grocery items, such as milk and meat, which were previously excluded outside of the holiday season. The move, effective immediately, comes as rising tariffs renew concerns about inflation and higher consumer prices. In a memo, the company acknowledged that the expanded benefit was one of the most requested by its 1.6 million U.S. employees. The perk could help motivate its workforce and encourage them to shop at Walmart.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the territorial implications of the upcoming Trump-Putin summit, focusing on the regions of Ukraine currently under Russian control. Since 2014, Russia has occupied Crimea and backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and it now controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. The article examines potential scenarios, such as Russia demanding full control of the Donbas in exchange for freezing the frontlines in the south. Such a concession would be a devastating blow for Kyiv, which has lost tens of thousands of soldiers defending these areas.</p>
