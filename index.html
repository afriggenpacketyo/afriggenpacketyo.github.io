          <p>A federal judge temporarily restored legal funding for unaccompanied migrant children in immigration court, blocking the Trump administration's decision to terminate the program.  The ruling cites the government's legal obligation under a 2008 anti-trafficking law to provide legal representation to vulnerable children.  The temporary restoration prevents immediate harm to children facing asylum proceedings and highlights the ongoing legal battle over the provision of legal aid to undocumented minors.</p>
