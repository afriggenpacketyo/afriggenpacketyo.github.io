          <p>Miki Sudo has won the women's division of the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, consuming 33 hot dogs and buns to claim her 11th title. The annual Fourth of July event in Coney Island, New York, saw Sudo pull ahead in the latter half of the competition to secure the victory. Meanwhile, the men's competition features the return of 16-time champion Joey Chestnut, who was absent last year due to a sponsorship conflict, creating anticipation for a competitive showdown.</p>

          <p>The sentence of a 15-year-old boy, convicted of manslaughter for the killing of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli in Leicestershire, is being referred for review over concerns it may be unduly lenient. Kohli died after being subjected to a racially aggravated assault in a park, which was filmed by a 13-year-old girl. The Attorney General's Office has invoked the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme for the boy's seven-year custody sentence, while the girl's sentence will not be reviewed.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old man, Tyler Webb, has been sentenced to a nine-year hybrid order for encouraging a vulnerable woman to self-harm for his sexual gratification. This case marks the first conviction under a new provision of the UK's Online Safety Act 2023. Webb met the victim on a social media forum and used the Telegram app to instruct her on self-harm, asking for images and attempting to watch her take her own life via video call.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through the country, specifically targeting Chinese manufacturers avoiding US tariffs. However, economists and trade experts note the pact lacks clear definitions, raising questions about its enforcement and potential impact on supply chains. The deal's effectiveness will depend on how "made in Vietnam" is defined and whether it applies to goods with minimal Chinese components, potentially causing significant disruptions.

The company's primary demographic consists of young adults, not the children under eight targeted by potential regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and rapidly growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a cushion against domestic regulatory pressures. The company's international revenue is projected to comprise over half of its total sales in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that while taxes like the Stamp Act ignited conflict, it was the imposition of martial law in Boston under the 1774 Coercive Acts that escalated resistance into a full-blown revolution. By dissolving local governance and occupying the city with troops, Britain transformed a legal matter into a military one, a blunder that led to unintended bloodshed at Lexington and ultimately the Declaration of Independence, which cited these military actions as a primary grievance.</p>

Peroni was 27 when she disappeared in Oregon in 1983 after an argument with Sanfratello. The case was reopened last year after a human skull found in 1997 was definitively identified as Peroni's through advanced DNA testing. This new evidence led a grand jury to indict Sanfratello, who has been arrested in California and is awaiting extradition.</p>

          <p>In response to recent US and Israeli airstrikes targeting its nuclear sites, Iran has officially suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The move raises concerns about international oversight, as Iran possesses enough highly enriched uranium for several nuclear bombs. This decision reflects a long and complex history, from Iran's US-backed nuclear beginnings in the 1950s to the 2018 collapse of the JCPOA deal, and fuels debate on whether the Non-Proliferation Treaty still offers security to nations without nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Following his feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, Elon Musk has renewed his threat to launch a new political party, but faces significant legal and logistical hurdles. Creating a third party in the US requires navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, a process that is costly, time-consuming, and heavily biased toward the two major parties. While Musk's immense wealth could fund the effort, experts note that building a nationally recognized party from scratch would likely take years and hundreds of millions of dollars in litigation and organization.</p>

          <p>The United Nations human rights agency has criticized Germany's proposal to resume deportations to Afghanistan, stating it is "not appropriate" given the ongoing human rights violations under Taliban rule. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) affirmed that a "non-return advisory" remains in place, as conditions are not yet safe for returns. The push for deportations by Germany's Interior Minister comes amid a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment and marks a potential shift from the policy enacted after the Taliban regained power in 2021.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, aimed at ending conflict in eastern DRC, is facing significant skepticism. While lauded by the governments as a historic milestone, armed groups like the M23 rebels have rejected its binding nature. Observers warn that the deal's success is threatened by a lack of inclusivity for local communities and armed factions, as well as the challenge of ensuring accountability for past atrocities. The agreement also has strong economic motives, tied to the region's vast mineral wealth.</p>

The legislation also introduces new tax deductions for tipped workers and expands the child tax credit, representing a major policy overhaul. (not investment advice)</p>
