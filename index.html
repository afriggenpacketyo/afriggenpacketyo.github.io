        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the prohibition of bottom trawling in its offshore areas designated as protected, increasing the area covered from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans, coinciding with the UN Ocean Conference in France. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed, with environmental groups like Greenpeace UK and The Wildlife Trust welcoming the move as a win-win for nature and climate. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect 30% of the ocean. The article notes that the UK is among the countries that has yet to ratify.</p>

          <p>China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) is at the forefront of constructing Egypt's New Administrative Capital, a city designed to house over 6 million people and alleviate congestion in Cairo. CSCEC is not only the primary contractor for the central business district (CBD) but will also operate and maintain it, according to an agreement between China and Egypt. The CBD includes Africa’s tallest skyscraper, the Iconic Tower, along with office towers, residential towers, and hotels. Over 30,000 government employees have already relocated to the new capital, which has served as Egypt’s official seat of government since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s third-term inauguration, marking a significant step in the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. saw a significant drop of 34.5% year-on-year in May, marking the steepest decline since February 2020 due to tariffs. Overall exports rose 4.8% but fell short of expectations, while imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. This decline was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Volumes of car and ship exports increased, while smartphone and home appliance exports decreased, reflecting shifts in global trade dynamics. The article notes that China's imports of soybeans surged to a record high, and that the tariff ceasefire occurred in mid-May, by which point the damage was already done. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>National Guard troops arrived in downtown Los Angeles after President Trump ordered their deployment in response to clashes between law enforcement and protesters triggered by immigration enforcement operations. Protesters clashed with soldiers near the Metropolitan Detention Center, leading to the use of tear gas and non-lethal rounds. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell stated the department cannot participate in civil immigration enforcement due to the California Values Act. Governor Newsom criticized Trump's deployment, calling it "purposefully inflammatory," while former Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the escalation and urged peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures amid weak domestic demand. The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices fell by 3.3%, the steepest decline since July 2023. Despite stimulus measures, domestic consumption remains sluggish, with price wars in the auto sector adding to downward pressure.

Analysts suggest this move could indicate Russian involvement in repairing the vessel.

Rajin's proximity to Russia makes it a key location for North Korea's efforts to strengthen economic and potentially military ties with Moscow.
