          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility while visiting with New Jersey's congressional delegation. U.S. Attorney Alina Habba stated Baraka ignored warnings from Homeland Security Investigations. Baraka, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, has been protesting the facility's opening, arguing it's dangerous and illegal. Governor Murphy expressed outrage at the arrest, while congressmembers Menendez and Watson Coleman claimed it was an act of intimidation intended to suppress dissent regarding the detention center's operations and legitimacy.</p>

          <p>India launched missiles at three air bases inside Pakistan, triggering retaliatory attacks, according to Pakistani military officials. The escalation follows a mass shooting in India-controlled Kashmir, which India blames on Pakistan. Pakistani army spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif stated some missiles also hit India's eastern Punjab and even landed in Afghanistan, calling the situation a 'provocation of the highest order'. Pakistan claims to have targeted an Indian missile storage facility and airbases in response. The conflict has heightened tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals, raising concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>The robotic Soviet spacecraft Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, it has been adrift in space for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact location is still unknown. Although some parts of the spacecraft are expected to survive the atmospheric plunge, the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low, and if any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

He warns that budget cuts could undermine the probation service's ability to support offenders and reduce reoffending rates. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reports that the prisons and probation budget has already decreased, and further cuts could exacerbate the situation.</p>

          <p>Asfandyar Mir writes that the ongoing military conflict between India and Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, highlights a dangerous shift in their rivalry. India, under Narendra Modi, views Pakistan as a threat to its rise, while Pakistan, despite its challenges, remains unwilling to back down on issues like Kashmir. The absence of U.S. mediation and the erosion of communication channels exacerbate the situation, raising concerns about the potential for nuclear escalation.

          <p>A study by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) highlights growing concerns about the vulnerability of China's nuclear power plants in the event of a military conflict. China's nuclear power construction is rapidly expanding, with over 100 reactors planned or operational, primarily along the coast. The study warns that these reactors could become high-value targets for adversaries, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences if attacked. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has prompted Chinese military researchers to re-evaluate security risks and propose enhanced defense strategies for these facilities.</p>

Documents released by prosecutors revealed an investigation into witness tampering, though Adams was never charged. The meeting occurred amid ongoing tensions between the city and the Trump administration, including disputes over immigration and law enforcement cooperation.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades, utilizing new tools of war such as drones. India accused Pakistan of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting air bases, prompting retaliatory actions.

Diplomatic pressure from international actors has been largely ignored, as both countries exchange gunfire, drone attacks, and misinformation.

The last utility with a 'do not drink' notice, the Las Flores Water Co. in Altadena, was cleared to resume delivering drinking water. The State Water Resources Control Board worked with utilities to assess damage, test for potential contamination, and ensure the water is safe. Approximately 23,000 water customers were affected by the notices during and after the fires.</p>

Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the firings, with Senator Amy Klobuchar calling the dismissals 'illegal'.</p>
