          <p>President Trump's new tariffs are causing significant concern among small retailers, who lack the leverage of larger companies to absorb or negotiate tariff costs.  Experts warn that tariffs will disproportionately impact working-class consumers through higher prices, while benefiting the wealthy through tax cuts.  NPR's reporting highlights the potential for small businesses to scale back operations, reduce hiring, or face closure due to increased import costs. The situation illustrates the complex economic consequences of widespread tariffs.</p>

          <p>OPEC+ announced a significant increase in oil production, despite falling oil prices and growing concerns about a global recession fueled by Trump's tariffs.

Analysts attribute the move to several factors, including appeasing President Trump and addressing compliance issues within the group.  The decision highlights the complex dynamics of the global oil market and its response to economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)

          <p>Senators Chuck Grassley and Maria Cantwell introduced a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for new tariffs, aiming to curb presidential authority in trade policy.  House Democrats are also seeking to block Trump's tariffs through a resolution of disapproval.  Reactions to the tariffs are sharply divided along party lines, though some Republicans expressed concern over market reactions. The proposed legislation highlights the ongoing debate over the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches on trade issues.</p>

          <p>Senator Cory Booker's 25-hour speech, while impressive, didn't technically qualify as a filibuster, but it renewed focus on the Senate tradition.

The article traces the evolution of the filibuster, from lengthy speeches to silent threats of obstruction, and discusses ongoing debates about its reform or elimination. The piece examines the historical and contemporary significance of this Senate procedure.</p>
