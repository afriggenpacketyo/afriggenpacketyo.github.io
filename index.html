          <p>Gilead Sciences agreed to pay $202 million to settle civil claims that it used speaker programs to pay kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe Gilead's HIV drugs. The company gave money to doctors who spoke at HIV Speaker Program events in the form of honoraria payments, meals, and travel expenses. The arrangement violated the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, causing false claims to be made for Gilead's drugs to be paid for by federal health-care programs. The article reports that one doctor who spoke at Gilead events received more than $300,000 in honorarium and wrote prescriptions for Gilead HIV drugs resulting in upward of $6 million in payments.</p>
