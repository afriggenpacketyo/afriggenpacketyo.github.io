          <h2>New US Tariff on Copper Creates Uncertainty for China's Refining Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 07:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Washington's unexpected decision to implement a 50% tariff on copper imports is creating significant uncertainty for China, the world's largest consumer of the metal. The move caused US copper futures to rally while prices in London and China fell, creating arbitrage opportunities. However, analysts caution that the tariff will likely be implemented before most new shipments can arrive, potentially depressing global copper prices as the US market's ability to absorb supply is constrained. The exact timeline and potential exemptions for the tariff remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Recent social media images have revealed a mysterious Chinese vehicle, dubbed the "Bohai Monster," which appears to be a modern wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) craft. This type of vehicle, also known as an ekranoplan, flies at very low altitudes over flat surfaces to reduce drag, allowing for greater fuel efficiency and payload capacity. The design shares similarities with the massive Soviet-era "Caspian Sea Monster" from the 1960s, suggesting a potential revival of the technology for military or cargo transport purposes.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England will stage a five-day strike starting July 25 after voting in favor of further industrial action over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) announced the walkout after the government stated it would not negotiate on pay, despite the BMA's claims that real-term wages have fallen by about 20% since 2008. The union has given the government a two-week window to enter serious negotiations to avert the strike, which health officials warn would be a disaster for patients.</p>

          <p>A new book by columnist Christine Brennan claims that basketball phenom Caitlin Clark "never had a chance" of making the U.S. Olympic team. The book alleges that a spot was unofficially reserved for veteran Diana Taurasi as a "farewell present," leaving only 11 open positions. Additionally, officials were reportedly concerned about how Clark's massive fanbase would react to her likely limited playing time on a team of established stars. Clark herself stated she would not want to be on the team for her popularity alone.</p>

          <p>A massive wildfire is burning on the northern edge of Marseille, France, injuring at least 110 people and forcing the evacuation of 400 residents. The blaze, which authorities say was sparked by a car fire, spread rapidly due to strong winds, dry vegetation, and steep terrain, consuming over 700 hectares. About 800 firefighters are battling the fire, which has disrupted flights at Marseille Provence airport and created what some residents describe as an "apocalyptic" scene with huge plumes of smoke over the city.</p>

          <p>This article provides a deep dive into the background of White House official Stephen Miller, a key architect of the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies. It explores how his formative years in the liberal enclave of Santa Monica, California, may have fueled his reactionary conservative views. The piece posits that Miller's influential and controversial platform, which has heavily targeted cities like Los Angeles, could be interpreted as a form of political revenge against the communities where he felt like an outsider.</p>

          <p>A profile of Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman details his first six months in office, which have been marked by a reversal of his predecessor's progressive policies and an effort to restore "normalcy." The self-described independent has focused on a "hard middle" approach to public safety, a stance that is being tested by the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement in the county. While he has brought a sense of stability to the office, his neutrality has drawn criticism from some legal advocates.</p>

Industry leaders described the proposal as uninformed and out of touch with the realities of food production. They pointed out the significant technical limitations of automation for many crops and the historical failure of programs designed to transition welfare recipients into the physically demanding field of farm labor.</p>

Experts caution against attributing the drop to a single factor, but note it represents a multi-year downward trajectory since a spike during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>A cognitive neuroscience researcher argues in a new article that the increasingly common metaphor comparing the human brain to an AI is dangerously flawed and misleading. The author contends that this comparison causes us to misunderstand our own minds, ignoring uniquely human attributes like motivation, passion, and the value of messy, mistake-driven learning. Unlike an AI, human cognition is not a process to be simply "trained" or "optimized," and viewing it as such could lead to harmful approaches in education and mental healthcare.</p>

These efforts often involve setting minimum payment rates for insurers, but they face strong opposition from the health insurance industry. Insurers and their lobbyists argue that such measures constitute government price-setting that will ultimately lead to higher health coverage premiums for all consumers, stalling progress on the issue.</p>
