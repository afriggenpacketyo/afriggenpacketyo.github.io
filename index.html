          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to terminate a program that provided temporary legal status to over 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Venezuelans. This decision allows the administration to proceed with ending the humanitarian parole program, known as CHNV, which was created during the Biden administration to address the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, arguing that the decision would cause needless human suffering before the legal arguments are fully considered. The Trump administration asserts that the program incentivized illegal immigration and violated immigration law.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, citing a record low U.S. fertility rate. The author suggests that redefined standards of harm, abuse, and trauma play a significant role in this trend. Millennials hold their parents to higher standards, expecting them to ensure career success and mental well-being into adulthood. This creates an overwhelming expectation that many fear they cannot meet, contributing to their reluctance to embrace parenthood.</p>

The article suggests that these trends reflect a broader disillusionment with American institutions and a search for solutions that often prove to be ineffective or even harmful.</p>

          <p>China has responded to accusations from President Donald Trump that it is violating a two-week-old truce on tariffs. Trump claimed that China had "totally violated its agreement with us," while US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed. China's response urged the US to "cease discriminatory restrictions against China" and uphold the consensus reached at talks in Geneva. The statements have raised concerns about a potential escalation in trade tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Paul Ingrassia, a former right-wing podcast host, to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an independent watchdog agency. Ingrassia has a history of promoting Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and ties to far-right media figures. His appointment is expected to face tough scrutiny due to his past controversial statements and associations. The Trump administration previously fired the head of the agency, Hampton Dellinger, who opposed cuts to federal employees.</p>
