          <p>A New York Times article reports that a federal judge in Boston criticized the Trump administration for violating an order that protects immigrants from deportation to countries where they could face danger. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, stated that the administration deported eight migrants to a third country with insufficient notice, potentially leading to criminal contempt penalties for those involved. The flight, carrying individuals from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma, and Vietnam, landed in Djibouti. The article includes an interactive graphic mapping the flight's path, originating from Harlingen, Texas, with a stop in Shannon, Ireland, before reaching Djibouti, highlighting the administration's contentious deportation practices.</p>

          <p>The South China Morning Post reports that the Trump administration defended its tariffs in a New York trade court, arguing that removing them would undermine the president's position in trade negotiations with China. The lawsuit, led by Oregon and 11 other states, challenged the legality of Trump's use of a "national emergency" under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the tariffs. The administration asserted that the president's emergency declarations were not subject to judicial review, framing the matter as a political question only Congress could address.</p>

          <p>A CBS News article reports on a tense meeting between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, where Trump confronted Ramaphosa over claims of "White genocide" in South Africa. Trump presented a video with controversial content, including apartheid-era songs and images of white crosses, which he claimed represented burial sites of White farmers, though they were part of a protest. Ramaphosa and others in his delegation pushed back, stating that crime affects all demographics in South Africa, with the majority of victims being Black people. The meeting, attended by Elon Musk, highlighted strained relations between the U.S. and South Africa, especially after the U.S. granted refugee status to 59 White Afrikaners.</p>

Inflows into exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin's price have exceeded $40 billion, with reduced selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market.

          <p>A Yahoo News article reports that heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding in Argentina's farms, threatening crop production. Farmer Martin Vivanco notes that the rainfall has been among the most impressive he's witnessed, with 400 millimeters falling in 24 hours. The excessive humidity has delayed the harvest, increasing the risk of crop diseases and potentially impacting soybean yields. Vivanco expresses concern about the next production cycle, with wheat planting expected in June, noting that the soil conditions will make it very difficult to move forward with normal planting schedules.</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that Texas lawmakers have advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, which only allows abortions to save the mother's life. While the bill doesn't expand abortion access or list specific medical exceptions, it specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency causing major bodily impairment. The bill defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death, representing a pivot for Texas Republicans. The proposal has garnered mixed reactions, with some abortion-rights allies questioning its potential impact.</p>
