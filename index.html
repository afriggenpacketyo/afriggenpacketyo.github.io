          <p>A Member of Scottish Parliament, Colin Smyth, has had his parliamentary pass deactivated following reports he placed a camera in a Holyrood toilet. Smyth was previously suspended by the Labour party after being charged with possessing indecent images of children and is cooperating with the ongoing criminal investigation. The parliament's chief executive informed members of the decision ahead of the return from recess, acknowledging the distressing nature of the charges and reminding staff of available confidential support services. The Scottish Labour Party has stated Smyth is now an independent MSP and cannot comment further during legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>An asylum seeker residing at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, has voiced concerns about the residents' uncertain future as they face eviction by September 12. The move follows a High Court injunction, which is currently being appealed by the Home Office, granted after anti-immigration protests at the site. A Somalian man identified as Abdi described feeling "in the dark" and noted the hostility they face from some locals, which has made them afraid to leave the hotel. He also acknowledged understanding the public's anger over mass migration, stating it is a logical and reasonable concern.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit, allowing families of 9/11 victims to proceed with their case. The lawsuit alleges that the Saudi government provided support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers, a claim the kingdom has consistently denied. The case was bolstered by the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act and recently declassified documents suggesting links between a Saudi official and two of the hijackers. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence of assistance, which Saudi Arabia has not sufficiently refuted.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that global demand, particularly from markets like China, is intrinsically linked to the deforestation caused by Indonesia's palm oil industry. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has initiated a campaign against illegal plantations, which cover at least 3.7 million hectares, aiming to reclaim vital forest areas. The author suggests that palm oil is not just a commodity but a reflection of civilization, where economic growth has often been prioritized at the expense of environmental destruction. The article posits that by leveraging its market power, China can play a crucial role in promoting more sustainable and responsible practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public media stations in rural America are warning that crucial funding for the nation's emergency alert system is at risk, potentially leaving communities vulnerable during disasters. The Next Generation Warning System grant program, administered by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), has been disrupted after Congress rescinded the CPB's federal funding. Stations that were awarded grants for equipment upgrades, like backup generators, have faced stop-work orders and are uncertain about reimbursement, causing projects to stall. This leaves many rural areas dependent on aging infrastructure as they face increasing threats from extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Amid rising reports of employee burnout, a lifestyle expert suggests practical ways for workers to reduce on-the-job stress and improve work-life balance. Maisha Wynn, author of "The Wynning Way," advises employees to utilize their "high energy time" in the morning for demanding tasks and save simpler activities for later in the day. She also recommends building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create small moments of joy and relief at the desk. A key strategy for avoiding burnout, according to Wynn, is learning to set boundaries and occasionally say "no" to preserve one's own well-being.</p>

The author contends that Article II of the Constitution vests the entire "executive power," including the power of removal, in the president, and that court decisions limiting this power for "independent" agencies are aberrations. The piece asserts that since Fed governors exercise significant executive policymaking authority, they must be subject to presidential removal to ensure political accountability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that while President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve are concerning, the larger and more enduring threat to its independence is the nation's growing public debt. The author explains the concept of "fiscal dominance," where a central bank's monetary policy becomes subordinate to the government's need to finance its debt. As interest payments on the national debt consume a larger portion of the federal budget, pressure will inevitably mount on the Fed to keep interest rates low, regardless of who is president. The article concludes that without congressional action to control spending, the Fed's ability to fight inflation will be compromised.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock fall despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations, driven by a 69% surge in its server business from AI-related demand. The company raised its full-year revenue and earnings forecast, but its guidance for third-quarter earnings per share came in below Wall Street estimates, causing investor concern. Dell attributed the back-loaded profit forecast to seasonality in its storage business, which saw a 3% revenue decline in the second quarter. The company announced it has shipped $10 billion in AI servers in the last two quarters and plans to double that figure next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As seniors face rising costs and concerns about Social Security, managing healthcare expenses remains a primary challenge, as Medicare often does not cover all costs. This article outlines several options for filling these coverage gaps, including Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which can cover copays and deductibles. Other viable strategies for homeowners aged 62 and older include reverse mortgages, which provide access to home equity without requiring monthly repayments. For those concerned about future income, purchasing an annuity can provide a guaranteed stream of monthly payments to cover ongoing medical and living expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a potential club-record fee. The move is significant as it could influence the future of Alexander Isak, who has been a transfer target for Liverpool. Newcastle had previously indicated they would need to secure two quality strikers before considering a sale of Isak. The acquisition of Woltemade, a 6ft 6in forward who scored 17 goals last season and was the top scorer at the recent Under-21 Euros, would be a major first step in meeting that condition.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that current laws fail to prevent individuals with a history of emergency psychiatric holds from purchasing firearms, citing the recent Manhattan shooter as an example. While federal law prohibits gun ownership for those involuntarily committed by a judicial order, many states' temporary "emergency holds" do not trigger this prohibition. The author suggests that states should follow California's lead by implementing a temporary, five-year ban on firearm purchases for individuals placed on such holds. The article also calls for closing a loophole that allows concealed-carry permit holders to bypass background checks and for considering temporary gun-right pauses for individuals prescribed serious antipsychotic medications.</p>

          <p>Police in Minneapolis have stated that locked doors at the Annunciation Catholic school church likely saved "countless lives" during the recent mass shooting. The attacker, Robin Westman, was unable to enter the building and instead fired through the windows, killing two children and injuring 17 others before taking their own life. Investigators believe Westman intended to carry out the attack from inside, having created detailed diagrams of the church's interior and prepared materials to barricade emergency exits. The FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, noting the shooter's writings expressed widespread hate.</p>
