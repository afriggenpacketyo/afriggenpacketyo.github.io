          <p>President Trump downplayed immediate market reactions to his sweeping tariffs, asserting that a manufacturing boom will take 18 months to two years to materialize.  He compared the economic pain to necessary surgery, predicting a future economic surge.  However, manufacturers expressed concern over the complexities and potential negative impacts on their operations, highlighting the potential for higher costs and threats to investment and jobs.  China swiftly retaliated with its own tariffs, further exacerbating market anxieties.</p>

          <p>Oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in years, driven by concerns about a global recession triggered by Trump's tariffs and a larger-than-expected OPEC+ production increase.  The economic uncertainty surrounding the tariffs dampened demand for oil, while the increased supply further pressured prices.  Analysts predict a one-way downward trajectory for oil prices, though lower oil prices could potentially offset some inflationary pressures from the trade war.  The situation reflects the interconnectedness of global markets and the far-reaching effects of Trump's trade policies.</p>
