            <p>Following a deadly New Year's Day attack, a new report suggests making Bourbon Street in New Orleans a permanent pedestrian zone to enhance safety. The report, conducted by Teneo Risk, emphasizes the street's vulnerability to vehicle attacks due to narrow sidewalks and a lack of barriers. The proposal aims to restrict vehicle access to emergency services, deliveries, and hotel drop-offs during specific hours. The report also suggests making the Department of Homeland Security's 'SEAR 1' rating permanent to ensure continued federal resources for security, especially during Mardi Gras, where the city welcomes over a million visitors.</p>

            <p>Amazon delayed the launch of its initial Kuiper internet satellites due to adverse weather conditions at Cape Canaveral, Florida. A United Launch Alliance rocket, set to carry 27 Kuiper satellites, was unable to proceed because of cumulus clouds and strong winds. Amazon is competing with SpaceX's Starlink to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations, and governments. The company faces a July 2026 deadline from the FCC to have half of its 1,618 satellites in orbit.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, is under scrutiny for allegedly using 35 methane gas-burning turbines to power its supercomputer facility in Memphis, despite only having a permit for 15. The Southern Environmental Law Center claims these generators are a significant source of air pollution, violating the Clean Air Act. The facility, known as Colossus, requires immense energy, and while xAI has contracts with the local utility, it appears to be using the generators to address power fluctuation issues. Local residents express concerns about the impact on air quality in a historically Black area already burdened by industrial pollution.</p>

            <p>President Trump has paused higher tariffs for most countries for 90 days, but has significantly increased tariffs on China, signaling a renewed focus on trade tensions with Beijing. Trump stated the increase was due to China's retaliation and lack of respect. This move aims to disrupt the global trade system centered on China and its export-driven economic model. The future depends on whether China is willing to negotiate and make major concessions, including overhauling its economic model, and whether the US still believes in free trade.</p>

Defense attorneys are seeking to delay the dismissal, fearing deportation to El Salvador without due process. Charging documents made only a fleeting reference to his alleged affiliation with MS-13, and he was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced a significant surge after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on most 'reciprocal tariffs', with the exception of China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared nearly 8%, while the S&P 500 had its best day since October 2008. The gains were widespread, with tech stocks and airlines leading the rally. Despite the pause, uncertainty remains regarding the future of tariffs and the impact of increased tariffs on China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has temporarily suspended higher tariffs for most countries, reversing course after previously insisting on sweeping 'reciprocal' tariffs. The White House claims this pause is strategic, intended to prompt individual countries to negotiate with the US. However, the move comes after investor panic and growing criticism of the tariffs. The details of the tariff suspension remain unclear, leaving US trading partners to scrutinize Trump's announcements for specific information.</p>

            <p>Milwaukee is home to Ascent, the world's tallest timber-concrete hybrid building, which developers see as a model for future construction. Ascent, a 284-foot luxury apartment building, is primarily made of wood, making building costs comparable to traditional structures. The use of mass timber, made from pre-fabricated pieces of glued wood, is more environmentally friendly than steel and concrete, as it has a lighter carbon footprint. The building's timber was tested for fire resistance, and it burned slowly enough to meet building codes.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. praised the U.S. measles response, comparing it favorably to Europe, despite an ongoing outbreak in Texas. Kennedy cited European measles cases and deaths, but experts caution against broad comparisons due to disparities in healthcare access and vaccination coverage. While U.S. cases are lower than the entire WHO European region, smaller, more comparable European countries have similar or better outcomes. Experts also worry about underreporting of cases and higher mortality rates in the U.S. outbreak.</p>
