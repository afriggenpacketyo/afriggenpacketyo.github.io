          <p>Hamas has declared its intention to release Edan Alexander, a US-Israeli hostage, as a goodwill gesture to advance ceasefire negotiations with Israel and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under blockade for 70 days. This announcement precedes President Trump's visit to the Middle East and follows direct negotiations between Hamas and a US administration official in Qatar. Alexander, captured during the October 7 attack, is believed to be the last living US citizen among the hostages. The Israeli Prime Minister's office confirmed being informed by the US of Hamas's plan, viewing it as a potential catalyst for further hostage negotiations.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to stop covering Zepbound, a popular obesity drug, in favor of Wegovy, despite research indicating that Zepbound leads to greater weight loss. This decision is driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, impacting patients' access to treatments.
