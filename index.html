          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures to the eastern United States this week, with the National Weather Service issuing warnings for the Midwest to the East Coast. More than 150 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, with the total number affected rising to about 200 million, marking one of the most expansive heat alert events ever. The heat wave is caused by a heat dome, an area of high pressure that traps heat and humidity, and is particularly dangerous as the human body has not yet adjusted to the warmer temperatures. Experts advise staying indoors with air conditioning, staying hydrated, and being aware of symptoms of overheating to avoid heat-related illnesses. The high temperatures are expected to linger through the first half of the week. The optimism score reflects the potential dangers of the heat wave. </p>

The amendment expresses concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the consequences on the jobs market and on people's health.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, including to conflict-ridden places like South Sudan. This decision pauses a ruling by a Boston-based federal judge who argued that immigrants deserved a 'meaningful opportunity' to bring claims that they would face torture, persecution, or even death if removed to certain countries. Simultaneously, Donald Trump claimed that Israel and Iran had agreed to a 'Complete and Total CEASEFIRE'. The optimism score reflects the mixed nature of these events. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018 and reached a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023. These imports are particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, strengthening China's dominant position in the global heavy rare earths supply chain. This dynamic has led to a supply chain where extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are carried out in China. The optimism score reflects the potential for geopolitical and environmental risks. (not investment advice)</p>
