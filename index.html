          <p>French Prime Minister François Bayrou's government has been ousted after losing a parliamentary no-confidence vote, marking the third prime minister to fall in the past year. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's proposed austerity measures, which aimed to address France's significant national debt but faced widespread opposition from both left-wing and far-right parties. This political turmoil intensifies pressure on President Emmanuel Macron, who must now appoint a new prime minister or risk further instability by calling for snap elections, a move demanded by opposition leader Marine Le Pen.</p>

          <p>A new mural attributed to the elusive street artist Banksy has emerged on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a grounded protester, a theme that appears to critique the legal system's handling of public demonstrations, particularly following recent mass arrests. Shortly after Banksy authenticated the piece on Instagram, court officials covered it and stated it would be removed, citing the building's listed status which requires its original character to be maintained. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident as potential criminal damage.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,600 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst growing global economic uncertainty. This represents a significant climb of over 38% since the beginning of the year. Despite the peak prices, several major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, are forecasting further increases, with some projections reaching $4,000 by mid-2026. Factors such as a weakening labor market and the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts are fueling this bullish outlook for the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her first televised interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, stating that the ruling returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process rather than making it illegal. She also addressed criticisms of the court's emergency "shadow docket" and rejected the notion that the justices operate with a political agenda. Barrett spoke candidly about the personal cost of her role, including receiving death threats and the need for a "stiff spine" to withstand criticism from all sides of the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted lower court restrictions on aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in central California, allowing federal agents to resume stops that critics have labeled unconstitutional racial profiling. A temporary restraining order had been imposed after a court found that agents likely violated the Fourth Amendment by targeting individuals based on race or ethnicity.

          <p>President Trump has announced that the Department of Education will soon issue new guidance aimed at protecting the right to prayer in public schools. Speaking at the Bible Museum, the president framed the move as a defense of religious liberty against what he described as "anti-religious propaganda" in education. The announcement is part of a broader administration effort to appeal to religious conservatives by supporting their interests on social issues. Trump also highlighted his administration's support for school choice scholarships and its stance on transgender students in sports during his address.</p>

The Second Circuit panel dismissed Trump's argument that he was protected by presidential immunity, stating he failed to provide grounds for reconsidering its prior ruling on the matter. The court also found that the damages awarded by the jury were fair and reasonable, given the high degree of reprehensibility of Trump's conduct. This ruling affirms the significant legal and financial consequences stemming from his repeated denials of Carroll's sexual abuse allegations.</p>

          <p>China's export growth decelerated in August, increasing by 4.4% compared to the previous year, down from a 7.2% jump in July and marking the slowest pace since the start of 2025. The slowdown reflects ongoing trade tensions, particularly with the United States, as Chinese exports to the U.S. plummeted by 33% amid tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite the overall slowdown, China maintained a large trade surplus, a contentious issue with its major trading partners. The data indicates that global economic headwinds and trade disputes are continuing to impact the world's second-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a crowded bus stop in north Jerusalem, killing six people and wounding several others in one of the deadliest such attacks in recent months. Israeli police reported that a security officer and a civilian at the scene neutralized two attackers. The militant group Hamas praised the attack, calling it a natural response to Israel's military actions in Gaza. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions as Israel expands its operations in Gaza City and a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire proposal is being considered by both sides of the nearly two-year-long conflict.</p>

          <p>The new UK Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has stated that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with deals to return their own citizens who have no right to be in the UK. The proposal was discussed at a meeting of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance as a potential coordinated action to address illegal immigration. This policy consideration comes as the UK government faces mounting pressure to reduce the number of small boat crossings in the English Channel, which saw a near-record number of arrivals on Saturday. The total number of arrivals this year has already surpassed 30,000.</p>

          <p>The theatrical release of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical "Hamilton" is being framed as a significant cultural and political counter-narrative to the current political climate in the United States. This article argues that the film's diverse casting and pro-immigrant themes serve as a powerful rebuke to the anti-DEI and anti-immigrant rhetoric of the Trump administration. By telling the story of the nation's founding with actors of color, the production inherently challenges a whitewashed version of American history. Its arrival on the big screen amplifies its message of inclusivity at a time of intense national debate over diversity and historical narratives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid signs of a weakening U.S. job market, financial experts are advising student loan borrowers on how to manage their debt if they become unemployed. For federal loan holders, options include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, which can lower monthly payments to as little as $0 based on income, including unemployment benefits. Other relief measures like Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment can temporarily pause payments, though interest may still accrue on some loans. Borrowers with private loans have fewer options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to inquire about potential assistance programs.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll highlights a stark and widening partisan gap in how Americans view capitalism and socialism. While a majority of U.S. adults overall still view capitalism more positively, Democrats have increasingly warmed to socialism, with 66% now holding a favorable view of it compared to just 42% for capitalism. Conversely, Republican favorability towards socialism remains extremely low at 14%. The survey indicates a significant shift over the past 15 years, particularly among Democrats under 50, reflecting growing concerns about economic fairness and creating a complex political dynamic for the Democratic party's national platform.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has postponed a pretrial hearing for former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces charges of crimes against humanity over his deadly anti-drug crackdown. The 80-year-old's lawyers argued that he is not medically fit to stand trial, prompting judges to grant a delay to assess his health. Duterte is the first former Asian president to be charged by the ICC, with prosecutors investigating thousands of killings that occurred during his tenure. The postponement has been met with disappointment from the families of alleged victims, who fear justice will be delayed indefinitely.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that Chagas disease, a potentially fatal condition transmitted by the "kissing bug," may be becoming endemic in the United States. While historically prevalent in Central and South America, locally acquired human cases have now been reported in eight states, including Texas, California, and Tennessee, with the insect itself found in 32 states. The disease is caused by a parasite passed through the insect's feces, often near a bite wound. Without treatment, the infection can lead to severe, life-threatening heart and digestive problems over time.</p>
