          <p>Amazon has confirmed that it is laying off approximately 100 employees within its devices and services division, which includes Alexa, Echo, Ring, and Zoox. The company cited efforts to operate more efficiently and better align with its product roadmap as reasons for the cuts. This move is part of a broader cost-cutting initiative led by CEO Andy Jassy, which has resulted in 27,000 layoffs since 2022, with other tech companies like Microsoft also trimming their workforces in similar efforts to reduce management layers and increase efficiency. Amazon continues to hire within the devices and services division despite the layoffs.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with significant legislation aimed at enacting President Trump's domestic agenda, despite facing opposition from Democrats and internal divisions within their own party. The proposed bill includes extensions to Trump's 2017 tax cuts, temporary measures to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, and cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies to offset the bill's $3.8 trillion cost. While House leaders express confidence in passing the bill before the Memorial Day recess, conservative lawmakers argue the Medicaid cuts don't go far enough, and Republicans from high-tax states are dissatisfied with the state and local tax deduction provisions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar as a temporary replacement for Air Force One has sparked a rift within MAGA world. While Trump defends the move as a way to avoid flying in an outdated plane, some allies criticize it as swampy and unpatriotic. The plan raises security and ethical concerns, as the Qatari aircraft would require extensive modifications to meet American military standards.

          <p>Missouri Republicans are attempting to reinstate an abortion ban through a ballot measure in 2026, seeking to reverse a recent decision by voters to overturn a near-total ban. The measure would amend the state Constitution to ban abortion except in medical emergencies, or in cases of sexual assault if reported to police within 48 hours and the pregnancy is less than 12 weeks along. The move bucks the trend of voters siding with abortion rights in other states, and faces opposition from Democrats and abortion rights groups, who call the measure a deceptive assault on voters.</p>
