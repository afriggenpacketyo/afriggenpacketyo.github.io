          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued strong condemnations of Israel's plans to escalate the war in Gaza, citing disproportionate actions and the blockade of humanitarian aid amid famine warnings. Britain has suspended free-trade agreement talks with Israel, while all three countries demand an end to the renewed military offensive. Prime Minister Netanyahu responded by accusing them of encouraging further attacks akin to the October 7th events. The article highlights a shift in diplomatic support due to the rising Palestinian death toll and dire humanitarian conditions, with the US also expressing concern over the situation.

          <p>An interim U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, has charged Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, with assaulting federal agents during an incident at an immigrant-detention facility. The article suggests this action is politically motivated, intended to punish criticism and intimidate Democrats, given Trump's history of using the Justice Department for retribution. It contrasts this case with others, such as the lenient treatment of January 6th rioters, arguing the administration lacks commitment to defending law enforcement impartially. The article concludes by questioning how the American public will respond to this apparent attempt to make dissent illegal.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is implementing temporary flight restrictions at Newark Liberty International Airport due to technology outages, staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, and ongoing runway construction. Flights will be capped at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, with slightly higher limits afterward through October 25. United Airlines, the airport's largest operator, supports the restrictions, aiming to ensure safer and more reliable operations. The FAA acknowledges a significant shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbating the issues, with recent near misses further straining the system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled plans to construct a new missile defense shield, dubbed "Golden Dome," estimated to cost $175 billion and become operational in three years. The project, led by Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, aims to intercept threats from space and integrates with existing defense capabilities. While some experts believe improving the nation's ability to fend off aerial threats is overdue, others question the feasibility of developing such a comprehensive system within three years. Democrats have criticized the steep price tag, while Republicans have largely expressed support for the initiative.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily blocked a southern California school district from enforcing its ban on critical race theory (CRT), citing the resolution's vague nature and potential unconstitutionality. The court expressed concern over educators' confusion and fear resulting from the policy, negatively impacting education. The ruling is part of a long-running legal battle over the CRT ban, adopted by the Temecula Valley Board of Education in December 2022. The conflict over CRT in education has been divisive in Temecula, with conservative school board members elected in 2022 after running in opposition to mask mandates and "sexualized" material in school curriculums.</p>

Aggressive prostate cancers can develop rapidly between screenings or may not be detected by PSA tests. Doctors emphasize the importance of discussing the risks and benefits of screening with physicians, noting that treatments can have devastating side effects, especially in older men.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed his chief spokesman, Sean Parnell, to lead a panel reviewing the U.S. military’s 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. This decision is unusual, reflecting skepticism that military leaders would hold each other accountable. The review's scope will likely exclude decisions leading up to the withdrawal, including the Trump administration's deal with the Taliban. Parnell will be joined by former Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller, who criticized senior military officials after a suicide bombing in Kabul, suggesting a focus on accountability for uniformed military leaders.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers allege that the U.S. government may have deported migrants from countries like Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan, violating a court order requiring due process rights. The lawyers argue that deportation to South Sudan poses a significant risk of harm due to widespread violence and instability. The U.S. government has not confirmed this arrangement, but the allegations have prompted an emergency motion to prohibit deportations to South Sudan and order the return of those already deported. The Trump administration has been mounting an aggressive diplomatic campaign to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has issued an executive directive to support local film and TV jobs by streamlining city processes and lowering costs for on-location filming. The order requires city departments to make iconic locations more accessible and affordable, reduce the number of city staff monitoring filming, and institute a proactive approach to communication with production companies. The move aims to address the decline in on-location production in Los Angeles, which has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and recent wildfires.

          <p>The FDA has announced that it will limit access to seasonal Covid-19 boosters for healthy Americans under 65 without clear evidence of clinical benefit. Under the new framework, boosters will be available for Americans over 65 and for those with conditions that increase their risk of severe Covid-19. For lower-risk groups, the FDA will require what the authors describe as “robust, gold-standard data” from drugmakers before approval is granted. Critics of the new guidelines say it will limit access for people who want the booster, including parents and their children.</p>

          <p>The FDA will permit use of Covid vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, but will require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. The agency leaders said that at this point, the additional doses offer “uncertain” benefits to many young and middle-aged people who have already been vaccinated or have had Covid. Before approving Covid vaccines for wider use, the F.D.A. “anticipates the need” for new clinical trials in which participants under 65 are randomly assigned to receive the new shots or a placebo. The decision marks a departure from the previous policy of offering annual Covid shots to everyone 6 months and older.</p>

          <p>Johnpaul began using nicotine pouches to help him get off vapes – but says it just led to another addiction. At one stage he was using 15 pouches a day, although the 16-year-old has now cut back to five. Health experts say the pouches – small sachets that fit between the top lip and the gum, nicknamed "snus" by some teenagers - are addictive and may have other harmful side effects. They are largely unregulated in the UK and there is currently no law to stop children buying them.</p>
