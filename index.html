            <p>The annual Lyrid meteor shower, known as one of the oldest observed meteor showers, is expected to be visible from Wednesday night through April 25. These meteors are debris trails from Comet Thatcher, which was first documented in 1861. To best view the shower, find a dark sky away from city lights, lie flat on your back, and allow your eyes to adjust for 30-45 minutes. The peak viewing time is expected around April 21 and 22.</p>

            <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have detected potential biosignatures, specifically dimethyl sulfide, in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, which is located in the habitable zone around a distant star. On Earth, this gas is primarily produced by marine microbes, suggesting the possibility of life on this ocean-covered world. While researchers are excited, they emphasize the need for further observations to confirm the presence of the gas and rule out non-biological sources. The scientific community is urged to analyze the data independently to verify the findings.</p>

            <p>Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are reassessing their security strategies in response to Donald Trump's return to the White House and concerns about Washington's commitment to its allies. Strategies include seeking new security assurances from the US, increasing defense spending, and considering the development of independent nuclear deterrents. The focus is on the Taiwan Strait, where China's assertiveness is raising tensions, and the region's response to potential trade disruptions caused by US tariffs.

            <p>The Trump administration has effectively shut down the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, placing all staff on administrative leave. This agency, created in 1987 to coordinate the federal response to homelessness, had fewer than 20 employees and a budget of just over $4 million. The move is part of an executive order on reducing the federal bureaucracy, potentially shifting homelessness policy away from a "housing first" approach.

            <p>Fyre Festival 2, organized by Billy McFarland, has been postponed with no new date set, and refunds are being issued to ticket holders. The event, scheduled to take place in Mexico, faced uncertainty as officials denied that any event of that name would be held there. McFarland countered by sharing screenshots of conversations and permits with the government of Playa Del Carmen. The original Fyre Festival in 2017 was a notorious disaster that led to McFarland's conviction for wire fraud.</p>

            <p>The trade battle between the United States and China is driving a decoupling of the world's two largest economies, splintering global supply chains. With tariffs on some items reaching triple digits, manufacturers are seeking workarounds, including smuggling and other risky practices. This era of evasive logistics raises questions about the future of global trade and the effectiveness of tariffs. The effective tariff rate, factoring in existing tariffs, is nearing 156 percent.</p>

            <p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared autism a rapidly growing "epidemic" and vowed to identify the "environmental toxin" responsible. He cited increasing autism incidence and contrasted his approach with past research focused on genetic causes. Researchers and advocates pushed back, noting that autism research points to a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Some expressed concern over Kennedy's past statements linking autism with vaccines and the stigmatizing nature of some of his remarks.</p>
