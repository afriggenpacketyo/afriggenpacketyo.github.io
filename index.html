          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are scheduled to sign a US-brokered peace agreement on June 27, aiming to end fighting in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have made advances. The agreement includes provisions for respecting territorial integrity, prohibiting hostilities, disengaging, disarming, and integrating non-state armed groups. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will witness the signing, signaling the Trump administration's effort to halt the conflict and attract Western investment to the mineral-rich region. Previous ceasefires have failed, and it remains unclear if the Congo River Alliance will adhere to the deal. The agreement builds on principles signed in April, but the success hinges on the commitment of all parties to uphold the terms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Escalating tensions between Israel and Iran have caused a spike in shipping insurance costs for vessels navigating the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for Gulf journeys, up from 0.125% before Israel's recent attack on Iran. War risk insurance rates for the Red Sea have also risen, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%. These reassessments reflect the deteriorating security environment in the Middle East, raising concerns about a broader conflict and potential U.S. intervention. Despite the risks, cargo flow continues in the region, but the situation is being closely monitored by insurers and businesses alike.</p>

CEO Elon Musk's SpaceX assured that there were no hazards to nearby communities and requested that people avoid the site, with the company working with local officials to address the incident.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has suspended all activities in the region, urging residents to stay home or seek shelter in low-lying areas.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a dilemma in negotiating with the U.S. over tariffs, particularly on autos, as he aims to protect Japan's national interests ahead of an upcoming election. Despite multiple rounds of negotiations, a deal remains elusive, with Japan resisting pressure to concede on auto tariffs, which are crucial to its export-driven economy. Ishiba emphasizes the need for an agreement that benefits both sides, while also upholding Japan's commitment to free trade under multilateral arrangements. Failure to reach a deal could have economic repercussions, especially for smaller suppliers, and could also impact Japan's diplomatic standing in Asia. The Prime Minister is trying to set a precedent for other countries that negotiations on U.S. tariffs can produce results that can benefit both sides, not one side.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing injuries and significant damage, while another missile hit a high-rise near Tel Aviv. In response, Israel conducted strikes on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, escalating the conflict between the two nations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the hospital attack and vowed retaliation, as President Trump considers direct U.S. involvement. The Arak reactor is a concern due to its potential for producing plutonium, which could be used in nuclear weapons, and the International Atomic Energy Agency has urged Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites, but inspectors have limited access. The developments mark a dangerous escalation in the ongoing conflict, with both sides exchanging attacks and casualties rising.</p>

          <p>Critics are expressing alarm over what they describe as Donald Trump's rapid shift towards authoritarianism, citing actions such as the arrest of opposition politicians and a judge, deployment of masked agents, and the potential suspension of habeas corpus.

Academics are warning that the U.S. is trending towards a lower score on democratic measures, potentially falling further in the coming years. Concerns are also being raised about Trump's efforts to politicize the military and expand the powers of the presidency, potentially undermining democratic safeguards.</p>

The Princess of Wales, who is now cancer-free, is adopting a case-by-case approach to engagements, with her decisions being responsible and dignified. The cancellation was attributed to the ongoing heatwave in the U.K. and the need for Kate to listen to her body, as she continues to navigate the challenges of recovery.</p>

          <p>Japan's policy of making high school tuition free, even for private institutions, is causing concern among educators who fear it may lead to an exodus from public schools and exacerbate inequalities. Critics argue that the policy, implemented to ease financial burdens, lacks adequate support for struggling public schools facing declining enrollment and budget shortfalls. Public schools, which have traditionally served as safety nets for diverse students, may struggle to compete with private schools without additional resources. Some analysts suggest the government should focus on providing resources and crafting a vision for the high school system to address these challenges.</p>

The Juventus team, including US internationals, appeared uncomfortable with the query, and the team's general manager attempted to steer the conversation towards their women's team.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a compact, portable neutron gun powered by a controlled nuclear reaction between hydrogen and lithium. This breakthrough in neutron generation technology has potential applications in scientific, industrial, and defense sectors. The device uses an electromagnetic technique to achieve nuclear fusion, producing a beam with 10 billion fast neutrons per second, each packing 3 million electron volts of energy. Unlike previous designs requiring massive accelerators, this portable gun could offer new possibilities for material analysis and other applications.</p>

Consular officers will be monitoring posts and messages deemed hostile to the U.S., its government, culture, or founding principles. Applicants who refuse to grant access to their social media accounts may face visa rejection, as it could be seen as an attempt to evade screening. The State Department has also instructed consulates to prioritize students enrolling at colleges with a lower percentage of foreign students, adding scrutiny for international students in the U.S.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has suspended NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over deals made with China covering infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. Wellington, the Cook Islands' biggest funder, claims it was not informed about the agreements, leading to a breakdown in trust. Fresh funding will be reconsidered once the Cook Islands takes steps to repair the relationship and restore trust. The move highlights growing concerns among US allies, including New Zealand, about China's increasing influence in the Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the complexities and potential consequences of regime change in Iran, arguing that while removing the repressive theocratic regime would be desirable, it is a difficult and risky undertaking. The author cautions against naivety, citing the problematic outcomes of regime change efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. While a successful overthrow could disrupt terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and provide relief for Ukraine, the author emphasizes the lack of a viable Iranian government-in-waiting and the potential for civic instability and prolonged conflict. The article concludes that regime change is a messy business, and the outcome in Iran is uncertain and potentially dangerous.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is facing a demographic challenge as large numbers of young women are leaving the country due to the ongoing war, seeking education and opportunities abroad. With young men restricted from leaving due to martial law, the emigration of young women is causing a brain drain and raising concerns about who will rebuild the country after the war. Many students express a desire for a better life in another country, driven by the stress of war and limited career opportunities in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government is investing in education and career opportunities to encourage young people to stay or return, but the long-term impact of this emigration remains uncertain.</p>
