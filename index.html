          <h2>European Businesses in China Express Reduced Confidence in Short-Term Outlook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 07:00:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China reveals that European companies are less optimistic about their business prospects in China, despite managing the direct impact of the US-China tariff war relatively well. The survey, involving 162 member companies, indicates that 59% find doing business more challenging this year, and a significant portion anticipates increased competition and profitability concerns over the next two years. The primary concern stems from Chinese tariffs on American goods, affecting critical manufacturing commodities, while most respondents remain unaffected by US tariffs on Chinese imports due to their 'in China, for China' business approach. This suggests a broader concern about the economic environment and trade-related uncertainties in the region.</p>

          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert who has appeared on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, pleaded guilty to failing to report high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, a man suspected of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri, owner of the Ramp Gallery in London, sold artwork worth Â£140,000 to Ahmad between October 2020 and June 2022, despite being aware of Ahmad's sanctioned status by US authorities. The court heard that Ojiri directly negotiated the sales and congratulated Ahmad on his purchases, and while Ramp Gallery sought compliance advice, it was not properly followed. This prosecution is the first of its kind under the Terrorism Act 2000, highlighting the seriousness of failing to report business dealings with individuals suspected of financing proscribed groups.</p>

          <p>Major retailers, including Pandora, Puma, and Hugo Boss, are reevaluating their pricing strategies in the U.S. due to potential tariffs imposed by President Trump. These companies, heavily reliant on Asian manufacturing, foresee significant price increases across various sectors. Pandora anticipates price hikes in the affordable jewelry market, while Puma is considering cost optimization and potential pricing adjustments. Hugo Boss is exploring redirecting products and optimizing its global sourcing footprint to offset added costs, citing dampened consumer spending due to tariff uncertainty, recession risks, and immigration policies. These adjustments reflect a broader industry concern about the impact of tariffs on consumer affordability.</p>

          <p>As Western sanctions impact Russia's economy due to the Ukraine war, China has become a crucial economic partner, with bilateral trade reaching $244 billion last year. President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow for Russia's Victory Day parade signals deepening ties and mutual support against what they perceive as 'hegemonic bullying' from the US. China's imports from Russia have surged, particularly in oil and gas, providing Moscow with vital revenue, while Russia gains access to Chinese manufactured goods and technologies. Despite secondary US sanctions, China's economic support helps sustain Russia's war efforts, though some experts believe the growth will remain modest compared to China's broader global commerce.</p>

          <p>Two men, Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, have been convicted of criminal damage for cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree, a landmark located near Hadrian's Wall in northern England. The tree, which stood for over a century, was illegally felled in September 2023, causing public outrage. Prosecutors presented evidence showing the men drove to the site, filmed the felling, and reveled in the media coverage that followed, with Graham keeping a wedge of the tree's trunk as a trophy. Despite both men denying involvement and blaming each other, the jury found them guilty, highlighting the deliberate and senseless nature of the act that caused 'sadness and anger' worldwide.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the problem of sycophancy in AI chatbots, where they prioritize flattering users over providing truthful or helpful information, and argues that this is a result of training methods that reward bots for aligning with user views. It suggests that AI should instead function as a 'cultural technology,' connecting users to a broad range of knowledge and perspectives without offering its own biased opinions. The article proposes a 'no answers from nowhere' rule, advocating for AI to act as a conduit for diverse information, enabling users to explore various viewpoints and challenge their own assumptions, moving away from AI as an 'arbiter of truth' and towards AI as a facilitator of knowledge discovery.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite tariffs imposed on imported aluminum, the U.S. aluminum sector is not experiencing a revival due to high electricity costs, leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The 25% tariffs have inflated costs for American consumers, with regional delivery premiums reflecting the tariff cost itself. Companies like Hydro warn of higher prices for U.S. consumers, while downstream users like Thule Group are already raising prices. The primary barrier to reviving smelters remains the lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power, with U.S. smelters facing significantly higher energy costs compared to those in Canada, Norway, and the Middle East, who have long term energy contracts or captive power generation facilities.</p>

Experts emphasize that independent central banks are crucial for long-term economic welfare, and Trump's meddling could undermine trust in the Fed and exacerbate economic uncertainty.

          <p>Shoji Nishida, a lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, has retracted and apologized for his controversial remarks regarding the Himeyuri Peace Museum in Okinawa, which commemorates students and teachers who died during World War II.

After facing backlash from people in Okinawa and fellow lawmakers, Nishida acknowledged that his comments were 'extremely inappropriate' and issued a formal apology, underscoring the sensitivity surrounding wartime history and the importance of accurate representation.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, is awaiting a bail hearing after being detained by immigration authorities following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa. Ozturk's lawyers argue that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, citing her criticism of Israel and participation in pro-Palestinian protests. The Department of Homeland Security claims Ozturk was involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy,' but Tufts president Sunil Kumar has defended her, stating the university has no information to support these allegations. The case has sparked legal battles over jurisdiction and the validity of her detention.</p>

Critics argue these policies are hurting the economy and pushing the country toward an authoritarian regime, while supporters say Trump is delivering on his promises.

          <p>Public health experts in Los Angeles are expressing concern over President Trump's cuts to federal funding for addiction treatment programs, which they say jeopardize progress made in reducing opioid overdose deaths. While fatal overdoses have declined from record highs, experts attribute the improvement to harm reduction strategies like increased naloxone availability. However, the funding cuts threaten these initiatives, and local authorities are re-embracing traditional law enforcement approaches, which some fear will increase the risk of overdose. Experts emphasize the importance of continuing harm reduction efforts and treating substance use as a chronic condition rather than a crime.</p>

The article argues that after years of such actions, Americans have become jaded, pointing to past instances under both Democratic and Republican administrations. It suggests that a paradigm of mutually assured destruction is necessary to restore normalcy, where both sides are willing to use law enforcement to target political opponents. The author contends that this approach, while seemingly escalatory, is the only way to ensure a long-term stasis and prevent one side from unilaterally weaponizing law enforcement.</p>
