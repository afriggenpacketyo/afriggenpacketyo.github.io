While India's property market is experiencing a boom, China is grappling with a severe housing crisis, marked by falling prices and a 10.7% drop in real estate investment. Despite India's surge, the analysis concludes that it cannot be considered a substitute for China's market, which plays a more critical role in Asia and is supported by stronger fundamentals.

The changes, which now aim to save Â£2 billion instead of an initial Â£5 billion, follow threats from over 120 Labour MPs to vote against the original plans. Despite the U-turn, some MPs remain opposed, citing concerns over the poverty impact of the remaining cuts on vulnerable people.</p>

          <p>Newly promoted sumo grand champion Onosato has announced his goal to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, a feat achieved by only a few wrestlers in their yokozuna debut. The 25-year-old, who reached the sport's highest rank after just 13 tournaments, is the first new Japanese-born yokozuna since 2017. He hopes his performance will energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year.</p>

Patterson is charged with intentionally spiking the meal with death cap mushrooms during a family lunch in July 2023, which also left a fourth guest seriously ill. The defense maintains that the poisoning was a tragic accident, while the prosecution argues it was a deliberate and calculated act.</p>
