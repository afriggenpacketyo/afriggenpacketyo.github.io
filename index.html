          <p>Belgian cyclist Tim Merlier secured a narrow victory in the third stage of the Tour de France, edging out Jonathan Milan in a dramatic sprint finish. The 178.3km stage was marred by several crashes, one of which forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race. Despite the chaos, overall race leader Mathieu van der Poel retained the yellow jersey, with top contenders Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard finishing safely in the main group. The day also saw the recovery of 11 bikes that had been stolen from the Cofidis team truck.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old man from Michigan, identified as Ryan Lewis Mosqueda, was shot and killed by law enforcement after he opened fire at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas. The suspect, wearing tactical gear, fired dozens of rounds at the building's entrance, injuring two police officers and a border patrol employee before being neutralized. Authorities, who found additional weapons in his vehicle, have not yet determined a motive for the attack. The FBI has taken over the investigation, and officials believe there is no further threat to the community.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a blanket 25% tariff on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. The announcement was made via letters shared on social media, which stated the new rates are necessary to address persistent trade deficits with the two nations. These tariffs are separate from any additional sector-specific duties and include measures to prevent transshipping to evade the higher rates. The news prompted a downturn in U.S. financial markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 1%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 89 deaths, with dozens of people, including children from a summer camp, still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities and Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp that suffered at least 27 fatalities among campers and staff. In response, President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the hardest-hit area, Kerr County, as extensive search and rescue operations continue. Officials warn the number of missing persons is likely higher than confirmed, as many campers were in the area.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk following the tech billionaire's announcement of a new political party, called the "American Party." Trump described the move as "ridiculous" and claimed Musk has gone "completely 'off the rails,'" stating that third parties only create disruption and chaos. The conflict marks a significant falling out between the two, who had previously maintained a close relationship, with Musk having been a major donor and an appointee in the Trump administration. Trump also criticized Musk's previous support for electric vehicle mandates, which his administration recently ended.</p>

          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a new peer-to-peer messaging app called Bitchat, which functions without an internet connection by using Bluetooth mesh networks. The app is designed for ephemeral, encrypted communication between nearby devices, allowing messages to be relayed from phone to phone to extend range. This model ensures privacy and censorship-resistance, as messages are stored only on-device and no central servers or personal data are required. The project reflects Dorsey's ongoing interest in decentralizing communication technologies to maintain connectivity during internet shutdowns.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a provision in a new domestic policy bill that would eliminate its access to Medicaid reimbursements. The organization argues the measure is an unconstitutional and targeted attack designed to punish it for its role in the public debate over abortion. In its complaint, Planned Parenthood stated that defunding its nearly 600 health centers, which serve over a million Medicaid patients annually, would have "catastrophic consequences" for public health.

          <p>A CNBC analysis, drawing on insights from economists and officials, highlights the growing risks associated with the U.S. national deficit, which now exceeds 6% of GDP. Experts warn that the current debt trajectory, unlinked to war or economic crisis, could lead to severe consequences for markets, the economy, and international relations. Prominent investors see classic signs of a late-stage debt cycle, while others point to risks of inflation, reduced private investment, and a diminished capacity for defense spending. The report suggests the U.S. may have less than two decades to correct its fiscal course. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro has criticized Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, for not moving the company's manufacturing operations out of China at a faster pace. Navarro described the situation as the "longest-running soap opera in Silicon Valley," accusing Cook of continually asking for more time to shift production. The comments come as President Trump escalates pressure on Apple to move its iPhone production to the U.S., threatening tariffs of 25% or more on phones made abroad. Navarro argued that with modern manufacturing techniques, it is "inconceivable" that Apple cannot produce its iPhones elsewhere.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old former In-N-Out employee has filed a $3 million lawsuit against the burger chain, alleging he was wrongfully terminated due to racial discrimination over his hairstyle. The plaintiff, Elijah Obeng, claims that after complying with company policy by braiding his hair, he was repeatedly told to shave his sideburns, which he considers part of his cultural identity. After refusing, he was fired. The lawsuit accuses In-N-Out of enforcing racially biased grooming policies and may leverage California's CROWN Act, which prohibits discrimination based on hair texture and protective hairstyles associated with race.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable display of sportsmanship, South Africa's acting cricket captain, Wiaan Mulder, chose to declare his team's innings, leaving himself stranded at 367 not out and passing up a chance to break a legendary record. Mulder was just 33 runs short of Brian Lara's all-time highest individual Test score of 400. He explained the decision was made both for the team's strategic advantage and out of respect for Lara, stating the West Indies legend deserved to keep his iconic record. The gesture was widely noted as a tribute to one of the game's greats.</p>

The Center for Asbestos Related Disease (CARD) has long served the community, where decades of exposure from a local vermiculite mine caused widespread health issues. A lawsuit by BNSF Railway has resulted in the seizure of the clinic's assets, and a critical $3 million federal grant is also at risk under the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts.
