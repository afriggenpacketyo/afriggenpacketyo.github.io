            <p>Severe storms caused deadly flooding in Moore, Oklahoma, resulting in the deaths of an adult woman and a 12-year-old boy who were trapped in a vehicle. The police reported numerous water rescues as heavy rainfall inundated the area, leading to hazardous road conditions. Forecasters warned of continued severe weather across the southern and midwestern United States, including East Texas, the Ozarks, and the mid-Mississippi Valley, with potential for destructive winds, large hail, and tornadoes. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for parts of Oklahoma. The worst of the storms are expected to subside by Monday. Optimism score: 5</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in a Texas detention center under the Alien Enemies Act, following an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the act, potentially sending individuals to dangerous foreign prisons without due process. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted hastily. The White House claimed the detainees were foreign terrorists, while the ACLU cited concerns over their potential transfer to a notorious Salvadoran prison. Optimism score: 40</p>
