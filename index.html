        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced significant declines on Monday following a resurgence of trade tensions between China and the U.S. China declared it was "not afraid of" a trade war after President Trump threatened 100% retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports. This renewed friction, stemming from China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, caused Hong Kong's Hang Seng index to fall over 3% and mainland China's CSI 300 to drop nearly 2%. The uncertainty also led to substantial losses in U.S. markets on Friday, wiping out $2 trillion in market value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's September exports grew 8.3% year-on-year, surpassing economists' estimates, while imports jumped 7.4%, marking their strongest gain in over a year. This robust trade performance occurred amidst escalating tensions with the U.S., including President Trump's threat of additional 100% tariffs and China's expanded restrictions on rare earth exports. Both nations also threatened reciprocal port fees. China's Commerce Ministry urged dialogue, stating that tariff threats are not conducive to relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly considering providing Ukraine with Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles, a move he described as a "new step of aggression" in its ongoing conflict with Russia. This consideration follows recent discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks. Moscow has previously issued warnings that supplying such long-range weapons would significantly escalate the conflict and strain U.S.-Russian relations. Tomahawk missiles have a range that could potentially reach Moscow, which Trump suggested could be used as leverage in future peace talks.</p>

          <p>A brawl erupted between Kansas City Chiefs and Detroit Lions players after the Chiefs' 30-17 victory. The altercation began when Lions defensive back Brian Branch appeared to snub Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes during a post-game handshake. Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster intervened, leading to a physical confrontation where Branch shoved Smith-Schuster and ripped off his helmet. The NFL is expected to issue disciplinary actions following the incident, which marred the end of the game.</p>

          <p>Western Alaska is experiencing catastrophic flooding and hurricane-force winds due to the remnants of Typhoon Halong, leading to homes being swept off foundations.

          <p>A Chinese study indicates that fathers can epigenetically pass on the benefits of exercise to their children. Research on mice showed that offspring sired by exercise-trained fathers exhibited improved muscle mass, lower body fat, and stronger bones. Conversely, the offspring of inactive fathers performed poorly in physical tests. The study, published in Cell Metabolism, highlights paternal exercise as a cost-effective way to enhance offspring health, even demonstrating transmission via sperm microRNAs.</p>

          <p>Retired General Tim Haugh, former head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, warns that China has extensively hacked into America's critical infrastructure, including water, electrical power, and transportation systems. Haugh stated that China's targeting of civilian services, even in small communities like Littleton, Massachusetts, is part of an "unrestricted warfare" strategy aimed at causing domestic distraction during a potential conflict. These intrusions, often involving dormant access for years, pose a severe national threat by potentially enabling sabotage and economic chaos.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Maintaining Adult Friendships and Combating "Ghosting"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maintaining adult friendships amidst busy lives and life stage changes is a common challenge, with research suggesting half of friendships are lost every seven years. Psychologists emphasize that honesty, vulnerability, and embracing "messy" lives are crucial for sustaining connections. Experts advise prioritizing in-person interactions, even brief or unconventional ones, over relying solely on virtual communication, which can lead to "relational loneliness." Overcoming the "liking gap" and trusting friends' enduring affection are key to rekindling bonds and fostering deeper platonic connections.</p>

          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can objectively measure stress levels and monitor recovery. The research shows that stress alters facial blood flow, redirecting it from the nose to eyes and ears as a physiological response to perceived danger. This non-invasive technique, which registered a two-degree drop in the reporter's nose during a stress test, could be a "game changer" for monitoring stress in humans, babies, and even great apes, offering insights into anxiety and depression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major class action lawsuit, potentially involving 1.6 million car owners, is commencing at the High Court against five leading carmakers: Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault, and Nissan. These companies are accused of using "defeat devices" to manipulate emissions tests, allowing their diesel vehicles to record lower nitrogen oxide readings under test conditions than in real-world driving. This trial is the latest development in the "dieselgate" scandal, following Volkswagen's previous settlement. If found liable, the carmakers could face significant compensation payouts and accusations of breaching corporate trust.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" when seeking to raise tax revenue in the upcoming Budget. The influential think tank urges comprehensive tax system reform, suggesting property tax and capital gains tax as "good places to start" for fairer, more growth-friendly policies. The IFS warns against economically harmful options like a wealth tax or restricting pension contribution relief, emphasizing the need for strategic changes to meet fiscal rules without breaking manifesto promises.

          <p>A new report from the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute declares coral reefs the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate "tipping point," facing irreversible damage due to warming oceans. Researchers describe this as an "unprecedented crisis," with an estimated 84% of the world's coral reefs currently under heat stress. The report highlights that beyond 1.2 degrees Celsius of warming, 70-90% of coral dies, threatening marine life and the livelihoods of a billion people. Urgent decarbonization efforts are crucial to mitigate further devastating tipping points.</p>
