          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's presidential election in a tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, revealing deep divisions within the country. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist path under Nawrocki, who was supported by President Trump. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation with Poland. Nawrocki's victory complicates Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his liberal agenda, as the president holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation, potentially hindering Tusk's ability to fulfill electoral promises. The article indicates the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027.</p>

The article highlights the importance of preserving the memory of the event as the number of survivors dwindles. The trees stand as a symbol of resilience and a testament to the enduring impact of the bombing on the city and its people.</p>

          <p>The debate over AI and copyright continues in the House of Lords, pitting the government against the creative industry. The core issue is how to balance the needs of AI developers to access creative content with the livelihoods of the creators of that content. The Data (Use and Access) Bill, which would allow AI developers access to all content unless owners opt out, is currently stalled. Opponents argue AI firms should disclose copyrighted material used to train their tools and license it, while supporters claim requiring permission would stifle the AI industry. The article concludes that there is no easy answer and the outcome remains uncertain.</p>

Capital spending by Japanese companies rose 6.4% in Jan.-March, reflecting robust investment to boost production capacity and advance digitalization. Former yokozuna Hakuho is expected to announce his retirement from the Japan Sumo Association, and Japanese universities have obtained around 2.7 billion yen in defense tech subsidies since fiscal 2015. A commercial whaling ship returned to a port in northeastern Japan carrying 25 fin whales, and North Korea lifted a ban on the military use of space for national defense purposes.

          <p>Chinese researchers are leading an effort to create a comprehensive genomic atlas of Southeast Asia, addressing the historical underrepresentation of the region in the Human Genome Project. The SEA3K data set, published in Nature, is the result of a decade-long collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams. The study revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east. Researchers collected samples from Southeast Asian populations covering six countries, five language families, and 30 ethnic languages, completing genome sequencing for 3,023 cases.</p>

Revenue, operating profits, and net profits of the industry are projected to increase from 2024, mainly due to lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, and jet fuel costs are expected to average $86 per barrel in 2025, down from $99 in 2024.

          <p>CNN data reporter Harry Enten reported that the acronym "TACO," standing for "Trump Always Chickens Out," is gaining traction and being widely searched in relation to President Donald Trump. This term refers to the perception that Trump announces big tariffs, causing market instability, and then backs down. Enten stated that this trend is troubling for Trump because it undermines his image as someone who follows through on his promises. Searches for Trump and "TACO" have increased significantly, indicating that the term has entered the mainstream.</p>

          <p>Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The new company, listed in Sydney, will acquire all outstanding shares of both companies, with the merged entity projected to be worth around $9 billion. The merger will unwind a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers and promote long-term investment strategies. The move is seen as a positive step towards simplifying the structure, adding scale, and creating a more investable company (not investment advice).</p>

The U.S. allowed its rare earth metals industry to move to China and could now face severe economic disruption as China limits crucial supplies. This situation highlights the vulnerability of relying on a single source for essential materials.

          <p>The convergence of the Dragon Boat Festival and Children's Day in China led to a surge in domestic tourism bookings. Short-haul domestic travel bookings grew 23% year on year, driven by "summer escapes" and family-friendly activities. Bookings for theme park tickets and campsites increased significantly, and family hotel packages that include hotels, food, and entertainment have also risen. Chinese officials view tourism as a key driver for the nation's service sector, especially amid economic uncertainties.</p>

Supporters believe this is needed to overhaul the judicial system, known for corruption and inefficiency.
