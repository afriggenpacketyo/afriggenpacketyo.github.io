          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at an industrial plant in Russia's Ryazan region have resulted in the deaths of 24 people and left more than 150 injured. The incident occurred at the Elastik plant, where a gunpowder workshop reportedly caught fire, triggering the blast that reduced parts of the building to rubble. Investigators have opened a criminal case for violations of industrial safety rules, suggesting the cause was likely mismanagement rather than an external attack. This event highlights ongoing concerns about chronic safety violations at Russian industrial facilities, as a similar deadly blast occurred at the same plant in 2021.</p>

          <p>A seventh suspect, a 32-year-old man with 22 prior arrests, has been indicted for his alleged role in a widely publicized group assault in Cincinnati. He faces charges of aggravated riot and felony aggravated robbery for reportedly stealing a necklace from a victim during the attack and filming the incident. Despite a lengthy criminal record that includes convictions for drug trafficking and illegal firearm possession, he has often received lenient sentences, such as probation. This latest indictment comes as six other co-defendants in the case have been arraigned on new charges, continuing the legal fallout from the viral event.</p>

          <p>The search for a missing 7-month-old boy in Yucaipa, California, has become more complex after his mother stopped cooperating with investigators. The mother initially claimed she was attacked and knocked unconscious, only to find her baby gone when she awoke, but authorities noted inconsistencies in her story and now suspect potential foul play. Her refusal to continue speaking with law enforcement has led a child advocacy group to retract its offer of a $5,000 reward and assistance. Community members continue to hold vigils as the investigation into the infant's mysterious disappearance proceeds without the mother's further input.</p>

          <p>Football legend Wayne Rooney has called for more comprehensive anti-racism education and stricter penalties for clubs whose fans engage in racist behavior. Recalling a distressing incident where a player at DC United, the MLS club he managed, was racially abused to the point of tears, Rooney emphasized the profound emotional impact of such actions. His comments follow a recent incident where a Bournemouth player was racially abused during a Premier League match. Rooney suggests that sanctions like points deductions or financial penalties against clubs are necessary to force a change in fan behavior and eradicate racism from the sport.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's club captain, Cristian Romero, has signed a new four-year contract, committing his future to the North London club until 2029. The 27-year-old Argentine center-back has been a pivotal player since joining from Atalanta in 2021, making 126 appearances and recently captaining the team to a Europa League victory. After being linked with a potential move to Atletico Madrid during the summer, this new deal solidifies his leadership role under new head coach Thomas Frank. The extension follows a similar long-term contract signed by right-back Djed Spence, signaling stability in the club's defensive lineup.</p>

          <p>After a two-week walkout to stall the process, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, allowing Republicans to resume their efforts to redraw U.S. congressional maps. The proposed changes are expected to give the GOP a significant advantage in the 2026 midterm elections by creating up to five new winnable seats. The move in Texas has prompted a national response, with California Democrats advancing their own redistricting plan to counteract the potential Republican gains. This unusual mid-decade redistricting battle highlights the intense partisan struggle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remaining attractive, experts advise savers to carefully consider their personal financial situation before investing. Key factors include ensuring a sufficient emergency fund exists in a more liquid account and evaluating the likelihood of needing the funds before the CD's maturity to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Experts also suggest comparing CD rates to other low-risk options like high-yield savings accounts and considering interest rate trends, as the Federal Reserve may lower rates soon. A CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different terms, is recommended to maintain flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to mounting pressure to lower medication costs, drugmaker Novo Nordisk announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, for $499 per month to U.S. patients paying in cash. This price is less than half of the medication's monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and the savings company GoodRx. This move aims to expand access for uninsured or underinsured patients and to steer them away from potentially unsafe compounded versions of the drug, which gained popularity during previous shortages.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm and has grown significantly in size as it moves near the Bahamas. While the storm's core is not expected to make landfall in the United States, its immense scale will generate dangerous high surf and life-threatening rip currents along the entire U.S. Eastern Seaboard throughout the week. Forecasters are warning the public to stay out of the Atlantic waters from Florida to New England.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a proposed rule change that would prevent employees of certain organizations from receiving benefits under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The U.S. Department of Education aims to halt loan forgiveness for individuals working for organizations deemed to be "undermining national security and American values through illegal means." Critics argue the vague language could be used to arbitrarily exclude non-profits based on political ideology. The proposed change would not be retroactive, meaning past work at a later-deemed ineligible organization would still count toward forgiveness.</p>

This collaboration is significant as it shifts the financial risk of constructing a first-of-its-kind nuclear plant from consumers to the private companies.

County officials, bound by non-disclosure agreements, had approached residents to sell their land without disclosing the project's nature, fueling speculation and mistrust. The proposed 2.2-gigawatt data center would nearly double the annual generation capacity of the local power cooperative, raising significant concerns about the strain on the energy grid and the environmental impact of turning productive farmland into an industrial complex.
