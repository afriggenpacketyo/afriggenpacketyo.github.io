          <p>Garment manufacturers in China and Vietnam are cautiously optimistic after US President Donald Trump indicated that the United States is not focused on manufacturing sneakers and T-shirts. Despite this, businesses are proceeding with their plans to diversify markets due to the uncertainty surrounding US tariff policies. Both countries are currently in a 90-day pause in US tariffs and are attempting to negotiate a deal with Washington to prevent further duty increases. Recent comments from US officials suggest that Trumpâ€™s push to revive American manufacturing will not extend to low-margin sectors.</p>

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly moving their gold offshore to Singapore as a safe haven amid growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. A storage facility called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April, compared to the same period in 2024. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with relative political and economic stability, attracting high-net-worth clients seeking to mitigate risks related to tariffs and geopolitical instability.

          <p>A former federal prison warden described the security protocols at the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility as deficient, contributing to the escape of a serial escape artist and nine other inmates. Cameron Lindsay, with 20 years of experience in the federal prison system, highlighted the lack of basic security inspections and inadequate inmate supervision. A 2024 compliance check report revealed significant incidents of violence, drug use, and weapon creation within the jail.

          <p>The Chinese government has cautioned its citizens in Bangladesh against "buying a foreign wife" due to rising reports of marriage scams and human trafficking. The Chinese embassy in Dhaka urged citizens to avoid being misled by social media posts offering quick marriages abroad, emphasizing that no marriage agency is permitted to offer international matchmaking services. China faces a surplus of approximately 35 million men unable to find brides, partly due to the one-child policy, leading some to seek brides from other nations. This demand has fueled human trafficking, with women and children from South and Southeast Asian countries being smuggled into China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant challenge to Darwinian evolution, Chinese scientists have revived the theory that acquired traits can shape heredity without DNA changes. A study published in Cell demonstrated that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on an adaptive tolerance to low temperatures across five generations, bypassing genetic mutations. This research reignites the debate between Lamarck's theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics and Darwin's ideas about random genetic variation. The team found heritable DNA methylation changes as the driver of cold adaptation in crops, positioning Lamarckism as a force in evolution.</p>

While the rule did lead to a variety of strategic scenarios, it did not significantly alter the race outcome. Some teams used strategic driver positioning, causing discomfort among drivers. The rule also facilitated the exploitation of the red-flag tire-change rule. The core issue remains the difficulty of overtaking at Monaco, prompting questions about the effectiveness of artificial gimmicks to address an unfixable problem.</p>

          <p>The diamond industry faces new challenges with a baseline 10% import duty to the U.S., which accounts for over half of the global demand for polished diamonds. This is compounded by the complex supply chains and expensive price tags of diamonds, making them fragile to trade disruptions. The industry is pushing for diamonds to be excluded from tariffs, arguing that loose diamonds are raw materials used in jewelry. The tariff uncertainty comes as the luxury industry contends with a slowdown in demand and increasing competition from lab-grown diamonds. (not investment advice)</p>
