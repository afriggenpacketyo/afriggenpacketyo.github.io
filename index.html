            <h2>Indian and Chinese Students File Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Visa Terminations</h2>

            <p>Three Indian and two Chinese students have initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the termination of their F-1 visas, which threatens their academic pursuits and financial stability in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the suit, asserting that the government failed to provide adequate notice before revoking the students' legal status. The students face potential deportation and significant financial losses, with one student already having their research assistantship terminated and another potentially losing a substantial investment in their education. This legal action reflects growing concerns among international students and universities regarding the tightening of student visa policies by the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>Dozens of police officers in Tonawanda, New York, are facing fines for allegedly participating in an unauthorized labor strike during a period of heavy snowfall this past winter. The police union asserts that these fines are retaliatory and an abuse of power after the officers failed to meet ticket quotas, which are illegal under New York law, while the town supervisor insists the charges are valid. The dispute arose amidst increased police calls and mandatory training during a staffing shortage, with the town alleging a significant decrease in traffic tickets issued. The union has launched a public campaign urging residents to demand the removal of the police chief, accusing him of harassment and withholding essential gear.</p>

            <p>The beauty industry's embrace of snail slime in skincare products has sparked ethical debates regarding the treatment of snails. While some companies claim to provide stress-free environments for snails, others employ methods that involve acidic solutions or physical force to stimulate slime secretion. Animal welfare organizations have raised concerns about the potential pain and stress inflicted on snails during the extraction process, highlighting the need for ethical practices within the industry. Consumers are increasingly seeking cruelty-free options, but the lack of transparency and the prioritization of human beauty over animal welfare remain significant issues.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian attacks continued in some areas despite Vladimir Putin's order for an Easter truce, accusing Russia of creating an "impression" of a ceasefire. Zelenskyy reported numerous shellings and assaults by Russian forces within the first six hours of the declared truce. Despite these accusations, it has been reported that it has been quieter on the front lines. Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's readiness to extend the truce for 30 days if Russia genuinely commits to a full and unconditional ceasefire, but few Ukrainians believe this is possible.</p>
