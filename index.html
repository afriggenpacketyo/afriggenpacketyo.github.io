          <p>Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been released from prison in Hermosillo, Mexico, where he was held after being deported from the United States. He faces trial on accusations of cartel involvement and illegal arms trafficking, with a judge prohibiting him from leaving Mexico during the investigation period. Chávez Jr., who has a history of addiction and prior arrests, had been living in the U.S. and was arrested there for visa overstay before his deportation. This high-profile case unfolds as the Trump administration pressures Mexico to intensify its crackdown on organized crime.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops deployed in Washington, D.C., as part of President Trump's crime crackdown, have begun carrying service-issued weapons. Over 2,200 soldiers are assigned to the Joint Task Force-DC, with rules of engagement allowing force only as a last resort against imminent threats. Critics, including Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, argue that federal data contradicts Trump's claims of rampant crime, with violent crime rates at a 30-year low, making the military presence unnecessary and an "authoritarian push."</p>

Despite Starbucks' public image as a progressive employer, workers claim the company's intense focus on cost-cutting has led to understaffing and unstable "just-in-time" scheduling, which negatively impacts their personal lives and income. While Starbucks has pledged reforms following public scrutiny, employees remain skeptical, demanding higher wages, full-time hours, and more predictable schedules to truly improve their experience.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric carmaker Nio saw its Hong Kong-listed shares surge by nearly 15%, marking its seventh consecutive session of gains. This rally follows the unveiling of Nio's new ES8 SUV, priced significantly lower than its premium models under a battery subscription plan, making it one of the company's most affordable offerings. The launch is a strategic move by Nio to compete in China's increasingly competitive EV market, where it is introducing cheaper brands like Onvo and Firefly to attract a broader customer base.</p>

          <p>Chinese property behemoth Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a significant milestone in its spectacular collapse from a $50 billion valuation. Once China's largest real estate firm, Evergrande succumbed to over $300 billion in debt, triggered by Beijing's 2020 rules on developer borrowing. Its founder, Hui Ka Yan, was fined and banned for overstating revenue. The delisting underscores the ongoing property crisis, which has severely impacted China's economy, leading to layoffs and decreased consumer spending, with no clear end in sight.</p>

          <h2>Palmer Luckey Champions AI-Powered Autonomous Weapons as Future of Warfare</h2>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of defense tech company Anduril, advocates for AI-powered autonomous weapons, arguing they are essential for modern warfare and can reduce risks to American lives. He asserts that U.S. military technology is outdated compared to commercial AI. Anduril's products, like the Roadrunner interceptor and Dive XL submarine, use AI for surveillance and target engagement without human operators, though they include "kill switches." While critics, including the UN Secretary-General, deem such "killer robots" morally repugnant, Luckey believes they act as powerful deterrents, promoting peace through strength.</p>

          <p>Nine Chevening scholars from Gaza have received emails from the UK government, signaling potential evacuation to pursue masters and PhD studies in the UK, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the ongoing conflict. Mahmoud, a doctor, and Mohammed, an epidemiology student, express emotional relief but profound sadness at the prospect of leaving their families in constant danger. This development follows extensive campaigning for over 80 Palestinian students with UK university offers. However, many other scholars remain in limbo, highlighting the bureaucratic hurdles and the immense human cost of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Victims of Ecuador's surging cartel violence, like Gabriela, are fleeing to the U.S. seeking asylum, only to find themselves hiding from authorities due to restrictive immigration policies. Gabriela, whose grandfather was murdered by a gang, highlights the systemic corruption in Ecuador that prevents protection. Under the Trump administration, asylum claims based on gang or domestic violence became harder to prove, requiring victims to show government inability or complicity. While the Biden administration repealed some interpretations, the legal definitions remain challenging, leaving many in limbo and fearing deportation.</p>

          <p>Lourdes, France, a renowned pilgrimage site, has seen over 70 medical miracles recognized by the Catholic Church in 163 years, with two new cases confirmed since 2022. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts decade-long investigations into thousands of reported cures. They apply stringent criteria, requiring sudden, complete, lasting cures with no possible medical explanation. Despite skepticism about past rigor, analysis by scholars like Dr. Esther Sternberg confirms the credibility of their conclusions, underscoring the unique nature of these unexplained recoveries.</p>

          <p>Newly unsealed evidence from a 9/11 families' lawsuit against Saudi Arabia reveals a chilling 1999 video of Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi intelligence operative, filming the U.S. Capitol, a likely target of Flight 93. This and other crucial evidence, including an airplane descent equation, were seized by British police and sent to the FBI in 2001 but were inexplicably withheld from lead FBI field agents and top intelligence officials for years. Investigators believe Bayoumi facilitated the hijackers, and the failure to share this information represents a significant intelligence breakdown.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, are strongly criticizing President Trump's plan to deploy federalized National Guard troops to Chicago. Jeffries accused Trump of "playing games with the lives of Americans" and manufacturing a crisis to justify military intervention in Democrat-led cities, despite local crime statistics showing reductions. Johnson called the plan a "flagrant violation of our constitution," asserting that the National Guard is not needed and that local authorities have not requested federal intervention, echoing concerns about Trump's overreach.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident for charging a Tesla in their driveway, not due to the electric vehicle itself, but because the Level 1 charging cable was deemed unsightly. The HOA cited National Electrical Code 625, but many online commenters and experts argued the code does not prohibit standard Level 1 charging, suggesting the board was overreaching. This incident highlights HOAs' reputation for micromanaging aesthetics and residents' property rights, sparking debate over whether the rule was based on safety or purely visual preferences.</p>
