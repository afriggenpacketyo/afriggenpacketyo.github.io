          <p>Job cuts in the United States have surged to their highest point since the 2020 pandemic, with 744,308 layoffs announced in the first half of 2025. A significant portion of these cuts, nearly 287,000, are attributed to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has heavily impacted federal agencies and related non-profit organizations. Other contributing factors include economic slowdowns, company restructuring, and the effects of new tariffs, with the retail and technology sectors also seeing substantial job losses. Economists express concern that growth may cool further as the full impact of these policies materializes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Senate's narrow passage of President Trump's major tax and spending bill, the legislation now faces significant challenges in the House. Several key changes made by the Senate have become points of contention for House Republicans, threatening the bill's final approval. These disagreements center on deeper Medicaid cuts that could leave millions more uninsured, a larger increase to the national debt and debt ceiling, and alterations to tax policies like the SALT deduction. The divisions within the GOP have created uncertainty, prompting President Trump to increase pressure on lawmakers to resolve their differences.</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave sweeping across Europe has resulted in multiple fatalities, with temperatures soaring above 40Â°C (104Â°F). In Spain, two farmers died in a wildfire, while Italy reported three deaths on beaches and in hospitals due to heat-related illnesses. France also confirmed two heat-related fatalities and the death of a 10-year-old American tourist who collapsed at the Palace of Versailles. The extreme weather has also fueled wildfires in Greece, forcing evacuations. The UN's climate agency attributes the increasing frequency and intensity of such events to human-induced climate change, which is exacerbated in urban areas.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Oncology has found that women under 55 using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for menopause symptoms may face a higher risk of breast cancer. The research distinguished between women with and without a uterus, as their treatments differ. For women who have had a hysterectomy, taking estrogen alone was found to actually reduce breast cancer risk. This new research refines previous understandings from a controversial early 2000s study, highlighting that the type and timing of hormone therapy are critical factors. Health experts stress the importance of personalized medical consultation to weigh the risks and benefits.</p>

While Trump stated that "Vietnam will pay" the duty, tariffs are typically paid by the importing companies, which can lead to higher costs for consumers.

          <p>President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill proposes a massive expansion of the federal government's immigration enforcement capabilities, dedicating roughly $170 billion to related operations. If passed, the funding would supercharge the administration's plans for a large-scale deportation campaign. The bill authorizes tens of thousands of new detention beds, funding for more border wall construction, and would make ICE the most heavily funded federal law enforcement agency. Critics warn this will lead to more indiscriminate raids and severely restrict access to humanitarian protections like asylum by imposing new fees on applicants, fundamentally transforming the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama, Tibet's 89-year-old spiritual leader, has announced a formal succession plan, asserting that the process will be handled exclusively by his appointed trust, free from Chinese government interference. In a televised statement, he declared that the Gaden Phodrang Trust will consult with Tibetan Buddhist leaders to find his reincarnation according to traditional procedures. This move directly challenges Beijing, which passed a law in 2007 claiming authority over the selection of the next Dalai Lama and has long viewed the spiritual leader as a separatist. The announcement is politically and spiritually significant for Tibetans seeking to preserve their identity and religious freedom.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is taking a confrontational stance against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions in her city. Accusing the president of an "all-out assault against Los Angeles," Bass has defended the city's sanctuary policies and vowed not to be intimidated by federal pressure, including a Justice Department lawsuit. This marks a shift in style for the mayor, who is typically known as a consensus builder. Her strong defense of the city's immigrant communities against federal raids has unified many local leaders and residents, who see the administration's actions as an overreach that runs counter to the city's values.</p>

          <p>The United States' ability to accurately forecast hurricanes is being significantly undermined just as the storm season intensifies. The Department of Defense is set to discontinue a crucial satellite imaging technology, known as SSMIS, that provides three-dimensional views of storms through clouds, which is vital for detecting rapid intensification. This loss is compounded by staffing shortages at the National Weather Service and proposed budget cuts that would eliminate the entire Oceanic and Atmospheric Research office. Scientists warn that these combined cuts are rapidly degrading state-of-the-art forecasting, leaving the country more vulnerable to surprise storms.</p>

West, who is married to an Australian citizen and has been a regular visitor, is now barred from entering the country. The minister defended the decision, stating that while citizens have freedom of speech, Australia does not need to "deliberately import bigotry," especially amid a recent rise in antisemitic incidents.</p>

          <h2>A Breakdown of the Charges and Verdict in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs Trial</h2>

          <p>A federal jury delivered a split verdict in the trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, acquitting him of the most serious charges while finding him guilty on two lesser counts. He was found not guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, but was convicted on two counts of transportation for prostitution involving his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and another woman. The acquittal on the racketeering charge, which required proving a coordinated criminal enterprise, is a significant win for his defense. Combs now faces a maximum sentence of 10 years for each of the two convictions, with a sentencing date yet to be determined by the judge.</p>

          <h2>Twenty States Sue Trump Administration for Sharing Medicaid Data with Deportation Officials</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 11:34:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing confidential Medicaid enrollee data with federal deportation officials. The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Health and Human Services violated federal privacy laws, including HIPAA, by providing the Department of Homeland Security with data on millions of people. Attorneys general argue this action erodes trust in the healthcare system, potentially deterring immigrants from seeking necessary medical care. The move is part of a broader administration effort to use data from various federal agencies to accelerate its mass deportation campaign.</p>
