          <p>Chinese researchers have developed LICOMK++, a high-resolution ocean simulation system, despite US semiconductor export controls. This system, dubbed an ocean "microscope," allows scientists to analyze ocean dynamics and climate patterns with unprecedented precision. It enhances predictions for extreme weather events and aids in disaster response strategies and coastal resilience planning. The innovation highlights China's determination to achieve technological self-reliance and contribute to global climate research, as climate-related economic losses increase worldwide.</p>

Passengers expressed frustration with the ongoing disruptions, with many experiencing significant delays and overnight stays. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized the need for the FAA to prioritize fixing Newark's problems to prevent similar issues nationwide.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister's office has been informed by the US of Hamas's intention and sees it as a potential step towards further negotiations on hostages. The release is expected to require a temporary halt to Israeli military activity during the handover.</p>

The elections will decide over 18,000 jobs, including seats in the House of Representatives, and will influence the impeachment trial of Duterte. The feuding between Marcos and Duterte escalated after Duterte was impeached for alleged "high crimes" and her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, was arrested by the ICC.

Despite political rhetoric promising to reduce net migration, numbers have remained historically high.

          <p>Stocks in Asia experienced gains following weekend talks signaling progress in easing trade tensions between the United States and China. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that "substantial progress" had been made in meetings with Chinese officials. The meetings were the first since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to hopes that tariffs could be lowered. Analysts anticipate that an initial agreement will involve a reduction in tariff levels, potentially reducing the risk of an economic downturn.</p>

Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that Poland knows "for sure" that the fire was caused by arson ordered by Russian special services. Some individuals responsible are in custody, and others have been identified and are being sought. The fire destroyed 1,400 businesses, many owned by members of Warsaw's Vietnamese community, and is seen as part of a "hybrid war" waged by Moscow.</p>

This shift forces patients to switch from a drug shown to produce more weight loss to one that is less effective. The decision, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, prioritizes lower drug prices for employers but restricts worker access to competing treatments. Doctors say both drugs are good, but Zepbound is generally preferred for most patients.</p>
