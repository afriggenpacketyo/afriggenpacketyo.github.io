          <p>A French court has convicted eight individuals for their involvement in the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris, where $10 million worth of jewelry was stolen. The robbers, some of whom were dubbed the "grandpa robbers" due to their age, received prison sentences ranging from three to eight years, with some suspended sentences. Kardashian testified earlier this month, stating she feared for her life during the ordeal and expressed gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice. She also said she forgave the ringleader, Aomar Aït Khedache, for the sexual assault and theft.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top buyers of his meme coin, $TRUMP, at his Virginia golf club, but the event was met with mixed reviews from attendees and sparked controversy among lawmakers and regulators. One attendee described the food as poor and Trump's appearance as brief. The event, which cost attendees a combined $148 million in meme coin purchases, also drew protesters and raised concerns about the involvement of figures like Justin Sun, who is facing SEC fraud charges. The dinner has complicated stablecoin regulation efforts in Congress and prompted calls for banning presidents from profiting off crypto ventures while in office. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced support for a "partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting it will create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. This announcement comes after the Biden administration blocked Nippon Steel's outright acquisition of U.S. Steel on national security grounds. While details of the deal are unclear, it seems to suggest an investment rather than an acquisition, although Nippon Steel has historically preferred a wholly-owned subsidiary arrangement. Shares of U.S. Steel surged following the news, while the United Steelworkers union expressed concern about job security under foreign ownership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is restructuring the National Security Council, reducing its size and shifting responsibilities to other agencies such as the State and Defense departments. This move aims to streamline the agency and eliminate perceived bureaucratic staffers who do not align with Trump's agenda. Andy Baker, national security advisor for Vice President JD Vance, and Robert Gabriel will take on deputy national security advisor roles. The restructuring follows the departure of Mike Waltz and is intended to target Washington’s so-called "Deep State," according to a White House official. The goal is to have a more top-down approach to foreign policy debates.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also serving as national security advisor, announced a significant restructuring of the National Security Council, reducing its size by at least half. The changes involve officials returning to their original agencies and others being placed on administrative leave. Some teams focusing on specific regions or issues will be eliminated or merged into others. Andy Baker, national security advisor for Vice President JD Vance, will serve as deputy alongside Robert Gabriel. The downsizing aligns with President Trump's preference for top-down foreign policy decision-making.</p>

          <p>An essay reflects on the life of Sarah Milgrim, who was murdered alongside Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in a politically motivated, antisemitic attack. The author, Yasmina Asrarguis, met Milgrim on an interfaith trip to Morocco and emphasizes Milgrim's dedication to peace-building and cross-cultural dialogue. The essay argues that Milgrim's legacy should not be exploited for political gain or used as a rallying cry for any cause. It urges those who mourn her to reflect on her ideals and continue her work toward Middle East peace.</p>

Despite a recent pause in automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., a private organization operating facial recognition cameras, authorities used the technology to recapture one of the fugitives. Critics argue that citizens are unaware of being scanned and that the technology poses a threat to fundamental rights.

Experts say the race could be a harbinger for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's midterm elections, and the first real test for the potential Democratic backlash against the Trump administration. The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Republicans are hoping to flip New Jersey's governorship red, and point to the closer-than-expected margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 as evidence that it's in reach.</p>

          <p>A brush fire outside Yosemite National Park in California has forced the shutdown of a major highway and the evacuation of a resort town near the Nevada border. The Inn fire ignited on Thursday afternoon and has burned more than 700 acres near Mono Lake, forcing the evacuation of Mono City and popular establishments like the Mono Inn restaurant and Tioga Lodge hotel. Highway 395 is closed due to safety reasons, including burned power lines, with firefighting efforts focused on containing the fire's north end. The Inn fire is one of several brush fires that have erupted in California in the last week as the weather has begun to warm.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The deal, which was previously blocked by former President Joe Biden, is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% following the announcement, and both companies praised Trump's leadership. However, details of the arrangement and ownership structure remain unclear, and the United Steelworkers union has yet to comment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students, intensifying its monthslong targeting of the university. The move comes as the White House ramps up its crackdown on colleges that do not align with its agenda, accusing Columbia of breaching Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The administration had previously suspended more than $400 million in research funding to Columbia. The announcement formalizes previous accusations against the university rather than signaling a new stage of the campaign.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a budget package with historic spending cuts to Medicaid and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). The legislation, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," would slash Medicaid spending by roughly $700 billion and SNAP by about $300 billion, the largest cuts in the programs' histories. These cuts are intended to help pay for tax perks primarily benefiting the wealthy. The bill would also add roughly $3 trillion to the national debt including interest over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is moving to reduce the size and scope of the US National Security Council, with staff dealing with major geopolitical issues receiving termination notices. The restructuring is expected to grant more authority to the state department, the defense department, and other agencies, aiming to reduce the NSC staff to a few dozen people. The NSC is the main body used by presidents to coordinate national security strategy, and its staff often make key decisions regarding the US’s approach to volatile conflicts.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants in the United States, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months. Another encourages the Energy and Defense departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. The Trump administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nation’s fleet of nuclear power plants by 2050.</p>

          <p>A Georgia man, Jon Worrell, has been charged with the murder of his wife, Doris Worrell, nearly 19 years after fleeing the U.S. with the couple's live-in nanny.

Worrell was arrested in Missouri after investigators obtained new information from the nanny, who had ended her relationship with him. The case had remained open for years, and authorities are still seeking to determine who shot Doris Worrell.</p>

This move has ignited accusations that the US president is trying to do a favor for Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele, who allegedly struck a deal with the gang in 2019. Critics believe the deportation is aimed at preventing Arevalo-Chavez from testifying in a US court about Bukele's past ties to MS-13.</p>
