        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A severe storm system brought tornadoes and flash flooding to parts of the South and Midwest, resulting in at least 16 fatalities. The storm, which has already caused widespread flooding and infrastructure damage, is expected to bring more severe weather and rising waterways. Many areas are already waterlogged from previous storms, exacerbating the risk of flash flooding, especially in rural Kentucky. The extreme flooding has also affected interstate commerce, potentially leading to shipping and supply chain delays due to disruptions at major cargo hubs.&#x3c;br&#x3e;The National Weather Service anticipates major flood stages at 45 river locations across multiple states.</p>

Officials will conduct an examination to determine the cause of death, including whether the whale was affected by domoic acid from recent algal blooms.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has appealed a U.S. Department of Agriculture decision to end funding for the state's Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) Program. Newsom called the decision "irrational and malicious," stating it will harm both farmers and families relying on food banks. The USDA program, initiated in 2022, aimed to diversify food supply chains by providing grants to states for purchasing food from local and socially disadvantaged farmers. The cuts coincide with rising food insecurity and inflation, impacting safety net programs and leaving farmers uncertain about their future.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has issued a scathing opinion against the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man with legal protection from deportation, to a prison in El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis reaffirmed her ruling demanding Garcia's return to the U.S., stating he was seized and held without lawful authority. Trump officials claim they lack the authority to remove Garcia from jail in El Salvador. The Justice Department lawyer who argued the case on behalf of the Trump administration was put on leave after admitting to being unaware of certain elements of the case.</p>

          <p>The UK government has relaxed rules for car firms ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol vehicles, in an effort to shield the industry from the impact of US tariffs. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the government is committed to the 2030 deadline but will make regulations more flexible to protect jobs. Changes include relaxed mandates on car firms, allowing smaller firms to keep making petrol cars beyond 2030, and allowing some hybrid vehicles to stay on the market until 2035. Opposition parties criticized the measures as insufficient to boost the industry.</p>
