        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stricter enforcement of social insurance laws in China is prompting businesses to hire more retirees, as they are exempt from these contribution requirements. This trend is causing public concern, particularly as a record number of university graduates are struggling to find employment in a competitive job market. A new judicial interpretation from the Supreme People's Court, effective next month, will invalidate agreements to forgo these contributions, aiming to address the country's pension crisis but potentially intensifying the hiring dynamic.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to ban Palestine Action, asserting it is not a typical protest group. She cited incidents of alleged violent disorder and aggravated burglary for which the group claimed responsibility, noting the Crown Prosecution Service has assessed these charges as having a "terrorism connection." The defense comes as an additional 60 people face prosecution for supporting the group, with over 700 arrests made since the ban was implemented in early July.</p>

          <p>Singer Billy Joel is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and will auction his personal collection of bikes following a recent medical diagnosis. The 76-year-old musician revealed he is battling normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder that affects his balance, vision, and hearing, leading to the cancellation of his tour dates. The shop, opened in 2010, served as a showcase for his collection and a community hub in Oyster Bay.</p>

The pilot scheme proposes returning one migrant to France for every asylum seeker with a strong case that the UK accepts. The continued crossings, including a reported "mega dinghy" capable of holding over 100 people, are placing pressure on the UK government to demonstrate the effectiveness of its new policy.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, writer Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett explores how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to profound emotional connection through life experience. She explains that events like personal trauma and motherhood allowed her to resonate with the complex human themes depicted in works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo. The article argues that aging and lived experiences can break down cynicism, making one more open to the deep emotional power of classical art.</p>
