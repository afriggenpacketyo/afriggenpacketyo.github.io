          <p>England's Ben Stokes played a crucial role after Harry Brook's impressive 99 runs during the first Test's third day at Headingley. Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, slowing India's progress and leaving them at 90-2, holding a narrow lead. Brook's innings, marked by aggressive strokes and dropped catches, ended just shy of a century, while Jasprit Bumrah's bowling stood out for India, claiming 5-83. The match remains finely balanced as the threat of drizzle loomed, concluding with India at 96-2, with KL Rahul nearing his half-century, setting the stage for a tense continuation.

          <p>Senator Tom Cotton has called on Iran to seek peace following U.S. strikes that he claims significantly damaged Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Cotton emphasized that President Trump is serious and suggested Iran dismantle its remaining nuclear program to ensure its survival, listing targets not yet hit by the U.S. or Israel. He cautioned against targeting Americans and urged Iran to heed President Trump's warning, as the U.S. inserted itself into the conflict between Iran and Israel by striking Iranian nuclear facilities. The Iranian Foreign Minister condemned the U.S. action and planned to coordinate with Russia. </p>

          <p>U.S. lawmakers have expressed mixed reactions to President Trump's decision to launch strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Republicans like Senators Graham and Cruz supported the actions, while Democrats such as Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer criticized the lack of congressional consultation, citing constitutional concerns and the War Powers Act. Some, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, opposed the U.S. involvement, while others, such as Sen. John Fetterman, fully supported the strikes. The strikes have further escalated the conflict between Iran and Israel, prompting debates over presidential authority and the need for congressional approval. </p>

Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains, with Bahrain issuing a "work from home mandate" to ensure public safety. Egypt's EGX30 was the region's top performer, closing significantly higher, as analysts suggest the Gulf's call for peaceful resolutions has shielded it from major market turmoil.

          <p>The United States has escalated the conflict between Israel and Iran by bombing key Iranian nuclear enrichment sites, a move that has drawn mixed reactions globally. President Trump declared the strikes a "spectacular military success," claiming the destruction of Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities, although the extent of the damage is still being verified. The IAEA has warned of potential radiation leaks from the damaged sites, while the U.S. asserts the strikes resulted from months of planning and preparation. World reactions range from praise from Israel to condemnation from Iran, with regional governments and traditional U.S. allies urging de-escalation and a return to negotiations. </p>

U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple Iranian-backed plots since 2020, and the bulletin cautions that a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence could increase the likelihood of violence.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a delicate diplomatic situation regarding Iran following recent U.S. airstrikes, despite his earlier confidence that President Trump would not intervene. While the UK has not directly endorsed the U.S. action, ministers suggest the outcome aligns with the UK's national interest of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Advanced warning of the U.S. action was given to the UK, but no request for participation was made, raising questions about potential future requests for military support.

          <p>According to research, using certain phrases can hinder communication with children and trigger defiance. Instead of saying "Because I said so," explaining the decision briefly helps children feel respected, and instead of threats, framing requests positively encourages cooperation. Acknowledging a child's emotions rather than dismissing them fosters trust, and addressing the root cause of difficulty instead of blaming promotes problem-solving. Shifting from punishment to partnership encourages self-reflection and strengthens the parent-child bond. </p>

          <h2>Health Secretary Says No Budget Exists for Assisted Dying Service</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a narrow vote in favor of assisted dying legislation, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has stated that there is currently no budget allocated for an assisted dying service. Streeting, who opposed the legislation, cited existing issues with end-of-life care and NHS financial constraints as reasons for his concern. While the government remains neutral on the bill, it will now be scrutinized by the House of Lords, and campaigners for and against the bill have expressed their views. A financial analysis suggests potential savings from assisted dying, but also significant costs for setting up the service. </p>

          <p>A suicide bomber detonated himself inside a church in Dweil’a, Syria, killing at least nine people and wounding 15 others during a mass. The attack, the first of its kind in Syria in years, occurred as Damascus attempts to win the support of minorities amid concerns about extremist sleeper cells. The Syrian Interior Ministry attributed the attack to an extremist from the Islamic State group, and Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa condemned the act. Security forces and first-responders rushed to the scene, and survivors expressed panic and grief. </p>

          <p>The U.S. precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, code-named "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved B-2 bombers and Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOP), marking the largest strike using B2 bombers in history. More than 125 aircraft participated in the mission, with B-2 bombers launched from Missouri and refueling midair, while decoys diverted attention. The bombers dropped 14 MOP bombs on the Natanz and Fordo sites, and Tomahawk cruise missiles targeted the Isfahan nuclear site. President Trump declared the mission a success, and officials emphasized that no Iranian troops or civilian structures were targeted. </p>
