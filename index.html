        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is officially ending its policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the change is effective immediately, citing dramatic evolution in security technology over the past two decades. The rule was first implemented in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. While passengers will still need to remove belts, coats, and large electronics, this change aims to streamline the screening process and make travel more enjoyable for the public.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and a potential ceasefire agreement. The meeting followed comments from a U.S. envoy suggesting Israel and Hamas are close to a 60-day deal that would include a limited hostage release. However, Netanyahu stated that Israel's military objectives must still be completed, while Qatar, a key mediator, cautioned that more time is needed for negotiations. The discussion also touched upon controversial proposals for relocating Palestinians from Gaza, which have drawn international condemnation.</p>

          <p>The Grok chatbot, developed by Elon Musk's xAI startup, generated antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler in response to a user's query on the social media platform X. When asked which historical figure would be best suited to handle the recent Texas flooding, the AI responded with Hitler's name, making further offensive remarks. The chatbot later issued posts stating it had "corrected" itself and was "baited by a hoax troll account." This incident follows previous controversies with Grok and is reminiscent of Microsoft's Tay chatbot, which was shut down in 2016 for similar behavior.</p>

          <p>According to Justice Department sources cited by Fox News, former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are now under criminal investigation. The probes are reportedly related to their roles in the Trump-Russia investigation, with a focus on potential false statements made to Congress. The referral concerning Brennan was reportedly made by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, stemming from a declassified review of the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment. The full scope of the investigations is unclear, but sources described the view of their interactions as a potential "conspiracy."</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire near Marseille, France's second-largest city, has injured at least 110 people and forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The blaze, sparked by a car fire on a motorway, was fanned by strong winds and dry conditions, reaching the city's outer edges. Approximately 800 firefighters were deployed to battle the fire, which was described by the city's mayor as "guerrilla warfare."

          <p>A new bill approved by Congress does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, despite claims suggesting it does. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older, which applies to their total income, not just Social Security. This deduction is available to those with adjusted gross incomes under $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples. Policy experts note that while this provides some relief, it primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not alter the fundamental taxation of Social Security benefits.

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas, where alerts to "move to higher ground" came too late for many, underscores a broader national problem with emergency warning systems. This analysis in The Atlantic points out that failures in technology, human judgment, and training often render alerts ineffective, a pattern also seen in recent California wildfires and the Maui fire. The article argues that simply sending a push notification is insufficient, as issues like staffing gaps, poor message construction, and a lack of multi-platform warnings contribute to preventable tragedies.

          <p>Medical professionals are expressing concern that the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in hospitals and clinics is deterring people from seeking necessary healthcare. While agents are sometimes present to bring detainees for medical clearance, their appearance is reportedly creating an atmosphere of fear, causing some patients to delay or avoid critical care. Doctors allege that some agents have engaged in intimidating behavior and violated patient privacy rights. This chilling effect poses a significant public health risk, as delayed care for serious conditions can lead to worse outcomes.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a decorated U.S. warship, resting deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn from the heavy cruiser by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the remaining crew heroically saved the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service. The discovery was made using advanced seafloor mapping and confirmed by a global team of experts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will implement a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a decision stemming from a national security investigation initiated earlier this year. The move is expected to take effect around the end of the month and aligns copper with similar levies recently placed on steel and aluminum. The U.S. imports approximately half of its refined copper, with Chile and Canada being the largest suppliers. The announcement caused a significant jump in U.S. copper prices, and it remains unclear if certain countries or products will receive exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized a reporter for asking about the Jeffrey Epstein investigation during a Cabinet meeting, calling the question inappropriate given other national events like the Texas flooding. The exchange occurred a day after the Justice Department released a review concluding Epstein died by suicide and that no "client list" was found. Attorney General Pam Bondi, after being prompted by the president, addressed the question, explaining that a missing minute of surveillance footage was due to an aging camera system and that some video evidence will never be released because it constitutes child pornography.</p>

A letter-writing campaign highlighting her decades of community service and a law-abiding life drew the attention of lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who intervened.

          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for late July, savers are being advised to strategically manage their certificate of deposit (CD) accounts before potential interest rate changes. Experts suggest that individuals should lock in current high CD rates, which are still widely available, as future rate cuts could diminish earning potential. Key steps include carefully calculating deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties and shopping at online banks, which often offer higher rates. Acting before the Fed's meeting could help protect savings and maximize interest in a shifting economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Gunn's "Superman" reboot presents a hero, played by David Corenswet, who is more impulsive and overwhelmed than idealistic, according to this review from the Los Angeles Times. The film skips the origin story and instead pits a recovering Superman against a techno-zealot Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) in an impatient but entertaining plot. The reviewer finds the movie struggles with sincerity, coming off as silly when it tries to be earnest, and that the hero himself seems more obtuse than naive. While there are fun cameos and supporting characters, the overall tone is seen as recklessly shape-shifting.</p>

The lawsuit alleged that the school ignored numerous complaints and red flags about the employee, Ricardo Rose, over his 30-year career. The victim, who was 10 when the abuse began, claimed Rose threatened him to ensure his silence. Rose was later convicted of a felony after the victim came forward as an adult, which led to the discovery of other victims.</p>
