          <p>The first group of white South Africans, known as Afrikaners, who were granted refugee status by the U.S. departed from Johannesburg on a U.S.-funded charter plane. This move follows President Trump's executive order to resettle Afrikaners, citing "government-sponsored race-based discrimination," a claim strongly denied by South Africa. The initiative contrasts sharply with the Trump administration's ban on most other refugees, and the processing of Afrikaners has been unusually fast. Relations between South Africa and the U.S. have deteriorated over various policy issues, leading to Washington's expulsion of Pretoria's ambassador earlier in the year, yet this resettlement is still occurring.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, although the matter remains under review by legal departments. The plane, estimated to be worth $400 million, would be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. A Democratic representative has urged the Government Accountability Office to investigate the potential ethics violations of accepting such a gift. This development occurs as Mr. Trump embarks on his first international trip of his second term, with stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane carrying white South Africans who claim discrimination in their home country has arrived in the United States, marking a significant development in President Trump’s reshaping of U.S. foreign policy. This move comes as the Trump administration is halting virtually all other refugee admissions. The article notes that the refugee process for Afrikaners has been expedited, taking only three months from the executive order to their arrival. Aid groups, immigrant rights activists, and the South African government have criticized the initiative, calling it a mockery of the refugee system.</p>

Marisa Abela won best leading actress, while Lennie James and Ariyon Bakare won best leading and supporting actor respectively for 'Mr Loverman'. The Traitors missed out on the three prizes it was nominated for, with best reality series instead going to Channel 4's Jury: Murder Trial.</p>

The author, Pepper Stetler, expresses concern that the Special Education Simplified Funding Program would limit federal oversight and give states greater flexibility, potentially leading to uneven enforcement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The article notes that before federal oversight, many states chose not to educate children with disabilities.

A takeover of BP might be difficult, the article states, but the speculation highlights the ongoing consolidation wave in the oil patch.</p>
