          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. ceasefire proposal, indicating a willingness to release hostages while requesting amendments to the plan, including a permanent truce and complete Israeli withdrawal. The group proposed releasing 10 living and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the response as unacceptable, while Israel stated Hamas continues to refuse the updated outline for hostage release. Caught between internal pressure and Israeli escalation threats, Hamas presented a counterproposal, as the group lacks the military capacity to resist an Israeli offensive. </p>

The decisions affect immigrants who may have committed minor offenses long ago but now face severe consequences, highlighting concerns about fairness and due process in immigration law.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-led ceasefire proposal for Gaza, seeking amendments to the plan, which Israel has approved. The group aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid, while the U.S. envoy deemed the response unacceptable. The U.N. Food Program reported that aid trucks were stopped and offloaded by hungry Palestinians due to severe shortages, as a three-month Israeli blockade has pushed Gaza to the brink of famine. Despite some aid entering recently, organizations say it's insufficient, and the U.N. has called Gaza the "hungriest place on Earth."</p>

          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties, but exceptions exist if you or your spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees and covered by their health insurance. Delaying also allows continued contributions to a health savings account, which cease upon Medicare enrollment. It's crucial to confirm appropriate coverage with the employer's benefits department before delaying Medicare application.

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility at the Spanish Grand Prix, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA imposed a stiffer load test to limit aerodynamic exploitation, but Hamilton argues it changed nothing and forced teams to spend money on new wings. He said that the wings still bend, just half as much, and that the money could have been better spent on charitable causes, as the change made no difference. The FIA delayed the rule's introduction, expecting teams to introduce new front wings anyway as part of development programs.</p>

The owners, Freddy and Yovanna Melo, raised the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, due to soaring egg costs. Despite revenue declining over the years, the bodega remains afloat due to the Melos owning the building and collecting rent from apartments above the store.

They suggest that the apparent increase in autism rates is primarily due to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and better screening.</p>
