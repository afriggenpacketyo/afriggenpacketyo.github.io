          <p>Japan's exports saw a smaller-than-expected contraction in August, falling 0.1% year-on-year, a softer decline than July's 2.6% drop, primarily due to a rebound in shipments to Asia. Despite this, overall growth remained negative for the fourth consecutive month, influenced by U.S. tariffs and an earlier front-loading of exports. This article notes that while exports to Western Europe also jumped, shipments to the U.S. continued to plunge, particularly in autos. Economists anticipate the Bank of Japan to hold rates steady, with future export volumes potentially shrinking due to slower external demand. (not investment advice)</p>
