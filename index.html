          <p>China's economy showed significant signs of slowing in July, as key indicators failed to meet expectations. Retail sales growth decelerated, and industrial output registered its weakest increase since November of the previous year. Furthermore, fixed-asset investment expanded at a slower pace than anticipated, pointing to persistent weakness in domestic demand and the ongoing challenges from Beijing's industrial capacity curbs. Economists are now cautioning that without fresh policy support, China may struggle to meet its annual growth target of 5 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Australian man convicted of murdering British expatriate Emma Lovell during a home invasion in 2022 will be eligible for supervised release sooner than expected. The Queensland Court of Appeal reduced his non-parole period from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence, cutting his minimum time served by 17 months. Judges cited the man's early guilty plea, which spared Lovell's family the trauma of a trial, as well as his genuine remorse and troubled upbringing as factors in their decision. The case had previously fueled public outrage and led to stricter youth crime laws in the state.</p>

          <p>A man was fatally struck by a vehicle on a freeway in Monrovia, a suburb of Los Angeles, as he attempted to escape an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid. The incident occurred near a Home Depot, a site where day laborers often gather for work and one of several locations targeted by recent ICE operations in Southern California. The event has intensified fear within immigrant communities and drawn condemnation from local officials, who argue such raids terrorize families and create dangerous situations. The Trump administration has significantly increased immigration enforcement and detention nationwide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump made false claims that crime in Washington D.C. is at an all-time high to justify a 30-day federal takeover of the city's police department. The move has seen the deployment of National Guard troops and federal agents, who are conducting checkpoints and clearing homeless encampments. This assertion of federal control, permitted under the D.C. Home Rule Act, has been met with strong opposition from local Democratic officials, who argue the president is painting a false, damaging picture of the city for political purposes.</p>

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concluded with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending that this article argues is a weirdly perfect and more truthful resolution for the character. After three seasons exploring widowhood and rekindled romances, the show brings Carrie to a place of self-acceptance, realizing that a life without a male partner is not a tragedy. This conclusion is seen as a correction to the original "Sex and the City" finale, better honoring the franchise's core theme that friendships, not romantic relationships, are the most enduring and powerful soulmates.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, alleging that the company has failed to implement adequate safety measures, allowing it to become a space where sexual predators can victimize children. The suit, brought by Attorney General Liz Murrill, claims Roblox prioritizes user growth and profits over child safety. This legal action follows similar lawsuits and growing criticism that the popular platform, with over 111 million monthly users, is not doing enough to protect its young user base from harmful content and exploitation.</p>

          <h2>Poll Reveals Two-Thirds of Americans Believe Tipping Expectations Have Increased</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 20:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll finds that a significant majority of Americans, two-thirds, feel that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. Many respondents view tipping less as a way to show appreciation and more as an added, often obligatory, cost. This sentiment is widespread across various income levels, and few people who have noticed the trend consider it a positive development. The perception reflects broader public concerns about rising prices and the increasing cost of living in the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>The British government is partnering with TikTok influencers and medical content creators to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. This campaign aims to curb the rise in so-called medical tourism, which has led to numerous cases of botched procedures leaving patients with life-altering injuries. The influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor, purchase proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include medical treatments, in an effort to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS to fix complications.</p>

          <p>Four years after making a highly publicized switch to a completely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm announced that the dining room will now serve select dishes with fish and meat, including its famous honey-lavender-glazed duck. Humm cited a decline in private event bookings and wine sales as key factors, stating that the all-vegan approach was excluding potential diners. The reversal highlights the significant commercial challenges of sustaining a luxury, plant-based dining experience.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years into the war in Gaza, Israeli society is experiencing deep internal divisions that have widened into chasms. A secular, anti-government protest movement, centered on the families of hostages, is demanding an immediate deal to end the war and secure the release of captives. This faction is clashing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's religious-nationalist coalition partners, who view the war as a divine opportunity to annex Gaza and oppose any compromise. This article explores how these opposing worldviews are shaping the national conversation and the future of the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska is framed by starkly different goals for each leader. Putin likely aims to achieve international recognition, demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate him have failed, while also seeking to solidify territorial claims in Ukraine. In contrast, Trump's primary motivation appears to be burnishing his legacy as a global peacemaker, though his vacillating statements make his specific strategy unpredictable. This analysis suggests Putin may seek to leverage the meeting for symbolic victories, regardless of any substantive outcome on the war.</p>
