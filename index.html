          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 01:05:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk confirmed Tesla has entered into a $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of advanced semiconductors. The deal, effective until the end of 2033, is for Tesla's next-generation AI chips, with production slated for Samsung's new facility in Texas. Musk highlighted the strategic importance of this partnership, suggesting the final value could exceed the initial figure as Tesla will assist in optimizing manufacturing efficiency. This agreement is crucial for Tesla's AI and autonomous driving ambitions and provides a significant boost to Samsung's foundry business. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent trade agreement between the European Union and the United States, while averting a broader conflict, leaves several key issues unresolved. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on many EU goods but maintains a steep 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, creating disappointment in sectors like Germany's auto industry. Uncertainty persists around specific product categories, and the deal creates trade disparities on the island of Ireland. Analysts note that the agreement is a high-level political accord, with President Trump retaining the ability to alter terms, leaving tariffs much higher than historical levels.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the starvation occurring in Gaza is a deliberate and foreseeable crisis resulting from Israel's prolonged siege, which has blocked essential aid. The author highlights the devastating toll on children, who are dying from malnutrition and related diseases at an alarming rate. The piece criticizes the international community's response as inadequate, describing statements from Western leaders as "hollow" and performative. It concludes by asserting that continued public protest is the only remaining lever to pressure political establishments into taking meaningful action, such as ceasing military and trade relations with Israel.</p>

          <p>Following the England women's football team's historic Euro 2025 victory against Spain, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans for a celebratory bank holiday. This decision aligns with the precedent set after their 2022 win and the men's 1966 World Cup victory. While a homecoming parade is scheduled, the government appears to be weighing the economic cost of an extra day off, previously estimated at over £1 billion. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner will host a special reception for the team, but calls for a national holiday, previously supported by Keir Starmer, will likely go unheeded.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker at the Dharmasthala temple in Karnataka, India, has alleged that he was forced to dispose of hundreds of bodies over nearly two decades, many showing signs of sexual assault and violence. In a police complaint, the man claimed his supervisors at the famous pilgrimage center covered up the deaths and threatened him into silence. The allegations, which include the murder of poor individuals and underage girls, have prompted the state government to form a Special Investigation Team. The scandal has led families of missing persons to demand their cases be reopened, while the temple administration states it supports a transparent investigation.</p>

          <p>While a new trade deal with the U.S. lowers tariffs on Japanese-made vehicles from 25% to 15%, it offers little comfort to Japan's auto industry, which faces more significant long-term threats.

Domestic economic issues in Japan, such as weak consumer spending, further compound the problem for companies like Nissan. The tariff deal provides some predictability, but the industry's outlook remains challenging due to these structural shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

The model forecasts a more than 46% drop in global exports to the U.S. by 2027 compared to recent years, as the 15% tariff on EU goods makes them less competitive. The simulation suggests countries will rewire their trade relationships away from the U.S., with China expected to see a massive $485 billion decrease in its exports to America.

The policy states that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, and reasonable corrective actions are taken, the individuals and units involved should not be punished or have their future funding applications hindered. This move is designed to encourage innovators to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and take risks necessary for significant scientific breakthroughs. The rules apply to all universities, hospitals, and companies receiving government financial aid for technological innovation.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: How 'Japan First' Populism, Fueled by Economic Woes and Tourism, is Reshaping Politics</h2>

          <p>Japan's traditionally stable political landscape is being shaken by the rise of the far-right Sanseito party, which recently surged to 15 seats in the upper house elections. Running on a "Japanese First" slogan reminiscent of Donald Trump's populism, the party has capitalized on public frustration with inflation, stagnant wages, and a perceived increase in disorderly conduct by foreign tourists. Analysts suggest the party's success reflects a broader discontent, particularly among younger voters, and a desire for change. This shift challenges the long-standing dominance of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and introduces a new, more volatile element into Japanese politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought stated that President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve is primarily about securing lower interest rates, not a broader overhaul as detailed in Project 2025. When questioned about the conservative blueprint's chapter on restructuring the Fed, Vought claimed, "I don't even know what that chapter says." Project 2025, a policy guide for a new Republican administration, proposes limiting the Fed's mandate to solely focusing on stable money. Vought's comments appear to distance the administration's immediate goals from the more sweeping institutional changes advocated by the conservative think tank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Thomas Massie is criticizing House Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership for preventing a vote on a bill to release federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Massie, along with Democratic co-sponsor Ro Khanna, argues that Johnson's claim that the bill lacks protections for victims is a "straw man argument," as their legislation includes redactions for victims' names. Massie warned that failing to hold a vote on the popular bipartisan measure before the midterm elections could be a political liability for Republicans, potentially costing them their majority.

This marks North Korea's first formal response to President Lee Jae Myung's administration, signaling that Pyongyang sees no immediate reason to resume diplomacy.
