          <h2>Trump Announces Framework for U.K. Trade Deal Amidst Tariff Negotiations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer announced a preliminary trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K., aiming to increase market access and reduce trade barriers. The deal maintains a 10% tariff on U.K. imports but provides exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually. Commerce Secretary Lutnick estimates the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S., with Rolls Royce engines exempt from tariffs. The agreement is viewed as a symbolic victory for both nations, though some analysts believe its substantive benefits will be limited, as the U.S. still maintains a trade surplus in goods with the U.K.</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, via email. Democratic leaders such as Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer criticized the move, with Schumer calling for the Librarian of Congress to be appointed by a Congressional commission rather than the president. Hayden, who had served since 2016, previously led the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore. The firing has ignited debate about the politicization of federal appointments and the importance of the Library of Congress.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, surpassing market expectations despite the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the U.S. However, exports to the United States decreased by 21%. Imports to China fell by 0.2% year on year, while China's trade surplus decreased to US$96.18 billion. President Trump had announced tariffs of up to 145% on various Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory duties from China on American goods. The data indicates that while trade tensions impact specific markets, China's overall export sector demonstrates resilience.</p>

          <p>A grand jury investigation into the Hanceville Police Department in Alabama uncovered a "rampant culture of corruption," leading to the dismissal of nearly 60 felony cases. The investigation revealed mishandling and removal of evidence, including firearms, cash, and drugs, from the department's evidence room. An audit showed that nearly 40% of evidence bags lacked proper documentation. The town's mayor had previously placed the entire department on leave and decided to disband and rebuild it. District Attorney Champ Crocker expressed concern over the compromised cases, most of which were drug-related.</p>

The CEO of Almonty Industries notes that US defense contractors face a 2027 deadline to cease using Chinese tungsten.

          <p>Despite Russia's announcement of a three-day ceasefire, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians report continued attacks and distrust of Russian intentions. The sounds of explosions persist in the Donetsk region, with soldiers stating they are always prepared for attacks. President Zelensky has rejected Russia's unilateral ceasefire, calling for a longer 30-day truce, which has been supported by President Trump. Civilians in Dobropillya express fear and skepticism, highlighting the ongoing reality of the conflict despite diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the U.S.-U.K. trade deal suggests that its substantive benefits are limited, with the 10% import tax on most U.K. goods remaining intact. The deal primarily involves the U.S. rolling back some import taxes on strategic sectors in exchange for increased access for American agricultural products in the U.K. While steelmakers and car firms expressed relief, analysts note that goods from the U.K. still face higher tariffs than before. The deal is viewed as a political victory for both Trump and Starmer, but its economic impact is expected to be narrow.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that Jeanine Pirro, a Fox News personality, will be the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., after withdrawing his previous nominee.

The move is seen as an attempt to place a trusted ally in a key Justice Department position.</p>

This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, with various countries commemorating the event. President Xi Jinping is scheduled to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>

          <p>A federal lawsuit accuses UCLA's medical school of using race as a factor in admissions, despite state law and Supreme Court rulings against affirmative action. The lawsuit, brought by activist groups and a rejected applicant, alleges that the medical school prioritizes race over merit. It claims that the associate dean for admissions requires applicants to submit responses that reveal their race, and that Black applicants are admitted with lower scores than white and Asian applicants. The Trump administration is already scrutinizing UCLA for potential “illegal DEI” practices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump proposes creating a new top income bracket for individuals making over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6%. This move would partially reverse the tax cuts from 2017. Republicans are considering other tax hikes, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting compensation deductions for highly paid employees. Trump believes a tax increase on the rich could protect Medicaid.</p>
