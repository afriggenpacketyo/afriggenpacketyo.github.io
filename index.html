          <p>House Republicans are facing internal discord over a Medicaid overhaul plan, a key component of President Trump's legislative agenda. Hardliners criticize the plan's delayed implementation of work requirements and the potential for states to waive these requirements, while others raise concerns about Medicaid eligibility for undocumented immigrants. The infighting threatens to derail the megabill, as Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose a few GOP votes. The article highlights the challenges Johnson faces in unifying his divided conference and delivering a legislative win for the president. This is happening as Democrats are fighting against the proposal, claiming it will leave millions uninsured.</p>

          <p>AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave reported strong revenue growth in its first earnings release since its IPO, surpassing analyst expectations. The company's revenue soared by 420% year-over-year, driven by increasing demand for its AI infrastructure, particularly from OpenAI, with whom they have a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite the positive results, the stock initially dipped in extended trading, and the company's net loss widened due to stock-based compensation costs. CoreWeave anticipates significant capital expenditures to support its rapid growth, and the company does not foresee any major issues stemming from President Trump's new tariffs.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown academic, was released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order, hours after the ruling. Khan Suri was targeted by the Trump administration for his pro-Palestinian activism, spending two months in detention. The judge stated the release was "in the public interest to disrupt the chilling effect on protected speech". Immigration officials had revoked his visa, alleging his father-in-law was an advisor to Hamas and citing his social media posts. The US secretary of state claimed his presence would have "potentially serious foreign policy consequences".</p>

          <p>Anti-abortion activists have initiated a coordinated campaign, dubbed "Rolling Thunder," to pressure the FDA to reinstate restrictions on mifepristone, a medication used in most abortions in the US. This includes promoting a report claiming mifepristone causes high rates of health complications, despite contradicting existing safety data. Republican Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a bill to reimpose restrictions and allow lawsuits against telehealth providers. While the Trump administration has sent mixed signals, experts believe the ultimate goal is to ban the drug entirely, potentially ending telemedicine abortion access.</p>
