          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, drawing attention ahead of the annual shareholder meeting. A new ETF, VistaShares Target 15 Berkshire Select Income ETF (OMAH), holds Berkshire's top 20 stocks and aims to provide a 15% annual income through call options. Berkshire's decision not to pay dividends has led to the creation of this ETF, which distributes monthly payments to shareholders, appealing to those seeking income from their investments (not investment advice). The fund is designed to capture income opportunities amid market volatility, providing an alternative investment strategy for those seeking exposure to Buffett's stock picks with an income component.</p>

          <p>Critics argue that President Trump's policies are inadvertently benefiting Vladimir Putin's agenda, citing pressure on Ukraine and shifts in U.S. foreign policy. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine appears one-sided, potentially allowing Russia to retain control of occupied territories while preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. Furthermore, Trump's actions, including strained relationships with traditional allies, align with Moscow's objectives. This analysis suggests that Trump's policies, whether intentional or not, are advantageous to Russia's geopolitical goals.</p>

The film presents a series of vignettes depicting the everyday struggles and resilience of a family. With its understated approach and documentary-like simplicity, the film offers a radical depiction of ordinary Black life at a time when such images were scarce. The film features blues, R&B, and jazz on the soundtrack, and serves as a soulful counterpoint to the critical portrait of inequality.</p>
