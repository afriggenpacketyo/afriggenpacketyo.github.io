          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the country's military conducted airstrikes in Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and research scientists in an operation dubbed "Operation Rising Lion". Iranian state television reported that the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, was killed in the strikes. The United States stated they were not involved in the operation, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing the priority of protecting American forces in the region and advising Iran against targeting U.S. interests. Iranian state media reported explosions and casualties in Tehran and Natanz, while the U.S. Embassy in Israel advised employees to shelter in place.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer ruled that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles, and granted their request to block his use of the forces to assist immigration agents during raids. Breyer stated that Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment. The Justice Department appealed the order, but Newsom praised the decision as a victory for the Constitution and democracy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump's federalizing of California National Guard troops and deploying them to Los Angeles was "illegal," ordering him to return control of the Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer stayed his temporary restraining order to allow the Trump administration to appeal the decision. Newsom and California's attorney general sued to reverse Trump's federalization of the Guard without the governor's consent. Breyer stated that none of the conditions required for Trump's federalization of the Guard existed, and that Trump's actions threatened the constitutional balance of power between the federal and state governments.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that one of Iran’s top nuclear facilities had been hit in a strike against the regime.

          <p>The article discusses Dan Wang's observation of China as an "engineering state," highlighting the nation's impressive infrastructure and technological advancements. China has rapidly developed its transportation systems, including subway stations and high-speed rail, surpassing the United States in the scale and speed of construction. The country's focus on STEM fields has led to a large number of engineering graduates and a prioritization of engineering in national security. This contrasts with the United States, which Wang characterizes as a "lawyerly state," where lawyers often hold top government positions.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China as early as 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The findings indicate that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. This discovery offers new insights into the origins of animal domestication and early agricultural practices.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has begun, serving as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. All eyes are on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can retain its seats, given his Cabinet's approval ratings. Parties are using social media to appeal to voters, especially those unaffiliated, with major issues including support for households facing rising living costs and political funding scandals involving the LDP. Around 300 candidates are running in the assembly election, making it the highest number of candidates in over 30 years.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are focusing on overseas expansion to ensure their survival amid ongoing trade tariffs imposed by the U.S. Despite a temporary truce in the tariff war, exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. still face significant levies. Companies are diversifying their production bases, with a shift towards the Middle East and Africa for planned capacity expansion. Executives emphasize that localizing production abroad is essential due to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the potential for increased trade barriers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings that it could be costly and increase the risk of catastrophic blazes. The order aims to centralize firefighting efforts, which are currently split among five agencies and two cabinet departments. Trump's proposed budget calls for the creation of a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the US interior department. Critics argue that restructuring firefighting efforts could cause major disruptions in the middle of fire season and potentially increase the likelihood of large, catastrophic fires.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump stated he may raise tariffs on auto imports in the near future to attract more investment in American manufacturing. Trump believes higher tariffs will incentivize companies to build plants in the United States. This move is aimed at boosting domestic production and creating jobs.

Clinical trials showed it halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current therapies.</p>
