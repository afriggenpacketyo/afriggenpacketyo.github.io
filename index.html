The article notes that Russia's manufacturing and technological capabilities regarding drones are evolving, making them harder to detect. The air force reported shooting down many missiles and UAVs, but damage and casualties were widespread across multiple regions. The article also states that Russia's defense ministry claimed to have inflicted damage on military targets across 142 areas.</p>

The move is a transparent show of Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney - a Liberal - has invited King Charles the III to open the 45th Canadian parliament. Prime Minister Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by saying it would be better off as a US state. It also works to tie Canada closer to Europe - a key objective of Prime Minister Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England, who has spoken about the need for Canada to find new allies as it navigates its changing relationship with the US.</p>
