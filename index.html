          <p>Republican senators, including Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, are voicing opposition to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act due to concerns about its impact on the national debt, which has reached nearly $37 trillion. These senators are pushing for deeper spending cuts than those proposed in the House-passed bill. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by over $1.5 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would still add about $3.1 trillion to the debt. Trump has criticized Paul's opposition, and the White House insists the bill will save $1.6 trillion over ten years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Ukraine and Russia intensify attacks and engage in negotiations, the Trump administration is stepping back from mediating the conflict. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the U.S. played a smaller role in the recent talks held in Istanbul. U.S. officials expressed disappointment with Russia's demands for a truce, which included conditions viewed as nonstarters by Ukraine and the Trump administration. Despite the lack of progress, both Russia and Ukraine have escalated their attacks, with Ukraine launching drone strikes inside Russia and Russia deploying a record number of drones and missiles against Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right Freedom Party, withdrew his party from the governing coalition due to a dispute over immigration policy. Wilders sought stricter asylum measures, which were dismissed due to legal concerns. His former coalition partners have accused him of orchestrating the crisis. Snap elections are likely to be called, with Wilders expected to focus on asylum issues in his campaign.

          <p>Chelsea has decided not to permanently sign winger Jadon Sancho, who was on loan from Manchester United. Instead, Chelsea will pay a £5 million penalty to return the player to Manchester United.

Chelsea had an obligation to buy Sancho for around £25 million if they finished above 14th in the Premier League, which they did, or pay to get out of the deal.</p>

          <p>As hurricane season begins, forecasters are predicting above-average activity, with six to ten hurricanes expected in the Atlantic. This heightened activity is attributed to unusually warm Caribbean waters and a neutral ENSO phase. Concerns are rising about NOAA's ability to accurately forecast and respond to severe storms due to staffing shortages and proposed budget cuts under the Trump administration. Climate scientists have challenged claims that the government is prepared, citing the loss of employees and potential breakdown in proper warning and evacuation procedures.</p>

          <p>The Planet Money newsletter explores the potential of revitalizing the manufacturing sector to promote economic growth in the American heartland and reduce regional inequality. Manufacturing, as a tradable sector, can attract new wealth from outside a community and foster economic ecosystems. Economists estimate that each manufacturing job can create additional jobs in the local community through multiplier effects. While manufacturing may not be the only solution for struggling communities, it presents a viable option for regionally diversified economic growth.</p>

          <p>More than 200 inmates escaped from a prison in Karachi, Pakistan, after being temporarily moved out of their cells due to earthquake tremors. Prison officials allowed the inmates into the courtyard, which caused "panic" during the tremors, leading to a group attacking guards and fleeing with seized weapons. One prisoner was killed and three security officials were wounded in the ensuing shootout, but the situation has been brought under control. Police are conducting raids to recapture the remaining escapees.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is in doubt after KKR, a US private equity giant, withdrew from plans to invest in the company. This setback increases the possibility of the company collapsing into government-supervised administration. The company serves about a quarter of the UK's population but has huge debts and struggles to fix leaks, stop sewage spills, and modernize outdated infrastructure. The withdrawal was on the same morning that an independent commission released interim findings of a review into how the water industry can be reformed.</p>

          <p>Work requirements for government benefits have been proposed several times over the past 46 years. Each time, these work rules have been initially denounced by opponents as “cruel,” “punitive,” “blaming the victim.” Yet each time work requirements have been implemented, they have resulted in increased employment and other life benefits for a significant segment of participants, their families and local communities. A job brings structure to participants in work requirement programs, somewhere to go every day.</p>

          <h2>Southern California Faces Triple Threat: Thunderstorms, Dry Lightning, and Rip Currents</h2>

          <p>Southern California is bracing for a combination of risky weather conditions, including thunderstorms, dry lightning, and rip currents. A low-pressure system will bring a chance of thunderstorms, particularly in the San Gabriel Mountains and interior regions. The dry air near the surface increases the risk of dry lightning, which can spark wildfires. Along the coast, a south swell is expected to generate elevated surf and rip currents, posing a threat to swimmers and surfers.</p>
