          <p>Overnight Russian airstrikes across Ukraine have resulted in at least 25 fatalities, with attacks striking a prison and a hospital. The deadliest incident occurred at a penitentiary in the Zaporizhzhia region, where 16 inmates were killed and over 50 were injured. Additional strikes killed five people waiting for humanitarian aid in Kharkiv and three people at a hospital in Dnipropetrovsk. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned the attacks, calling for stronger international sanctions to compel Russia to seek peace.</p>

          <p>Flight attendants at United Airlines have voted to reject a tentative labor agreement that included immediate raises of at least 26%. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents about 28,000 cabin crew members, announced that 71% of voters opposed the deal. The union stated the proposed contract did not sufficiently address years of hard work and sacrifice by its members. The rejection sends a strong message to management, and the union will now survey members to identify key improvements needed before returning to negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's direct involvement in the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files is drawing scrutiny due to his past work as Donald Trump's personal lawyer. Blanche recently conducted a two-day interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, a highly unusual move for a senior DOJ official, raising questions about impartiality. Critics express concern that Blanche's history could create an appearance of protecting the president's image rather than ensuring a disinterested pursuit of justice in the politically sensitive case involving widespread sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition alleges that American labor activist Chris Smalls was physically assaulted by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) after an aid ship he was on was intercepted. Smalls, co-founder of the Amazon Labor Union, was reportedly choked and kicked by soldiers while in custody. The ship, named the Handala, was attempting to deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza, where a severe famine is unfolding. The coalition condemned the violence against Smalls, who was the only Black person aboard the vessel, and demanded accountability for the discriminatory treatment.</p>

          <p>Flash floods in Nigeria's Adamawa state have killed at least 23 people, with another 11 reported missing, according to the UN humanitarian agency. The flooding, which began on Sunday, has submerged several communities in the Yola area and displaced over 5,500 people. Emergency management agencies have set up a camp for the displaced and are providing basic materials. Nigeria frequently experiences severe flooding during its rainy season due to poor infrastructure, and climate change is believed to be fueling more extreme weather events in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly shortened his previous 50-day ultimatum, now giving Russia a 10-day deadline to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. If a deal is not reached by August 8, the U.S. plans to impose secondary sanctions and tariffs on countries conducting business with Russia. This escalation reflects growing U.S. frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to ending the war, as diplomatic conversations have been followed by continued attacks on Ukrainian cities. The move aims to increase pressure on Moscow to negotiate a lasting peace.</p>

In response, Tea has taken the affected system offline out of an abundance of caution, while cybersecurity experts criticize the app for what they call inadequate security protections.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk plummeted 23% after it announced a new CEO and slashed its full-year financial guidance.

Company veteran Maziar Mike Doustdar will take over as CEO. The lowered outlook has intensified negative sentiment surrounding the company, which has already seen its share price fall significantly this year amid disappointing trial results for other drug candidates.
