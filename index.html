          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual assault and sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Giuffre had accused Epstein and Prince Andrew of sexual assault when she was a minor. She had previously settled a civil lawsuit with Epstein for $500,000 in 2009 and Prince Andrew settled a lawsuit in 2022 without admitting wrongdoing. Her family stated that she had been a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, expected to be a high pick, went undrafted through the first three rounds of the NFL Draft, a historically shocking slide for a quarterback prospect. Experts and analysts had projected Sanders to be a top pick, but he was passed over by multiple teams. Anonymous NFL coaches cited concerns about his entitlement, body language, and on-field performance. The slide prompted debate, with President Trump even weighing in, while Sanders expressed gratitude despite the unexpected turn of events.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, the possibility of separating from the rest of Canada and joining the United States is being discussed, fueled by Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state and resentment towards Liberal policies. Some Albertans feel overlooked by politicians in Ottawa and view environmental policies as an attack on the region's economic growth. While an independent Alberta remains unlikely, the sentiment underscores a challenge for Canada's next prime minister, potentially leading to a "national unity crisis" if Alberta's demands are not met.</p>

          <p>Canadians are preparing for a federal election, with a tight race between the ruling Liberals, led by Mark Carney, and the opposition Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre. Carney, a former head of the Banks of Canada and England, is politically untested but hailed for his financial expertise. Poilievre, known for his confrontational style, has been critical of the Liberals' policies and promises a return to "common sense politics." The Bloc Québécois and the New Democratic Party also play key roles in the election, particularly in Quebec.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has rescinded a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, now allowing authorities to use subpoenas and compel testimony from reporters. Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the need to stop government employees from leaking sensitive information. The policy allows for subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists, subject to DOJ leadership approval and advance notice. The move marks a return to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations.</p>

          <p>Senators are calling for an ethics investigation into President Donald Trump's dinner with holders of his meme coin, $TRUMP, alleging potential "pay to play" corruption. The value of the coin surged after the announcement of the dinner, raising concerns that Trump and his family are profiting from political influence. The senators are asking ethics officials to determine if Trump violated federal ethics rules by offering exclusive access to top investors in his coin. The letter highlights concerns about foreign ties and potential conflicts of interest.</p>
