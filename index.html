          <p>Ole Miss Rebels head coach Lane Kiffin celebrated a hard-fought 34-26 road victory against No. 13 Oklahoma by engaging in some post-game banter with Oklahoma lineman David Stone. Kiffin was overheard on a hot mic reminding Stone of his earlier taunts during the game, stating, "You's a little quieter now than before." The Rebels, ranked eighth, overcame squandering a 12-point lead in the third quarter by shutting out the Sooners in the fourth.

          <p>Manchester United secured their third consecutive victory by beating Brighton 4-2, leading to speculation that the team has turned a corner after a period of negativity. Manager Ruben Amorim, however, cautioned against premature celebration, reminding everyone of the team's struggles just three weeks prior. Key new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo contributed goals, and the squad's adaptation to Amorim's system, along with improved defensive stability, are cited as factors in their recent success. The team now faces a more forgiving fixture list, providing an opportunity to build on this momentum.</p>

His itinerary includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, aiming for investment deals and peace efforts, such as a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia. The trip unfolds as the U.S. government shutdown persists, causing federal workers to miss paychecks and creating disruptions.

          <p>Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly has won Ireland's presidential election in a landslide, securing 63% of first-preference votes. Connolly, a former barrister and independent lawmaker, received backing from several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin. She pledged to champion diversity and be a voice for peace, emphasizing Ireland's policy of neutrality. Her rival, Heather Humphreys, conceded the election, wishing Connolly well. This victory makes Connolly Ireland's 10th president and the third woman to hold the largely ceremonial post, succeeding Michael D. Higgins after his two terms.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people protested in Valencia, Spain, one year after floods killed 229, making it Europe's worst flood-related disaster since 1967. Demonstrators demanded the resignation of regional leader Carlos Mazon, criticizing his administration for issuing a warning more than 12 hours after the national weather agency's highest alert. Residents reported receiving alerts only after their homes and streets were already flooding. A judicial investigation into the emergency response is underway, while Mazon maintains his administration lacked necessary information and the magnitude was unforeseeable.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins football team experienced a significant setback, suffering a 56-6 loss to No. 2 Indiana, reminiscent of their early-season struggles.

Interim coach Tim Skipper cited a lost battle in the trenches, with the offensive line struggling and the run game failing. Missed tackles, repeated penalties, and blown coverages plagued the defense.

          <p>President Donald Trump's support among Hispanic adults has notably declined since the beginning of his second term, with only 25% now holding a favorable view, down from 44% in March. This plunge in popularity is linked to ongoing hardline immigration enforcement and rising financial strain within Hispanic households. Polling indicates less confidence in Trump's handling of the economy and immigration, issues that previously bolstered his support. The decline is evident across various demographics, including younger Hispanics and Hispanic men, and even among Hispanic Republicans, signaling a significant shift in a crucial voting bloc.</p>

          <p>Indian police have arrested a 30-year-old man for allegedly stalking and sexually assaulting two Australian women cricketers during the ICC Women's World Cup in Indore. The incident occurred when the players were walking near their hotel, and the man reportedly approached them for "a bad touch." Indian authorities acted swiftly following a complaint from the Australian team's security, registering a case and identifying the accused within six hours. India's cricket board called the incident "deeply regrettable and isolated," promising to review and strengthen existing safety protocols for athletes.</p>

          <p>One year after the historic removal of four dams on the Klamath River, the largest project of its kind in U.S. history, the river is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery. Threatened coho salmon have returned to upper river reaches, and Chinook salmon were spotted in headwaters for the first time in over a century. Indigenous youth, who were the first to kayak the entire river post-removal, are now inspiring similar restoration efforts globally. This environmental success story demonstrates that dedicated collective action can lead to significant ecological wins and renewed connections with natural waterways.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, aimed at redrawing congressional district lines to counteract Republican gerrymandering efforts in other states, is gaining significant support through "screw Trump" messaging. Governor Gavin Newsom and Democrats are framing the measure as a direct response to President Trump's influence on electoral manipulation. Despite mixed feelings about abandoning non-partisan maps, recent polls show a strong majority of Californians intending to vote "yes," largely motivated by opposition to Trump. This partisan framing appears to be a powerful factor in swaying voters, even for a complex ballot initiative.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks surged to record highs this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both gaining significantly, driven by cooler-than-expected inflation data and robust corporate earnings. The consumer price index showed smaller increases than anticipated, bolstering expectations for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Strong earnings reports from major companies, with 87% beating expectations, further fueled market optimism. This positive performance occurred despite ongoing government shutdown drama and trade tensions, indicating that market focus remained on economic fundamentals and corporate profitability.

          <p>A commentary in a key Communist Party publication suggests that digital currencies are emerging as a disruptive tool in global geopolitics, potentially enabling China to "militarize" cryptocurrencies to sanction-proof its economy. The article highlights that digital currencies, both central bank-issued and private, offer fast, secure, and anonymous transaction features suitable for military applications. It notes the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act's authorization of a Pentagon blockchain initiative, implying digital currencies could become a strategic tool for future financial defense. This indicates a growing recognition of digital assets' geopolitical significance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A four-year study in Southern California found that nearly one in five urinary tract infections (UTIs) were linked to E. coli strains originating from contaminated meat, particularly turkey and chicken. Researchers used genomic attribution to trace the bacterial DNA, highlighting that contaminated meat is more than a food safety nuisance, especially impacting female and elderly patients. The study also revealed higher contamination rates in lower-income areas and "value packs," suggesting systemic issues. Experts advocate for stronger food safety regulations, improved slaughterhouse hygiene, and consumer awareness to mitigate this public health risk.</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated trade negotiations with Canada, citing a Canadian advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. This decision could lead to increased prices for various goods, including home appliances, cars, and auto parts, as Canada is a major steel and aluminum exporter to the U.S. Experts warn that the existing 35% tariffs on many Canadian goods, and 50% on steel and aluminum, may remain in place, raising input costs for manufacturers. The move also casts doubt on the upcoming joint review of the USMCA, potentially impacting further trade agreements. (not investment advice)</p>
