        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a plan to dismantle the popular Energy Star program and other federal appliance efficiency standards, arguing the move will reduce burdensome regulations. This proposal has drawn significant resistance from a broad coalition including consumer protection groups, environmental organizations, and appliance manufacturers. Opponents warn that eliminating these standards could lead to higher energy bills for homeowners and remove a trusted tool for making informed purchases. The debate highlights a clash between deregulation goals and established programs widely seen as beneficial for both consumer savings and energy conservation.</p>

          <p>The recently designated SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands national monument in northern California, a sacred area for the Pit River Tribe, faces a potential threat of having its protections rolled back. President Trump has indicated he would undo the designation to open the land for economic development, challenging the protections established by the Biden administration. This has created uncertainty for the tribe and environmental groups who fought for decades to safeguard the region from industrial projects like geothermal energy extraction. Legal experts anticipate a significant court battle over a president's authority to abolish national monuments, making SÃ¡ttÃ­tla a potential test case.</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is facing sharp criticism from Boston sports radio hosts for revealing that the 2025 season will likely be his last. On WEEI Radio's "The Greg Hill Show," the hosts labeled the announcement a narcissistic move designed to create a season-long "farewell tour." They argued that the early declaration would become a constant distraction for his teammates, who will be repeatedly questioned about it throughout the year. The hosts described Rodgers as an "egomaniac" and "loathsome," suggesting the focus should be on the team's performance rather than his impending retirement.</p>

          <p>President Trump made a public plea for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, posting on social media to "MAKE THE DEAL" and secure the return of hostages. His call for an end to the 20-month conflict comes as the Israeli military issues new mass evacuation orders for Palestinians in northern Gaza. The primary obstacle in negotiations remains Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war in exchange for hostages, a condition Israel rejects. Meanwhile, Trump also criticized the ongoing corruption trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling it a politically motivated distraction from the peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has refrained from endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, citing a need to get to know the candidate better. While praising Mamdani's successful campaign focus on the high cost of living, Jeffries noted that their districts do not overlap and they have never had a substantive conversation. He stated that Mamdani would need to clarify his positions on antisemitism and his relationship with the Jewish community, calling some of his past rhetoric unacceptable.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly advanced President Trump's major legislative package, which aims to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent while increasing spending on defense and border security. The bill, which is being moved through the reconciliation process to bypass Democratic opposition, also proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs. Key provisions include raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 and increasing the child tax credit to $2,200. The legislation faces hurdles, including input from the Senate parliamentarian and dissent from some Republican senators concerned about its impact on their states.</p>

In response, Trump accused the senator of grandstanding for publicity and making a "BIG MISTAKE." This confrontation highlights the internal divisions within the Republican party as they attempt to pass the sweeping legislation before the July 4th holiday.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, titled "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article highlights how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," created a platform for conservative ideas that propelled figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan to prominence. It argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that reshaped the Republican Party, creating a direct lineage to today's political landscape, including the rise of Donald Trump. The analysis presents Buckley's legacy as complex, blending intellectual civility with controversial stances on issues like civil rights.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States must urgently treat its critical mineral supply chains, particularly for rare earth elements, as instruments of geopolitical power to counter China's dominance. The author contends that for over 15 years, the U.S. has failed to address its vulnerability to Beijing, which controls over 90% of the refining capacity for materials essential to defense and technology. Recent Chinese export controls are described as a weaponization of this dependence, exposing a critical failure in U.S. policy across multiple administrations. The article calls for a coherent, long-term strategy involving domestic production, permitting reform, and stronger alliances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its proposed welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that concessions were made after MPs raised concerns that the cuts would harm disabled people. Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health component of Universal Credit rises with inflation for existing recipients. The U-turn has been seen as a way to reset relations within the party, though it has drawn criticism from conservatives for delaying necessary reforms.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Global Health reveals that a significant number of cancer drugs available in four African nations are defective. Researchers tested nearly 200 products in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon, finding that approximately 17% had incorrect levels of active ingredients. Such discrepancies can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for patients. The issue is attributed to a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products, compounded by a lack of regulatory infrastructure and testing capabilities in the region. The findings underscore a broader problem of substandard medicines across low and middle-income countries.</p>

Lotus had temporarily paused production in May due to supply chain issues related to a 25% U.S. tariff, which is set to be reduced. The government expressed its commitment to supporting the UK's automotive sector, and Lotus reiterated that the UK remains the heart of its brand.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Identify Waiting Too Long to Save as the Primary Retirement Planning Mistake</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to financial experts, the most significant error Americans make in retirement planning is delaying the start of their savings. Procrastination, often with the intent to save after earning more or paying off debt, results in missing out on substantial gains from compound interest over decades. Experts also highlight a secondary mistake: focusing on a total savings number rather than creating a reliable income strategy for retirement. The primary recommendation is to begin saving immediately, even with small amounts, to build the habit and take advantage of employer matches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is alerting Americans to a growing "brushing" scam where third-party online sellers send unsolicited, low-value items to random addresses. The sellers then use the recipient's information to post fake "verified" reviews, artificially boosting their product ratings. While receiving a free item may seem harmless, the USPS warns it is a major red flag that an individual's personal information, including their name and address, has been compromised. This data can then be exploited for identity theft, credit fraud, or other malicious activities, prompting officials to advise treating personal information "like cash."</p>

The policy, which will include retailers reporting on healthy food sales to increase accountability, is part of a broader 10-year plan for the NHS.

          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, if they can be their authentic selves, if their partner is genuinely curious about their inner world, and if their partner takes accountability for mistakes. The article argues that healthy relationships require collaborative problem-solving, security in self-expression, ongoing curiosity, and a willingness to repair after conflict. A consistent lack of these qualities can lead to resentment, distance, and a loss of personal identity.</p>
