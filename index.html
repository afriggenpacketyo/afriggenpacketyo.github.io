          <p>Despite calls for direct talks, Vladimir Putin will not be attending peace negotiations with Ukraine in Turkey, instead sending a delegation led by Vladimir Medinsky. This absence casts doubt on the potential for substantial progress, especially as Ukrainian President Zelensky emphasizes the need to see who Russia sends before committing to further steps. The article notes that former President Trump, who has advocated for peace talks, will also not be attending, though Secretary of State Rubio will. The situation remains tense, with Zelensky urging stronger Western sanctions if Putin rejects the meeting, as both sides navigate a complex path toward potential resolution amid ongoing conflict. The article offers insight into the dynamics and uncertainties surrounding the upcoming discussions.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to weaken limits on certain PFAS "forever chemicals" in drinking water, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered. The EPA will grant utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply with standards for PFOA and PFOS. This decision has sparked controversy, with health advocates criticizing the move as illegal and utilities arguing that treatment systems are expensive to install, potentially raising water bills for customers.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction, escalating a clash between the Trump administration and local authorities over immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of helping a man evade ICE agents after learning they were in her courtroom seeking his arrest. She argues she is entitled to judicial immunity and has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The case has drawn comparisons to a similar one during the first Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Co-op narrowly averted being locked out of its computer systems during the cyber attack that saw customer data stolen and store shelves left bare, the hackers who claim responsibility have told the BBC. The revelation could help explain why Co-op has started to recover more quickly than fellow retailer M&S, which had its systems more comprehensively compromised, and is still unable to carry out online orders. Cyber experts like Jen Ellis from the Ransomware Task Force said the response from Co-op was sensible.</p>

          <p>The majestic Bayesian superyacht, which foundered last year off Sicily, killing seven people, was likely knocked over by an intense gust of wind and sank within minutes, according to a preliminary investigation by British maritime authorities. As the storm approached, a young deckhand on watch delayed waking up the captain and instead posted a video of the squall on his social media feed, the investigation found. The wind forces were powerful enough to knock over the yacht even though the sails were furled at the time, investigators found.</p>
