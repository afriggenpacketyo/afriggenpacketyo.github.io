            <h2>China's Exports Surge in March Amid Trade War Concerns</h2>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge of over 12% in March, surpassing expectations, driven by businesses accelerating shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. However, imports declined by 4.3% during the same period, indicating weakening domestic demand. This data arrives amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with the U.S. considering further tariff increases on Chinese goods, which would significantly impact trade relations. The Chinese leadership has set an ambitious annual growth target of around 5% this year, a goal seen harder to achieve given the prospects of an escalating trade war and persistently lackluster domestic consumption.

            <p>South Africa is set to reopen the inquest into the 1967 death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Luthuli, who was the leader of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC). The initial inquest ruled his death as accidental, caused by being struck by a train; however, activists and Luthuli's family have long suspected foul play by the apartheid regime. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) plans to present new evidence to overturn the initial findings, though the details of the evidence have not been disclosed. This reopening coincides with another inquest into the death of anti-apartheid lawyer Mlungisi Griffiths Mxenge, highlighting ongoing efforts to address unresolved cases from the apartheid era.</p>

            <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's trade and tariff policies are causing concern among Americans about rising prices and financial impacts. While Republicans are more likely to believe that the tariffs will lead to more U.S. manufacturing jobs, a majority of Americans anticipate that the tariffs will raise prices. The poll also reveals that more people now believe Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, and his ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative. A majority of the public now considers this Donald Trump's economy, holding his policies responsible for the current economic conditions.</p>

            <h2>Bond Ladder Strategy Offers Stability Amid Market Volatility</h2>

            <p>Amid stock market panic and bond market volatility, investing experts suggest a bond ladder strategy to provide 'peace of mind' income. This approach involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity, providing regular income through principal and interest. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) is an example of an ETF that utilizes this strategy, investing in treasuries from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds and distributing a fixed monthly income. Experts note that while the net asset value of bond ladder ETFs may fluctuate, the key is holding them to maturity for a predictable return. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Londoners with disabilities and chronic health conditions are sharing their experiences using Transport for London's (TfL) 'Please Offer Me a Seat' badge, designed to help them secure seating on public transport. While the scheme aims to raise awareness and encourage passengers to give up their seats, some badge users report being challenged, ignored, or even threatened by other passengers. A TfL survey revealed that a significant percentage of people in priority seats were unaware of their purpose, highlighting the need for increased awareness and improved attitudes toward the scheme. TfL encourages passengers to offer seats to those in need, even if they don't have a badge.</p>

            <p>A geologist warns that the prospect of a mineral bonanza in Greenland, touted by politicians and media outlets, is likely a mirage. He argues that there's no special concentration of minerals and rare earths in Greenland, and there are many places in the world where minerals are easier and cheaper to obtain, such as the USA. The real issue is not to acquire more territory but to develop facilities for processing raw materials and foster a competitive market. The economist is puzzled by why the U.S. believes it needs to acquire Greenland at all.</p>
