          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions, negotiators from the US and China reached a "framework" agreement in London to potentially alleviate the trade conflict. The agreement could involve the US revoking some tech embargoes in exchange for China relaxing rare earth export restrictions. This development followed a call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping after China tightened its rare earth exports, impacting US car manufacturers and defense companies. While the talks may de-escalate tensions, the article suggests that a reorientation of Washingtonâ€™s trade and foreign policy thinking is necessary for lasting optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Christy Walton, a Walmart heiress, funded a full-page New York Times advertisement promoting the "No Kings" protest against President Trump, scheduled for June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th Anniversary parade and Trump's birthday. The ad lists declarations emphasizing values like honoring commitments, defending against dictators, and supporting a healthy economy. Walmart distanced itself from the ad, stating it was not connected to or endorsed by the company. The "No Kings" protest aims to counter Trump's military parade and reject strongman politics and corruption, with the group deliberately choosing the date to detract attention from the parade.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats and some Republicans are criticizing the multimillion-dollar cost of the Army's 250th anniversary parade, which coincides with President Trump's birthday. The Army has allocated between $25 million and $45 million for the parade, which will include troops, tanks, and aircraft. Critics argue that the money could be better spent on supporting military families or medical defense research. Trump defended the parade, stating it showcases the country's greatness and military strength, but others have compared it to displays in authoritarian regimes.</p>

This followed a partial verdict where Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley but not guilty of criminal sexual assault against Kaja Sokola. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of third-degree sexual assault against Jessica Mann, leading to the mistrial. The Manhattan District Attorney's office intends to retry the rape charge, with Mann ready to testify again, while Weinstein's team expressed disappointment and cited potential juror misconduct.</p>

          <p>California is challenging the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles to assist with enforcing federal immigration laws. State officials filed an emergency request to block expansion of what they call the "unlawful militarization." The state argues that Trump failed to meet the legal requirements for such a federal deployment, claiming there is no "rebellion" in Los Angeles.

          <p>A photographer captured the moment Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed and handcuffed during a Homeland Security press conference in Los Angeles. Padilla attempted to ask Secretary Kristi Noem a question, but agents grabbed him, pushed him out of the room, and handcuffed him. The senator later described being forced to the ground and handcuffed, emphasizing the potential impact on ordinary citizens if this is how the administration treats a senator. The images and videos of the incident have sparked controversy amid ongoing immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Democratic governors defended their states' immigration policies during a House committee hearing, countering Republican claims that sanctuary policies endanger Americans. The governors of Minnesota, New York, and Illinois argued that migrants are hardworking and safe residents, while Republicans criticized policies limiting local law enforcement's role in immigration enforcement. The hearing occurred amid ongoing unrest in Los Angeles over immigration raids, with Democrats describing the Trump administration's actions as a threat to civil liberties. The governors also emphasized the importance of due process and family histories as immigrants to the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended a performance of Les MisÃ©rables at the Kennedy Center, which also served as a fundraiser, while protests simmered in Los Angeles over his administration's immigration policies. The musical, known for its themes of social injustice and rebellion against autocracy, presents an ironic backdrop given Trump's policies and views. The article highlights the contrast between the musical's message and Trump's actions, including deploying military force to counter protests. Despite the irony, Trump's appreciation for the show is not surprising, as he has often expressed a love for Broadway musicals and has even used the show's signature song, "Do You Hear the People Sing?" at his rallies.</p>

          <p>A federal court hearing is underway in California over President Trump's deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles.
