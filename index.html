          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck while she slept. The case is unusual as prosecutors have found no motive, and the defense argues Elliott was sleepwalking, a condition with a history in his family. He immediately called 911 upon realizing what he had done, claiming he thought it was a dream. A sleep disorder expert who studied Elliott supports the defense, citing a rare but successful legal precedent for crimes committed while sleepwalking.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical company Pfizer is facing a U.S. class-action lawsuit from more than 1,300 women who allege that its contraceptive injection, Depo-Provera, led to the development of brain tumors. The lawsuit claims Pfizer failed to adequately warn patients and doctors about the increased risk of intracranial meningioma associated with prolonged use of the drug. Pfizer contends that it is protected from liability because the FDA had previously rejected its request to add such a warning to the product's label.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the Trump administration is causing a crisis of legitimacy in the U.S. government by violating the social contract, which requires the government to follow established rules. The author points to actions like defying court orders and the controversial transfer of asylum seekers to a prison in El Salvador as evidence of a shredded constitutional order. The piece also criticizes the Supreme Court for enabling these actions by limiting the power of injunctions, thereby weakening the judiciary's ability to check executive power.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas remarked that he does not consider settled legal precedent to be "gospel" and feels no obligation to adhere to past rulings if he finds they "don't make any sense." Speaking at a university event, he suggested that some precedents may have been based on flimsy reasoning and that justices owe citizens more than simply following prior decisions without question. His comments come as the court prepares to hear cases that could challenge major rulings, including the one that legalized same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>An ancient canoe, believed to have been unearthed by Hurricane Ian in 2022, has been discovered and preserved by Florida state archeologists. The 9-foot vessel is notable because it is made of mahogany, a wood not native to the state, suggesting it may have originated from the Caribbean. Investigators theorize it could be a dugout cayuco crafted by Spanish settlers in the 16th century, a unique addition to the more than 450 ancient canoes already found in Florida.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is experiencing its largest mass resignation in history, with over 100,000 workers set to quit as part of the Trump administration's deferred resignation program. Employees have described a work environment of "fear and intimidation" and public vilification as motivating factors for their departure. The administration defends the program as a cost-saving measure that will reduce government spending by $28 billion annually, while unions argue it undermines essential government functions and was coercive.</p>

          <p>According to a report from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, the country's J-35 stealth fighter has a radar cross-section smaller than a human palm, a claim suggesting a significant leap in its low-observability capabilities. This advancement is credited to the aircraft's unique airframe design and the use of proprietary metamaterial technology. The report draws an implicit comparison to the U.S. F-35 fighter, often described as having a radar signature equivalent to a golf ball, positioning the J-35 as a highly competitive stealth aircraft.</p>

          <p>In response to soaring housing costs, a growing trend has emerged where friends and relatives are pooling their resources to co-buy homes. With U.S. home prices having increased 56% since early 2020, this strategy allows single buyers to overcome the significant affordability gap they face compared to couples. While co-buying expands purchasing power and offers companionship, experts stress the importance of creating formal legal agreements to clearly define ownership, responsibilities, and exit strategies to prevent future disputes.</p>

          <p>Despite some bipartisan interest, Republican lawmakers in Congress are reportedly waiting for President Trump to initiate any negotiations on a permanent legislative solution for DACA recipients. The administration's current immigration priority is overwhelmingly focused on border enforcement and deportation, leaving little room for other initiatives. The coalition of Republicans who previously supported a DACA fix has diminished, and key senators believe no progress can be made until the White House signals a willingness to broker a deal.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is conducting a massive evacuation of over 250,000 people from its coastal regions as it braces for the arrival of Typhoon Bualoi. The storm, which has already caused at least 10 fatalities in the Philippines, is expected to make landfall with powerful winds and heavy rain. Authorities have closed four airports, ordered fishing fleets to return to port, and mobilized thousands of troops in preparation for what they warn could be a multi-faceted natural disaster including flash floods and landslides.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that China is merely "nanoseconds behind" the U.S. in semiconductor technology, emphasizing the need for American companies to compete directly in the Chinese market.

Huang advocated for Washington to allow U.S. tech firms to compete globally, asserting this would maximize America's economic success and geopolitical influence.</p>

          <p>Moldovans are participating in a crucial parliamentary election that will determine the country's geopolitical alignment, presenting a choice between deeper integration with the European Union or a return to Russia's influence. The vote is taking place amid accusations from pro-EU President Maia Sandu of "massive interference" by Russia, which she claims is funding political parties and spreading disinformation. The charged atmosphere was heightened by the disqualification of two pro-Russian parties just before the election for alleged illegal financing.</p>

          <p>For the second time in three years, Swiss voters are deciding on the introduction of a national electronic identity system. A 2021 proposal was rejected due to concerns that private companies would manage the system, raising data privacy fears. The new, revised proposal keeps the e-ID system entirely in public hands, makes it optional, and stores data decentrally on users' smartphones. Supporters claim it will simplify online life, while opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements despite the enhanced safeguards.</p>

          <p>A decades-long, violent feud between the Lyons and Daniel crime families of Scotland has reached a new level with the arrest of four key figures in Dubai. The arrests follow a recent surge in gang-related violence across Scotland, including assaults and fire-bombings, which authorities believe was directed from the UAE. This bloody rivalry, which began in 2001, has involved multiple murders and assassination plots, with the gangs now reportedly leveraging international criminal networks to expand their operations globally.</p>

          <p>According to projections from The Senior Citizens League, Social Security recipients are expected to receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of approximately 2.7% in 2026. This would mark the fifth consecutive year of above-average increases, raising the average retired worker's monthly benefit by about $54. However, this gain is likely to be significantly offset by a projected 11.5% increase in Medicare Part B premiums, continuing a long-term trend of eroding the purchasing power of Social Security benefits.

          <p>This article explains the geopolitical significance of Transnistria, a breakaway region in eastern Moldova that functions as a Russian military and political stronghold. Since a 1992 post-Soviet war, the unrecognized territory has been controlled by pro-Russian separatists and hosts approximately 1,500 Russian soldiers and a large weapons depot. This frozen conflict allows Moscow to exert continuous pressure on Moldova, undermining its sovereignty, interfering in its politics, and creating a significant obstacle to the country's ambitions for European integration.</p>
