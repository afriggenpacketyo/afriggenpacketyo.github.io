          <p>Australia has become the first country to lift all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, a move estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, revoke previous bans on sexually active gay and bisexual men donating blood and plasma. While blood donation rules will be updated in 2026, plasma donation rules take effect in July, allowing people in monogamous relationships of six months or more to donate, regardless of gender or sexuality. This decision aims to increase plasma supplies amid rising global demand, while research indicates the changes will not impact blood and plasma safety.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with signing bonuses as high as $100 million, along with substantial annual compensation packages. Despite Meta's aggressive poaching efforts, Altman stated that none of OpenAI's top talent has accepted the offers. This comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seeks to build a leading artificial intelligence team for the company's "superintelligence" AI lab. Meta's efforts underscore the intense competition for AI talent and the perceived rivalry between the two tech giants.</p>

          <p>Dozens of families are demanding an inquiry into maternity care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust, following concerns about inadequate care leading to deaths and injuries. These families contacted the BBC after an earlier investigation revealed potentially avoidable deaths of 56 babies and two mothers at the trust between 2019 and 2024. Concerns include women feeling unheard, a lack of compassion, and inadequate staffing levels, with some staff members expressing fear of raising concerns. The trust has offered apologies and stated it is taking steps to improve, but families are seeking an independent review.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell in May, with auto shipments to the U.S. dropping nearly 25% due to tariffs, resulting in a trade deficit of 637.6 billion yen. Despite the decline being less than analysts predicted, imports also sank, reflecting weakening domestic demand. Japan and the U.S. have yet to reach a deal on resolving the tariff issue, with ongoing concerns about additional tariffs on Japanese autos and other goods. The auto industry, a key pillar of Japan's economy, is particularly vulnerable, although Japanese automakers also contribute to the U.S. economy through local production. (not investment advice)</p>

This data follows the Bank of Japan's warning about a likely moderation in the country's growth due to trade uncertainties.

          <p>China is expected to play an active role in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, although analysts caution about the limits of its potential influence.

The article suggests that a European-led coalition could provide security guarantees for Ukraine, highlighting the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defense.

          <p>Two wildfires in New Mexico have burned over 80,000 acres, leading to the evacuation of approximately 2,000 homes and a state of emergency declaration. The Buck Fire and the Trout Fire, driven by extreme drought conditions and high temperatures, have prompted emergency response efforts from state and federal officials. The New Mexico National Guard will assist, and the state has allocated $750,000 for emergency response. Smoke advisories have been issued, and red flag warnings are in effect due to continued fire danger.</p>
