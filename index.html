            <p>Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national imprisoned for treason, was released by Russia in a prisoner swap facilitated by the CIA and FSB, marking a potential effort to improve ties between the Trump administration and Moscow. Karelina was arrested for donating a small amount to a Ukrainian humanitarian group and sentenced to 12 years. In exchange, the U.S. freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus on charges of exporting sensitive microelectronics. The exchange highlights the importance of maintaining communication channels with Russia despite bilateral challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Faced with U.S. tariffs reaching triple digits, Chinese exporters are raising prices, diversifying operations, or halting shipments to the U.S., potentially impacting U.S. consumers.

Goldman Sachs cut China's GDP forecast due to trade tensions, estimating a significant impact on employment in export-related businesses.

            <p>After a week of dramatic tariff announcements and reversals, President Trump's trade goals remain uncertain. While trade talks are underway with some countries, instability in tariff policies makes it difficult for businesses to make long-term investment decisions. The trade war with China carries significant economic and political risks, and the potential for increased tariff revenue may be offset by shifts in production and consumption patterns. The situation underscores the complex and volatile nature of international trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The government asserted Senator Marco Rubio's authority in the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist facing deportation. The government presented a memo signed by Rubio stating that Khalil's presence in the U.S. would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests due to his alleged role in "antisemitic protests." Khalil's lawyers criticized the memo, arguing it focused on First Amendment activity rather than foreign policy concerns. The case raises questions about the government's power to deport individuals based on their political activities.</p>
