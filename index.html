          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at the UN General Assembly was marked by a walkout from many delegates as he addressed the ongoing war in Gaza. He vowed to "finish the job" against Hamas, a stance that has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from the UN Secretary-General. Netanyahu's visit to New York also faced protests from families of hostages and occurred amidst a backdrop of Israel's growing isolation on the world stage. His office announced the speech would be broadcast into Gaza via loudspeakers from the Israeli side of the border.</p>

          <p>In a high-interest-rate environment, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are presented as more affordable borrowing options for homeowners compared to personal loans or credit cards. With the average homeowner possessing significant equity, these financial products offer lower rates that are expected to decrease further with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. The article details the current average rates for different loan terms and explains the functional differences between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate HELOC. It also notes potential tax benefits but warns that the home is used as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, current interest rates remain a significant factor amid a challenging market. This article provides the average national rates for 15-year and 30-year mortgages and refinances as of late September 2025. It suggests that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure a better rate, prospective borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms.

          <p>An intellectual property attorney advises that anyone starting a side hustle should, at a minimum, secure a trademark to legally protect their brand. This measure is compared to owning a deed to a house, preventing others from using a similar name, logo, or slogan and potentially suing for a share of the profits. The article stresses the importance of thinking about the future growth of a business, no matter how small it starts. Other recommended legal protections include obtaining copyrights for original work and forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate personal and business assets, thereby protecting personal finances from potential lawsuits.</p>

The article reports the price of gold as of September 25, 2025, while noting that its value is subject to constant fluctuation. Several key factors that influence gold's price are detailed, including supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. The strength of the U.S. dollar and the policies of central banks also play a significant role in determining the value of the precious metal in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, a group of Republican lawmakers is introducing a resolution for Congress to formally condemn violent attacks against Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The resolution highlights what it calls a rise in hostile rhetoric and a significant increase in assaults on ICE personnel since President Trump took office. It lists several recent threats and incidents, arguing that such ideologically motivated violence endangers lives and undermines the rule of law. While the Dallas shooting received bipartisan condemnation, the resolution's praise for the Trump administration's policies could create division among Democrats.</p>

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, held steady at a 2.9% annual rate in August. The headline inflation rate saw a slight increase to 2.7%, with both figures aligning with economists' expectations. The data suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had a limited impact on consumer prices, and strong consumer spending and income growth were also reported. These stable inflation readings are unlikely to alter the Federal Reserve's course, with policymakers still anticipating further interest rate reductions before the end of the year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While interest rates for products like credit cards and auto loans are beginning to ease, mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high, hovering above 6%. This discrepancy is because fixed mortgage rates are more closely tied to the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds than to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate. The gap, or spread, between Treasury yields and mortgage rates is currently wider than historical norms. Economists attribute this to persistent inflation concerns and the Federal Reserve's reduced purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, which has decreased demand and driven up yields for private investors.

          <p>Recent high-profile shootings in the U.S. have featured a disturbing trend: perpetrators leaving written messages on shell casings and firearm magazines. This phenomenon is viewed by extremism experts as a performative act, intended to send a message to specific online communities and gain media attention for the shooter's motives or ideology. The practice draws some historical parallels but has seen a modern resurgence, notably influenced by the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooter. These inscriptions can range from targeted personal messages to nonsensical internet memes, adding a new layer of evidence for investigators to analyze in understanding the motivations behind such violent acts.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, is advancing in Congress with the goal of making Social Security's claiming-age terminology easier to understand. The proposed changes would rename the "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age" and the "full retirement age" (66-67) to "standard benefit age." Additionally, age 70 would be referred to as the "maximum benefit age."

The group, calling itself Radiant, has already posted profiles of 10 children on the dark web, including photos, birthdates, and family details. The breach occurred through a third-party software service called Famly, which stated its own systems were not compromised. One parent reported receiving a threatening phone call from the hackers, who demanded she pressure the nursery to pay. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident, which Famly's CEO described as a "barbaric new low."</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has suspended newly announced export controls on semiconductor products to South Africa. The curbs, which would have required prior approval for shipping 47 different chip-related products, were introduced amid a diplomatic dispute over South Africa's demand that Taipei change the name of its representative office. Following the announcement of the controls, South Africa agreed to suspend its demand and engage in further discussions. This led Taiwan to backtrack on the planned measures, which were seen as a rare unilateral move by Taipei to use its dominance in the chip industry for diplomatic leverage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that fewer than one in three U.S. teenagers with opioid use disorder receive any form of treatment, even as overdose deaths in this age group have nearly tripled since 2018. The rapid increase in fatalities is partly attributed to the prevalence of counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, which teenagers may encounter while experimenting with drugs. Experts highlight a severe lack of available treatment options for adolescents, especially medication-assisted treatments like buprenorphine, which are considered the most effective. This treatment gap leaves young people vulnerable, with addiction specialists warning that failure to intervene early can lead to more severe disorders and fatal outcomes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the use of American PR and marketing firms by Israel's government to reshape public perception of the war in Gaza. It highlights a report from polling firm Stagwell Global, commissioned by Israel's foreign ministry, which suggested strategies to reframe the narrative by stoking fears of radical Islam. The author argues that these multi-million dollar propaganda campaigns, which allegedly include bot-based programs to "flood the zone" with pro-Israel messaging, aim to create uncertainty and fatigue around the conflict. This effort, combined with media complicity, works to obscure the reality on the ground and diminish accountability for the devastation in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to newly released government data, immigrants with no criminal record now constitute the largest group of individuals arrested by ICE and held in U.S. immigration detention. The figures show that 16,523 detainees arrested by ICE have no criminal history, surpassing the number of those with convictions or pending charges. This marks a significant shift under the second Trump administration and contradicts the narrative that enforcement primarily targets dangerous criminals. The total number of people in ICE custody has reached a record high of nearly 60,000, driven by a directive to increase daily arrests, which has led to a surge in so-called collateral arrests.</p>

          <p>China has initiated two trade investigations into Mexico, a move analysts interpret as a clear warning against aligning too closely with U.S. trade policies. One probe is an anti-dumping investigation into pecans from Mexico and the U.S., while the other examines whether Mexico has erected unfair trade barriers against Chinese goods. This action follows Mexico's recent proposal to impose its own duties on various imports, which notably spared the United States and Canada. Experts suggest Beijing is flexing its economic muscle to signal that it will not tolerate actions it perceives as being taken under pressure from Washington.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on her marriage to a man who is her political opposite—a devoted supporter of Donald Trump. Despite their conflicting views, which once led a marriage counselor to advise them to avoid politics entirely, their 15-year relationship endures. The author describes the tension that arises from their differences but ultimately focuses on the qualities that hold them together, such as mutual laughter, support, and acts of kindness. The piece illustrates how love and personal connection can coexist with, and sometimes transcend, the profound political and cultural divisions prevalent in contemporary American society.</p>

          <p>Hiring a financial advisor involves understanding how they are compensated, which typically falls into commission-based or fee-based models. Commissions are one-time payments for selling a product, which can create conflicts of interest, while fee-based structures include charges based on assets under management (AUM), flat annual fees, or hourly rates. The most common model is the AUM fee, where an advisor charges a percentage of the client's portfolio. The article explains the pros and cons of each model and advises consumers to ask direct questions about fees and potential conflicts to protect their investments and ensure transparency.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs survey of 245 family offices reveals that the ultra-wealthy prefer investing in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities rather than direct investments in startups or venture capital funds. Over half of the respondents reported AI exposure via stocks or ETFs, compared to just a quarter investing directly in private AI companies. This preference is attributed to more reasonable valuations in public markets and the significant presence of AI-driven companies among top stocks in the S&P 500. The trend indicates that while high-profile tech billionaires make headlines backing startups, the broader cohort of wealthy investors is taking a more conventional approach.

His defense argues that the act was unintentional, citing a family history of sleepwalking and expert analysis from a sleep disorder specialist who believes Benjamin was in a state of slow-wave sleep.
