          <p>Russia launched a significant wave of 136 drones and four missiles into Ukraine, coinciding with the arrival of U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv. The attack comes as the Trump administration is expected to announce a new policy on the conflict, having recently signaled it would provide Ukraine with more advanced Patriot air defense systems. Ukrainian officials reported shooting down 108 of the drones, but impacts were recorded in ten locations. The developments underscore the escalating military situation as diplomatic and strategic discussions about future U.S. support and potential peace talks continue.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator has conditionally approved the acquisition of engineering software firm Ansys by U.S. chip design software giant Synopsys. The approval requires the combined entity to honor all existing contracts with Chinese clients and not reject renewal requests, highlighting the critical role of this technology for China's semiconductor industry. This decision is viewed as a sign of de-escalating tech tensions between Washington and Beijing, particularly after the U.S. recently lifted certain export controls on electronic design automation (EDA) software. The move ensures Chinese firms maintain access to essential design tools.</p>

          <h2>NATO's 5% Defense Spending Goal Faces Scrutiny Amid Economic Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO members have agreed to a new target of spending 5% of their GDP on defense and related infrastructure by 2035, a move championed by U.S. President Donald Trump. However, the commitment is facing resistance, notably from Spain, which argues the target is unreasonable and could harm its economy by diverting funds from social programs. Experts question the feasibility for many nations, especially those with high government debt, to meet these ambitious pledges without significant tax hikes or cuts to other public services. The debate highlights the difficult balance between bolstering collective security and maintaining domestic economic stability.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has minimized concerns that his company's advanced AI chips could be used by the Chinese military, arguing that China cannot rely on technology that could be restricted by the U.S. at any moment. Speaking ahead of another trip to China, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to establishing American technology as the global standard, especially since half the world's AI developers are in China. Despite his stance, U.S. officials remain wary, with some analysts noting that advanced chips are likely central to any nation's military AI development.</p>

          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession by posting 1.4% GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025, a significant reversal from the previous quarter's contraction. The growth was primarily driven by a strong manufacturing sector, which analysts suggest may have been boosted by businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential U.S. tariff extensions. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook, warning of significant global economic uncertainty and downside risks for the remainder of the year.

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of multistory tower houses in the ancient Egyptian city of Imet, located in the Nile Delta. Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, a British and Egyptian team identified dense architectural structures dating back to the Ptolemaic Period (332-30 B.C.). The discovery of these tall dwellings, supported by thick foundation walls, suggests that Imet was a densely populated and thriving urban center designed to accommodate a growing population. The excavation also revealed granaries and a ceremonial road, offering new insights into the city's complex infrastructure and religious life.</p>

The robust trade data, particularly a record-high volume of steel exports, has helped offset weak domestic demand, but analysts remain cautious about the second half of the year due to ongoing uncertainty over U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that the fuel control switches on Boeing aircraft are not an "unsafe condition," despite their mention in a preliminary report on a fatal Air India crash. The crash, which killed 260 people, was linked to the fuel flow to the Boeing 787's engines being cut off moments after takeoff. While an earlier FAA advisory had recommended inspections of the switch's locking feature, the agency has now clarified that it does not believe the issue warrants a mandatory airworthiness directive. The AAIB report noted one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, suggesting an inadvertent action.</p>

          <p>The 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary is undertaking a massive effort to save 100,000 books from a severe drugstore beetle infestation. The tiny insects, which are attracted to the starch-based adhesives in old books, have burrowed into a significant portion of the library's collection. Restoration workers are carefully removing the books to place them in an oxygen-free nitrogen environment for six weeks to kill the pests. Officials at the UNESCO World Heritage site believe that rising temperatures due to climate change may have contributed to the infestation by allowing the beetles more development cycles.</p>

          <p>The amount of online abuse directed at players during the first week of Wimbledon in 2025 was nearly four times higher than in the same period last year, according to monitoring data. The Threat Matrix system detected over 1,900 abusive posts, with angry gamblers reportedly responsible for 37% of the total. Players like Carlos Alcaraz described the abuse as "cruel," while Amanda Anisimova admitted she was scared to check her phone after a loss. The All England Club, which uses the AI-powered monitoring service, has stated that perpetrators of online abuse will face consequences for their actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG have rapidly captured approximately 10% of the new car market in Norway, the world's most EV-friendly country. This growth is notable as Norway, which is not an EU member, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the U.S. and the EU. Consumers in Norway have been won over by the competitive pricing and advanced technology of Chinese models, posing a serious challenge to established players like Tesla. Analysts view Norway as a key entry point and laboratory for Chinese brands looking to expand across the European continent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An undercover investigation by BBC Panorama has exposed questionable sales practices at two of the UK's largest estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. At Connells, an agent appeared to sideline a cash buyer in favor of one who agreed to use the company's in-house mortgage service, a practice that potentially cost the seller money. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower revealed that staff were incentivized to secure price reductions on properties that were allegedly overvalued to win instructions. Both companies have stated they are committed to fair practices and have updated policies to address some of the concerns raised.</p>

          <p>A woman has been found to have unlawfully brought a baby into the UK from Nigeria using a fabricated story of her own pregnancy and birth. The woman, who had been living in West Yorkshire, was arrested at Gatwick Airport after DNA tests proved she and her husband were not the baby's biological parents. A Family Court investigation uncovered forged medical documents and messages suggesting a deal to purchase the child. The case highlights what experts call a worrying trend of child trafficking, sometimes involving illegal "baby factories" where young girls are kidnapped and sexually assaulted.</p>
