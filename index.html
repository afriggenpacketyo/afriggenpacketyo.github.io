          <p>Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe was released from the hospital after receiving treatment for gastroenteritis. The French captain had missed training due to a fever and was absent from a recent match against Al-Hilal. Real Madrid confirmed Mbappe's release and stated that he would continue medical treatment and gradually return to team activities at their training complex in Palm Beach. Gastroenteritis is an infection that affects the gut, leading to symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, and Mbappe's recovery will be closely monitored by the team's medical staff. The player is expected to resume training as soon as he is medically cleared to do so.</p>

          <p>Carly Simon has defended Sabrina Carpenter's album cover for "Man's Best Friend," which depicts Carpenter on her hands and knees with a man seemingly grabbing her hair, arguing that it is not outrageous compared to past instances of bold artistic expression. Simon referenced The Rolling Stonesâ€™ "Sticky Fingers" album cover as a more sexually charged example. The album cover has received mixed reactions from fans, with some finding it uncomfortable and others praising its iconic potential. Simon also addressed the criticism she faced for her 1975 "Playing Possum" album cover, which featured her in a lacy black dress and leather boots, photographed on her knees.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip due to disagreements over proposed cuts to disability benefits. In her resignation letter to the prime minister, Foxcroft expressed understanding of the need to address welfare costs but opposed cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit. Foxcroft stated she could not vote for the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, which is scheduled for debate in Parliament. The government argues that claimant levels are rising unsustainably, while critics fear the impact on vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>'28 Years Later,' the first film in a planned trilogy, revisits the post-apocalyptic world created by Alex Garland and Danny Boyle. The film picks up nearly three decades after a viral outbreak devastated the British Isles, focusing on survivors on Lindisfarne. The movie blends philosophy, violence, pathos, and comedy, creating a tonally uneven experience. The film uses abrasive editing and archival footage to explore themes of human progress and regression, questioning whether humanity's natural state is struggle and division, and the film ultimately asks who the real savages are: the infected or us?</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bags have significantly reduced their presence as litter along U.S. shorelines. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023. The study found that plastic bag litter decreased by 25% to 47% in areas with bag regulations compared to those without. Fees on plastic bags appear to be more effective than partial bans in limiting shoreline litter, according to the study.</p>

The deadline extension aims to allow more time for securing a buyer for TikTok, with the approval of Chinese authorities also required.
