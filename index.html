          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud, according to a video posted by Trump's communications advisor. Savannah Chrisley, their daughter, stated she received a call from Trump informing her of the decision and that she and her brother were personally informed by Trump. The Chrisleys, known for "Chrisley Knows Best," were sentenced to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution after being found guilty of engaging in a "fifteen-year fraud spree," according to prosecutors. The pardon came as a surprise to Savannah Chrisley, who had lost hope, and she expressed gratitude to Trump and his team.</p>

She also claimed that America "lived through four years of hell" under President Biden, citing dangerous criminals and terrorists entering the country.

          <p>President Trump's global tariffs have led to a surge in fraudulent activity as companies seek ways to evade the increased taxes, according to U.S. firms. Shipping companies, particularly those based in China, are offering solutions to U.S. importers to avoid tariffs, which experts say constitute customs fraud. These schemes, which include undervaluing products and transshipping goods through countries with lower tariffs, are costing the U.S. government billions in tariff revenue annually. The Trump administration has stated it will focus on fighting trade fraud, but many American companies believe the scale of the problem far outweighs the government's ability to address it.

          <p>Olympic icon Mary Lou Retton was reportedly stopped by police in West Virginia on May 17 after a report of a Porsche driving erratically. The criminal complaint states that Retton smelled of alcohol, slurred her words, and failed a field sobriety test, with officers also noting a wine container in the passenger seat. Retton refused a roadside breath test and a blood test and was later released on a $1,500 personal recognizance bond. Retton, who was diagnosed with a rare form of pneumonia in 2023, won a gold medal at the 1984 Summer Games and has since worked as a motivational speaker.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article discusses how the loss of parental aid is contributing to a record surge in homelessness among elderly Americans, particularly late baby boomers. Challenges such as economic inequality, inner-city distress, and a lack of affordable housing have left many economically vulnerable and dependent on their parents. As these parents pass away, thousands are left with no place to live, highlighting a gap in the American safety net meant to prevent destitution among older adults. The article uses the story of Anthony Forrest, a 70-year-old homeless man in Washington, D.C., to illustrate this generational struggle.</p>

This push for sanctions has grown following Russia's intensified attacks, with bipartisan support for legislation that would impose sweeping penalties on Moscow. Senator Lindsey Graham is leading this effort, urging Trump to recognize the ineffectiveness of his influence over Putin and to take decisive action.

          <p>An Atlantic article analyzes President Trump's recent verbal attacks on Russian President Vladimir Putin, arguing that they are unlikely to have any real impact. Trump, frustrated with Putin's continued aggression in Ukraine, has resorted to social media tirades, but the author contends that these actions are feckless and performative. The article suggests that Putin is exploiting Trump's desire for a personal connection and that the U.S. needs a functional national security team to address the situation effectively. The analysis concludes that Putin is unlikely to take Trump's threats seriously without concrete action and increased costs for his actions.</p>

The State Department is also warning U.S. nationals that even close proximity to the Venezuelan border has led to detention by the country's government.

          <p>An opinion piece in the LA Times argues that the Trump administration's decision to withdraw court orders aimed at reforming abusive police departments represents a perverse setback.

The decision to cancel the consent decree process signals a loss of crucial means for police reform, potentially leading to increased violations of rights and police violence. The piece suggests that the administration's actions echo a pattern of declaring victory without addressing underlying problems, with tragic consequences likely to follow.</p>

The "soft" approach tactics involve detectives in plain clothes knocking on the door without a hard knock, battering ram, or shouts of "police" to minimize disruption to the neighborhood. This method is used due to a marked change in offending behavior since the Covid pandemic with more offenders making direct contact with children online. The unit carries out 700 child sexual abuse investigations a year and safeguards between 600 and 800 children, almost all of them in Scotland.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increasing difficulty finding employment, contributing significantly to the rise in the national unemployment rate. The unemployment rate among recent college graduates, ages 22 to 27, is nearing 6%, surpassing the national unemployment rate. This trend is largely driven by a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where employer demand has waned, particularly in the technology sector. Economic uncertainty, influenced by President Trump's tariff policies, is also contributing to the slowdown in hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, involving nearly 200,000 mothers, found a sharp decrease in those rating their mental health as "excellent" and an increase in those reporting "poor or fair" mental health. Researchers and experts attribute this decline to factors such as high housing and child care costs, soaring food prices, and the lack of national paid parental leave. While the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the issue, the decline predates it, reflecting broader trends affecting maternal well-being.</p>
