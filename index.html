          <h2>Study Suggests Primate Alcohol Consumption Has Deep Evolutionary Roots</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol through fermented fruit, equivalent to about one small beer for a human daily. Researchers observed this behavior in multiple national parks, noting that the animals often consume the alcoholic fruits socially. These findings support the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, suggesting that human attraction to alcohol is not just a cultural phenomenon but may have evolved from our primate ancestors' dietary habits. The study opens further questions about the potential social or physiological benefits for the chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>The FBI has arrested a Texas man, Joshua Cole, for allegedly making online threats to commit a mass shooting at an Abilene Pride parade. Cole reportedly posted on Facebook about avenging the recent murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, whose killer was allegedly motivated by pro-LGBTQ+ views. According to court documents, Cole admitted to making the posts, which included comments like "let's go hunting fairies," and agreed they could be interpreted as a threat. He now faces federal charges for threatening communications, which could result in up to five years in prison.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal facilities, specifically an ICE center he claims is under siege by "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." The president authorized the use of "full force, if necessary," a move that drew immediate condemnation from Oregon's Democratic governor and Portland's mayor, who stated there was no need for federal intervention. This action marks an escalation in the administration's crackdown on protesters and follows Trump's recent designation of antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, a move legal experts say faces constitutional challenges.</p>

          <p>A retired FBI investigator posits that convicted serial killer Joseph Naso, known as the "Alphabet Killer," may have murdered women with matching first and last initials as a twisted homage to his idol, Caryl Chessman. Chessman, the "Red Light Bandit," was executed in 1960, and Naso was reportedly a pen pal who was invited to the execution. This theory is explored in a new docuseries, which also features insights from a fellow death row inmate to whom Naso allegedly confessed to killing 26 people. The investigation aims to connect Naso to more cold cases before the 91-year-old takes his secrets to the grave.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen FBI agents were fired on Friday, reportedly including several who were photographed kneeling to de-escalate a confrontation with protesters in Washington, D.C., in June 2020. The agents had been deployed by the Trump administration to deter vandalism during the racial justice protests following George Floyd's murder. While an initial FBI review found no grounds for discipline, a subsequent investigation was opened by FBI Director Kash Patel. The FBI Agents Association has condemned the firings, stating they violate due process and damage trust within the Bureau, ultimately weakening national security.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country on Earth, a distinction Finns themselves often find puzzling. Experts suggest the ranking, based on life satisfaction rather than daily joy, reflects a deep sense of contentment rooted in a well-functioning society with strong social support systems. Public services like Helsinki's central library, which offers free access to everything from books to 3D printers, exemplify the societal trust and investment in citizens. This focus on community well-being, combined with a close connection to nature and traditions like saunas, fosters a stable environment where people feel secure and cared for.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 storm over the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds reaching 145 mph. As of Saturday morning, the storm was located approximately 365 miles north-northeast of the Leeward Islands and is forecast to continue strengthening as it moves west. While there are currently no coastal watches or warnings in effect for the United States, the National Hurricane Center is monitoring its path. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and officials are also tracking a second nearby system that could impact the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>As Major Hurricane Humberto churns in the Atlantic, there is a possibility it could interact with a nearby developing storm system in a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This meteorological event occurs when two tropical cyclones get close enough to orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths and intensity. While experts consider this outcome unlikely in the current scenario due to the second system's relative weakness, the interaction is being closely monitored. The "dance" between two storms of comparable strength can be unpredictable, though typically a stronger storm absorbs the weaker one.</p>

The brutal case, in which the victims were bound, shot, and set on fire, had previously resulted in wrongful convictions that were later overturned.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly condemned Reform UK, stating the party's policies "will tear this country apart." Speaking ahead of the Labour party conference, Starmer highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as particularly "shocking," a plan that would force long-term residents to reapply for visas every five years. He positioned the Labour conference as an opportunity to present an alternative vision of "patriotic national renewal" against what he termed the "toxic divide and decline" offered by Nigel Farage's party. Starmer is facing pressure as some polls show Labour trailing Reform.</p>

          <p>Market strategist David Zervos of Jefferies has warned that the rapid growth of artificial intelligence could create a significant problem for the U.S. labor market and a dilemma for the Federal Reserve. He suggests a scenario where the economy experiences strong GDP growth driven by AI productivity, but the unemployment rate simultaneously rises due to job displacement. Zervos cites conversations with top AI experts who predict the loss of three to five million jobs within the next few years. This would challenge the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining full employment and price stability, forcing it to navigate a complex economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

The unusual summons has required top commanders from around the world to travel to the event.

          <p>An abrupt summons for hundreds of top U.S. military leaders to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly stirred anxiety and speculation about potential firings or demotions. The unprecedented gathering in Quantico, Virginia, is officially for Hegseth to share his vision, including new guidance on military fitness standards and his "warrior ethos." However, some officials view it as a "show of force" for Hegseth to demand loyalty, with one source telling CNN it's about getting leaders "on board, or potentially have your career shortened." The meeting follows Hegseth's recent dismissal of over a dozen senior officers, fueling unease among the top brass.</p>

          <p>Recent positive economic data, including strong consumer spending and durable goods orders, suggests the U.S. economy is remaining resilient, potentially staving off a recession. This strength is increasingly attributed to the "wealth effect" from a robust stock market, as asset holders feel more confident and continue to spend. However, economists warn this could be a double-edged sword, as the top 10% of earners own 87% of the market, while broader consumer sentiment is declining. This reliance on market performance makes the economy vulnerable to a downturn if stocks were to fall, especially in the context of stagnant job growth. (not investment advice)</p>
