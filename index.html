          <p>Human microbiome scientist Wang Leyao has left her position at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to join the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation in China. Her departure comes amid a period of turmoil for U.S. medical research agencies under the second Trump administration. The article notes that thousands of American researchers are facing uncertainty due to significant funding cuts and policy changes that have impacted the scientific community. Wang, who was also part of an NIH climate and health scholars cohort, is now a senior research fellow at the Institute of Human Immunology in Shenzhen.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked the Trump administration from expanding its fast-track deportation policy, known as expedited removal, across the entire country. The ruling cites significant due process concerns, stating that the government's current procedures are insufficient for the large group of people living in the interior who would be affected. This decision is a major setback for the administration's mass deportation agenda, which had broadened the policy to apply anywhere in the U.S. for individuals present for less than two years. The Department of Homeland Security has criticized the ruling, asserting that it ignores clear presidential authorities.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic secured his place in the fourth round of the US Open by defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match. Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required a medical timeout, the 24-time Grand Slam champion fought back to win 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 6-3. The loss ends British singles participation in the tournament. Norrie expressed that he may have become overconfident after breaking Djokovic early in the third set, but he remains positive about his season's progress after a difficult start to the year.</p>

          <p>South Korean prosecutors have indicted former first lady Kim Keon Hee on charges of bribery and market manipulation, alleging she amassed over $720,000 in criminal proceeds. The charges include involvement in a stock manipulation scheme from 2010 to 2012 and accepting bribes. This development follows the impeachment and arrest of her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, over a short-lived martial law declaration. The investigation, which President Yoon had previously vetoed, is part of a broader probe into his administration, creating significant political turmoil within the country.</p>

          <p>Russian forces have launched what Ukrainian officials are calling a "massive attack" on the central Dnipropetrovsk region, with explosions reported in the cities of Dnipro and Pavlograd. This escalation marks a significant development, as the region had largely been spared from heavy fighting since the 2022 invasion. The attack comes shortly after Kyiv confirmed that Russian troops had entered the region for the first time. The assault occurs amid ongoing diplomatic discussions, with the EU considering a military training mission in Ukraine and the White House pushing for peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly criticized the planned deployment of the U.S.-made Typhon missile system in Japan during joint military exercises next month. Beijing stated that the move undermines the security interests of other countries and that both the U.S. and Japan must not proceed with the deployment. Analysts interpret the action as a strategic message to China, particularly concerning potential conflicts over Taiwan. According to reports, the intermediate-range missile system will be stationed at a U.S. base in Yamaguchi prefecture for the duration of the training exercise and withdrawn afterward.</p>

The incident occurred amidst a heightened federal presence in the capital, which President Trump initiated by declaring a crime emergency and deploying hundreds of troops.

          <p>A fierce political battle over congressional redistricting is escalating across the United States, with California and Texas at its epicenter. After Texas Republicans redrew maps to create five new GOP-favored seats, California Democrats countered with a plan to add five Democratic seats, aiming to neutralize the move. This tit-for-tat has spread, with Missouri now joining the effort to gain a Republican seat ahead of the midterm elections. The fight over gerrymandering, while legal unless racially motivated, has intensified as both parties vie for control of the narrowly divided U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

A key driver is the rotation of domestic funds out of low-yield fixed-income products and into equities. Beijing's strategic push for technological innovation in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI is also seen as a major catalyst for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

This month, a large moorland fire in North Yorkshire was hampered by exploding bombs from World War II-era training.

          <p>Campaigns for and against a California special-election ballot measure on congressional redistricting are set to unleash millions of dollars in television ads. Opponents of Proposition 50, which would redraw the state's congressional maps to favor Democrats, have booked over $10 million in airtime. This measure is part of a national political battle, initiated after Texas Republicans redrew their maps to gain seats, prompting California to counter. The high-stakes fight over the ballot measure will likely determine control of the U.S. House and features an unusual opposition coalition including both Republicans and progressive Democrats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has canceled $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funding by using a rarely utilized procedure known as a "pocket rescission." This move allows the White House to withhold funds late in the fiscal year, bypassing the need for congressional approval as lawmakers run out of time to act. The cuts will primarily affect USAID funding and peacekeeping missions. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who warn it could lead to a government shutdown, and even from some moderate Republicans who have questioned its legality.</p>

          <p>A cold case investigation has concluded that Buford Pusser, the legendary Tennessee sheriff who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," killed his wife, Pauline, in 1967 and staged it to look like an ambush by his enemies. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation reexamined the case and found that physical evidence, including blood spatter and the nature of Pusser's own wound, contradicted his story. Authorities now believe Pauline was shot outside their car and placed back inside. The finding upends the heroic legacy of a law enforcement icon.</p>

Roberts defended the film's moral ambiguity, stating that its purpose is to challenge viewers and provoke conversation about complex issues. While her performance has been praised, some critics found the film's messaging to be troubling and its themes outdated.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open suggests that young children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication without first trying behavioral therapy. Researchers at Stanford Medicine examined the health records of nearly 10,000 children aged 3 to 5 and found that about 68% were prescribed medication. Of those, 42% received a prescription within just 30 days of their diagnosis. This practice goes against clinical guidelines, which recommend behavioral intervention as the first line of treatment for preschool-aged children due to potential side effects from stimulant medications.</p>
