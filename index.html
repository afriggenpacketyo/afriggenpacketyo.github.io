          <p>The New York Knicks are now down 0-2 in the Eastern Conference Finals after losing Game 2 to the Indiana Pacers with a final score of 114-109. Pascal Siakam led the Pacers with a playoff career-high of 39 points, while Jalen Brunson scored 36 points for the Knicks. The Pacers capitalized on a strong start to the fourth quarter, and the Knicks were unable to catch up despite a late rally. With no NBA team having previously overcome losing the first two home games in the conference finals, the Knicks face a challenging road ahead as the series shifts to Indiana.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England plans to establish specialized mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade, aimed at alleviating overcrowding in hospital accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients, referrals from GPs, and police, providing immediate care from specialist staff. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed the initiative as a pioneering model that ensures individuals receive the right support in the right setting, potentially speeding up access to appropriate care and reducing hospital admissions. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for robust testing and proper funding to ensure the effectiveness of the scheme.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, has emphasized the bloc's commitment to securing a trade agreement with the United States based on mutual respect, rather than threats. This statement comes after former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the U.S. from the EU. Sefcovic highlighted that EU-US trade is unmatched and should be guided by mutual respect, while also asserting that the EU stands ready to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, with leaders advocating for negotiations as the best way forward.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new rules requiring journalists to have official escorts for access to many areas of the Department of Defense headquarters. This move is the latest in a series of restrictions placed on the mainstream press by the Trump administration, following several leaks from the Pentagon in recent months. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver the commencement address at West Point military academy, marking his first such address since returning to office this year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available to consumers at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms, in response to soaring rice prices. The government intends to bypass auctions to directly control prices, with the reserve rice expected to reach store shelves as early as June. This initiative comes amid mounting criticism that the government has failed to curb the spike in rice prices, which is hurting households as inflation outpaces wage growth. Koizumi also mentioned exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution of the lower-priced rice.</p>

Both steelmakers have welcomed this decision, with Nippon Steel emphasizing its commitment to protecting American workers, the American steel industry, and America's national security.

          <p>Women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are facing challenges when considering pregnancy due to the condition's treatment primarily involving contraceptive pills. Marianne Barry, a 29-year-old with PMDD, expresses her fear of discontinuing her medication due to the return of severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Doctors acknowledge the limited research and treatment options for PMDD, often relying on contraception, CBT, and antidepressants to manage symptoms. The Welsh government has pledged to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD, but the dilemma remains for women wanting to conceive.</p>

The Chinese government has been urging young citizens to plan early for retirement due to the country's rapidly aging population and a strained state pension system. However, most young employees interviewed expressed that they are more concerned with their present circumstances and find retirement too distant to prioritize in a rapidly changing world.

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are adopting the concept of "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations who showed unwavering loyalty to their employers, these workers are choosing to do the bare minimum at their jobs to have more time for personal pursuits. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to engage in this practice. This shift reflects a desire for more "me time" and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation.</p>

In response, the Israeli military stated that it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields and is investigating several cases.

          <p>Germany's most highly endowed journalism award, the Herbert Quandt Media Prize, has sparked controversy for celebrating the legacy of Herbert Quandt, an early SS supporter involved in the Nazi war economy.

This has raised questions about Germany's selective approach to reckoning with its Nazi past, with some critics arguing that it represents a form of amnesia cloaked in liberal respectability.

          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm made a deal with former President Trump to avoid federal government targeting. The departures of Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jessica Phillips, and Jeannie Rhee come after the firm faced an executive order from Trump criticizing its employment of Mark Pomerantz and its diversity policies. The order was later rescinded after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises, including auditing its hiring practices. Some legal experts criticized the agreement, arguing it legitimized Trump's attacks on the legal community.</p>
