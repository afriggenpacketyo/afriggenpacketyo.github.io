          <p>After more than three years of war, Ukraine and Russia are engaging in direct, public talks to find an end to the fighting, but their positions still diverge greatly. The meeting in Istanbul represents a renewed effort to broker peace, even as military actions intensify across the region. The outcome of these discussions remains uncertain, given the entrenched stances of both countries and the complex geopolitical factors at play. Despite the challenges, the talks signify a crucial step towards de-escalation and potential resolution of the ongoing conflict. </p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by Donald Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election with 50.89% of the vote against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. This outcome suggests Poland is expected to take a more populist and nationalist direction under its new leader. Nawrocki, endorsed by Trump, has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and has echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine. His victory may complicate Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s efforts to advance his liberal agenda, particularly in reversing laws that politicized the court system. </p>

          <p>Ministers are set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) which will re-design the routes planes must take over UK airspace - many of which were decided around 70 years ago. The UK government plans to remodel flight paths to potentially reduce delays and improve flight times for passengers. These changes, which aim to modernize airspace formed in the 1950s, could also reduce aviation's climate change impacts and pave the way for new technologies such as flying taxis. However, some groups warn that the plans could lead to new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader Lee Jae Myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election on Wednesday, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was in doubt after he was charged with breaching election laws, but a final ruling on the case had been postponed until after the election by South Korea's High Court. Eurasia predicts that if Lee is elected, he will contend with the dual challenges of reviving South Korea's economy and completing a "package" agreement with the U.S. by July. Goldman Sachs noted that both candidates share similar goals, including economic growth and improving housing affordability.</p>

          <p>More than 100 protected archaeological sites and historic monuments in Northern Ireland have been damaged or vandalized in the past five years, with most breaches occurring on farmland. The Department for Communities is responsible for protecting these monuments, some dating back almost 10,000 years. The damage includes incidents like graffiti at a 5,000-year-old tomb site and the unlawful insertion of a path into an ancient ceremonial site.

The Trump administration is now reviewing the events, potentially intervening where city leadership has been perceived as lacking in protecting basic rights.

          <p>Dr. Hamdi al-Najjar, a Palestinian doctor, has died from injuries sustained in an Israeli air strike in Gaza that killed nine of his children. The attack occurred as he returned from dropping his wife, also a doctor, at Nasser Hospital. His wife and one surviving son are now the sole remaining members of the family. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the incident is under review, claiming they targeted suspects operating near troops in an area evacuated of civilians.</p>

          <p>An attack in Boulder, Colorado, that injured eight people is being investigated as a "targeted act of violence" and an "act of terrorism" by the FBI. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly threw an incendiary device and used a "makeshift flamethrower" at a group gathered for a Run for Their Lives event, which raises awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza. Soliman, who was heard yelling "Free Palestine" during the attack, is in custody, and authorities believe he acted alone. The victims, aged between 52 and 88, sustained burns and other injuries.</p>
