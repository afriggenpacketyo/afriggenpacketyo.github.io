          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned Israel's plan to take control of Gaza City, calling the decision "wrong" and warning it will only lead to more bloodshed. Starmer urged for an immediate reconsideration, emphasizing the need for a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, and the release of all hostages. Other UK political leaders, including Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey and the SNP's Stephen Flynn, echoed the condemnation, with some calling for sanctions and an end to UK arms exports to Israel.</p>

          <p>An Ohio affiliate of Planned Parenthood has announced it will stop accepting Medicaid insurance due to fears that the Trump administration could retroactively reclaim payments. This decision follows a judge's ruling that temporarily blocked a new law defunding abortion providers, but the risk of that ruling being overturned has created significant financial uncertainty. Another affiliate in the state is also suspending the provision of costly long-acting contraceptives for Medicaid patients for similar reasons, highlighting the precarious situation for reproductive health services.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him as "highly conflicted" in a social media post that caused the company's stock to fall. The demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton raising concerns about Tan's investments and alleged ties to Chinese companies, including some with connections to the Chinese military. In response, Tan affirmed his commitment to Intel and high ethical standards, dismissing the allegations as "misinformation" in a letter to employees.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has officially approved a plan for its military to assume control of Gaza City, a major escalation in the ongoing conflict. The prime minister's office stated the plan includes providing humanitarian aid outside combat zones and outlined five principles for ending the war, such as disarming Hamas and establishing a new civilian government. This move follows Prime Minister Netanyahu's earlier statements about intending to control the entire Gaza Strip before handing governance to unspecified "Arab forces," drawing significant international opposition.</p>

          <p>Top global insurers are increasingly concerned that the climate crisis could render entire regions of the world uninsurable, threatening the stability of financial services like mortgages and investments. Executives from major firms like Allianz and Zurich warn that as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, the financial burden is becoming unbearable, with a growing "protection gap" between economic losses and insured coverage. They argue that without rapid decarbonization, adaptation will become impossible, potentially destroying the very foundation of capitalism that insurance helps to lubricate.

          <p>Astoria Portfolio Advisors is set to launch a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to help investors mitigate large tax bills arising from highly appreciated stocks. The fund, LCOR, will use a tax code provision known as a Section 351 exchange, allowing investors to transfer overconcentrated positions in stocks like Nvidia or Microsoft into the new ETF without immediately triggering capital gains taxes. This financial product is particularly relevant in the current market, where the significant outperformance of Big Tech stocks has left many investors facing substantial tax liabilities.

          <h2>Op-Ed: Republican Party's Stance on Healthcare Shifts from Innovation to Anti-Science</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An op-ed in The Atlantic argues that the Republican party has abandoned its former praise of the American healthcare system's innovation, now actively undermining it. While previously championing cutting-edge treatments, the party under Trump is now slashing medical research funding and elevating anti-science figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This shift, driven by anti-elite sentiment and culture-war politics, creates a system that will not only fail to develop new cures but will also deny basic care to more people, forfeiting America's role as a medical pioneer.</p>

          <h2>Controversial 'Tea' Dating App Highlights Perils of Commodifying Whisper Networks</h2>

          <p>The Tea app, a popular "dating safety tool" that allows women to anonymously review men, has sparked controversy over privacy, defamation, and its fundamental premise. While intended to make dating safer, the app's "name and shame" model has been criticized for its potential for misuse and for commodifying the concept of a whisper network. Experts argue that such commercial products misunderstand the trust and context inherent in genuine support networks and problematically frame women's safety as an individual risk-management issue rather than a broader societal problem.</p>

          <p>As a deadline set by U.S. President Trump for Russia to cease hostilities passes, Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines hold little optimism for a diplomatic resolution to the war. With Russia's forces continuing a slow but relentless advance and intense fighting ongoing, commanders believe negotiation is impossible and that defeating Russia militarily is the only option. Meanwhile, Trump's willingness to meet with Putin without Ukrainian involvement has fueled fears in Europe that Ukraine could be sidelined in peace efforts, while Russia appears uninterested in meaningful negotiations.</p>

          <p>Researchers have proposed the new word "healthocide" to define the intentional and systematic destruction of healthcare services, infrastructure, and personnel during conflict. The term was introduced in a medical journal commentary to highlight the increasing weaponization of health care in war zones like Gaza, Lebanon, and Sudan, where attacks are used as a strategic tool. While some in the humanitarian community welcome the term to galvanize action and accountability, others argue that existing legal terms like "war crimes" are sufficient and that a new word is unnecessary.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tax legislation, the "big beautiful bill," could indirectly influence when older Americans should claim Social Security benefits due to its new senior deduction. The bill introduces a deduction of up to $12,000 for qualifying joint filers over 65, but it phases out based on income thresholds that include taxable Social Security benefits. Claiming benefits early could push some seniors' income over these thresholds, reducing their deduction and creating a new strategic consideration for maximizing tax efficiency in retirement.
