          <p>Chief executives from major European companies, including Zurich Insurance and Maersk, are voicing confusion and concern over the new US tariff regime, which imposes duties of 10% to 50% on numerous trading partners. They emphasize that the lack of clarity and certainty is delaying crucial investment decisions and could negatively impact global growth. While some business leaders appreciate an end to the waiting period, the predominant sentiment is one of apprehension regarding the unpredictable trade environment, which complicates long-term strategic planning and operations.

          <p>A political advisor in Beijing has described cyberattacks originating from Taiwan as being technically "below average" but notably widespread and persistent. Zhou Hongyi, founder of cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, stated that these attackers exploit unpatched, old vulnerabilities in mainland Chinese organizations due to their diligence and high frequency of attacks. He noted that this constant targeting of a wide range of entities has allowed China to collect a significant amount of evidence against them. Qihoo 360 itself was placed on a US trade-restriction list in 2020 for national security reasons.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has started detaining the first group of migrants who crossed the English Channel under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme with France. According to the agreement, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept a vetted asylum seeker from there through a safe route. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the detentions are underway and stated the government will robustly defend against legal challenges, asserting that France is a safe country. The 11-month pilot aims to deter illegal crossings, which have already surpassed 25,000 this year.</p>

          <p>England has announced a near full-strength team for its final Women's Rugby World Cup warm-up game against France, featuring the return of world player of the year Ellie Kildunne. Kildunne, who missed the Six Nations victory over France due to injury, is one of eleven changes from the team that recently defeated Spain. Key players like Zoe Harrison at fly-half and captain Zoe Aldcroft are set to start in what will be a crucial test for the squad. The match provides a final opportunity to fine-tune strategies and team chemistry before the World Cup begins.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in South Korea have requested an arrest warrant for former first lady Kim Keon Hee on suspicions of bribery, stock manipulation, and political influence-peddling. The move comes a day after she was interrogated and follows the detention of her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, for declaring martial law. If the warrant is granted, it would mark the first time a former South Korean president and first lady have both been arrested. The investigation is one of three separate probes launched by the new government into the former administration.</p>

The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is set to undergo a medical before completing the move.

          <p>The NHL's commitment to diversity and inclusion is being questioned after Commissioner Gary Bettman and other league figures joined Donald Trump's sports council, which aims to exclude transgender women from women's sports. This move is seen as a direct contradiction to the league's own 2022 diversity report, which emphasized accelerating engagement across all layers of diversity, including gender identity.

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, a leading research hospital for rare and life-threatening diseases, has experienced a sharp drop in patient numbers under the second Trump administration. Government documents show a pronounced decline, with the number of cancer clinical trial participants down about 20% from the previous year. Current and former employees attribute the decrease to an exodus of clinicians and scientists following mass firings, research grant cancellations, and a crackdown on immigration.

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that public approval of the U.S. Supreme Court has dropped below 40% for the first time, with an unprecedented partisan gap. While Republicans maintain high approval, Democrats' trust in the institution has collapsed, largely since the Court gained a 6-3 conservative supermajority. This trend is attributed to a series of politically charged rulings, such as granting broad immunity to Donald Trump while blocking decisions that limited his power. The American public increasingly perceives the Court as a partisan body, a shift from previous eras when judicial ideology was less aligned with party politics.</p>

Internal FEMA logs show that call answer rates plummeted from nearly 100% to just 20% while the agency awaited funding approval, which now requires personal sign-off from the Homeland Security Secretary.

          <p>Toyota Motor has lowered its full-year operating profit forecast by 600 billion yen, attributing the revision to the significant impact of U.S. auto tariffs. Although its June-quarter results surpassed estimates, the world's largest carmaker saw its operating profit fall by 11% year-on-year, with 450 billion yen in losses directly linked to the new American duties. Like other Japanese automakers, Toyota has been heavily affected by the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles, which have squeezed margins and prompted price cuts to maintain market share in the competitive U.S. market.

          <h2>Experts Propose Strategies for Fireproofing Forests in a Warming World</h2>

          <p>As global heating increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, experts are advocating for new forest management strategies to enhance fire resilience. The best natural protection comes from healthy, native deciduous forests, which are less flammable than the dense, monoculture pine or eucalyptus plantations common in many regions. Short-term strategies include reducing fuel loads by clearing dry undergrowth, creating vegetation-free firebreaks, and using controlled burns during cooler months. These proactive measures, combined with rapid detection systems, are crucial for adapting to the growing threat of extreme fires worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's sweeping new tariffs on goods from over 90 countries have officially gone into effect, aimed at reshaping a global trading system the president views as unfair to the US. While major economies like the UK, Japan, and the EU negotiated lower rates, others face steep levies, such as a 39% tariff on Switzerland. The move has created months of chaos and uncertainty, with export-dependent economies in Southeast Asia hit particularly hard. President Trump also imposed a 50% tariff on India over its Russian oil trade and threatened 100% on foreign-made computer chips.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the traditional leadership model based on tight control is ill-suited for tackling today's complex global crises, from climate change to political polarization. The author suggests that leaders, including those in government and institutions, must embrace uncertainty and move away from a 'power over' mentality that stifles creativity and collaboration. By acknowledging what they don't know and resisting fear-based reactions, they can foster more resilient, democratic, and effective solutions. The piece posits that letting go of the illusion of control is essential for meaningful change and navigating an unstable future.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping company Maersk has raised its full-year financial guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits. The company, a key indicator of global trade, now anticipates higher global container volume growth, citing robust demand driven by a manufacturing boom in China and strong exports worldwide. CEO Vincent Clerc noted that this strong demand is prevalent "pretty much everywhere in the world except for the U.S.," where he suggests the uncertainty around tariffs has had a dampening effect on trade activity. The ongoing disruption in the Red Sea is still expected to persist throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>
