        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his position amid significant pressure from the Trump administration to file criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Despite a five-month investigation into alleged mortgage fraud, Siebert's office reportedly found insufficient evidence to proceed with a case. President Trump publicly stated he wanted Siebert removed and later claimed on social media to have fired him, citing the prosecutor's endorsement by Democratic senators. This development has sparked criticism, with opponents calling it a politically motivated attack on the independence of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Hamas's armed wing released symbolic "farewell" photographs of the 47 remaining hostages in Gaza, warning that their lives are endangered by Israel's ongoing military assault. The images were labeled with the name of Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who disappeared in 1986 and is presumed dead, evoking a painful historical parallel for Israel. This act comes as international pressure mounts on Israel to cease its operations, with a United Nations conference on the two-state solution set to convene. German officials hope the conference will amplify calls for Israel to end the war and permit humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's Liberal Democrat party has suggested using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for wartime or national emergencies, to clear the nation's significant asylum application backlog. The proposal includes establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of asylum caseworkers to 4,000. According to the party's home affairs spokeswoman, this emergency measure is necessary to secure the funds and resources required to quickly end the government's costly reliance on hotels for housing asylum seekers. The plan is part of a broader call for a more efficient and humane immigration system.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally turbulent qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. The session was repeatedly interrupted by crashes, including one by McLaren's Oscar Piastri in the final segment, which hampered his and his teammate Lando Norris's performance. Verstappen managed to set the fastest time in the final moments after the last restart, narrowly beating Williams' Carlos Sainz. The chaotic conditions led to a surprising starting grid, with other top drivers like Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton failing to advance to the final top-10 shootout.</p>

          <p>Kevin Blatt, a broker known for promoting celebrity sex tapes like Paris Hilton's in the 2000s, claims that subscription-based platforms such as OnlyFans have effectively ended his line of work. He states that the business model of leaking and profiting from intimate recordings is no longer viable, as celebrities can now control and monetize their own content directly. In a new docuseries, Blatt explains that technology and privacy laws have shifted the landscape, making it more beneficial for individuals to manage their own platforms.

          <h2>Commentary Explores the Portrayal of Charlie Kirk as a Martyr for Christian Nationalism</h2>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a movement among Christian nationalists in the United States is framing him as a martyr for their cause. Figures within the movement are using his death to issue a call for followers to become more bold in what they describe as a spiritual and political battle against leftist ideologies. This article analyzes how Kirk's career mirrored the rise of Trump-era Christian nationalism, evolving from secular free-market advocacy to embracing a fervent culture war. Experts suggest this shift tapped into a demoralized Christian right, which has increasingly adopted more aggressive, anti-democratic ideas like the "seven mountains mandate" to assert influence over society.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault on nine Ukrainian regions, killing at least three people and injuring more than 30 others in what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called a deliberate strategy to intimidate civilians. The attacks targeted infrastructure and residential areas, with one missile reportedly striking a multi-story building in Dnipro. Ukraine's Air Force stated that it intercepted the majority of the 619 drones and missiles launched, noting the effectiveness of Western-supplied F-16 fighters against cruise missiles. In response, Ukrainian drones successfully targeted two major Russian oil refineries in the Samara and Saratov regions, causing significant fires and explosions.</p>

The software provider, RTX-owned Collins Aerospace, confirmed a "cyber-related disruption" to its system and stated it was working to resolve the issue.

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new powers to block U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. The intervention marks the first use of "golden share" rights, a condition of the company's $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel that grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company the administration would not permit the shutdown, U.S. Steel reversed its decision and announced the facility would continue operations. This move underscores President Trump's increasing direct involvement in corporate and industrial policy.</p>

Lewinsky noted that younger generations have been more receptive to her story, questioning the power dynamics at play during the scandal. She also discussed the cultural shifts since the 1990s, including the rise of the #MeToo movement and new language to describe experiences like gaslighting and slut-shaming.</p>

While the U.S. has confirmed the recent transits when questioned by the media, the shift to a lower-profile approach is seen by some Chinese observers as a tactical change rather than a substantive shift in American policy toward the region.</p>

For many, the lower cost of education overseas is a primary motivator, as median tuition in Europe can be substantially cheaper than at U.S. public universities.

          <p>According to dermatologist Dr. Adam Friedman, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful ultraviolet A (UVA) rays even when sitting indoors near a window. While windows and clouds can filter out most UVB rays, which cause sunburn, UVA rays can still penetrate deeply into the skin. This "silent killer" exposure is associated with accelerated skin aging, collagen damage, and an increased risk of skin cancer without causing a noticeable burn. To protect against both types of radiation, Dr. Friedman recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on cloudy days or when spending extended time indoors.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing increasingly expensive grocery bills, with food prices rising at their fastest monthly rate since 2022. According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change on agriculture, and a shortage of farm workers in the U.S. Tariffs have significantly increased the cost of imported goods like coffee, while climate change has shifted crop production to other countries.

          <p>A two-year-old boy has died after the vehicle he was in was swept away by flash floodwaters near Barstow, Southern California. The child's father was rescued after being separated from his son in the deluge. The tragedy occurred amid intense rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Storm Mario, which unleashed powerful mudslides in mountain communities near the San Bernardino National Forest. The slides trapped multiple drivers on state Route 38 and caused significant damage to homes in Forest Falls and Oak Glen, areas previously scarred by wildfires, making them highly susceptible to such events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark short-term interest rate, longer-term rates, including those for mortgages, have unexpectedly risen. This counterintuitive market reaction occurred because bond traders, who influence long-term yields, are concerned that the Fed may be easing its monetary policy too soon while inflation remains above its 2% target. Selling of long-term bonds drove their prices down and yields up, leading to higher costs for consumers on major loans for homes and cars. This trend suggests that bond investors are signaling they want the central bank to maintain its focus on controlling inflation rather than stimulating the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan seeks to move away from boxing's reliance on disparate promoters and sanctioning bodies toward a centralized, UFC-style model.

          <p>An ongoing severe drought in Vermont is placing immense strain on the state's dairy farmers, who are struggling with failing feed crops and dwindling water supplies. Poor growth of essential crops like corn and alfalfa has forced farmers to spend thousands of dollars on supplemental feed to maintain their herds' health and milk quality. Some have also had to resort to hauling water daily as their wells run dry, a costly and labor-intensive measure. While farmers report significant financial losses, they have not yet met the threshold for a federal disaster declaration, leaving them to adapt to increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather patterns on their own.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data reveals that Tampa, Florida, experienced the fastest growth in median household income among major cities, with a jump of over 15% between 2023 and 2024. Four California cities—Long Beach, San Jose, Oakland, and San Francisco—also ranked in the top 10 for income growth. Much of Tampa's increase was driven by rising incomes among its senior population. In California, the growth occurred in cities that already boast some of the highest median incomes in the country, largely due to the high-paying tech industry.

The five foreign suspects, who were in the country illegally, were apprehended while attempting to flee on foot. Two other suspects, believed to be from West African nations, managed to escape.

The order, which cites the need to prevent "abuse" of the program, will apply to new applicants and must be paid each year for up to six years. The move has drawn concern from businesses and immigration lawyers, who argue the steep cost will price out small and medium-sized companies and harm American competitiveness.

After initial tests were inconclusive, a stomach scan revealed the condition, which his doctor had only seen once before.
