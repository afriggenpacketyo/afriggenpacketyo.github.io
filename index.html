            <h2>Dodgers' Pitching Depth Tested Early After Snell Injury</h2>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' pitching depth is being tested early in the season after veteran starter Blake Snell was placed on the injured list with shoulder inflammation. A disastrous outing by Justin Wrobleski in a game against the Nationals highlighted the team's vulnerability. While Snell's MRI showed no structural damage, his absence forces the Dodgers to rely on other arms like Landon Knack and potentially Bobby Miller. Injuries to other pitchers like Tony Gonsolin, Clayton Kershaw, and Emmet Sheehan further strain the team's pitching resources, leaving the Dodgers in a precarious position.

            <p>The Trump administration has decided to cut $4 million in funding for climate research at Princeton University, citing a review of the Department of Commerce's financial assistance programs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the cuts align with the administration's goal to streamline and reduce the cost of the Federal Government. The department claimed that the funded programs promoted exaggerated climate threats and contributed to 'climate anxiety' among America's youth. Princeton University has not yet responded to the funding cuts.</p>

            <p>The city of Palm Springs, California, has launched a 'Palm Springs Loves Canada' campaign in response to concerns that Donald Trump's policies are deterring Canadian tourists. The city relies heavily on Canadian visitors, who contribute an estimated $300 million annually and support approximately 2,000 jobs in the hospitality industry. The mayor, Ron deHarte, expressed concern that tariffs and anti-Canada rhetoric from the U.S. government are causing Canadians to cancel their trips. The campaign aims to reassure Canadians that they are welcome and valued members of the community.</p>

Despite a court order for his return, Garcia remains incarcerated in El Salvador, leading to a legal battle over due process. The Trump administration argues it cannot compel El Salvador to return Garcia, but experts point to agreements between the two countries, including payments for housing prisoners, suggesting the U.S. has leverage. The Supreme Court is now considering the case, raising concerns about the potential impact on immigrants' rights.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants suspected of being members of a Venezuelan gang, using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. However, the court clarified that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review. The decision comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary over immigration policies. The court's ruling confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.</p>

            <p>President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang has sparked legal challenges. The law, enacted during a time of anticipated war with France, allows the president to detain and deport citizens of enemy nations during war or invasion. The Supreme Court has ruled that individuals subject to removal under the Act are entitled to judicial review. The Act has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.</p>

            <p>Stocks experienced a decline after the U.S. announced it would impose a 104% tariff on China, reversing earlier gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all fell, adding to a three-day sell-off driven by concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. Optimism about potential tariff negotiations faded after the White House confirmed the tariffs would take effect on Wednesday. Investors are also anticipating corporate earnings reports and upcoming inflation data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump and Speaker Johnson are advocating for the Senate's budget resolution, which faces opposition from House Republicans who believe it doesn't cut enough spending. The resolution is crucial for extending Trump's tax cuts, but its passage is uncertain due to the slim GOP majority in the House. The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. The Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as 'current policy,' which assumes that continuing current policies incurs no cost.</p>

            <p>Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, questioned Bitcoin's supposed independence from the U.S. dollar, noting its recent trading patterns mirroring the stock market. This observation came as Bitcoin and crypto stocks declined following President Trump's tariff announcement. MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor attributed the correlation to Bitcoin's liquidity and salability during times of panic. The correlation raises questions about Bitcoin's role as a truly independent asset. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A public feud has erupted between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro over Tesla's reliance on foreign-made parts. Navarro claimed Tesla is merely a car assembler using cheap foreign parts, while Musk retorted that Tesla has the most American-made cars. Fact-checkers have largely sided with Musk, noting that Tesla is significantly more vertically integrated than most automakers. Government data indicates that a high percentage of parts for Tesla's Model 3 Long Range are sourced from the U.S. or Canada.</p>

            <p>A federal appeals panel has expressed concerns that a trial judge may have overstepped his authority in ordering the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to build more housing on its West Los Angeles campus. The panel appeared sympathetic to the claim that the VA has failed in its duty to veterans but questioned the broad scope of the judge's order. The case involves a class-action lawsuit in which the judge invalidated leases of VA land to private entities and ordered the agency to build thousands of housing units for disabled veterans.</p>
