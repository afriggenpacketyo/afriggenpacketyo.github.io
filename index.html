          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is conducting a high-profile state visit to the United Kingdom, featuring meetings with royalty and political leaders. Despite the ceremonial nature of the visit, discussions are heavily influenced by the looming threat of new US trade tariffs under the Trump administration. European leaders are anxiously awaiting details on potential duties, trying to negotiate exemptions while preparing for significant economic impacts. The talks between Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer aim to align strategies on handling Washington's unpredictable trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is sparking political debate by portraying the hero with a focus on "universal morality" rather than American exceptionalism. The film depicts a battered Superman symbolizing a struggling America, which has drawn criticism from conservative commentators who label the character as "woke." This interpretation aligns with Superman's origins, created by Jewish immigrants as a defender of the weak, and recasts him as a "moral immigrant" in an era of intense cultural and political division. The article explores how superhero narratives are increasingly reflecting ideological divides.</p>

          <p>The FBI is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Benjamin Hanil Song, a 32-year-old military veteran. He is the 12th suspect wanted in connection with an organized ambush on the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, on July 4th. The group, dressed in military-style gear, allegedly fired upon correctional and police officers, resulting in one officer being shot in the neck. Song is accused of using AR-15 style rifles in the attack and is considered armed and dangerous.</p>

          <p>A large-scale overnight Russian aerial assault on Kyiv has resulted in at least two fatalities and thirteen injuries, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack involved numerous drones and missiles, causing fires and damage to residential buildings and infrastructure across six city districts. Ukraine's air defense systems were activated, but wreckage still hit several locations, including a primary healthcare center that was almost completely destroyed. This latest barrage highlights the escalating intensity of Russian attacks and the dimming prospects for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has temporarily stopped delivering its electric ID.Buzz van to the United States, citing multiple factors for the decision. The move is reportedly influenced by the steep 27.5% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on European-built cars, making the model less competitive. Additionally, the vehicle faces a recall by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration due to safety standards concerning its third-row seating. This development contributes to a nearly 7% decline in VW's vehicle deliveries to North America in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful and long-standing social housing policies. Approximately 43% of the city's housing is social housing, available to a wide range of income levels, which keeps rent significantly lower than in the private market. This large-scale public commitment, originating in the 1920s and funded partly by a levy on employee salaries, has remained stable despite privatization pressures seen elsewhere in Europe. While the system faces challenges regarding accessibility for newcomers, it demonstrates how sustained political will can prioritize housing as a basic need.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a 50% tariff on all copper imports into the United States will take effect on August 1, 2025. The decision was made following a national security assessment that highlighted copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, defense systems, and other essential technologies. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, creating what the administration views as a vulnerability. This move aligns copper with recent 50% tariff hikes on steel and aluminum, though experts caution it will take years for domestic production to meet demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is introducing a new subsidy to encourage the hiring of unemployed young people, aiming to stabilize the labor market amid economic pressures. Companies that hire individuals aged 16 to 24 who have been out of work will receive a one-time payment of up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) per new employee. This measure, funded by unemployment insurance reserves, is part of a broader effort to bolster household incomes and address persistent youth unemployment. Additionally, China's economic planner is allocating 10 billion yuan to expand a "work-for-relief" public works program.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens following a recent rise in kidnappings and violent crimes targeting them, particularly women. Analysts suggest Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they carry large amounts of cash and operate outside the formal banking system. The warning urges Chinese nationals to avoid going out alone and to inform relatives of their whereabouts. This alert comes amid a general increase in kidnappings in South Africa and follows a fatal home invasion that targeted Chinese citizens in May.</p>

          <p>All 31 construction workers trapped deep underground after a partial tunnel collapse in Los Angeles have been brought to safety. The incident occurred in a six-mile-long sanitation tunnel being built 400 feet beneath Wilmington. The workers were over five miles from the entrance when a section of the tunnel gave way, but they were able to navigate through the debris to a boring machine and be transported out. No major injuries were reported in what officials called a "victory" and a fortunate outcome to a potentially tragic situation. Work on the project is now paused pending a full investigation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's strict regulations on egg production are contributing to soaring egg prices nationwide. The suit claims that California's laws, which mandate cage-free conditions for hens and apply to eggs sold from out-of-state, impose "unnecessary red tape" and violate federal law requiring national uniformity in egg safety standards. This legal action is part of President Trump's broader campaign to lower egg prices, which have risen due to factors like bird flu, becoming a symbol of consumer anxiety over inflation.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk a second cargo ship in the Red Sea within a week, escalating threats to international shipping. The Greek-operated vessel, Eternity C, was hit by rocket-propelled grenades, leading to a search and rescue operation that recovered six crew members, while at least three were killed and others remain missing. The Houthis claimed they attacked the ship because it was heading to Israel and have taken some surviving crew members. This attack follows the sinking of the Magic Seas and marks a significant resurgence of Houthi aggression against commercial vessels.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the North American cereal company, surged over 56% in after-hours trading following reports of a potential takeover by Italian chocolate giant Ferrero. The deal, valued at around $3 billion, could be announced as soon as this week and would give the owner of Nutella and TicTac a dominant position in the US breakfast cereal market. WK Kellogg, which makes brands like Froot Loops and Rice Krispies, was split from its parent company in 2023 and has been facing financial struggles. The potential acquisition reflects ongoing consolidation in the convenience food industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is proposing to tighten welfare rules by barring some foreign nationals from claiming sickness and disability benefits. In an upcoming speech, she will frame the UK's rising benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb" that threatens the economy. The proposal would limit access to benefits like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) to British citizens, with some exceptions, creating a clear policy distinction with both Labour and Reform UK. This move comes as the government has already scaled back its own planned welfare cuts after facing a significant backbench rebellion.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 2.5%, pausing to evaluate the effects of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. Despite concerns about slowing economic growth, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability due to the risks associated with high household debt, which is exacerbated by the country's unique "jeonse" rental deposit system. Analysts expect rate cuts later this year once the housing measures take effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxfam reveals stark wealth inequality in Africa, where the four wealthiest individuals possess more wealth than the bottom 50% of the continent's population, or 750 million people. The combined wealth of Africa's 23 billionaires has soared by 56% in the last five years, reaching $112.6 billion. The anti-poverty organization argues that government policies biased against the poor and ineffective tax systems allow the super-rich to accumulate vast fortunes. Oxfam contends that this extreme inequality hinders democracy, impedes poverty reduction, and exacerbates the climate crisis across the continent.</p>
