          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the G7 summit in Canada, pledging Japan's ongoing support for Ukraine in achieving a lasting peace. Ishiba announced that Japan will host an international conference on October 22 to address the issue of landmines in Ukraine. The two leaders discussed the war situation and future plans for Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion in 2022, Japan has condemned Moscow and imposed sanctions in coordination with other G7 members, and Ishiba also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to strengthen strategic partnerships, viewing it as a model for cooperation amid global complexities. The deepening ties aim to address security concerns across Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

These troops, activated under Title 10 law, will support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property. They will join the existing 4,100 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines already deployed in the city. The new troops are undergoing training in de-escalation, crowd control, and the use of force.

While the truck was parked, the suspects allegedly stole 24 bags containing the jewelry.

          <p>Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos was benched by manager Rob Thomson after making an "inappropriate comment" following being pulled from a game. Thomson emphasized Castellanos's passion for playing but stated that the comment crossed a line, leading to the disciplinary action. Castellanos acknowledged the manager's decision and his own displeasure at being removed from the game. Max Kepler shifted to right field, and Johan Rojas took over in centerfield as a result of the lineup change. Despite the incident, Castellanos has had a solid season, batting .278 with seven home runs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is evaluating whether to pursue a diplomatic solution with Iran or resort to military action, with the next 24 to 48 hours considered critical. Despite heightened rhetoric from President Trump, U.S. negotiators believe Iran's weak position could compel them to return to negotiations and abandon uranium enrichment. Iran has signaled a willingness to resume discussions, but the U.S. seeks concrete commitments before easing its stance. The U.S. military is deploying additional assets to the region for defensive purposes, while also keeping options open to assist Israel in its offensive against Iran.</p>

          <p>Extreme heatwaves, particularly in Europe, are changing the way people plan their holidays, with 81% of Europeans adjusting their travel plans due to climate change. Many are opting for destinations with milder weather or traveling during cooler months, like October and May, instead of the traditional summer season. This shift is prompting holiday resorts in the Mediterranean to adapt by offering evening markets and indoor activities during the hottest parts of the day. Some regions are also investing in winter tourism and connectivity to offset the decline in summer visitors, while others are introducing climate crisis resilience taxes to support rebuilding efforts after climate-related disasters.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-over-year decline in May, marking the sharpest fall since September 2024, as the country grapples with trade uncertainties. Exports to the U.S. fell 11.1%, with automobile exports to the U.S. plummeting 24.7%. The Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade-related factors, leading to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. Japan's trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May, smaller than the expected deficit. The U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly said that Japan was being "tough" in trade talks.

          <p>California farmers and workers are facing confusion and uncertainty as the summer harvest season begins, due to contradictory signals from the Trump administration regarding immigration enforcement. The industry relies heavily on undocumented labor, and recent ICE raids have sparked concerns about workforce shortages. While President Trump initially suggested changes to immigration policies to address farmers' concerns, a subsequent reversal has left the agricultural community unsure of the administration's stance. Employers are now seeking guidance on protecting their workers, and unusual alliances are forming between farmers and worker advocates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's deliberations on whether to join Israel in military action against Iran have revealed deep rifts among his supporters. The possibility of U.S. involvement has ignited conflict between isolationist and hawkish factions within the Republican party. Some conservatives have joined Democrats in efforts to block Trump from engaging in unauthorized hostilities, while others argue that intervention would betray Trump's promise to avoid "forever wars." This division highlights the challenges Trump faces in navigating foreign policy while maintaining support from his diverse base.</p>

          <p>An L.A. County supervisor, Kathryn Barger, suggested that some individuals detaining residents may not be ICE agents but rather impersonators. She cited an incident involving a staff member's godson being pulled over by men in an unmarked car, raising concerns about potential exploitation of the current climate. This comes as tensions rise due to recent immigration raids, with residents expressing fear and businesses experiencing significant declines. The supervisors are considering a study on the economic impact of the raids and discussing a proposed state law to ban law enforcement from wearing masks.</p>

          <p>The recent politically motivated attacks in Minnesota, including the murder of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, have shattered the state's reputation for politeness and respect, known as "Minnesota nice".

Despite the recent violence, the state Capitol showed little visible sign of heavy security, but the attacks have sparked lament and concern about the future of civility in Minnesota.</p>

          <p>Sleep experts emphasize the importance of morning routines in regulating the body's circadian rhythm for better sleep. They advise against lying in bed after the alarm goes off, as it can lead to feelings of laziness and grogginess. Instead, they recommend getting out of bed immediately and exposing oneself to light to signal the brain that the day has begun. Maintaining a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends, is also crucial for regulating physiological functions and preventing social jet lag.</p>
