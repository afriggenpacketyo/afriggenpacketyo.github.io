          <p>The Tall Ships Races have commenced in Aberdeen, an event anticipated to be Scotland's largest tourist draw this year, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors. Dozens of impressive vessels from around the globe, including from as far as Peru and Oman, are featured in the free family festival. The event, which includes concerts by bands like Deacon Blue and Kaiser Chiefs, aims to foster international friendship and youth sailing training. However, organizers are monitoring a Met Office yellow warning for heavy rain, which could potentially impact the four-day festivities before the ships sail to Norway.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 04:11:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovenia's parliament has passed a law legalizing medically-assisted suicide, making it the first Eastern European nation to do so. The legislation, approved with a 50-34 vote, applies to terminally-ill adults facing unbearable suffering with no hope of improvement, who are mentally competent and have exhausted other treatments. This decision follows a consultative referendum where 55% of voters supported the right to end-of-life autonomy. While hailed as a victory for compassion and dignity, the law's implementation is pending the finalization of detailed procedures and oversight mechanisms, and it faces opposition from groups vowing to seek a new referendum.</p>

          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has stated it will not offer compensation to thousands of Afghans whose personal details were leaked in a February 2022 data breach. The MoD announced it would "robustly defend" against any legal action, citing an independent review that concluded it was "highly unlikely" individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked spreadsheet. This decision affects over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation to the UK, many of whom now fear retribution from the Taliban and are living in hiding. A law firm is already preparing a major lawsuit on behalf of over 1,000 affected clients.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary has generated significant excitement, particularly within South Asian and Muslim communities. His campaign, built on a platform of affordability and advocacy for Palestinian rights, resonated with a diverse coalition of voters, signaling a shift in the city's political landscape. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise is seen by many as a hopeful sign of greater inclusion and a challenge to long-held assumptions about who can represent New York. His success is attributed not just to his identity but to a political program that addresses deep-seated inequalities in society.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has described media reports on the cause of the fatal Air India crash as speculative and premature. The statement came after India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) released a preliminary report that mentioned a cockpit voice recording of pilots discussing the engine fuel cutoff switches. This detail led to widespread media speculation about pilot error or intentional action, which the AAIB and Indian pilot federations have condemned as irresponsible. The NTSB emphasized that investigations of such magnitude require time and urged patience until a final report is issued.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China, focusing on strategies to counter Beijing's economic coercion. His testimony will draw on his experience from 2020, when his government's call for an independent inquiry into COVID-19's origins prompted China to impose significant tariffs on Australian commodities. The hearing, which will also feature former U.S. ambassador Rahm Emanuel, comes as the current Australian government under Anthony Albanese is working to warm diplomatic and trade relations with China.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. The legislation is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clear rules to legitimize the technology for payments and banking. Supporters believe the law will bolster the dollar's global status and increase demand for U.S. Treasuries, while critics argue it lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections and could make the U.S. a haven for illicit finance.

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has found that chemotherapy could inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially accelerating the spread, or metastasis, of the disease to other organs. The research, focused on breast cancer patients, helps explain why some experience cancer recurrence despite successful treatment of their primary tumor. The team also identified specific drugs that could inhibit this detrimental effect in mice. These promising findings have already led to the launch of a clinical trial to test this combination therapy approach in human breast cancer patients.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and be placed under a nighttime curfew. These measures were imposed due to fears he might attempt to abscond while standing trial on accusations of plotting a coup to overturn the 2023 election results. The case has attracted international attention, with U.S. President Donald Trump calling it a "witch hunt" and threatening tariffs on Brazil. In response, the U.S. has revoked visas for Brazilian judicial officials involved, escalating diplomatic tensions over the high-profile prosecution.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $10 billion in damages against The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch. The suit targets an article that detailed a sexually suggestive birthday letter Trump allegedly sent to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, and the publisher, Dow Jones, has stated it has full confidence in its reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit. The legal action escalates the conflict between the president and the prominent news organization.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the complete elimination of its scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The move will impact over 1,500 employees, including many leading scientists, and is part of a broader reorganization and staff reduction at the agency. The Trump administration stated the move would result in significant cost savings and allow the EPA to better focus on its core mission. However, former agency officials and scientists have condemned the decision, calling it dangerous and warning that it dismantles a world-renowned research organization, leaving the public more vulnerable to pollution.</p>

          <p>China's disciplinary authorities are using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prominent example of grass-roots government mismanagement and waste. The ambitious "Yaohan Longevity City," intended to be a major health tourism hub, was left mostly abandoned after its capital chain broke due to a series of poor decisions by local officials. The project, which resulted in a severe waste of resources, now serves as a public warning to other local cadres across China. The official who primarily backed the project was expelled from the Communist Party for his role in the debacle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from the Chinese army have proposed a new design for an electromagnetic railgun that could be significantly more powerful than the current naval version. The concept involves an 'X-railgun' that cross-stacks two railguns into a single weapon, a configuration that could nearly double the propulsive force. This increased power would allow it to fire much heavier projectiles, up to 30kg, at speeds of Mach 7. The research aims to overcome the power limitations of existing railguns, which have hampered their military application and effectiveness in warfare.</p>
