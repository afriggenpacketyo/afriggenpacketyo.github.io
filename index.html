          <p>A major wildfire in Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The fire, which also damaged a water treatment facility and caused a chlorine gas leak, has forced evacuations and park closures. This event unfolds as smoke from extensive Canadian wildfires continues to cause unhealthy air quality across the US Upper Midwest, highlighting a severe and widespread wildfire season impacting both nations. No injuries have been reported from the Grand Canyon fire itself.</p>

In a social media post, Trump urged his base to let Bondi do her job and not to waste energy on the Epstein case.

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are advocating for a bipartisan sanctions bill they say will provide a "sledgehammer" for the Trump administration to use against Russia's economy. The legislation, which has broad support, would target countries like China, India, and Brazil that help fund Russia's war effort by purchasing its goods. This push comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin and considers new measures, including potentially fresh funding for Ukraine. The senators argue this economic pressure is crucial to force Russia to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been repurposed into a unique, privately funded art gallery that is now open to the public free of charge. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and undertook an eight-year renovation to create the space. Her mission is to provide a place for community connection and healing through art, inspired by her own experiences. The gallery's inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and will rotate to feature new artists in the future.</p>

          <p>A new Senate report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report from the Senate Homeland Security Committee details a pattern of unfulfilled requests for assets like counter-snipers and drone countermeasures. Committee Chairman Rand Paul called the incident a "cascade of errors" and accused the agency of a "cultural cover-up." The report also found that then-Director Kimberly Cheatle provided false testimony to Congress regarding these denials.</p>

The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is pushing for a major investment in federal forecasting infrastructure, including upgraded Doppler radar and data analytics. She argued that a robust national system, rather than a community-by-community approach, is necessary to provide more advanced warnings for extreme weather events. Her comments come amid scrutiny of the federal response and proposed budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric about deporting "the worst of the worst," government data reveals a different reality about who is being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). As of late June, over 71% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, and the vast majority were not assigned a high threat level. This article highlights the disconnect between the administration's focus on violent criminals and the data, which shows a significant number of non-criminal individuals being arrested, particularly after ICE was given a higher daily arrest quota. Critics argue this rhetoric creates a false narrative about immigrants and crime.</p>
