          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the Trump administration, specifically Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. The 161-page decision condemned these actions as an unconstitutional suppression of free speech, intended to chill lawful protests on college campuses. The judge, William Young, also criticized former President Trump's perceived misunderstanding of free speech protections, asserting that the judiciary has consistently rebuffed such infringements.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that the existing 55% tariffs on Chinese imports are a 'good status quo' for the Trump administration. Despite this, Greer expressed a desire to explore avenues for increasing bilateral trade in 'non-sensitive goods' such as U.S. agricultural products. His comments, made ahead of a November 10 trade truce expiration, suggest no immediate plans to lower tariffs, emphasizing the current tariff regime as the established trade deal.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, into law, requiring developers of powerful AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini to publish safety reports. The law focuses on preventing 'catastrophic risks' such as AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks, defining them as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages. It mandates safety frameworks, incident reporting, and whistleblower protections, aiming to set a national precedent for AI regulation amidst ongoing debates about state versus federal oversight.</p>

          <p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr refuted claims that he threatened TV networks over their decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, stating that networks like Nexstar and Sinclair acted for 'business' reasons. Carr's earlier comments, where he urged broadcasters to 'take action' on Kimmel, had led to criticism and a brief pre-emption of the show. He maintained that his full remarks were misrepresented and viewed the episode as a win for local broadcasters asserting independence from national programming.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and Sheriff Robert Luna, alleging 'unreasonable' delays in processing concealed carry permit applications, violating gunowners' Second Amendment rights. The complaint highlights that the department took an average of nearly 300 days to advance applications, issuing only two new licenses out of almost 4,000 in a 15-month period. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized safeguarding Second Amendment rights, while gun rights groups lauded the lawsuit as a landmark move by the federal government.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace proposal, despite receiving qualified support from some international and regional actors, faces significant hurdles due to its vague details and the entrenched positions of the conflict parties. The plan, which aims to end the war, return hostages, and disarm Hamas, has been praised by Prime Minister Netanyahu for aligning with Israel's war aims, but Hamas has not yet agreed to concessions like demilitarization. The article highlights that the success of the plan hinges on Trump's ability to compel both Hamas, via its patrons, and Netanyahu, who faces domestic political pressures, to uphold the agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 'eternal peace' plan for Gaza, while welcomed by some nations, is met with skepticism due to its vague details and the unlikelihood of immediate results. Analysts, like Mouin Rabbani, emphasize that numerous aspects still require negotiation, and implementation by both Israel and Hamas remains uncertain. Despite Trump's optimism, the Israeli military continues operations in Gaza, and the plan's stipulations — such as Hamas's surrender and Israel's non-occupation — are contentious, with Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich dismissing it as a 'diplomatic failure.'</p>

Early data also suggests favorable tolerability with fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to existing market leaders.

          <p>Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed adding autism to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and broadening definitions of brain conditions to qualify autism cases. Experts warn this move could destabilize the program financially, unleash a flood of claims, and undermine public trust in vaccines, as scientific consensus has thoroughly debunked a link between vaccines and autism. The VICP, established in 1986, is a no-fault system designed to compensate for vaccine-related injuries while protecting vaccine supply, but adding autism would be a significant policy shift.</p>

          <p>For older homeowners, reverse mortgages can convert home equity into cash without monthly loan payments, appealing amidst high home values and inflation. However, this article advises avoiding common pitfalls, such as ignoring true costs like origination fees and insurance premiums, which can run into thousands. Borrowers must also consider the impact on heirs, who would need to repay the loan, and avoid borrowing more than necessary to prevent faster equity erosion. Additionally, it warns that reverse mortgage proceeds could affect eligibility for means-tested benefits like Medicaid, stressing the importance of professional guidance. (not investment advice)</p>
