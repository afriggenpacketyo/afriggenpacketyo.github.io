          <p>The husband of a Palestinian doctor, whose nine children were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, remains in critical condition at Nasser hospital. Dr. Milena Angelova-Chee reported that Hamdi al-Najjar, also a doctor, sustained severe injuries to his brain, lungs, arm, and kidney, while their surviving son Adam is doing "reasonably well." The Israeli military stated that the incident is under review, claiming they struck suspects operating near IDF troops in Khan Younis, a designated "dangerous war zone." The IDF has urged residents to evacuate, but some Palestinians say they have nowhere to go amidst the ongoing conflict.

          <p>An expert who studied over 200 kids introduces 'emotionally safe parenting' as a superior style that focuses on emotional attunement and resilience. This approach emphasizes accepting children's emotions without dismissal, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents prioritize inner healing and create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves authentically. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves inner reflection, empathy, setting boundaries with compassion, and modeling healthy conflict resolution. The optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, communities are commemorating the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, which sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. Floyd's family gathered in Houston, while Minneapolis held several commemorations, including a church service and a candlelight vigil. Rev. Al Sharpton noted that Floyd's death initiated a reckoning with systemic racism, but progress seems to be fading. The Justice Department has opened civil investigations into law enforcement agencies, revealing evidence of systemic police misconduct in multiple cities, though many feel much more work is needed to ensure equal justice.

          <p>Germany's finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, joins a growing chorus of European politicians urging talks with the US after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from Europe. Klingbeil warned that the US tariffs endanger both the US and European economies and has spoken with his US counterpart about the matter. The EU's trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, stated the bloc is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides, emphasizing that trade relations must be guided by mutual respect, not threats.

          <p>President Trump's warming relationship with the new Syrian leader has led to a significant decrease in Israeli airstrikes on Syria. Israel, which had previously launched numerous attacks to prevent hostile groups from gaining power, now faces a changed dynamic.
