          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for Donald Trump's private four-day visit. The US president is staying at his Turnberry golf resort, where he played a round of golf amid a heavy police and military presence, including road closures and aerial surveillance. The visit, which will include meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, has prompted planned protests and concerns over security costs. Trump has commented on European migration and wind farms, issues he has previously been vocal about in the region.</p>

          <h2>US Retailer Sam's Club Faces Backlash in China Over Introduction of a Low-Priced Snack</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 06:35:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart-owned Sam's Club is facing criticism from its middle-class members in China for stocking a domestically produced, low-priced chocolate pie. The bulk retailer has traditionally cultivated a premium image by offering globally sourced, high-quality products, which has been a key draw for its fee-paying members. The introduction of the common, inexpensive snack has led some loyal customers to believe the brand's quality standards are declining. This incident highlights the delicate balance foreign brands must maintain to meet the evolving expectations of China's discerning consumers.</p>

          <p>Despite earning salaries of $200,000 or more, a significant portion of Americans do not feel wealthy, a phenomenon experts label "high earners, not rich yet" (HENRYs). Factors such as rising costs, substantial debt, and lifestyle inflation contribute to this sentiment, with many still living paycheck to paycheck and struggling with credit card debt. Psychologists note a paradox where accumulating wealth can increase financial anxiety, as individuals feel pressure to maintain their earnings and lifestyle. The article suggests that feeling rich is more tied to spending than earning, creating a persistent cycle of financial unease.</p>

In the years leading up to his death, Hogan had been open about his extensive health problems, having undergone 25 surgeries in a decade for his back, shoulders, knees, and hips. He attributed these issues to the physical toll of his long wrestling career, which began with less safe equipment in the 1970s.

The author argues these posts reveal the administration's racist underpinnings and its alignment with the "Heritage American" movement, which prioritizes citizens of generational American descent.

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for the creation of an international center to coordinate global efforts on artificial intelligence governance. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Li highlighted the current "fragmented trend" in AI regulation and urged the establishment of a widely accepted global framework. This proposal is seen as a strategic move by China to increase its influence in the rapidly evolving AI sector. It comes as Beijing is engaged in an intense technological competition with the United States, which recently announced its own AI development blueprint.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, has published a series of commentaries urging the force's political officers to improve their public image. The guidelines emphasize demonstrating loyalty to the Communist Party leadership, maintaining honesty, and ensuring integrity in the promotion process. Analysts suggest this public campaign is a response to recent corruption scandals involving high-ranking generals. The articles are seen as an attempt by Beijing to address the damage to the PLA's reputation and reinforce political control within the military.</p>

          <p>A valuation tool known as the Shiller P/E Ratio, which has a strong historical track record, is signaling a potential significant downturn for the S&P 500. The ratio, currently at a historically high level, has preceded major market declines of 20% or more in all five previous instances it surpassed a multiple of 30. Based on this historical precedent, a reversion to its average would imply a market drop of at least 30% from current levels. The article notes, however, that long-term investing has consistently proven successful, with bull markets historically lasting much longer than bear markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming swimming world championships in Singapore are set to feature a defining duel between Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh and American legend Katie Ledecky. Their clash in the 800m freestyle is highly anticipated, as McIntosh is the only swimmer to have beaten Ledecky in that event in 15 years. The 18-year-old McIntosh arrives in historic form, having broken multiple world records this year and aiming to win five individual gold medals. This showdown represents a potential generational shift in long-distance swimming, challenging Ledecky's long-standing dominance ahead of the LA 2028 Olympics.</p>

          <p>An inquest into the deaths of Alphonsine Djiako Leuga and her 18-year-old daughter, Loraine, has raised critical questions about how they could lie undiscovered in their Nottingham home for months. Alphonsine, who was the sole carer for Loraine who had Down's syndrome, died of pneumonia, leaving her daughter to perish from malnutrition weeks later. The coroner noted "missed opportunities" by social care teams, as the family had disengaged with services and was living without heat. The tragic case has prompted shock and self-reflection within the community about systemic failures and a lack of neighborly connection.</p>

          <p>The recovery of the luxury goods market is facing several key challenges, creating a mixed outlook for high-end brands. A sharp decline in the Japanese yen has weakened tourist spending there, while the looming threat of U.S. tariffs is forcing many European brands to consider price increases. In contrast, U.S. sales have shown some strength, though it's unclear if this is temporary. The market also shows significant divergence by product, with jewelry and leather goods performing differently for various brands, indicating brand appeal remains a critical factor in a complex global environment.

Washington is levying new tariffs, cutting foreign aid, and imposing visa restrictions on several African countries. Analysts believe China's move is a significant diplomatic and economic win, reinforcing its image as a more reliable and beneficial partner to the continent. This is challenging the long-held U.S. belief that its humanitarian aid would secure unwavering goodwill, as African nations increasingly look to Beijing for partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

Supporters of the recall are angered by the KMT and its allies for blocking key legislation, including defense spending, and passing laws seen as favoring China. The outcome could potentially shift the power balance in the legislature, where the ruling Democratic Progressive Party currently lacks a majority. The KMT has condemned the recall as political retaliation, highlighting the deep political tensions on the island regarding its relationship with Beijing.</p>

These side effects include compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and, in some cases, sexually coercive or criminal behavior. Families report that these changes have torn their lives apart, and many were not adequately warned by doctors about the severity of these risks. The investigation also raises concerns about the impartiality of studies sponsored by drug manufacturers, which have downplayed some of the medication's known adverse effects.</p>
