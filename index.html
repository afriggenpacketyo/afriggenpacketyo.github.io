          <p>A cross-party group of 96 UK Members of Parliament has formally requested the government to facilitate the immediate evacuation of sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical care. The letter highlights the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system and the dire humanitarian crisis, urging that evacuations be based solely on clinical need. Coordinated with Doctors without Borders, the MPs are also calling for provisions that would allow the children and their families to seek asylum or resettlement in the UK after treatment is complete.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, has concluded without a formal agreement to end the war in Ukraine. Trump stated that while "great progress" was made, a final deal was not reached, identifying an unspecified but "most significant" sticking point. Putin reiterated Russia's position, emphasizing the need to address the "root causes" of the conflict, which implies demands for Ukrainian territorial concessions and neutrality. Following the summit, Trump held a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is now scheduled to visit Washington.</p>

The announcement came after a lengthy phone conversation between the two leaders, which also included European allies. Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the invitation and stated his intention to discuss the details of ending the war. This development shifts the diplomatic focus to direct U.S.-Ukraine discussions after the talks with Russia failed to produce a concrete peace agreement.</p>

          <p>The office of California Governor Gavin Newsom has been using social media to troll President Donald Trump by mimicking his distinctive writing style, featuring all-caps text and nicknames. In response to the Trump-Putin summit, Newsom's press team posted on X, accusing Trump of having "low energy" and copying Newsom's assertive posturing. The posts also reference Newsom's recent political maneuver involving redistricting maps in California, framing it as a strategic move that has unsettled the President. The tactic represents a novel and aggressive communications strategy in the ongoing political rivalry between the two figures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's imposition of steep 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil is causing significant concern for New York City coffee shops, which rely heavily on Brazilian beans. Cafe owners fear that the increased costs will force them to raise prices for consumers, potentially jeopardizing their already slim profit margins and threatening their businesses' viability. This financial pressure comes on top of existing price inflation from climate change impacts on coffee production. The tariffs are also affecting producers in Brazil, who face a competitive disadvantage and are seeking exemptions while exploring other markets like China.</p>

The concerts have served as a powerful reunion for families and friends, reinforcing a shared cultural identity for those both on and off the island.

          <p>Consumers across the United States are facing rapidly increasing electricity costs, which have climbed more than twice as fast as the overall inflation rate in the past year. This surge is attributed to several factors, including the rising price of natural gas and increased demand from new, power-intensive AI data centers. The rising bills are placing a significant strain on household budgets, particularly for seniors and low-income families who may have to choose between paying for power and other necessities. This trend is forcing a national conversation about grid capacity and who should bear the costs of necessary infrastructure upgrades.</p>

          <p>An executive order signed by President Trump is set to facilitate the inclusion of "alternative assets," such as cryptocurrency, real estate, and private equity, into 401(k) retirement plans. This move aims to democratize access to investment classes previously reserved for wealthy individuals and large institutions. However, financial experts caution against the potential risks, including the high fees and long lock-in periods associated with private equity and the significant volatility of cryptocurrency. The order directs the Department of Labor and other agencies to clear regulatory hurdles, though employers will ultimately decide which funds to offer. (not investment advice)</p>

In Ukraine, officials expressed frustration that Putin appeared to have bought more time without making any concessions.

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China have voiced increasing concerns about the sustainability of Washington's expanding national debt, leading to calls for Beijing to reduce its exposure to U.S. dollar assets. In a recent publication, they described the growth of U.S. debt as "unsustainable," even though it has not yet reached a default threshold. This sentiment aligns with China's recent actions, as it has been trimming its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds, which are now at their lowest level since 2009. The researchers recommend gradually adjusting these holdings while increasing reserves of gold and other strategic resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political analysis of the Alaska summit concludes that Russian President Vladimir Putin was the primary beneficiary, gaining a global platform and a propaganda victory without making any concessions on a ceasefire in Ukraine. The article argues that President Donald Trump is a clear loser, having offered a red-carpet welcome to a dictator but receiving nothing tangible in return. For Ukrainians, the outcome is seen as a major setback, as the lack of a deal means continued Russian aggression. The summit is interpreted as a signal of diminishing U.S. commitment, placing greater responsibility on European allies to support Ukraine.</p>
