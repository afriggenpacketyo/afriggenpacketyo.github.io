          <p>Joseph Kling, 19, faces arson charges for allegedly starting a wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, that consumed over 15,000 acres. Authorities claim Kling intentionally lit wooden pallets on fire and left before the fire was fully extinguished, leading to its spread. The wildfire, which started in Waretown, destroyed a commercial building and prompted air quality alerts in New York City due to the heavy smoke. Officials emphasize the dangers of starting fires in dry conditions and are holding Kling in Ocean County Jail pending a hearing. The wildfire is approximately 50% contained and expected to burn for days, with rain anticipated to aid in extinguishing it.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration experienced a series of legal defeats in federal courts across the country on Thursday, challenging the implementation of the president's agenda. Judges blocked the government from withholding federal funds from schools with DEI programs and sanctuary jurisdictions, as well as requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. A Boston judge is investigating potential violations of a court order related to the deportation of alleged gang members, and a judge in Maryland ordered the return of a man deported to El Salvador. Additionally, DOJ lawyers inadvertently revealed shortcomings in their plan to eliminate congestion pricing in New York, marking a challenging day in court for the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, potentially reversing a decade of U.S. policy. During his first term, Trump had hinted at accepting Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula, but his administration later issued the Crimea Declaration, pledging to maintain non-recognition until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored. This shift in stance aligns with Trump's efforts to negotiate a peace deal, potentially diverging from the long-standing American position on the strategic territory seized by Moscow in 2014.</p>

Speaking at an event organized by Close Screens, Open Minds, Grant criticized "posh private schools" for their "pathetic" regulations that keep children indoors. He expressed frustration with the increasing use of Chromebooks in classrooms and homework, arguing that it's the last thing children need.

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to defund the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a landmark study of women's health. The Department of Health and Human Services cited having exceeded internal targets for contract reductions as the reason for restoring financial support. This decision brings relief to scientists who feared the termination of contracts with regional centers would halt data collection and prevent further insights into chronic diseases affecting women. The WHI has produced significant discoveries, including findings on hormone therapy and its impact on heart health, and is uniquely positioned to advance understanding of conditions like Alzheimer's and heart disease.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are facing scrutiny as projected savings fall far short of initial promises. While Musk initially pledged trillions in savings, he now estimates DOGE will save taxpayers only $150 billion. This figure is significantly lower than the $7 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Costs associated with firings, re-hirings, lost productivity, and paid leave for thousands of workers are estimated to reach $135 billion this fiscal year, potentially negating any savings achieved.</p>

DOGE's representatives, however, recommended reducing MCC to the statutorily required minimum without articulating specific reasons. The cuts could reduce the agency's workforce from roughly 320 to just a couple dozen, raising concerns about the future of a model of foreign aid that has demonstrated clear benefits.</p>

          <p>Alphabet executives anticipate that President Trump's trade policies will negatively impact the company's core advertising business. While the word "tariff" was never mentioned on Alphabet's investor call Thursday, "macro" was mentioned several times as investors peppered company executives with questions about forward looking economic impacts amid new trade policies. The company expects headwinds, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region, due to changes in de minimis exemptions and potential pullbacks in advertising spending from budget constraints. CFO Anat Ashkenazi emphasized the company's focus on efficiency and productivity to navigate uncertain times.</p>

          <p>U.S. Central Command stated that a deadly blast near a UNESCO world heritage site in Yemen's capital was caused by a Houthi missile, not a U.S. airstrike. Houthi officials had claimed an American airstrike hit a populated neighborhood, killing 12 and injuring 30. The Pentagon's assessment is based on a review of local reporting and videos documenting Arabic writing on missile fragments at the market. The U.S. maintains that its closest strike was more than three miles away from the affected area.</p>

          <p>A massive Russian strike on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries, intensifying concerns as peace talks appear to be faltering. The attack, which involved missiles and drones, prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to cut short his trip to South Africa and return home. Ukrainian officials said the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to press his bigger army's advantage on the roughly 620-mile front line, where it currently holds the momentum. This event underscores the challenges in achieving a resolution to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Residents of St. Louis are grappling with the devastating effects of nuclear waste contamination in Coldwater Creek, with many families experiencing high rates of cancer. Starting in 1942, roughly one ton of pure uranium was produced per day in downtown St. Louis. It was then shipped to labs across the country for the top secret Manhattan Project that created the first nuclear bomb. The leftover waste was dumped around the city. A 2019 study linked living near the creek to an increased risk of lung, bone, and leukemia cancers. Many are now demanding further investigation and accountability for the contamination.</p>

A commercial internet line does not have any of the firewall protections that the Defense Department's unclassified system has, so that makes it potentially susceptible to being monitored particularly if sensitive information is being communicated. Hegseth strongly denied that what he shared over a second group chat on the Signal messaging app were classified war plans about imminent U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi militants in Yemen, and blamed former staffers for leaking, accusing them of going to the news media with new information to "sabotage" Trump's agenda.</p>
