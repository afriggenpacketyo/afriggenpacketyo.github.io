          <h2>Workplace Cardiac Arrests Increasing, Often Fatal Due to Lack of Preparedness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study highlights the increasing incidence of cardiac arrests in U.S. workplaces, affecting over 10,000 people annually. Unlike high-profile cases where immediate medical attention is available, most workplaces are ill-equipped to handle such emergencies. The American Heart Association reports that 7 in 10 Americans feel unprepared to act during a cardiac emergency, leading to a 90% fatality rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Efforts are underway to improve bystander confidence in performing CPR, but significant gaps remain in workplace preparedness and response capabilities. </p>

          <p>House Republican leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, convened at the White House with President Donald Trump and members of the House Freedom Caucus to discuss the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." This meeting occurred as GOP leaders struggled to regain momentum for the bill after negotiations with hard-liners faltered. The bill, addressing Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, and immigration policy, faces significant Republican opposition due to disagreements over Medicaid work requirements and SALT deductions. The bill's future in the House remains uncertain despite Speaker Johnson's efforts to secure enough votes for passage. </p>

          <p>Mark Gordon, on retrial for the manslaughter of his newborn baby Victoria, testified that the police manhunt was responsible for her death.

Gordon argued that the national manhunt, launched after their car caught fire and police realized they had another baby, created a calamitous situation. He stated that had the manhunt not occurred, the baby would be alive today, and denied any criminal intent. </p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking Bitcoin's price have surpassed $40 billion, indicating strong investor interest. Senate is advancing legislation to create the first regulatory framework in the U.S. for stablecoins, further boosting market confidence.

          <p>The FDA is planning to limit future COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with underlying health conditions, pending newer clinical trials. This potential policy change is based on arguments that annual booster shots may not be worth the risk for healthy individuals, and it aligns with recommendations from countries like the U.K., Canada, and Australia. Experts caution that lengthy clinical trials may result in vaccines that are ineffective against current variants, and that the FDA is overstepping the CDC's recommending capacity. The new framework could affect insurance coverage and access to vaccines for those wanting to protect vulnerable family members. </p>

          <p>A New York Times investigation reveals that Russia transformed Brazil into a hub for its elite intelligence officers, known as illegals, who established new identities to infiltrate the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. These spies created credible backstories by starting businesses, forming friendships, and engaging in relationships. However, a Brazilian counterintelligence team, with assistance from international intelligence agencies, dismantled the network, arresting some spies and forcing others to flee. The operation, known as Operation East, dealt a significant blow to Moscow's espionage efforts and exposed a betrayal of Brazil's historically friendly relations with Russia. </p>

          <h2>Unexpected Inflation Spike Clouds Economic Outlook</h2>

          <p>A surprise rise in inflation to 3.5% in April, the highest in a year, suggests a gloomier economic outlook than previously anticipated. Higher energy and water bills, along with rising food and service prices, contributed to the increase. Economists worry that businesses are passing on wage cost increases, potentially driving inflation higher in the coming months. While global factors, such as US President Donald Trump's trade war, could help bring inflation down, uncertainty remains and the Bank of England is not expected to cut interest rates much this year.

          <p>U.S. military strikes and sanctions targeting the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen have exacerbated the country's dire humanitarian crisis, according to a New York Times analysis. The attacks, aimed at degrading the Houthis' economic power and disrupting Red Sea shipping, have resulted in civilian casualties and infrastructure damage. Despite a ceasefire announced by President Trump, the Houthis have continued attacks on Israel, prompting retaliatory strikes. The strikes have triggered fuel shortages and increased the cost of basic goods, compounding the suffering of Yemeni civilians already struggling with decades of war. </p>

          <p>Vox explores why tech billionaires like Elon Musk admire Iain M. Banks's Culture series, despite Banks being a socialist and critic of the super-rich. The Culture series promotes empathy, pluralism, and social cooperation in a post-scarcity society, contrasting sharply with Silicon Valley's ethos. The author suggests billionaires may be drawn to the advanced technology in the series, seeing themselves as providers of brute force backing up a culture's ideals. The article notes that the series' villain is a capitalist tech billionaire who embodies exploitation and corruption. </p>

The Chinese Commerce Ministry criticized the U.S. policy as "overreaching" and "bullying," demanding corrections. Huang's comments highlight the delicate balance between the U.S. and China over tariffs and semiconductors, with Nvidia caught in the middle. </p>
