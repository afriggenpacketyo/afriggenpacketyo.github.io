          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar's royal family, intended for use as Air Force One until near the end of Trump's term, after which it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation. The arrangement is under legal review to ensure compliance with bribery laws and the Constitution's emoluments clause, with legal analyses suggesting it is permissible if the gift is not tied to any official act. The Air Force would modify the 13-year-old aircraft to meet military specifications before transferring it to the foundation, potentially raising ethical concerns about foreign influence and the use of public funds.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing growing concerns about societal polarization and the handling of the far-right AfD, with the domestic intelligence service classifying it as "confirmed right-wing extremist." This classification is now suspended due to legal challenges, sparking debate on how the media and government should address the party. The question of whether to ban the AfD is particularly divisive, with opponents arguing it would further social division, while supporters insist that enemies of democracy should not be in a position to destroy it. Experts suggest that the AfD should not be made bigger than it is, and that politicians must counter it with a successful model of democracy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies into Gaza after a ten-week ban, but top aid groups object to the idea. The proposed solution would initially provide aid to around 60 percent of Gaza's civilians in a new zone cordoned off by Israel's military, to prevent Hamas members from access. Key details remain unresolved, like who would run it or pay for it, and the main aid organizations working in Gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal. Humanitarian groups say they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it, even belligerents, and it contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between India and Pakistan, reached after U.S.-led mediation talks, was quickly shaken by overnight fighting in disputed Kashmir, with both sides accusing each other of violations. India's military claimed strikes into Pakistan-administered Kashmir killed over 100 militants, while Pakistan blamed Indian forces for initially violating the ceasefire. The escalation in violence followed a gun massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, with India blaming Pakistan for the attack. Despite the agreement to halt military action, reports of heavy exchanges of fire persisted, raising concerns about the ceasefire's stability.</p>

India made no reference to an American role, presumably in part because it hoped to avoid any domestic perception that it had stopped its fight against its neighbor and archenemy under outside pressure.</p>

Bessent indicated that details of the agreement would be announced on Monday, noting that Trump has been updated, while Trump praised the talks for engendering a "total reset" on the relationship between the two countries.</p>

The show reinforced the view that motherhood is antithetical to sexuality, missing an opportunity to present a more expansive view of motherhood.</p>
