          <p>In an opinion piece for The New York Times, Ezra Klein discusses the contrasting reactions to his book ‚ÄúAbundance,‚Äù which he co-authored with Derek Thompson, within the Democratic Party. The book critiques how Democrats have governed in areas where they hold power, advocating for a focus on increasing the availability of resources and opportunities. While some Democrats embrace the ‚Äúabundance agenda,‚Äù anti-corporate populists view it as a threat to their rising influence. The debate centers on whether the primary focus should be on addressing bottlenecks in production or tackling concentrated corporate power.</p>

The operation, which targeted Hezbollah militants, led to significant casualties and disruption within the organization. The assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, further destabilized the group, impacting Iran's proxy war strategy. The weakening of Hezbollah, combined with the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, has diminished Iran's ability to project power through its proxies.</p>
