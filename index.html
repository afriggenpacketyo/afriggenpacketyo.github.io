          <p>Ahead of his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump commented on Russia's recent overnight strikes against Ukraine, suggesting they weaken the Russian leader's negotiating position. The meeting in Alaska will include top U.S. military and defense officials who are orchestrating a new $1.5 billion military aid package for Ukraine, funded by European allies. Trump also indicated that the U.S., in conjunction with Europe, might offer post-war security guarantees to Ukraine and threatened "economically severe" consequences if Putin is not serious about achieving peace.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the complex and shifting relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin ahead of their meeting in Alaska, set against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. It contrasts Trump's previous praise for Putin, whom he once called a "genius," with his more recent expressions of frustration and disappointment as the conflict has intensified. The summit is framed as a crucial moment that will spotlight their personal dynamic and its potential to influence the war's resolution, moving beyond Trump's initial belief that their rapport alone could end the fighting.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a tech analyst has described such an intervention as essential for U.S. national security. The argument centers on reducing the country's reliance on foreign chip manufacturers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor for critical technology. This potential government investment, possibly using funds from the CHIPS Act, is presented as a necessary step to revive the struggling American company and ensure domestic control over foundational technology for defense and AI.

          <p>Epping Forest District Council is seeking a High Court injunction to stop The Bell Hotel from housing asylum seekers, arguing it poses an unacceptable risk to public safety. The legal action follows violent protests and rising community tensions, reportedly catalyzed by the arrest of an asylum seeker on sexual assault and other charges. The council claims the hotel's use for this purpose was not properly cleared, while the hotel's owners argue an injunction would cause hardship and set a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to reverse the federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). The suit argues that the president's executive order, which invoked a never-before-used section of the Home Rule Act, is an unlawful infringement on the District's right to self-governance. The legal challenge seeks to vacate the order given to the new federally appointed police chief and maintain local control over the city's law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of the Kingsmill bread brand, has announced an agreement to purchase its rival, Hovis. The merger, which is subject to approval by the UK's competition watchdog, would create the country's largest bread producer. ABF plans to implement cost-cutting measures to return the two currently loss-making businesses to profitability, a move that has prompted unions to warn against potential impacts on jobs, pay, and working conditions.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard across several counties in England after three RAF Typhoon fighter jets were scrambled from RAF Coningsby. The jets were launched to escort a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control while traveling from Nice. Communications were successfully re-established, and the plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport, with Essex Police later confirming there was no cause for concern after the flight landed.</p>

          <p>A Bankrate analysis reveals that West Virginia has experienced the highest percentage growth in home equity in the nation since 2020, with a surge of 450%. This dramatic increase is attributed to rising home prices in what was traditionally one of the most affordable markets, coupled with many homeowners securing low mortgage rates. While the overall dollar amount of equity remains lower than in other states, the trend highlights significant wealth generation for homeowners in the South and Midwest. (not investment advice)</p>

The jury acquitted him after a brief deliberation, a verdict that has drawn criticism from some political figures who allege "two-tier justice."</p>

          <p>In the Indian state of Bihar, where inadequate infrastructure and extreme heat cause significant post-harvest losses, solar-powered cold storage units are being introduced as a potential solution. These facilities allow small-scale farmers to preserve perishable produce like potatoes for longer, enabling them to sell at better market prices and reduce waste. While challenges such as initial cost and implementation remain, the technology offers a way to turn the region's abundant sunshine into a tool for agricultural stability and improved farmer income.</p>
