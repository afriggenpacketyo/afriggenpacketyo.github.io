          <p>Salt Lake City police are investigating two self-described "peacekeepers" following a fatal shooting at a "No Kings Day" protest that resulted in one death and another injury, raising concerns about unauthorized security at public demonstrations. The incident occurred when the peacekeepers confronted Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who allegedly brandished a rifle near the protest. One of the peacekeepers opened fire, hitting Gamboa and Arthur Folasa "Afa" Ah Loo, who died from his injuries, while Gamboa was arrested. The protest, organized by 50501, a grassroots political group, drew approximately 10,000 participants, and the investigation is ongoing to determine the legality of the use of deadly force and whether organized security was authorized. </p>

Mizuhara pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return, admitting to placing approximately 19,000 bets with a bookie over two years and accumulating over $40 million in debt. Ohtani publicly stated that he never placed a sports bet and that Mizuhara's story about paying off his gambling debt was fabricated. Federal prosecutors also requested Mizuhara to pay $16.9 million of restitution to Ohtani and another $1.1 million to the IRS.</p>

          <p>Israel struck Iranian state television and warned residents in Tehran to evacuate after accusing Iran of targeting civilians, marking the fourth day of open warfare between the two nations. The strike on the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network disrupted a live broadcast, resulting in casualties and widespread panic in Tehran, with many attempting to flee the city. The U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the deployment of additional capabilities to the United States Central Command Area of Responsibility. Israel claims Iranian missiles have killed 24 and injured hundreds, while Iran announced it had launched approximately 100 missiles and vowed further retaliation for Israel's attacks.</p>

          <p>The Jane Goodall Institute's Hope Through Action project in Tanzania, aimed at protecting endangered chimpanzees and their habitats, is facing a setback due to funding cuts from USAid. The project, launched in November 2023 with a $29.5 million pledge over five years, focuses on reforestation and community-led methodology to conserve biodiversity and improve local livelihoods. In response, Ecosia, a Berlin-based search engine, has offered $100,000 over three years to support the Gombe reforestation project, which will fund the planting of 360,000 seedlings. Goodall had previously criticized Trump's climate agenda, and Refugees International reported that 98% of USAid's climate-related awards have been discontinued.</p>

          <p>Peter Stinson, a former Coast Guard lieutenant, has been arrested for allegedly making threats to kill President Trump through social media posts spanning from 2020 to 2025. The FBI affidavit details numerous online statements suggesting the use of a gun, knife, and poison against Mr. Trump, with Stinson allegedly expressing a willingness to serve in a support capacity or raise money for a "contract hit." Stinson, who has self-identified as a member of ANTIFA, is charged with making threats against the president, and a federal judge has ordered his detention pending further hearings. Threats against politicians and public officials have become more common in recent years, with federal prosecutors routinely bringing charges over threats against Mr. Trump, former President Joe Biden, and other government officials.</p>

          <p>China is using its dominance in the global supply of rare earth elements as leverage in trade talks with the United States. Rare earths are vital components in various modern technologies, including smartphones, electric vehicles, medical equipment, and military applications. The article suggests that China wrapped up two days of high-level trade talks with the U.S. in London, where the two nations agreed “in principle to a framework” that each side would bring home for review by their top leaders. This marks a shift from the 2018 trade talks during Donald Trump's first term, where Beijing's attempts at "moral persuasion" failed to impress Trump.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear an appeal from Chevron, Exxon, and other oil and gas companies concerning lawsuits seeking compensation for coastal land loss and environmental degradation in Louisiana. The companies are appealing a 2024 federal appeals court decision that kept the lawsuits in state courts, allowing them to move to trial after more than a decade. Chevron argues that because they began oil production and refining during World War II as a federal contractor, these cases should be heard in federal court, while plaintiffs' attorneys say the appeal is a stall tactic to avoid accountability. Louisiana's coastal parishes have lost over 2,000 square miles of land in the past century, with oil and gas infrastructure identified as a significant cause.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Colorado has found MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent election conspiracy theorist, liable for defaming Eric Coomer, a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems, after the 2020 presidential election.

Dominion Voting Systems previously won a $787 million settlement in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News over airing false claims against the company. Lindell said he went to trial to draw attention to the need to get rid of electronic voting machines, claiming he used to be worth about $60 million before speaking out about the 2020 election and is now $10 million in debt.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled details of President Trump's tax bill, making changes to the tax and Medicaid provisions in the House-passed version. The Senate proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid funding and permanently extends the $10,000 state and local tax deduction (SALT), differing from the House bill's increase to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000. The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making Trump's first-term tax cuts permanent. Republican leaders aim to get the legislation to the president's desk by early July, but unresolved sticking points and a short week could delay progress.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been inconsistent, ranging from strong support for Israel to distancing himself, creating uncertainty as the situation escalates. The Israeli prime minister claims the attacks were "fully coordinated" with the US, while Trump's ultimate goal is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, preferably through a deal. Trump's options include escalating military action, maintaining the current course of limited involvement, or pulling back due to domestic political considerations, particularly from voices within his MAGA movement who oppose US involvement in Middle East conflicts. The president's decision will be influenced by factors such as pressure from Netanyahu, risks of escalation, and domestic political support.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite National Park's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer, adding an extra 500 campsites. Maintenance and staffing challenges had kept several campgrounds closed since 2020, but White Wolf Campground will open on June 20, Tamarack Flat Campground on June 23, and Yosemite Creek Campground on July 1. Reservations are available at Recreation.gov, but finding a camping spot is highly competitive, often filling up minutes after reservations open. The park's reservation system, introduced in 2020 amid the pandemic, was temporarily halted before being reinstated in late March.</p>

          <p>California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced an investigation into State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following the Los Angeles fires, focusing on how the insurer has managed smoke damage claims. The investigation will examine issues such as frequent reassignment of adjusters, inconsistent management of similar claims, and inadequate record-keeping. State Farm says it is cooperating with the state and will comply with the investigation, stating that thousands of its customers are being helped and are very satisfied. The investigation comes a month after the insurance department approved a 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers following the LA fires.</p>

          <p>The American Bar Association has sued the Trump administration, arguing that its push to punish law firms is unconstitutional, joining several targeted firms in legal action against the government. The lawsuit challenges orders that cut off security clearances, contracts, and federal building access for law firms, often citing their pro bono work, associations with Trump's legal foes, or diversity, equity, and inclusion practices. The ABA argues that Trump has coerced lawyers to abandon clients and causes he dislikes, violating the First Amendment, and that the administration's actions have led to a "chilling effect," intimidating firms from taking pro bono cases that counter the Trump administration's agenda.</p>

Arrests have dropped in downtown over the past few days, and the LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the area to ensure safety.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was "void and illegal," citing unlawful “racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community.” The cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), were ordered to be reinstated. The judge noted that he had “never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable.” The ruling follows the Trump administration's February decision to slash billions in NIH funding, influenced by Elon Musk, amid efforts to cut 10,000 jobs from federal health agencies.</p>

Kennedy bypassed the ACIP process to order changes to vaccine guidance, and fired the current roster of ACIP members and removed agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.
