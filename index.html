          <p>A program called ROMEO (Retired Older Men Eating Out) in Harpswell, Maine, addresses the issue of social isolation among older men, who are often reluctant to seek help. The initiative, started by Harpswell Aging at Home, provides monthly lunches and activities to foster connection and purpose. The program aims to combat depression and suicide rates, which are highest among men over 75, by creating a supportive community. Participants have reported feeling more connected and engaged with the outside world through these gatherings, which offer a safe space for socialization. </p>

          <p>A coalition of twelve states, primarily led by Democratic attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, contesting the legality of his imposed tariffs. The states argue that the President's actions exceed his constitutional authority, which they believe is reserved solely for Congress. They seek a court order to block the Trump administration from enforcing these tariffs, claiming they are based on the President's whims rather than lawful trade policy. This lawsuit follows a similar action taken by California, reflecting growing legal challenges to the administration's trade practices.</p>

          <p>Ricardo Prada VÃ¡squez, a Venezuelan man, was deported to El Salvador after mistakenly crossing into Canada and attempting to re-enter the U.S., igniting concerns over due process.

The incident highlights broader issues of long-term detentions and lack of oversight at the U.S.-Canada border, with another undocumented mother facing similar detention after a wrong turn.

          <p>Robert Holzmann, a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, suggests that the euro zone should postpone interest rate cuts until there is more clarity regarding U.S. tariffs and potential EU countermeasures. He stated that the current uncertainty makes it difficult to determine the best direction for monetary policy. While there is a general consensus on lowering rates, Holzmann believes it's important to assess the impact of tariffs on prices before making any decisions. His remarks reflect a cautious approach to easing monetary policy amid global trade tensions.</p>
