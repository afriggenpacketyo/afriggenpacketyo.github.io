            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry into the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month has attributed the incident to an 'operational misunderstanding,' stating that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces. The IDF claimed that six of the casualties were Hamas members, but did not provide evidence for this affiliation. The report cited poor night visibility and the commander's perception of an immediate threat as contributing factors, while also dismissing the deputy commander for providing an incomplete report. Despite initial claims of suspicious convoy behavior, video evidence showed the vehicles with lights and emergency signals activated.</p>

            <p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Sunday that his recent trip to El Salvador was not about defending Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident deported despite a court order, but about defending the Constitution. Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week to seek answers about the detention and safety of Abrego Garcia, who was deported in March to the countryâ€™s notorious CECOT prison, despite a 2019 court order prohibiting his removal due to safety fears. The Trump administration alleged he was affiliated with the MS-13 gang -- an accusation his attorneys and his family firmly deny.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) traveled to El Salvador to investigate the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident allegedly affiliated with MS-13, despite a court order prohibiting his removal. Van Hollen emphasized that his concern was upholding the rule of law and due process, not defending Abrego Garcia himself, as the Trump administration admitted to wrongfully detaining and deporting him. He criticized the Salvadoran government's complicity in the matter, noting that Abrego Garcia was initially held in the notorious CECOT prison without communication. Van Hollen stated that the administration should present its evidence in court rather than spreading lies.</p>

            <p>A leaked draft executive order from the Trump administration outlines a radical restructuring of the U.S. State Department, potentially eliminating bureaus related to climate, refugees, human rights, and gender equality. The proposal also suggests significant reductions in sub-Saharan Africa operations and diplomatic missions in Canada, signaling a rejection of multilateralism. The State Department would be reorganized into four regional bureaus, and Fulbright scholarships would be reformed to focus on national security-related disciplines. Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially dismissed the report as 'fake news,' while other sources suggest the final changes may be less drastic.</p>

            <p>Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have revised the death toll from a boat fire in Equateur province to 33, significantly lower than initial reports of 148 fatalities. The incident occurred at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers near Mbandaka, with around 400 people believed to have been aboard. The mayor of Mbandaka attributed the discrepancies to 'confusion,' while police suspect cooking onboard the vessel ignited the blaze. Boat travel is a common mode of transportation in Congo due to inadequate infrastructure, but accidents are frequent due to overcrowding and lack of safety measures.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center "until further order from this court." The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the reliability of various economic indicators, dismissing quirky metrics like lipstick sales and men's underwear purchases as having little empirical evidence. It acknowledges that media and economists often cite consumer sentiment, unemployment, GDP, bond yields, and manufacturing activity as indicators, but argues that none are consistently reliable predictors of a recession. Instead, the author suggests focusing on actual data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies, as these provide a more direct insight into consumer spending, capital flow, and employment trends. The article advises against relying too heavily on government data or trade association surveys, which can be biased or revised significantly.</p>

Initial observations suggested the star was a red giant engulfing the planet, but further analysis revealed the star was not bright enough to be in that stage. The new theory suggests a Jupiter-sized planet, orbiting very close to its star, was pulled inward due to tidal forces, eventually grazing the star's atmosphere and causing a runaway process of falling in. The impact ejected some of the star's outer layers into space, creating a ring of cold dust.</p>

            <p>A 14-year-old girl was killed by a lion near Nairobi National Park in Kenya, prompting increased security measures. The girl was snatched from a residential compound on a ranch bordering the park. This incident follows the death of a 54-year-old man killed by an elephant in central Nyeri county. Conservationists are urging the Kenya Wildlife Service to improve risk assessments and communication regarding wildlife movement, while also recommending anti-predator deterrent systems for properties near wildlife areas.</p>

            <p>German authorities are attempting to deport an American and three EU citizens following a pro-Palestinian protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. The individuals have been instructed to leave Germany by April 21st, but are appealing the orders. The Berlin Immigration Office cited property damage and graffiti as reasons for the deportations, while lawyers for the protesters say they have not received information about specific charges. The case has drawn comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protests in the U.S. and raises concerns about freedom of movement within the EU.</p>

Certified financial planners recommend rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance and timeline, potentially shifting assets to a 60/40 stock/bond allocation. Building cash reserves to cover two years of income is also advised to avoid selling investments during market downturns, mitigating 'sequence of returns risk'. Considering a 'bond ladder' can provide a steady stream of income while minimizing risk. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece explores the prevalence of dishonesty in dating, from 'catfishing' to 'gaslighting,' and considers whether all dating lies are inherently awful. While acknowledging the harm caused by serious lies about relationship status or intentions, the author suggests that some lesser lies stem from insecurity or a desire to present a better version of oneself. Ultimately, the author's date discovered the truth years later but it did not damage their relationship.</p>

Instead of solely relying on reciprocal tariff increases, China should mandate that bilateral trade be settled in renminbi. This would force the U.S. to purchase Chinese currency on a large scale, significantly increasing the renminbi's use and demand, while also pushing up its exchange rate against the U.S. dollar.
