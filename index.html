          <p>The Russian Defense Ministry reported that Ukrainian drones attacked airfields in five regions, resulting in fires affecting several aircraft.

The operation is considered a propaganda coup and sends a message to Russia and Ukraine's western allies that Ukraine is still in the fight.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a "large-scale" drone attack deep into Russian territory, claiming to have destroyed 40 military bombers. Ukrainian security sources said the attack took over a year and a half to execute and was personally supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The drone attack came as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site. Meanwhile, explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia overnight.</p>
