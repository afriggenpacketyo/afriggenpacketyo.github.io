          <p>Elon Musk has announced the creation of a new political party, named the "America Party," following a public disagreement with President Trump over a major tax and spending bill. Musk, who previously led a government efficiency initiative, criticized the bill for increasing the national deficit. The move was met with skepticism from Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who suggested Musk should focus on his business ventures rather than political activities. The announcement signals a significant rift between the two former allies and introduces a new, unpredictable element into U.S. politics.</p>

          <p>A 2022 video has surfaced showing Mahmood Mamdani, an Ivy League professor and father of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, making controversial historical assertions. During a panel discussion, he claimed that Adolf Hitler was inspired by Abraham Lincoln and that Nazi Germany's Nuremberg Laws were modeled on American laws. The report connects these statements to the political context of his son, a self-proclaimed socialist, whose own radical views are also being scrutinized following his primary win. The article suggests these past remarks could influence perceptions of the mayoral candidate's potential governance.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas have resulted in at least 70 deaths, including 13-year-old Blair and 11-year-old Brooke Harber from Dallas. The sisters were staying with their grandparents, who are still missing, in a cabin along the Guadalupe River when the floodwaters surged. The tragedy is part of a wider "mass casualty event" that has also left up to 11 campers and a counselor from the nearby Camp Mystic unaccounted for.

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has indicated that several new trade deals are expected to be finalized this week, just before a key tariff deadline.

Hassett emphasized that President Trump's strategy is successfully encouraging foreign companies to move operations to the U.S., thereby boosting domestic job creation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant failure in Wimbledon's new electronic line-calling system caused controversy during a fourth-round match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal. The system failed to make a call on a crucial point where a ball was visibly out, leading the umpire to replay the point instead of awarding it to Pavlyuchenkova. She later criticized the decision, suggesting the umpire was hesitant to overrule the faulty technology and stating a game was "stolen" from her. An All England Club spokesperson attributed the malfunction to operator error but confirmed the umpire followed the established protocol.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas, which saw three months' worth of rain fall in just a few hours, have underscored the limitations of modern weather forecasting. Despite the National Weather Service issuing timely watches and warnings, the rainfall's intensity far exceeded predictions, overwhelming the region known as "flash flood alley." Experts note that while technology can anticipate the possibility of a major event, pinpointing its exact location and severity remains incredibly difficult. The disaster, exacerbated by record atmospheric moisture, serves as a stark example of the complex and increasingly frequent tragedies fueled by the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has deported eight men, convicted of various crimes, to South Sudan after a contentious legal battle that reached the Supreme Court. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national; the others are from countries that reportedly refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had required due process hearings for such third-country removals. The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to expand deportations to third countries, raising concerns about the fate of deportees sent to unstable nations like South Sudan.</p>

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) and DW's Director General have strongly condemned an attack on a DW news crew by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The correspondent and cameraman were reporting on a planned protest against settler violence when they were chased and had stones thrown at them. While they escaped unharmed, their vehicle was severely damaged. Germany's ambassador to Israel also expressed concern, emphasizing that the safety of journalists and freedom of the press must be guaranteed in the region.</p>

A viral photo of the exhausted girl, Sohan Aboulsoud, on a smuggler's boat sparked protests in Tripoli from other families unable to access essential medicines. Libya's political instability since 2011 has decimated its medical infrastructure, leaving many to pay for expensive private care abroad or risk perilous journeys. Despite a government promise to help, the family reports receiving no concrete assistance since arriving in Italy.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official PLA Daily have stated that China's armed forces need to undergo structural reforms to effectively counter the increasing threat of unmanned aircraft. Citing the crucial role of drones in recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine, the experts suggest the likely establishment of specialized counter-drone combat units. In the interim, they propose integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing units like electronic warfare teams. This reflects an ongoing strategic shift within the PLA to adapt to the realities of modern warfare.</p>

After months of tense talks, the bloc has conceded that a comprehensive deal is unlikely and is now aiming for a more basic framework agreement to avert a full-scale trade war.

          <p>In a harrowing first-person account, an NPR journalist in Gaza describes the life-threatening journey to obtain food from a U.S.- and Israeli-supported distribution site. The process involved dodging Israeli military fire, facing armed private contractors, and navigating violent crowds fighting over scarce rations, a system the UN has called a "death trap." The journalist witnessed people being killed and wounded while trying to get food and was himself robbed by masked thieves. The report paints a visceral picture of the widespread hunger, lawlessness, and daily horror facing Palestinians trying to survive.</p>

The site, located north of Lima, contains 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes, along with ceremonial objects and clay sculptures. Archaeologists believe the discovery is significant for understanding what happened to the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it declined. Peñico's strategic location suggests it served as a key link between communities on the Pacific coast, in the Andes, and the Amazon basin.</p>
