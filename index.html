          <h2>ADM Stock Declines Following Trump's Claim of Coca-Cola's Shift to Cane Sugar</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 09:44:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), a significant producer of high fructose corn syrup, experienced a notable decline after President Donald Trump publicly claimed that Coca-Cola had agreed to transition to real cane sugar for its U.S. beverages. This assertion, which Coca-Cola did not directly confirm, was met with enthusiasm by Trump, who cited health and quality benefits. Conversely, the Corn Refiners Association expressed strong opposition, warning that such a shift could lead to thousands of American food manufacturing job losses, depress farm income, and increase reliance on foreign sugar imports. This situation highlights the administration's broader push for food industry reformulations and its immediate market impact on ingredient suppliers.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee is currently voting on the contentious nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer and a top Justice Department official, for a lifetime appointment as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. Bove faces significant opposition from former federal prosecutors and judges, alongside whistleblower allegations of unethical conduct, including pushing a quid pro quo in the Eric Adams case and suggesting the Justice Department disregard court orders. While Bove denies these claims, and Republican Senator Thom Tillis has indicated support, the intense partisan debate highlights deep divisions over judicial appointments and the integrity of the Justice Department. His ultimate confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 09:35:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a substantial third bid for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, with the offer potentially reaching £70 million. This proposal includes an initial payment of £65 million, supplemented by an additional £5 million in performance-related add-ons, though Brentford has not yet engaged in discussions regarding the offer. Manchester United remains optimistic about integrating the Cameroon international into Ruben Amorim's squad before their departure for three pre-season games in the United States. This aggressive pursuit highlights the club's strategy to strengthen its roster, aiming to enhance its competitive edge following earlier summer signings of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.</p>

          <p>Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve Governor and a rumored top candidate for Fed Chair under President Trump, has strongly advocated for a 'regime change' in the central bank's policy conduct. He criticized the current Fed's 'credibility deficit' and its reluctance to cut interest rates, echoing President Trump's public pressure. Warsh also proposed a 'new Treasury-Fed accord,' similar to the 1951 agreement, to foster greater coordination between the central bank and the Treasury Department on national debt management and balance sheet objectives. His remarks suggest a significant shift towards a more politically aligned monetary policy, aiming to lower borrowing costs and potentially challenging the Fed's traditional independence.

          <p>The value of stolen cryptocurrencies has surged to $2.17 billion in the first half of 2025, already surpassing last year's total and projected to reach $4 billion by year-end. This increase is largely due to a massive $1.5 billion hack on Dubai's Bybit exchange by North Korea-linked actors, the largest crypto heist in history. Alarmingly, the rise is also fueled by a spike in physical attacks on individual crypto holders, with criminals resorting to violence and coercion, including kidnapping and finger mutilation, to access funds. Experts suggest this shift occurs as crypto trading services enhance their security, pushing criminals to target less protected individual wallets.</p>

This vote follows a period of uncertainty caused by a right-wing Republican rebellion that initially stalled the bill, with holdouts seeking to merge it with legislation banning a central bank digital currency. President Trump intervened, leading to a deal where the CBDC ban would be tied to the annual defense bill, clearing the path for the GENIUS Act.

New borrowers after July 2026 will have only two choices: a standard fixed payment plan or the 'Repayment Assistance Plan' (RAP), which offers substantially higher monthly payments than SAVE.

          <p>Southeast Asian nations are apprehensive about new U.S. tariffs targeting 'transshipped' goods, which are products rerouted through intermediate countries to evade higher tariffs. While the U.S. recently reduced general tariffs for Vietnam and Indonesia, a 40% levy on transshipped goods aims to curb economic ties with China, accused of using these routes to bypass duties. The definition of 'transshipment' is crucial; a broad interpretation including goods with Chinese components could severely impact Southeast Asian economies and U.S. companies operating there. This policy risks creating diplomatic tensions between Southeast Asian countries and China, as Beijing warns against complying with terms detrimental to its interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the concept of 'rescissions,' a legislative mechanism President Trump is actively employing to claw back $9 billion in federal funding previously allocated by Congress. These proposed cuts primarily target foreign aid programs and public broadcasting, aligning with the administration's stated goal of reducing government spending. The recent narrow passage of the rescissions bill in the Senate, despite bipartisan opposition, underscores the contentious nature of this budgetary maneuver. The White House frames it as a necessary measure for fiscal responsibility, while opponents argue it bypasses traditional appropriations processes and could negatively impact crucial domestic and international initiatives.</p>
