          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is concluding a high-profile state visit to the United Kingdom, marked by royal ceremonies and meetings with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Discussions are set to cover migration, defense, and trade, but the event is largely overshadowed by the threat of new U.S. tariffs on European goods. The European Union is anxiously awaiting a decision from the Trump administration on a potential trade deal, creating a tense backdrop for the Franco-British summit. This visit highlights the complex diplomatic and economic challenges European leaders face in navigating transatlantic relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued after a section of a large industrial tunnel collapsed deep underground in Los Angeles. The workers were approximately six miles in from the entrance and 400 feet below the surface when the cave-in occurred. They managed to navigate over debris to reach a tunnel boring machine and were then transported to safety without any major injuries. Officials praised the workers' composure and called the outcome a victory, averting a potential tragedy during the construction of a major wastewater project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has temporarily stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the United States, citing multiple factors for the decision. The move is partly attributed to the high 27.5% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on European-built cars, which significantly impact the vehicle's market viability. Additionally, the model is facing a recall by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration due to its third-row seats not meeting federal safety standards. This development underscores the dual challenges of trade policy and regulatory compliance facing international car manufacturers in the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has approved a significant reform allowing Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays. The change is intended to help the postal service manage declining letter volumes and rising operational costs, which have been driving up stamp prices. Under the new rules, Royal Mail must still deliver first-class letters six days a week and will face revised delivery targets to ensure overall service reliability. The company welcomed the decision as a necessary step toward maintaining a financially sustainable universal service for the country.</p>

          <p>The European Union remains in a state of uncertainty as it awaits a decision from Washington on a potential trade agreement, with a previous informal deadline having passed. U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested a decision could come within days, and his administration has acknowledged that the EU has made significant offers to open its markets. However, the EU is preparing for all scenarios, including the imposition of a 10% baseline tariff on its goods, though it hopes for specific exemptions. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions and delicate negotiations shaping the future of transatlantic trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vienna is being highlighted as a prime example of successful housing policy, often described as a "renters' utopia" due to its large and stable social housing sector. Approximately 43% of the city's housing is social housing, available to a wide range of income levels, which keeps rent significantly lower than in the private market and helps control overall housing costs. This system, originating from the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, has been maintained through long-term political commitment and a levy on employee salaries. While challenges in accessibility remain, Vienna's model demonstrates that prioritizing housing as a basic need can lead to greater affordability.</p>

These pulses create illusions that allow scientists to command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of accuracy. In tests, the bees reportedly obeyed the commands nine out of ten times, marking a significant step in micro-robotics and animal-machine interfaces.</p>

The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, and the new tariff is expected to cause significant price increases for American consumers and industries.

          <p>Poland has implemented spot border checks at its crossings with Germany, mirroring a similar move by Germany last year and further straining the principle of free movement within the Schengen Area. Residents and commuters in the integrated border cities of Frankfurt an der Oder and Slubice report that the checks are making daily life difficult, causing delays and disrupting the cross-border economy. While introduced in response to Germany's toughened migration policies, the controls are seen by many locals as a political show that negatively impacts the close ties built between the two communities over decades.</p>

          <p>Questions are being raised about how Suffolk Police failed to capture a wanted man, Roy Barclay, who went on to murder 57-year-old Anita Rose during her morning dog walk. Barclay had been on the police's most-wanted list for two years after breaching his prison license conditions, yet he managed to evade capture while leaving a significant digital footprint, including using his bank card and posting hundreds of online reviews. A former detective stated that the police have serious questions to answer, suggesting the murder could have been prevented. Suffolk Police has confirmed it will conduct a review into its handling of the search.</p>

Employers can receive up to 1,500 yuan for each new hire who is signed to a formal contract and for whom social insurance contributions are paid for at least three months. This measure is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market and support household incomes as the country grapples with sluggish economic growth and high youth unemployment.

          <p>A 35-year-old man from San Ysidro has been charged in federal court after allegedly attempting to smuggle 14 live Keel-billed toucans into the U.S. from Mexico. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers discovered the birds bound, sedated, and hidden inside the dashboard of the suspect's vehicle at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry. Some of the juvenile toucans had sustained injuries, including broken bones. Keel-billed toucans are a protected species, and the illicit pet trade for them is lucrative, with a single bird costing up to $5,000. The suspect faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.</p>

This legal battle pits federal authority against state-level regulations and is part of the administration's broader effort to address consumer anxieties over inflation and the rising cost of living.

The Houthis claimed they attacked the ship for heading to Israel and stated they took some crew to a safe location, which the U.S. has described as a kidnapping.

In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where deadly floods struck on Tuesday, the community was already on high alert due to wildfire "burn scars" that increase flood risk, allowing for some level of readiness. In contrast, a flood in Texas just days earlier caught officials by surprise, leading to a much higher death toll of at least 119 people. The two events serve as a case study on how prior experience and proactive planning can significantly mitigate the human cost of natural disasters.</p>
