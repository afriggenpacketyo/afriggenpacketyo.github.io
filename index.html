        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, had her appeal dismissed after being jailed for inciting racial hatred in a tweet where she called for mass deportations and urged followers to set fire to hotels housing asylum seekers. The tweet, posted on the day of the Southport attacks, was viewed 310,000 times before deletion. Judges ruled that the original sentence of 31 months was not manifestly excessive, emphasizing the severity of inciting racial hatred through social media. Connolly's initial plea of guilty at Birmingham Crown Court led to her imprisonment, with a requirement to serve 40% of her sentence before parole.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. More than half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has been diversifying its imports, aiming to have no single country outside the U.S. represent more than 10% of purchases by next year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices due to tariffs. Home Depot expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the full year, with comparable sales rising about 1%.</p>

          <p>Ahmed Ebid, an Egyptian-born UK-based people smuggler, has been sentenced to 25 years in jail for organizing the illegal movement of nearly 3,800 migrants from North Africa to Italy between October 2022 and June 2023. Ebid, who arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 and applied for asylum, orchestrated boat crossings across the Mediterranean, exploiting desperate individuals for profit. The judge highlighted the horrifying treatment of migrants, the considerable risk of loss of life, and Ebid's managerial role in bribing officials and ordering threats of violence. Following his sentence, Ebid is likely to be deported.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is experiencing a significant decline in his political influence, marked by feuds with the Florida legislature and diminished national prominence. Analysts attribute this fall to his autocratic governing style and unsuccessful challenge to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential nomination. DeSantis's once-firm grip on Florida's lawmakers has weakened, and he faces investigations related to his wife Casey's charity. With his term ending in 2027, DeSantis faces an uncertain political future, overshadowed by rising figures in Trump's circle.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the Republican-backed tax and spending bill could add trillions to the U.S. deficit, as the proposed tax breaks are projected to outweigh any savings. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. The bill includes extending President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which would cost $2.2 trillion, along with other tax breaks. The Trump administration disagrees with the analysis, claiming the bill includes $1.6 trillion in savings.</p>
