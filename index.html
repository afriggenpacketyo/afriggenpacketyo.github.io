          <p>A new book excerpt from Ron Chernow's biography of Mark Twain details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling partially incognito, Samuel Clemens confronted the changes to the river and its towns, feeling both disappointment at their decay and a profound, dreamlike joy in reliving his past. The experience of once again piloting a steamboat allowed him to feel as if the intervening years had vanished, reconnecting him with his cherished, carefree youth.</p>

          <p>A segment on "CBS Sunday Morning" celebrates the 50th anniversary of the movie "Jaws," which forever changed Hollywood and became the first summer blockbuster. The retrospective features interviews with star Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, who recall the notoriously difficult 1974 film shoot on Martha's Vineyard. They reflect on the challenges of working with a young Steven Spielberg and a malfunctioning mechanical shark, a chaotic production that nevertheless resulted in one of cinema's most enduring and iconic thrillers.</p>

          <p>A city council secretary in Apaseo el Grande, Mexico, was shot and killed while attending an amateur basketball game in the state of Guanajuato. The attack occurred in a sports hall where families and children were present, highlighting the pervasive violence in the region. Guanajuato is currently Mexico's deadliest state, largely due to brutal turf wars between the Jalisco New Generation cartel and the Santa Rosa de Lima gang. This assassination is the latest incident in a wave of criminal violence that has plagued the state.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are confronting a critical week of negotiations to secure a trade deal with Washington and avert President Trump's threat of a 50% tariff on EU imports. The bloc is internally divided, with Germany favoring a quick deal to avoid a trade war, while France advocates for holding out for better terms. With the July 9 deadline looming, Brussels remains uncertain of its standing and may have to settle for a basic framework agreement, leaving key industries bracing for new challenges regardless of the outcome.

He argues the current model, designed in the 1960s, is inefficient, overstretched by funding cuts, and ill-equipped to handle modern threats. As part of his push for financial efficiency, Rowley also suggested that wealthy organizations like Premier League football clubs should contribute to the cost of policing their own events.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece posits that ranked-choice voting (RCV) was a significant winner in New York City's recent mayoral primary, fundamentally changing the campaign's dynamics for the better. The system allowed voters to support long-shot candidates without feeling like their vote was wasted and encouraged candidates to build coalitions and cross-endorse each other rather than engage in negative attacks. This positive, issue-focused environment is credited with helping a newcomer like Zohran Mamdani achieve a majority victory and demonstrates RCV's potential to create more engaging and less polarized elections.</p>

Critics state that his focus on long-discredited theories, such as a link to vaccines, and his use of what they call stigmatizing, tragedy-focused language, threaten to undo decades of scientific progress and humanizing advocacy. Researchers fear his initiatives will divert resources to phantom goals, create false hope for families, and roll back the narrative of autism from one of difference to one of disease.</p>

          <p>A key advisory committee to the CDC has recommended that flu shots be made without thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that has been safely used for decades. The move is controversial because it comes after the committee was reconstituted by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine critic. Experts worry the decision is not based on scientific evidence, as thimerosal has been extensively studied and found to be safe, and that it could unnecessarily undermine public confidence in vaccines by validating baseless fears.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the recent military exchange between Israel and Iran suggests that China's role as a global superpower is limited, as it was largely ineffective as a diplomatic or security player during the crisis. Despite its significant economic interests in the Middle East, including being a primary importer of the region's oil, Beijing could not broker peace or significantly influence the belligerents. The article argues this demonstrates that China currently lacks the military projection, diplomatic muscle, and political will to challenge U.S. influence on major global security issues.</p>

The reversal, forced by a rebellion of Labour MPs, means that £5 billion in anticipated annual savings will be delayed or lost, putting pressure on the upcoming budget. Consequently, Phillipson acknowledged that this makes it harder to commit to other costly policy changes, such as scrapping the controversial two-child benefit cap, which a government taskforce is currently reviewing.
