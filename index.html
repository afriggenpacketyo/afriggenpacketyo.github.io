            <h2>UK Prisons Suspend Kitchen Use After Inmate Attack</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-14 08:48:38 EDT</div>

            <p>The UK government has suspended kitchen use in high-security prison units following an attack at HMP Frankland, where Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi assaulted three prison officers. Abedi used hot oil and makeshift blades from cooking trays to attack the officers, resulting in serious injuries for two male officers, while a female officer was discharged after treatment. This decision aims to prevent similar incidents by restricting access to potential weapons and dangerous materials within separation centers housing the UK's most dangerous and extremist inmates. The incident raises concerns about prison security and the management of high-risk individuals.</p>

            <p>Over 400 Georgetown University alumni and students have signed a letter protesting the detention of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow, by immigration authorities. Suri, an Indian citizen, was detained on March 17, with officials citing his father-in-law's alleged ties to Hamas and Suri's social media posts supporting Palestine as reasons for revoking his J-1 visa. The letter argues that Suri's detention violates academic freedom and due process, comparing it to similar cases under the Trump administration. Supporters claim the allegations are unsubstantiated and politically motivated, urging Georgetown University to publicly defend academic freedom.</p>

            <p>Pfizer has halted the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill, danuglipron, following a patient in a trial experiencing a liver injury potentially linked to the drug. Although the patient had no symptoms and recovered quickly after discontinuing the medication, the decision was made after reviewing all clinical data and consulting with regulators. This setback comes as Pfizer aims to enter the competitive GLP-1 market, currently dominated by injectable medications from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The company remains committed to developing other weight loss treatments, but this development underscores the challenges in creating safe and effective oral GLP-1 drugs.</p>

            <p>President Trump has implemented tariffs on goods from various countries, including up to 145% on Chinese goods and a 10% tax on goods from most other nations, arguing these measures will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of the product's value, increasing costs for companies importing goods into the US, which may then be passed on to consumers. While Trump aims to reduce the trade deficit and encourage domestic consumption, economists anticipate tariffs will increase prices for consumers and cause volatility in global stock markets. The UK government is also assessing the potential economic impact and considering retaliatory tariffs on US imports.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that over 60% of CEOs expect a recession within the next six months, driven by growing concerns about the impact of tariffs on their businesses. The survey, conducted by Chief Executive, reveals a significant increase in recession fears compared to the previous month, with a sharp decline in CEOs' views on current business conditions. While some anticipate better business conditions in the coming year, a majority project rising costs and declining profits, reflecting widespread uncertainty about the US economy. These concerns echo warnings from prominent business leaders like Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink.</p>

            <p>Hungary's governing party is set to push through constitutional changes targeting LGBTQ+ people and foreign-funded organizations, part of Prime Minister Orban's campaign ahead of the 2026 elections. The amendments emphasize the protection of children's physical and moral development, which government lawmakers see as a safeguard against ideological influences. The changes will also enshrine the recognition of only two sexes in the constitution. This move underpins legislation that bans the annual Pride march, restricting freedom of assembly and triggering protests.</p>

            <p>The UK government has assumed control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant to prevent its closure, amidst financial struggles and concerns over the plant's ability to continue operating. The plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, employs 2,700 people and is the last in the UK producing virgin steel, which is crucial for major construction projects. The government is working to secure raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running, acknowledging that public ownership is a likely option. The situation arose after Jingye launched a consultation on the plant's closure, citing financial unsustainability due to challenging market conditions and tariffs.</p>

            <p>Talks between the Trump administration and Iran on a renewed nuclear agreement have begun positively, driven by Iran's weakened economic and regional position. Iran's economy has deteriorated since the US withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, compounded by the loss of its Syrian ally and Israeli attacks on Hezbollah. Trump's willingness to engage, combined with Iran's desperation for sanctions relief, creates a unique opportunity for a deal. Trump's stance allows him to be perceived as tough on Iran, while Biden faced constraints from appearing 'soft' on the issue.</p>

            <p>US military aid to Ukraine is nearing its end, prompting European leaders to step up their support. With the Trump administration unlikely to approve further aid packages, Europe must find ways to sustain Ukraine's defense through domestic production, European security assistance, and US intelligence sharing. Key strategies include increasing risk tolerance in donating military equipment, investing in Ukraine's defense industry, and negotiating air defense missile supplies with the US. Europe should also consider seizing Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine's defense and reduce reliance on the US.</p>

            <p>A study from Latin America found that "weekend warriors" who exercise once or twice a week are 25% less likely to develop mild dementia than those who don't exercise at all. Regular exercisers (at least three times a week) were 11% less likely to develop mild dementia. Researchers estimate that 13% of mild dementia cases could be avoided if all middle-aged adults exercised at least once or twice a week. The study suggests that even small amounts of exercise can have a significant positive impact on mental health.</p>

            <p>This article explores the pervasive issue of fatigue among working mothers, highlighting that they often sleep enough hours but still feel exhausted due to the demands of childcare and household labor. Studies show mothers report higher fatigue levels than fathers, even with similar sleep patterns. The problem stems from interrupted sleep, cognitive overload, and limited opportunities for relaxation. Experts recommend strategies like "wakeful rest" to combat this fatigue, encouraging mothers to take a few minutes each day to mentally zone out and reset.</p>

While people express dissatisfaction with how often they see their friends, prioritizing work, family, and self-care often leaves little room for spontaneous social interactions. Some experts suggest redefining what constitutes a hangout, incorporating less structured activities and embracing occasional spontaneity to maintain friendships.</p>
