          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the deployment of 40 National Guard members to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in deportation processes, under federal Title 32 powers. This initiative, backed by Sanders, aims to target "violent, criminal illegal immigrants" and aligns with former President Trump's immigration enforcement efforts. Guardsmen will provide logistical support, transportation, and clerical assistance, allowing federal agents to focus on apprehension. The move follows Sanders signing the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act, which imposes enhanced penalties for immigrants committing additional crimes in the state.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced a preliminary benchmark revision, revealing 911,000 fewer jobs were added over the 12 months ending March 2025 than initially reported. This represents the largest revision ever recorded, signaling a significantly weaker labor market. The revised data comes weeks after President Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, expressing frustration with previous downward adjustments and questioning the validity of economic reports.

          <p>The U.S. government faces a potential liability of $750 billion to $1 trillion in tariff refunds if the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings that President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" are illegal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned of significant disruption from unwinding these levies, which have already collected over $72 billion. Trump's administration has urged the Supreme Court for a swift decision, arguing that a reversal of the lower court's findings is crucial to prevent ruinous economic consequences. Importers are advised to meticulously document records in anticipation of a complex refund process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a preliminary benchmark revision, indicating the U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than initially estimated. This significant downward adjustment suggests the labor market was cooling more dramatically than previously understood, potentially strengthening the Federal Reserve's case for an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Economists note that such revisions are a normal part of the statistical process, but this scale highlights bigger headwinds in the economy. The data could provide additional evidence for the Fed to address the labor market side of its dual mandate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei's ultraliberal party, La Libertad Avanza, suffered a resounding defeat in legislative elections in Buenos Aires province, a Peronist stronghold. Milei acknowledged the "clear defeat" and promised to "correct what needs to be corrected," facing calls to change course on his austerity policies. The election results caused markets to plunge, with the dollar rising against the peso and the Merval index dropping sharply. Critics attribute the outcome to the complicated economic situation for Argentinians, including rising utility and food prices, and a corruption case involving Milei's sister.</p>

          <p>The U.S. manufacturing sector is experiencing significant job losses, with employers shedding 12,000 jobs in August and 42,000 since April, according to a Center for American Progress analysis.

The overall slowdown in hiring, with only 22,000 jobs added across all sectors in August, further compounds concerns about economic uncertainty.

          <p>Firefighters in California are in a desperate race to protect the historic McKinley Grove, home to approximately 170 ancient giant sequoia trees, from the advancing Garnet wildfire. The lightning-caused fire reached the grove, prompting crews to implement extensive precautions, including a 24-hour sprinkler system and clearing heavy fuel buildup around the trees. Despite these efforts, some embers ignited branches within the grove, requiring smokejumpers to extinguish them. The Garnet fire has burned over 54,925 acres and is 14% contained, with the coming days being critical for the survival of these iconic, millennia-old trees.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer competitive interest rates that currently surpass inflation, providing a secure way to grow savings. This article outlines today's CD interest rates, emphasizing that short-term CDs, typically six months to one year, often yield higher returns due to an inverted yield curve. Online banks are highlighted as prime sources for the most competitive rates, given their lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Financial experts suggest a CD laddering strategy to capitalize on high short-term rates while maintaining long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Trump's "America First" Movement Exhibits Globalist Tendencies Through Foreign Political Interference</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 09:34:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic argues that despite its "America First" rhetoric, Donald Trump's movement paradoxically engages in "globalist" behavior by actively interfering in the political systems of other nations. The article cites examples such as Trump's administration openly favoring a Polish presidential candidate who campaigned on anti-Ukrainian sentiments, and Vice President J.D. Vance's interventions in British and German politics. This pattern suggests a deliberate effort to manipulate foreign systems in favor of Trump's ideological allies, spreading a consistent message of blaming immigrants and promoting anti-vaccination and pro-Russia stances across various countries.</p>

          <p>Parents are navigating increasing confusion regarding family vaccinations due to significant changes in U.S. government guidance under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., particularly concerning Covid-19 shots for healthy children and pregnant women. These changes, which have led to an exodus of CDC leaders, contradict recommendations from major medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics. The article highlights uncertainty about vaccine accessibility and insurance coverage, with some states exploring their own recommendations. It advises parents to consult their family physicians and professional medical societies for reliable information and to ask critical questions about vaccine benefits and risks.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Braun, a New York drug dealer whose federal prison sentence was commuted by Donald Trump in January 2021, has been found guilty of violating the terms of his release. A federal judge ruled that prosecutors proved Braun committed multiple violations, including menacing a hospital nurse and a synagogue member, groping his family's nanny, and evading bridge tolls. Braun, who had served only about a year of his original 10-year sentence for drug-related charges, now faces up to five additional years in prison. This case highlights the complexities and risks associated with clemency decisions.</p>
