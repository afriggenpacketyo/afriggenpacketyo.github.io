          <p>Former President Donald Trump is facing criticism for using the term "shylocks" during a speech in Iowa, a word the Anti-Defamation League identifies as a long-standing antisemitic trope. The comment was made while discussing changes to the estate tax in his new legislative package. When questioned by reporters, Trump stated he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, defining it simply as a moneylender who charges high rates. The remarks drew condemnation from the ADL and Democratic Representative Dan Goldman, who described the language as blatant and vile antisemitism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has outlined five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli meats because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods.</p>

          <p>Competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, marking a triumphant return after being banned from the previous year's event. Chestnut consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes to secure his victory, falling short of his own 2021 world record of 76. The win comes after a one-year hiatus due to a partnership dispute with a rival brand. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo secured her 11th title by eating 33 hot dogs and buns, though this was significantly below her record-setting performance from the prior year.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history, asserting that it fundamentally "turned the world upside down." In an interview, Burns argued that the revolution's greatest contribution was the creation of the "citizen," a new concept in a world previously composed of subjects under rulers. He emphasized that the Declaration of Independence, despite its original exclusionary language, provided an inspirational foundation for future movements for equality worldwide. Burns's upcoming film on the subject aims to explore these complex and rich historical narratives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several economists are expressing alarm over President Trump's recently passed tax and spending legislation, which the Congressional Budget Office projects will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years. Experts warn that the already high national debt makes this new spending particularly risky, potentially leading to higher interest rates for consumers and businesses. They argue that increasing the debt reduces the government's ability to respond to future crises and could risk a "doom loop" of escalating interest rates and debt, forcing painful austerity measures. The White House disputes these projections, claiming economic growth will offset the costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts attribute the growth to the UK's lack of similar tariffs, the popularity of electric vehicles, and the competitive pricing and innovation of Chinese models. While this trend benefits consumers, some industry leaders have expressed concern about the ability of the UK's domestic auto industry to compete long-term.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton stated he can "dream of a strong weekend" after a competitive showing in Friday practice for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Driving for Ferrari, Hamilton finished third-fastest, closely behind McLaren's Lando Norris and his teammate Charles Leclerc, and ahead of championship leader Oscar Piastri. The performance was notable as both McLaren and Red Bull introduced upgrades for the race. Hamilton, who has a record nine wins at his home circuit, feels he is becoming more comfortable with the car, raising hopes for a positive result, though rain is forecast for the weekend.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, a prominent left-wing Member of Parliament, has announced her resignation from the Labour Party with the intention of launching a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. However, Corbyn's response suggested the plan was not finalized, stating that discussions for a "new kind of political party" are still ongoing. The move highlights a growing schism on the British left, with supporters believing there is significant space for a party to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour. Polling suggests such a party could capture 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be proscribed as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary block on the government's decision. The ban, which takes effect at midnight, will make it a criminal offense to be a member of or express support for the group, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group following an action claimed by Palestine Action that caused an estimated £7 million in damage to aircraft. The group's co-founder called the decision an "authoritarian abuse" of power and plans to appeal.</p>

This shift toward utility and infrastructure is driving institutional adoption, as firms value Ethereum's stability and security for handling financial transactions. Despite price volatility, the focus on building the back-end for global finance signals a new phase of maturation for the technology. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawmakers condemned the move as an "abuse of power" intended to hide potential human rights violations. The facility is a key part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, with officials hoping its harsh reputation will deter illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>As competitive eaters like Joey Chestnut consume massive quantities of food, health experts detail the potential short-term and long-term consequences. A 2007 study showed that a competitive eater's stomach can distend into a massive, food-filled sac with little ability to contract, which could lead to permanent stretching and impaired gastric emptying. Ingesting dozens of hot dogs also means consuming extreme levels of sodium and fat, which can spike blood pressure and cause gastrointestinal distress. While the long-term effects are not well-studied, immediate dangers include choking, esophageal tears, and even death.</p>
