          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 20:47:40 EDT</div>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy in Sacramento County, California, was taken into custody after allegedly stealing his parents' truck for a joyride to school, leading deputies on a brief pursuit through a residential neighborhood. The chase culminated in the boy crashing the truck into a patrol car and a parked vehicle, though thankfully, no one sustained injuries during the incident. Authorities are now determining the legal next steps in his juvenile case, as California law allows minors aged 12 and above to be held criminally responsible in juvenile court, with probation officers reviewing the police report and interviewing the family. This unusual event highlights the complexities of addressing youthful offenses and ensuring community safety while navigating the juvenile justice system's specific protocols and aims for rehabilitation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on Tuesday, reinstating the host after a suspension caused by his controversial jokes about conservative influencer Charlie Kirk's death. The network cited "thoughtful conversations" with Jimmy, acknowledging some comments were "ill-timed and insensitive" amidst a tense national climate regarding political discourse. This decision follows widespread debates over free speech, threats from the Federal Communications Commission to revoke ABC's broadcast license, and boycotts from major affiliate groups like Sinclair and Nexstar, which are still evaluating the show's potential return. The incident sparked significant backlash from critics and First Amendment advocates who viewed the initial suspension as an act of censorship and a violation of free expression.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani withdrew from a televised town hall hosted by a local ABC station, protesting the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel following FCC threats. Mamdani stated his withdrawal was a stand against corporate leaders prioritizing profits over free press, criticizing the perceived authoritarian pressure from the White House in the wake of Kimmel's comments. He emphasized the broader impact on free speech, not just for Jimmy but also for the engineers, writers, and musicians affected, sending a message that free speech is under threat. This action highlights the political fallout and public debate surrounding censorship and media independence.</p>

DHS labeled protesters as individuals who obstructed law enforcement, assaulted officers, and damaged property, disrupting an operation targeting convicted criminals including drug traffickers and domestic abusers. Governor Pritzker's office denied receiving multiple calls for assistance, emphasizing the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement and upholding constitutional rights to peaceful protest.

          <p>President Trump announced a significant increase in the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000, effective immediately for new applicants, up from previous fees of $2,000-$5,000. This controversial change aims to prioritize American workers and discourage perceived abuses of the program, though it has caused considerable confusion and concern within the tech and finance sectors heavily reliant on these skilled foreign professionals. The White House clarified it's a one-time fee for new visas, not renewals, with potential exceptions for employment deemed essential to national interest.

Critics argue the decentralized nature of Antifa, a loose anti-fascist movement, makes the designation legally complex and raises serious concerns about potential violations of free speech and assembly rights.

          <p>The Trump administration reportedly closed a federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, former "border czar," who was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents. Homan, a private citizen at the time, had boasted about a prominent role in a potential second Trump administration, promising to run the "biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen." The White House denied the allegations, calling the investigation "entrapment" and "weaponization of the Biden DOJ." This article highlights concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department and potential corruption within the administration's orbit, raising questions about accountability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration sanctioned Viviane Barci de Moraes, wife of Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, and revoked Solicitor-General Jorge Messias's visa, following the judge's sentencing of former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup. These actions, part of a "unilateral wave of attacks" against Brazil, were justified by the U.S. State Department as holding Moraes accountable for "abusing his authority" and "suppressing freedom of expression." Brazilian officials condemned the measures as attacks on international law, Brazil’s sovereignty, and judicial independence.

          <h2>Experts Detail Flimsy Evidence Behind Trump Administration's Tylenol-Autism Claims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critically examines the Trump administration's claims linking Tylenol use in pregnancy to autism, presenting a detailed scientific debunking of the evidence. It highlights that while some small studies suggested an association, the largest and most robust research, covering 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no such link, and medical groups still recommend acetaminophen as safe. Experts also clarify that the rise in autism diagnoses is largely due to increased public awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria, not a single environmental toxin. The article underscores concerns about misinformation and its potential to cause public alarm and distrust in scientific consensus.</p>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a Salvadoran journalist and founder of MG News, faces imminent deportation after the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened his 13-year-old case and denied his bond.

          <p>Immigration attorneys are advising H-1B visa holders to avoid international travel due to significant confusion surrounding the Trump administration's new $100,000 application fee for the visa. While the White House clarified the one-time fee applies only to new applicants, lawyers note "gray areas" for existing holders seeking renewals or employer changes who might travel abroad and face unexpected charges. This policy, aimed at prioritizing American workers, has caused considerable uncertainty for tech and financial industries. Experts warn of a "chilling effect" on skilled foreign workers and emphasize the urgent need for clearer official guidance from federal agencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a "Trump Gold Card" program, offering wealthy foreigners a fast track to permanent U.S. residency for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This new pathway, alongside changes to the H-1B program, targets high-net-worth individuals, with a potential $5 million "Platinum Card" tier for extended residency without U.S. income tax. Critics argue this initiative, intended to pay down national debt and promote industry, redefines the American dream by prioritizing financial capital over traditional qualifications.

          <p>NHS England has launched "Jess's Rule," urging General Practitioners (GPs) to re-evaluate diagnoses if a patient's symptoms persist or worsen after three appointments, aiming to prevent avoidable deaths. Named after Jessica Brady, who tragically died from advanced cancer at 27 after repeated misdiagnoses, the initiative encourages additional tests, second opinions from colleagues, or specialist referrals. Health Secretary Wes Streeting highlighted the rule's potential to significantly improve patient safety and catch deadly illnesses earlier across the country. This article underscores a new guideline designed to address diagnostic delays, particularly for younger and ethnic minority patients.</p>
