Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had hoped for a meeting with Putin himself to resolve critical issues but Putin did not agree.

The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation.

A Simion victory could trigger a crisis due to his pro-Russian stance and potential shift away from EU and NATO alignment. The election is seen as a historic decision with radical differences between candidates and deep societal divisions. While Simion has moderated his rhetoric, his anti-Ukrainian stance remains, and he lacks experience in governance. Dan represents a pro-European, rule-of-law approach, but faces challenges due to his association with the establishment.</p>

          <p>President Trump will speak with Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine following a Russian drone strike that killed nine civilians on a bus. He will also call Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and NATO leaders. This comes after fruitless talks in Istanbul. The Kremlin confirmed the call.
