          <p>Bobby Sherman, a teen idol known for his shaggy hair and hits like "Little Woman," has passed away at the age of 81 after battling Stage 4 cancer. Sherman rose to fame in the 1960s and 70s, appearing on magazines and television shows like "Shindig!" and "Here Come the Brides." After his music career, he became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, donating his salary. Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, providing education and healthcare to children in need, and is survived by his wife and two sons.

          <p>A Pentagon intelligence assessment indicates that US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities did not completely destroy the country's nuclear program, potentially setting it back only by months. The assessment, revealed to CBS, suggests that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was not eliminated in the bombings. The White House has disputed this assessment, calling it "flat-out wrong" and an attempt to undermine President Trump's claim that the strikes "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. This discrepancy highlights the ongoing debate and uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness and impact of the strikes on Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>French football club Lyon has been demoted to Ligue 2 due to financial difficulties, despite attempts to improve their situation through player sales and cost-cutting measures. The decision by the DNGC, the body overseeing French football clubs' accounts, was met with strong opposition from Lyon, who plan to appeal. The club argues that their proven funds and sporting success should guarantee their place in Ligue 1. Lyon's owner, John Textor, also owns stakes in Brazilian club Botafogo and Premier League club Crystal Palace, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest under UEFA rules.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter, driven by a 6% increase in U.S. daily package volume. The company announced it achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aims to reduce costs by an additional $1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. While FedEx's stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance falling slightly below expectations, the company's CEO expressed confidence in its transformation initiatives. FedEx is also planning to spin off its Freight division, and these results come shortly after the death of its founder and executive chairman, Fred Smith (not investment advice).</p>

A judge ruled that using legally purchased books for AI model training was "quintessentially transformative" and did not violate copyright law's "fair use" doctrine. However, Anthropic still faces a separate trial in December concerning the downloading of millions of pirated books, with employees expressing concerns about the legality of using pirate sites. The ruling sets a precedent for similar disputes, while the upcoming trial addresses the ethics of using illegally obtained data for AI training.</p>

          <h2>China's Concerns Over Israel-Iran Tensions</h2>

          <p>China is closely monitoring the war between Israel and Iran due to its status as the largest importer of Iranian oil and a close political partner of Tehran. Iran exports approximately 90% of its crude oil to China, despite U.S. sanctions. This trade relationship is crucial for Iran's economic survival, and China's government does not want Iran to fall. China transports Iranian oil via a "dark fleet" of ships and relies on smaller refineries to process the crude, while the situation has significant implications for global oil markets and geopolitical stability.</p>
