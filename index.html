          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. James Comer, has issued a subpoena to the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, demanding various documents and communications dating back to 1990. Among the materials sought is a leather-bound book reportedly compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday, which is said to contain a "bawdy" letter signed by former President Trump. This subpoena is part of an ongoing examination into the government's investigation of Epstein's activities and its enforcement of sex trafficking laws. Former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, who handled Epstein's 2008 non-prosecution agreement, is also scheduled to provide voluntary testimony to the committee.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie advanced to the second round of the US Open after his opponent, American Sebastian Korda, was forced to retire due to injury. Norrie was leading 7-5, 6-4 when Korda, who had recently returned to tour action following a shin stress fracture, ended the match, appearing to struggle with an abdominal issue. Norrie admitted to feeling "very nervous" before the match, especially against an opponent who had beaten him in three of their four previous encounters. He expressed sympathy for Korda's unfortunate early exit from the tournament.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's market value plunged by nearly $100 million after the company unveiled a new logo, sparking significant public backlash and a sharp stock decline. The redesign, which removed the long-standing "Uncle Herschel" character, was part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's strategy to modernize the 55-year-old chain's image. Conservative commentators and marketing experts widely criticized the new, cleaner design as "generic" and a betrayal of the brand's traditional, "down-home" aesthetic. The company later acknowledged that it "could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be," amidst accusations of going "woke."</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) announced an $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a strategic move aimed at revitalizing KDP's struggling U.S. coffee division. Following the announcement, KDP shares fell 11%, while JDE Peet's stock surged 15%. The acquisition, anticipated to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years, is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Keurig Dr Pepper plans to subsequently split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding their 2018 merger to create two focused entities.</p>

This statement follows the announcement of a partnership between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX to provide new coast-to-coast rail services. Consequently, CSX shares closed about 5% lower, and other railroad stocks also dipped as the prospect of a major takeover faded.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's memoir, "Nobody's Girl," is set for posthumous publication in October, months after her death by suicide at age 41. The 400-page book from Alfred A. Knopf will detail her personal story of sexual assault and her instrumental role in exposing the sex trafficking ring operated by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre's relentless pursuit of accountability helped send both abusers to prison and catalyzed Prince Andrew's fall from grace. The memoir promises to reveal how she fought to extricate herself from the abuse and sought justice for herself and other victims.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are pricing in a near-certainty of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, influenced by Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks at Jackson Hole. However, investor caution emerged regarding the pace of subsequent cuts, with much less certainty for further reductions in October or December. Experts from firms like Morgan Stanley express skepticism, citing persistent tariff-induced inflation and a resilient economy, questioning the urgency for aggressive easing. Concerns also linger about potential unintended consequences, drawing parallels to last year's bond market reaction to rate cuts, which could undermine White House hopes for lower financing costs.

          <p>This article details the severe consequences for homeowners aged 62 and older who fail to meet their reverse mortgage obligations, such as paying property taxes, insurance premiums, or maintenance costs. Default can trigger an acceleration clause, making the entire loan balance immediately due and payable, potentially leading to swift foreclosure proceedings. Furthermore, missed obligations can result in liens against the home and negatively impact credit scores, making future financing difficult. Despite these risks, reverse mortgages can still be a valuable tool for "house-rich but cash-poor" retirees if managed diligently and proactively to avoid financial distress.</p>

          <p>President Trump held his first meeting with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, at the White House, where he expressed a desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again in the future. Discussions also centered on the US-South Korean trade deal and Trump's call for the US to take ownership of land for its military bases in South Korea, urging increased financial contributions. Hours prior, Trump had issued vague social media criticisms about a "purge or revolution" in South Korea, later referencing "vicious raids on churches" by the new government, which he walked back as a potential misunderstanding. Despite initial tensions, the leaders appeared amicable during their public remarks, with Lee praising Trump's peacemaking efforts.</p>

The Emigrant Fire is estimated at 1,200 acres and burning on steep slopes within a previous fire scar, while the Sugar Loaf Fire is 15 acres. Firefighters are actively responding, but extreme heat, persistent air quality issues, and the threat of new thunderstorms with erratic winds are complicating containment efforts.

          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce a Relief Pitcher of the Year award for both the American and National Leagues, starting in the 2026 season. The Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA) established these new honors to recognize the increasingly vital and evolving role of relief pitchers, who have historically been underrepresented in major awards like MVP and Cy Young. This development acknowledges the strategic shift in modern baseball, where closers and setup relievers play crucial roles in team success. The award aims to properly celebrate their significant contributions to the game.</p>

          <p>Stephen Nakagawa, a choreographer and former dancer with The Washington Ballet, has been named the new Director of Dance Programming at the Kennedy Center. This appointment comes just days after the entire staff of the renowned performing arts institution's dance department was fired. The former director, Jane Raleigh, alleged her dismissal was in retaliation for her public support of a union organizing campaign earlier this year. Nakagawa's professional biography does not mention prior experience as a curator or arts administrator, making his ascension to this high-profile management position unusual amidst the internal turmoil.</p>

This trade policy, which allowed goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, was terminated by a Trump executive order for global imports, having already ended for China and Hong Kong. The carriers cited unprepared systems and unresolved questions regarding new customs requirements as reasons for the pause, which will primarily impact smaller European businesses and e-commerce flows, though major international commerce is expected to be unaffected.</p>
