          <p>China has responded to President Trump's accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement by claiming that the U.S. is the one undermining the consensus. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that the U.S. has been unilaterally provoking new economic and trade frictions, increasing uncertainty in bilateral relations. This comes after the Trump administration imposed export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, as well as announcing the revocation of visas for Chinese students, which Beijing views as actions that "seriously undermine" the Geneva deal. China vows to take measures to safeguard its rights and benefits if the U.S. continues to damage its interests. (not investment advice)</p>

As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda.

Russia confirmed Ukrainian attacks in five regions, calling them a "terrorist act." President Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the operation, striking "34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers." The attacks come as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are heading to Istanbul for a second round of peace talks. </p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was charged with voting illegally while attending the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S. Gao admitted to registering and voting in the 2024 general election, but later missed court hearings and boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. He has been federally charged with flight to avoid prosecution, although the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The case highlights the rare instances of noncitizens voting in federal elections.</p>

While citizens generally don't face issues upon return, residents can be scrutinized, especially if they've been abroad for over six months or have a criminal record. Residents are technically asking for permission to re-enter the U.S., while only citizens have an inherent right to return. Individuals with DACA or TPS status also face risks, as advance parole authorizations may be subject to immigration officer discretion.</p>

University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation.</p>
