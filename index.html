          <p>Journalism secured a victory at the 150th Preakness Stakes, triumphing over Gosger and Sandman, marking a significant achievement for jockey Umberto Rispoli, the first Italian jockey to win a Triple Crown race, and trainer Michael McCarthy. The absence of Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty set the stage for a Journalism-Sovereignty rematch at the Belmont Stakes. The race was held on a warm day, which suited Journalism, drying the track after heavy rains. This event marks the last Preakness at the historic Pimlico Race Course before its scheduled demolition and reconstruction, with plans to relocate the race to Laurel Park temporarily before returning to the rebuilt Pimlico in 2027.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day into night and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was caused by thunderstorms generating winds up to 70 mph, lifting dust from dry farmland. Visibility dropped dramatically, affecting major highways and Chicago Midway International Airport. This is the first time the Weather Service office in Romeoville has issued a dust storm warning for Chicago, recalling a similar event during the Dust Bowl era in 1934. The dry soil conditions in central Illinois contributed to the severity of the storm, classified as a haboob.</p>

This move has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it promotes a distorted view of history and lacks proper review. While some teachers express concern about the potential for misinformation, others believe effective teachers can still instruct students about the election results accurately.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU. The scheme would allow young people to work abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis, but specific details regarding age eligibility and numbers are yet to be determined. Critics, including Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, have described the proposal as “free movement through the back door,” which Starmer denies. An agreement is expected to be announced at a summit in London, although it will only be an agreement in principle.</p>

The Mosura's body included 16 segments lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods, indicating a more complex structure than previously known in radiodonts.
