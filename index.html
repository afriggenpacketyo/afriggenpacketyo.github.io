          <p>UNESCO has designated the Western Xia imperial mausoleums in China's Ningxia region as a World Heritage site. The 40-square-kilometer area includes nine imperial tombs and over 270 subordinate graves from the Tangut-ruled dynasty (1038–1227). Located west of Yinchuan, the site is recognized for its historical significance as a testament to the cultural fusion and interactions along the ancient Silk Road. The World Heritage Committee noted the site's unique value in representing the lost civilization of the Western Xia.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the Air India crash that killed 261 people reveals the plane's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position moments after takeoff from Ahmedabad. This action starved the engines of fuel, causing a total power loss. Cockpit recordings captured one pilot questioning the other about the action, which was denied. The Boeing 787 crashed less than a minute after becoming airborne, impacting a nearby building and killing 19 people on the ground in addition to the 242 on board.</p>

          <p>Russian forces conducted a large-scale overnight attack across Ukraine, launching nearly 600 drones and over two dozen cruise missiles. The strikes killed at least two people in Chernivtsi and injured approximately 20 others, with targets ranging from the eastern Kharkiv region to Lviv in the west. Ukrainian defenses successfully intercepted 319 drones and 25 missiles, while an additional 258 drones were suppressed by electronic warfare. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks and reiterated his call for more robust international sanctions and air-defense systems.</p>

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is carefully managing its relationship with the United States under the Trump administration as it aims for victory in the 2027 presidential election. While ideologically aligned on some issues, the party maintains a distance due to French public skepticism towards Trump and potential negative economic impacts from US tariffs. Analysts suggest the party, led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, is pursuing a strategy of moderation to attract mainstream voters. This contrasts with other European far-right leaders who have more openly embraced ties with Washington.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to introduce a quota limiting the number of students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has sparked a national debate. The suggestion, which floated a cap of 30-40%, aims to address educational challenges in schools with high proportions of non-native German speakers. Critics, including school principals and student organizations, argue the policy is discriminatory, stigmatizing, and logistically unfeasible. Proponents suggest it could create better-mixed learning environments, though many agree the core issue is language proficiency, not origin.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to halt immigration enforcement tactics deemed unconstitutional in several Southern California counties. The ruling bars federal agents from conducting stops based solely on factors like a person's apparent race, their accent, or their presence at certain locations like day laborer sites. The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups, which accused agents of racial profiling and other rights violations. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims.</p>

          <h2>Judge Allows Voice Artists' Lawsuit Against AI Startup Lovo to Proceed</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to create and sell AI-generated voice clones without their consent. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to the AI's training data will proceed. The decision is seen as a significant step for artists seeking to hold AI companies accountable for unauthorized use of their work.</p>

          <h2>Cockpit Audio and Fuel Switch Design Deepen Mystery of Air India Crash</h2>

          <p>An analysis of the preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash highlights the central mystery of why the fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position. The cockpit audio, where one pilot denies cutting the fuel, has left investigators puzzled about whether the action was intentional, accidental, or the result of a system malfunction. This article also noted a 2018 safety bulletin about the design of similar switches, raising questions about a potential mechanical or electronic fault. Experts say a full transcript and voice identification are crucial to understanding the sequence of events that led to the catastrophic dual-engine failure.</p>
