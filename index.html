          <h2>Poll Indicates Voters Concerned About Trump's Executive Power</h2>

          <p>A recent New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters are increasingly worried about President Trump's expansion of executive power and express reservations about key aspects of his agenda. The poll indicates that many voters, even those who approve of Trump's performance, view his administration's early months as "chaotic" and "scary." Additionally, confidence in Trump's handling of critical issues like the economy and immigration is waning, with only 43% approving of his economic management, signaling a significant decline in what was once considered a strength. This poll highlights growing unease among voters regarding Trump's leadership and policy direction.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge, Hannah Dugan, was arrested and charged with obstruction for allegedly assisting an undocumented immigrant in evading arrest by immigration agents. The FBI accused Judge Dugan of intentionally misdirecting agents away from the individual, who was wanted on a warrant related to misdemeanor battery charges. Dugan's lawyer protested the arrest, while reactions to the event split along partisan lines, with Democrats criticizing the move as an attack on the judicial system and Republicans emphasizing the importance of cooperating with law enforcement. The judge faces a potential sentence of six years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on China unless they offer something "substantial" in return, indicating a continued hardline stance in trade negotiations. Trump specified that he wants China to further open its markets to U.S. businesses and products, emphasizing the need for a more equitable trading relationship. He recalled a previous deal where China had agreed to open its markets, but later backed out, highlighting the challenges in reaching a lasting agreement. These comments suggest that the U.S. is prepared to maintain pressure on China until significant concessions are made.</p>

          <p>DoorDash has requested a California judge to dismiss Uber's anticompetition lawsuit, arguing that Uber is misusing state law to support its claims. The lawsuit centers on white-label delivery services, which both companies offer to restaurant chains, allowing them to integrate delivery ordering into their own websites. Uber alleges that DoorDash employs coercive tactics, such as threatening penalties for restaurants that don't exclusively use its white-label service, stifling competition. DoorDash denies these allegations, asserting that it competes fairly and that merchants have a choice of providers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that creatine, a common weightlifting supplement, may offer benefits in treating depression due to its role in brain energy metabolism. A recent study in India found that participants receiving creatine alongside talk therapy showed greater improvement in depression symptoms compared to those receiving therapy alone. Creatine helps the brain convert nutrients into energy, and scientists hypothesize that improving brain metabolism could ease depression. While more research is needed, the affordability and accessibility of creatine make it a promising area for further exploration in mental health treatment.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made an unannounced trip to the southern border amid scrutiny in Washington. The trip comes as Hegseth faces accusations of accusing top-ranking military officers of leaking to the news media and threatening to polygraph them. Additionally, reports indicate Hegseth used the Signal app on a personal computer connected to the internet on an unsecured commercial line. A Pentagon spokesman called that report "fake news."</p>

          <p>China is reportedly considering lifting sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what is viewed as a diplomatic effort to improve relations with the EU amidst global uncertainties. The sanctions were initially imposed in 2021 after the EU sanctioned Chinese officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. While it is unclear if all restrictions will be lifted, the move could facilitate future talks and trade discussions between China and the EU. However, Brussels has stated that it will maintain its sanctions on Chinese officials due to ongoing concerns about human rights in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a toy business with 500 employees, is suing President Trump over his administration's sweeping tariff policies, arguing they are catastrophic for his business and the U.S. economy. The lawsuit claims that Trump is overreaching his authority in imposing broad-based import duties, which are set to increase the company's import duties from $2.3 million to $100 million. Woldenberg expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year due to the tariffs' economic impact, and he is seeking to shift manufacturing out of China to mitigate the effects.</p>
