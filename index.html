          <p>Syrian political activist Shadi Martini addressed Israel's parliament, conveying a message from Syria's transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa urging swift action on a peace deal. The message highlights a rare opportunity for normalization, regional security, and economic prosperity, though unresolved issues like the Golan Heights and the Palestinian situation remain. This initiative, reportedly encouraged by former President Donald Trump, signals a potential shift in regional dynamics, with Martini noting that many in Syria now see peace as necessary for stability and investment. The visit is seen as a historic moment, aiming to clarify Syria's position directly to Israeli lawmakers.</p>

          <p>The UK will begin returning some migrants who arrive in small boats to France within weeks under a new "one in, one out" pilot program. For each migrant returned, the UK will accept a verified asylum seeker from France, aiming to disrupt the business model of people smugglers. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, announced the plan, stating it would demonstrate that illegal crossings are futile. While details on selection criteria are pending, the scheme is part of a broader collaboration that also includes coordinating nuclear deterrents and AI development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high above $113,000, driven by a broader investor shift into risk assets and significant short liquidations. Over $318 million in short positions were liquidated in a 24-hour period, which fueled the upward price momentum. The rally also lifted other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana, and boosted crypto-related stocks like Coinbase and Riot Platforms. This price action follows weeks of consolidation and is supported by strong inflows into bitcoin ETFs and large purchases by public companies, indicating sustained institutional interest.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to expand the service area for its robotaxi program in Austin, Texas, and integrate the xAI chatbot, Grok, into Tesla vehicles. The announcement comes as Musk navigates a turbulent period, including a public feud with President Trump and the recent departure of X CEO Linda Yaccarino. The integration of Grok follows controversy over the chatbot's recent antisemitic posts, with an updated version, Grok 4, being rolled out. These developments occur amid investor concerns over slowing sales and the potential impact of Musk's political conflicts on his companies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is suing California over Proposition 12, a voter-approved law that mandates cage-free conditions for hens, pigs, and calves. The lawsuit claims the state's animal welfare standards violate federal law, interfere with interstate commerce, and have contributed to rising egg prices. California's governor and attorney general have vowed to defend the law, which was previously upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2023. Animal welfare advocates and some California egg producers argue that overturning the law would be disruptive and economically damaging after farmers already invested millions to comply.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Madrid to New York was forced to divert to an island in the Azores after experiencing a mechanical issue with one of its engines. The plane, carrying 282 customers and 13 crew members, landed safely on the Portuguese island group in the Atlantic Ocean. Passengers were provided with hotel accommodations and meals overnight while technicians addressed the issue. A replacement aircraft was sent to transport the passengers and crew to New York the following day. Delta has apologized for the delay and will offer compensation to the affected customers.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can move forward to trial. Lemon sued X for breach of contract after the platform abruptly canceled a planned show partnership just hours after Lemon conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's legal team had plausibly alleged claims including "fraud by false promise" and the existence of an "implied contract." The lawsuit stems from the cancellation of Lemon's show, which was set to premiere on the platform before the partnership was terminated.</p>

          <p>Provisions within President Trump's recent budget bill have expanded access to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), a powerful, tax-advantaged tool for managing medical costs. The new law broadens eligibility for several groups, including all individuals enrolled in bronze and catastrophic health plans on the ACA marketplace. It also confirms that people using direct primary care services or those in high-deductible plans that cover telehealth before the deductible is met can contribute to an HSA. These changes make the triple-tax-advantaged accounts available to millions more Americans for healthcare spending and long-term investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling more than 850,000 vehicles in the U.S., including popular models like the F-150, Bronco, and Explorer, due to a faulty low-pressure fuel pump. According to the recall notice filed with federal regulators, the pump can fail during use, potentially causing the engine to stall and increasing the risk of a crash. Warning signs may include rough engine performance or a "check engine" light. The recall affects various Ford and Lincoln models from the 2021-2023 model years. Ford has not yet developed a remedy but will notify owners starting in mid-July.</p>

          <p>To mark its third anniversary, NASA has released breathtaking new images from the James Webb Space Telescope showing a star-forming region within the Cat's Paw Nebula. The telescope's infrared camera peered through gas and dust to reveal young, yellow-hued stars actively shaping their cosmic environment, about 4,000 light-years from Earth. The images also show glowing red spots where new stars are being born and dense brown filaments of dust that could collapse to form future stars. These images demonstrate the telescope's continued success in revealing previously hidden aspects of the universe.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods, disaster preparedness experts are sharing crucial safety advice. Before a storm, it is vital to understand your home's flood risk, create a household evacuation plan, and pack a "go bag" with essentials. During a flood, the primary goal is to get to higher ground immediately and never attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches of moving water can sweep a person away. If trapped in a car, escape through a window before it is submerged. After the storm, wait for the all-clear from authorities before returning home.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. goods if the Trump administration proceeds with its plan to levy a 50% duty on Brazilian exports. The move sets the stage for a potential trade war between the two major economies. President Trump's threat was linked to his accusation that Brazil is conducting a "witch-hunt" against former president Jair Bolsonaro. President Lula stated that Brazil would invoke its "Reciprocity Law" to defend its economy and that Trump's claim of an unbalanced economic relationship is inaccurate, escalating the dispute.</p>
