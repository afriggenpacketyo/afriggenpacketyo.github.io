          <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, a pro-Palestinian group, reported that Israeli troops boarded its aid vessel, the Handala, while it was in international waters attempting to deliver food to Gaza. The Israeli foreign ministry confirmed it stopped the boat to prevent a breach of the maritime blockade, stating all passengers are safe and the vessel is being brought to Israel. The activist group described the incident as a "kidnapping" of the 19 activists and two journalists on board. The boat was reportedly carrying baby formula for the besieged territory.</p>

          <p>With England in the Euro 2025 final, an article explores the intense physical and emotional reactions fans experience during tense sporting events. Psychologists explain that hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge, causing increased heart rates and a "fight or flight" response, which is a normal sign of deep investment in the outcome. To manage the stress, experts advise getting good rest, having a clear match day plan, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. They also emphasize reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system over the Pacific, which has led to persistent cloud cover and increased coastal upwelling of cold ocean water. While not record-breaking, the weather pattern is the most sustained of its kind in 20 to 30 years. The cool, gray conditions are expected to continue, though experts caution that the region's hottest weather often occurs in September and October.</p>

Stafford, 37, has not practiced since camp opened and will now be evaluated on a week-to-week basis, with no clear timeline for his return. The issue is reminiscent of a 2022 injury that sidelined him for the final seven games of that season.

While the authorization does not trigger an immediate walkout, it strengthens the union's position ahead of contract negotiations scheduled for late July.
