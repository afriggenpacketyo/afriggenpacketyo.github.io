          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, has been released following negotiations facilitated by the U.S. The International Committee of the Red Cross transferred Alexander to Israeli authorities, and he spoke with his mother, Yael, who assured him of his safety and homecoming. Alexander, a New Jersey native serving in the IDF, was captured during the Hamas attack on his base near the Gaza frontier. His release is celebrated by supporters in Tel Aviv and New Jersey, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanking President Donald Trump for his role in securing Alexander's freedom.</p>

          <p>Following a US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed a strong response to any future "terrorist attack" against India. This statement comes after days of intense military exchanges, triggered by a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. Modi also addressed the suspension of a water treaty, stating that "water and blood cannot flow together," and remarked that "terror and trade talks cannot happen together," referencing President Trump's condition for trade relations. Top military officials from both countries discussed the ceasefire details, agreeing to refrain from aggressive actions and consider troop reduction from the borders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariff receipts hit a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Donald Trump's trade war measures. This figure represents an 86% increase from March and more than double the amount collected a year prior. The surge in tariff revenue helped to reduce the budget deficit for April, which totaled $258.4 billion, a 23% increase from the previous year. However, high interest rates continue to pose a significant budgetary burden, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion in April.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a dual Israeli-American national, was released by Hamas following pressure from President Trump, who is set to travel to the region. Mediators brokered a deal between Hamas and the United States, largely bypassing the Israeli government. Alexander's release comes on the eve of Trump's visit to the Middle East and is seen by Hamas officials as an attempt to secure U.S. support for a wider deal to end the war. Unlike most other hostages, Alexander was released without a formally announced cease-fire, highlighting the failure of efforts to secure a broader truce between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's mass-deportation campaign is facing eroding public support as attention shifts from border control to ICE enforcement within U.S. communities. Recent incidents involving ICE officers arresting immigrants without criminal records have drawn criticism, with some comparing the tactics to those of authoritarian regimes. Polls show declining approval for Trump's handling of immigration, particularly regarding the deportation of immigrants with ties to U.S. citizens or those who came to the U.S. as children. Political scientists attribute the slump in Trump‚Äôs approval to the ‚Äúthermostatic‚Äù effect of bold executive action that generates backlash.</p>

According to the Chinese public, negotiators from Beijing convinced President Trump's administration to slash the 145% tariff rate to 30%.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to raise the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, as part of President Donald Trump's tax and spending package. The current SALT deduction limit, enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is $10,000 and is set to expire after 2025. Raising the SALT cap has been a priority for lawmakers from high-tax states.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced tighter British immigration rules, aiming to end what he calls a "failed experiment in open borders." The new rules will make it harder to obtain work, family, and student visas to the United Kingdom. Migrant rights advocates have criticized Starmer's language as being more typical of the far-right. The changes are intended to maintain social cohesion, drive investment in the local workforce, and prevent Britain from becoming "an island of strangers."</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China's trade deal, which includes a pause on the steepest tariffs, is expected to lead to a surge in freight shipments from China to the U.S. This surge is anticipated to drive up container rates due to pent-up demand. While the reduced tariffs may help small businesses, the uncertainty surrounding the trade policy continues to pose challenges. The peak shipping season will likely be extended into the third quarter, and consumers may face higher prices for goods.</p>
