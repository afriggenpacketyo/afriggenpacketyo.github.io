          <p>A parliamentary enquiry committee is investigating a French billionaire, Pierre-Edouard Sterin, for investing millions in far-right initiatives through his Pericles project. The project supports entities like far-right magazine L'Incorrect and the Observatory for Decolonization, which denounces left-wing ideologies. Other billionaires, such as Vincent Bollore, are also accused of wielding influence through media ownership, spreading far-right narratives. Lawmakers are considering countermeasures to prevent undue influence, while some argue that exposing these projects is sufficient to combat their effects. Optimism is limited given the potential for democratic subversion and the historical precedents of business leaders cooperating with authoritarian regimes.</p>

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning to visit the United States for further talks, aiming to reach common ground before a potential summit between the two countries' leaders. The negotiations come amid concerns over new tariffs imposed by the U.S. President, with Japan seeking concessions. Separately, Taiwan reported that China sent a large number of vessels to the Western Pacific in May, demonstrating its ability to control the sea area connecting Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. These military actions add to regional tensions. The article also reports on various domestic events in Japan, including the retirement of former yokozuna Hakuho and considerations for Taiwan's request to attend the Nagasaki A-bomb ceremony.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lending experts suggest homeowners consider home equity loans and HELOCs as cost-effective borrowing options due to lower interest rates compared to credit cards and personal loans. They advise locking in promotional rates for short-term needs like home upgrades that add immediate value, comparing multiple lenders to find low or no-fee deals, and prioritizing high-ROI home improvements. Experts also suggest that setting up a HELOC now could be beneficial, even without immediate needs, as a flexible financial safety net, and to weigh the advantages and drawbacks of HELOCs and home equity loans. Using home equity responsibly can be valuable for consolidating debt, funding high-return investments, or improving monthly cash flow (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to review a challenge to Maryland's ban on assault weapons, preserving a lower court's decision that upheld the law. The ban, enacted after the Sandy Hook shooting, prohibits the possession, sale, or transfer of certain semiautomatic rifles and copycat weapons. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented from the decision. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ruled that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned because they fall outside the scope of the Second Amendment. This decision maintains the status quo in Maryland and nine other states with similar restrictions.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court's Environmental Rulings Show Potential Double Standard</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Supreme Court decision in *Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County* limits environmental litigation, potentially hindering infrastructure development. The ruling emphasizes deference to government decisions, but this deference seems selective, favoring projects that downplay environmental harms. The Court's skepticism toward environmental regulation contrasts with its strict scrutiny of agencies seeking to protect the environment. This mismatch suggests a partisan approach, where environmental protection is viewed with suspicion. The decision could undermine environmental safeguards and reflect a biased application of administrative law.</p>

Short-term CDs, such as six-month to one-year terms, currently offer higher interest rates due to the inverted yield curve, making them an attractive option.

Resumed orders could be viewed by Beijing as leverage in broader trade talks.

          <p>A certified financial planner notes that the most common financial mistake young adults in their 20s make is increasing their lifestyle expenses in proportion to, or even beyond, their income increases. Many young adults tend to make lifestyle changes, such as buying new cars or renting nicer apartments, as soon as they receive their first paycheck or a promotion. This behavior can hinder their ability to save, especially for retirement. The expert suggests maintaining a consistent standard of living, or only slightly increasing it, to prioritize saving for the future. (not investment advice)</p>
