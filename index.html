          <p>The Colombian navy seized an unmanned semi-submersible vessel believed to be used for drug trafficking. The drone sub, equipped with a Starlink antenna, was reportedly owned by the Gulf Clan cartel and was likely on a test run. This discovery highlights a technological escalation by cartels, using unmanned systems to reduce risks for human operators and evade detection by authorities. The use of such technology makes it more difficult for law enforcement to trace the shipments back to cartel leaders.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin, just days after the U.S. paused some weapons shipments to Ukraine. The decision to halt aid, which included missiles and ammunition, was based on a Pentagon review of U.S. military stockpiles and an "America First" agenda. This move has drawn criticism from figures like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned that letting Russia win would be a disaster for American security. The call underscores ongoing diplomatic complexities in the fourth year of Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A man in his 50s has died in New South Wales, Australia, after being infected with Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a rare rabies-like virus. The infection occurred several months after he was bitten by a bat, marking only the fourth confirmed human case in Australia since 1996, all of which have been fatal. Health officials emphasized that there is no effective treatment for ABLV once symptoms appear and urged the public to avoid handling bats.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that seniors should reassess their life insurance policies to ensure they align with their current needs amid shifting economic conditions. Key questions include whether coverage is still necessary, what type of policy is most suitable, and how it fits into their overall estate plan. With changes in family structure, financial obligations, and goals, policies purchased years ago may no longer be optimal. Professionals recommend reviewing coverage annually and considering options like trusts to avoid potential issues for beneficiaries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Montana, letting a lower court's decision that blocked a parental consent law for minors seeking abortions stand. The 2013 law, which has never been enforced, required notarized written consent from a parent before a minor could have an abortion. The Montana Supreme Court had previously ruled the law unconstitutional under the state's right to privacy. In a separate statement, Justices Alito and Thomas noted that the denial of review should not be seen as a rejection of the legal arguments, calling the case a "poor vehicle" to decide the issue.</p>

          <p>The BBC has required several senior staff members to step back from their duties following the live broadcast of a controversial Glastonbury performance by the punk duo Bob Vylan. During their set, the band led a chant of "death to the IDF" and made other derogatory remarks, which were streamed on iPlayer. The BBC acknowledged it was an "error of judgement" not to cut the live feed, which had been flagged as "high risk." The corporation has apologized, particularly to the Jewish community, and announced immediate changes to its live-streaming protocols.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed President Trump's "big, beautiful" bill, a major domestic policy package, after a contentious overnight session where party leaders secured the votes of Republican holdouts. The legislation, which extends tax cuts from his first term and makes significant cuts to social safety net programs, now heads to the president's desk. Democrats were united in their opposition, criticizing the bill for benefiting the wealthy and potentially causing millions to lose health insurance. The passage marks a significant legislative victory for the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans are traveling for the July 4th holiday, but they are finding lower airfares compared to previous years. Domestic round-trip flights are averaging $265, the cheapest since 2021, as airlines grapple with an oversupply of flights and softer-than-expected demand. Several major airlines have cut their 2025 forecasts due to economic uncertainty and have planned to reduce unprofitable flights after the summer season. While international travel from the U.S. remains a strong point, even those fares have begun to ease. (not investment advice)</p>

Listeria can cause a serious infection, particularly for pregnant individuals, newborns, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems. While no illnesses have been confirmed, consumers are urged to discard the products or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

          <p>The cost for the UK government to borrow money has fallen, partially reversing a spike caused by political uncertainty. The yield on 10-year government bonds decreased after Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who had become emotional in Parliament. Market analysts suggest investors fear that if Reeves were to leave her position, fiscal discipline would weaken, leading to larger deficits. The stabilization provided some reassurance to financial markets, although concerns remain about the government's fiscal plans. (not investment advice)</p>
