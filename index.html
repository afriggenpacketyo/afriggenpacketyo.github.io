          <p>Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, has unveiled its first electric SUV, the YU7, setting its sights on Tesla's Model Y in the Chinese market. The YU7 boasts a claimed driving range of at least 760 kilometers on a single charge, surpassing the advertised range of Tesla's Model Y. Citi analysts predict that the YU7, expected to be priced competitively, could significantly erode Tesla's market share in China, with forecasted monthly sales of around 30,000 units and annual sales potentially reaching 300,000 to 360,000 units. The official launch, where the price will be announced, is planned for July.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner swap involving hundreds of soldiers, occurring shortly after Moscow initiated a large-scale aerial assault on Ukrainian territory. The exchange, the largest of the war, was part of a three-part agreement resulting from recent peace talks in Istanbul. Despite this moment of cooperation, the exchange occurred amidst escalating violence, including a significant drone and missile attack by Russia targeting Kyiv and other regions, resulting in casualties and infrastructure damage.

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to major retailers in an effort to reduce soaring rice prices. The move comes after public criticism of the government's previous ineffectiveness in preventing rice prices from rapidly increasing, and the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, aims to bring prices down to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through these contracts, bypassing the auction system that farming cooperatives primarily used. The public seems optimistic about the new measures, as a recent poll indicated that nearly 60% of respondents believe Koizumi can successfully lower rice prices.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which challenged the narrative of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has died at the age of 97. The film, released in 1969, interviewed ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand to reveal the complexities of collaboration and resistance during World War II, sparking controversy and debate upon its release. Despite directing other documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," "The Sorrow and the Pity" remained his most influential work, prompting a reevaluation of France's wartime history.</p>

          <p>Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the reality television show "Duck Dynasty" and founder of the Duck Commander duck-call business, has died at the age of 79. His death was confirmed by his son Jase Robertson, though a cause was not specified; Jase had previously mentioned his father's early-stage Alzheimer's and other health issues. Robertson's duck hunting gear business became the central premise for "Duck Dynasty," which ran for 11 seasons and gained a wide audience due to its humor and the family's Christian faith. The show courted controversy in 2013 when Robertson made comments deemed offensive to gay people, leading to a brief suspension.</p>

          <p>Businesses are using a legal workaround known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs, which has been around since 1988 but is gaining renewed attention. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the overseas producer to an intermediary, rather than the inflated price from the vendor to the U.S. retailer. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. While it requires trust and transparency between parties, the potential cost savings make it worthwhile, particularly for higher-value consumer goods and luxury products.</p>

Unlike traditional offshore net-pen systems, the Su Hai No 1 can relocate to safer waters to avoid adverse conditions, and it features an onboard processing facility for rapid delivery of fresh salmon.

The Carter Center found that count to be accurate.

The change in language from Israel’s international allies is remarkable.

          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism has discovered that sleep helps the brain clear out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research elucidates how hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), a metabolic by-product, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. The study confirmed that when H₂O₂ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative sleep. Excess buildup of free radicals can disrupt sleep quality and spark inflammation, which offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases.</p>

The bomber was shot down off the coast of New Guinea in 1944, killing all 11 men aboard, with their remains designated as non-recoverable. A remarkable investigation by family members and a recovery mission by Navy divers led to the retrieval of remains, dog tags, and personal items. The return of these soldiers brings closure to families who have waited decades for answers and allows them to finally lay their loved ones to rest.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expressing deep concern over "unilateral tariff measures" at their meeting in Malaysia. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim noted that the global trading system is under strain due to recent U.S. tariffs, which range from 10 to 49 percent on ASEAN members. The leaders warn that these tariffs pose complex challenges to ASEAN's economic growth, stability, and integration, and they reaffirm their commitment to a multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core.</p>

          <p>U.S. futures saw a jump while Asian shares mostly declined after President Trump announced he would delay a threatened 50% tariff on goods from the European Union to July 9. The delay came after discussions with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious negotiations. Trump's decision to delay tariffs provided some relief to markets, but concerns remain about the ongoing trade tensions. However, Trump warned that a tariff “of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” if it doesn’t move production of iPhones to the United States.</p>

          <p>North Korea has arrested a fourth official, Ri Hyong Son, following the failed launch of a new navy warship, as reported by state media.
