          <p>Thousands gathered in central London for a march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, promoting his "Unite the Kingdom" rally focused on free speech. A significant police presence was deployed to manage the event and a counter-protest held by the "March Against Fascism" group. The Metropolitan Police established a sterile area to keep the two demonstrations separate, citing concerns over Robinson's history of anti-Muslim rhetoric. The counter-protesters carried signs opposing the far-right and welcoming refugees.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, marking a return to large-scale sporting events in the city post-pandemic. However, the event is shadowed by controversy due to the reimposition of mandatory gene testing for female athletes to detect the SRY gene, typically found in males. World Athletics defends the policy as necessary for protecting women's sport, but critics argue the test is unreliable and discriminatory. This has sparked debate amid ongoing "culture wars" surrounding the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, has been taken into custody for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described as a targeted political assassination, occurred during an outdoor debate event. Investigators used video footage and social media messages to track the suspect, who allegedly fired a single shot from a high-powered rifle from a nearby building's roof. The suspect's father reportedly recognized him from police photos and encouraged him to surrender, leading to his arrest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy is showing signs of heading towards stagflation, a rare combination of stagnant growth and rising inflation, a scenario not seen since the 1970s. Economists are pointing to the Trump administration's policies, including tariffs and immigration crackdowns, as key drivers behind stalled job growth and increasing prices. This economic condition complicates the Federal Reserve's ability to manage the economy, as traditional tools like interest rate adjustments are less effective when both unemployment and inflation are concerns.

          <p>A group of scientists is advocating for Chagas disease, spread by "kissing bugs," to be officially treated as an endemic disease in the U.S. to increase awareness and improve diagnosis. The parasitic illness, traditionally associated with Latin America, is already present within the country, with infections documented in at least eight states. While many infected individuals show no initial symptoms, about 20-30% can later develop serious chronic heart or digestive problems, making early detection and treatment crucial for preventing long-term damage.</p>

          <p>According to travel experts at Google Flights, the single most effective strategy for securing affordable airfare is maintaining flexibility with travel dates. Flying midweek—specifically on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays—is generally cheaper than traveling on weekends, with potential savings of around 13-14%. The article debunks the myth that the day of the week you book a flight matters significantly, emphasizing instead that the day you fly is the crucial factor. Traveling during a destination's off-season or shoulder season can also lead to substantial savings.</p>

          <h2>California Ballot Measure Explicitly Cites Texas in Bid to Redraw Congressional Maps</h2>

          <p>California voters will decide on a ballot measure that seeks to temporarily bypass the state's independent redistricting commission to create more favorable congressional districts for Democrats. Unusually, the measure's official title directly references Texas's recent partisan redistricting as its justification, framing the move as a necessary response to the GOP's efforts to gain seats. This explicitly partisan and reactive approach is seen by experts as an extremely rare strategy in ballot initiatives, highlighting the escalating national battle over gerrymandering and its impact on control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>As teenagers increasingly use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, experts are urging parents to engage in open conversations about the technology's benefits and risks. Parents are encouraged to learn about AI alongside their children, co-create household rules for its use, and teach critical thinking skills like fact-checking AI-generated information. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, research also shows it can provide unsafe responses to sensitive topics like self-harm, making parental guidance essential for responsible usage.</p>

          <p>A growing number of small colleges across the U.S., such as Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding or reinstating football programs as a strategy to boost enrollment, particularly among men. With women now outnumbering men 60% to 40% at four-year colleges, administrators hope that the sport, along with marching bands and cheerleading, will create a more vibrant campus spirit and attract more male students. While research suggests that any enrollment spike from adding football is often short-lived, these schools see it as a vital tool to address the gender imbalance in higher education.</p>

          <p>Over thirty individuals across the U.S., including many public school teachers, have been fired or are under investigation for their social media posts about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Conservative activists and some Republican officials are actively identifying and publicizing comments they deem celebratory or critical of Kirk, demanding employers take action. This organized campaign has created a chilling effect on public discourse, with some legal experts expressing concern that it silences debate over a public figure's legacy.</p>

          <p>Voters in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, are participating in local elections that are being viewed as the first major political test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition government. The results will also be a significant indicator of the performance of state Premier Hendrik Wüst, who governs with the Green Party and is considered a potential successor to Merz. Opinion polls suggest potential gains for the far-right AfD party in some industrial areas, adding another layer of significance to the municipal and city council races.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that officials in both the UK Prime Minister's office and the Foreign Office were aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly defended the ambassador. While sources claim Starmer himself was not aware of the emails' contents during his defense, the revelation has led to criticism of his office's handling of the situation. The timeline suggests officials received a media inquiry about the emails a day before the Prime Minister stood by Lord Mandelson, who was subsequently sacked once the messages became public.</p>

The ruling orders Meta to review and clarify its terms of use regarding content moderation and the appeals process, reinforcing that social media posts are protected under the country's constitution.</p>

          <p>Boxing experts are divided ahead of the super-middleweight fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Crawford, moving up two weight classes, is lauded for his technical skill, adaptability, and ability to exploit an opponent's weaknesses, but faces a significant size and power disadvantage. Álvarez, the natural super-middleweight, is seen as slower than in his prime but possesses formidable power and experience at the higher weight. The matchup presents a classic clash of styles, with Crawford's boxing prowess pitted against Canelo's strength and ring control.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly, youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. The "Gen Z" protests, which escalated after a social media ban, led to the dissolution of parliament and new elections scheduled for March. Karki, known for her strong anti-graft stance, was installed after negotiations between the army, the president, and protest representatives, bringing a sense of calm back to the capital, Kathmandu.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative aimed at both boosting its birth rate and retaining scientific talent, Shanghai has launched a subsidy program for female researchers. The program, starting with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to new mothers under 40 with a doctoral degree who are returning to work. This policy is designed to address the challenges women face in balancing career and family, a key factor in both China's declining birth rate and the attrition of women from STEM fields.</p>
