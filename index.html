          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry, the tenth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is intensifying over the central Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become a hurricane later this week. Located far from the U.S. mainland, the storm is projected to pass near or north of the northern Leeward Islands by late Thursday, bringing two to four inches of rain and a risk of flash flooding, particularly in higher terrain. Swells generated by Jerry are also anticipated to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across the Leeward and Windward Islands. This development follows a relatively quiet hurricane season, with only one of the previous nine named storms making landfall in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Portland, Oregon, is experiencing heightened anxiety as President Trump attempts to deploy federalized National Guard troops to quell protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. Business owners report a significant decline in revenue, attributing it to Trump's rhetoric portraying the city as "war-ravaged." Legal battles have ensued, with a federal judge temporarily blocking the federalization of Oregon National Guard troops and the deployment of any state's Guard to Portland. The ongoing conflict highlights a perception problem for the city and a struggle between federal and local authority over protest response.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla has weakened from a hurricane off Mexico's Pacific coast, with maximum sustained winds now at 65 mph, below the Category 1 threshold. The storm is bringing high surf conditions and gusty winds to Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect. Forecasters predict Priscilla will continue moving parallel to the coast and weaken further over the next 48 hours. Large swells generated by the storm are expected to cause life-threatening surf, rip current conditions, and coastal flooding along parts of Mexico's southwestern and west-central coastlines.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation, stemming from his 2020 testimony before a Senate panel. The proceeding in Alexandria, Virginia, set a trial date for early January, though Comey's lawyer plans to seek dismissal on grounds of vindictive prosecution and the invalid appointment of the U.S. Attorney. The Justice Department's prosecution marks a significant escalation in President Trump's efforts against political opponents, with Comey asserting his innocence and welcoming a trial. The case is expected to involve discussions of classified information, potentially complicating proceedings.</p>

          <p>Consumers planning to decorate for the holidays are advised to shop early this year, as significant shortages and higher prices are anticipated for items like artificial Christmas trees, lights, and wreaths. One of the largest importers of artificial trees, National Tree Company, reported bringing in 25% less product due to trade war tariffs, leading to a 10% price increase. The company's CEO, Chris Butler, warned against waiting for Black Friday, urging early purchases to secure desired items.

          <p>The war in Gaza has led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis for children, with an estimated 20,000 killed—nearly a third of all Palestinian fatalities—and thousands more maimed, injured, or orphaned.

Displaced multiple times, many children live in makeshift camps, performing adult tasks and grappling with profound trauma.

          <p>An opinion article criticizes the growing trend of American politicians, including figures like Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, and Donald Trump, using profanity in public discourse. The author argues that this widespread use diminishes the impact of swearing, which should be reserved for extraordinary circumstances, and erodes the decorum expected of public servants. Instead of appearing authentic or "cool," politicians who frequently curse are perceived as less sophisticated and contribute to a vulgarized political culture. The article calls for elected officials to model more respectful behavior, setting higher standards for the electorate.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project during a recent meeting in Washington. Carney raised the pipeline in the context of broader discussions about U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, with Trump reportedly receptive to the idea. The project, which would transport 830,000 barrels of oil daily from Alberta to Nebraska, was previously blocked by both the Obama and Biden administrations and abandoned by its owner, TC Energy. While discussions were preliminary, both leaders instructed their teams to continue talks, signaling a potential shift in policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator has strongly refuted concerns that the company's significant deals with other artificial intelligence giants constitute "circular investments," labeling the narrative as "fundamentally flawed." Intrator asserted that major technology companies are genuinely purchasing cloud infrastructure for AI to meet client demand, emphasizing that such partnerships are common during massive infrastructure buildouts. CoreWeave, which went public in March and has seen its stock soar, recently expanded its contracts with OpenAI and Meta, and inked a substantial deal with Nvidia, a key backer. The CEO maintains that the market's fundamental drivers are enormous, dismissing the criticism as temporary.</p>

          <p>Writer Alex O’Keefe, formerly of 'The Bear,' has had a civil summons for alleged disorderly conduct dismissed by a New York City administrative judge, following a viral incident on a Metro-North train.

Police, however, alleged he occupied two seats, refused directions, and delayed service. O'Keefe expressed relief at the dismissal, asserting the charges were "facially insufficient" and that the court's judgment affirmed his innocence, vowing to continue defending civil rights.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Democratic senators, Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, publicly pressed House Speaker Mike Johnson to swear in newly elected Representative Adelita Grijalva, whose inability to assume her role is linked to the ongoing government shutdown. Democrats allege Johnson is intentionally delaying Grijalva's swearing-in to prevent a critical vote on legislation requiring the release of files related to alleged sexual assaulter Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson dismissed these claims as "totally absurd" and a "publicity stunt," attributing the delay solely to the government shutdown. The confrontation highlights the intense political gridlock and accusations of obstruction in Washington.</p>

This surprising move includes Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel's foundry division for custom microprocessor development and potential direct GPU sales to OpenAI. Huang's comments underscore Nvidia's dominant position in the AI accelerator market, where its market cap has soared to $4.5 trillion. The strategic partnership aims to expand manufacturing options beyond TSMC and further tighten Nvidia's grip on the AI supply chain, with an optimistic outlook for future growth.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sparked controversy by comparing antifa to designated terrorist organizations like MS-13, Hamas, Hezbollah, and ISIS during a White House roundtable. Noem asserted that the loosely affiliated network of antifascist activists is "just as dangerous" and aims to "destroy us." Her comments follow President Trump's executive order designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. Extremism experts generally describe antifa as a decentralized movement without formal leadership, contrasting sharply with the structured, military-winged terrorist groups Noem cited. The roundtable, featuring right-wing social media journalists, further fueled the political debate surrounding antifa's nature.</p>

          <p>California has passed the "Real Food, Healthy Kids Act," a pioneering state law that will ban certain "ultraprocessed foods of concern" from school meals starting in 2035. The legislation establishes a statutory definition for ultraprocessed foods and aims to address health issues like obesity and asthma linked to these products. The state's Department of Public Health will identify the specific prohibited foods by 2028, giving schools and vendors time to adapt. Governor Gavin Newsom emphasized California's leadership in kids' health, stating the law ensures students have access to nutritious meals, despite some opposition from agricultural groups regarding implementation details.</p>

          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily lifted a lower court's specific order that blocked the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. However, a broader ruling from the U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, which prohibits any state's National Guard from deploying into Portland, remains in effect. The administrative stay was issued to preserve the status quo while the appeals court deliberates on the legal arguments. This development means that while one legal hurdle was cleared, the overall deployment of National Guard forces to Portland is still prohibited, reflecting ongoing legal challenges to federal intervention.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced it would furlough nearly half of its employees, approximately 34,000 workers, due to the ongoing government shutdown. This significant reduction in staff will severely impact taxpayer assistance, leading to increased wait times, backlogs, and delays in implementing tax law changes, especially as the extended tax-filing deadline approaches. The National Treasury Employees Union condemned the decision, highlighting the loss of vital services for the American public. Despite a 2019 law ensuring back pay for furloughed workers, a White House memo had suggested this might not occur, adding to employee uncertainty.</p>
