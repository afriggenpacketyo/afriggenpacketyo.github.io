          <p>The Smithsonian Institution released a statement affirming its independence after President Trump announced the firing of National Portrait Gallery head Kim Sajet, whom he described as partisan. The statement, issued after a Board of Regents meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Chief Justice John Roberts, emphasizes that personnel decisions are made by the Secretary with oversight from the Board. Sajet allegedly rejected artist Julian Raven's 2016 Trump painting and is still reporting to work. The museum also addressed concerns about biased content, directing the Secretary to set expectations for unbiased content and report back to the Board, with Trump having signed an executive order for Vance to supervise efforts to remove improper ideology from the Smithsonian.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in Los Angeles to join National Guard troops responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement.

The U.S. Northern Command stated the Marines will integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, having received training in de-escalation and crowd control. Newsom argues the deployment is illegal and an abuse of power, while LAPD Chief Jim McDowell expressed concerns about the logistical challenges and potential for escalation.

          <p>Tesla's stock has recovered significantly after a dip caused by a feud between Elon Musk and President Trump. The rebound is attributed to Musk's announcement of Tesla testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas. The eight-second clip showed the latest version of the Model Y SUV, painted black with a white "Robotaxi" graffiti-style logo painted on it, navigating an intersection and pausing to allow pedestrians to traverse a crosswalk. Tesla is expected to launch a driverless ride-hailing service pilot in Austin in June, using a small fleet of Model Y vehicles with remote monitoring.

          <p>The UK, along with Australia, Norway, Canada, and New Zealand, has sanctioned two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for "repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities" in the occupied West Bank. The sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes. The ministers have also been criticized for their stance on the war in Gaza. Israel has condemned the move as outrageous. The action reflects growing international concern over violence in the West Bank. The UK government stated that the sanctions were due to the ministers' rhetoric leading to civilian deaths.</p>

The State Department clarified that the ambassador "speaks for himself." The remarks come as French and Saudi diplomats plan a conference aimed at laying out a roadmap for a Palestinian state.

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2, priced at $449.99, is a worthy successor to the original, focusing on refinement rather than reinvention. It features improved graphics, enhanced controllers with mouse capabilities, and optional chat features with a camera. The screen is 1080p with support for 4K TVs, making older games look brighter and crisper. While battery life may be a challenge, the console's magnetic Joy-Cons and overall feel are significant upgrades. One of the main launch titles is "Mario Kart World," and there's also "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour," a collection of mini-games to show off the console's features.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has asked a federal judge to quickly block President Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles. The lawsuit argues that Trump broke the law by federalizing the California National Guard without Newsom's consent and that the action is unwarranted and stoking unrest. Trump administration officials insist the scale of the protests justifies the deployments. The request was denied, with the court ordering Trump and his co-defendants to respond by Wednesday morning.

          <p>Google on Tuesday offered buyouts to employees across several of its divisions, including those within its knowledge and information and central engineering units as well as marketing, research and communications teams, CNBC has learned. Knowledge and information, or K&I, is the unit that houses Google's search, ads and commerce divisions. The buyouts Tuesday are the company's latest effort to reduce headcount, which Google has continued to do in waves since laying off 12,000 employees in 2023. The buyouts come after finance chief Anat Ashkenazi in October said that one of her top priorities would be to drive more cost cutting as Google expands its spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure in 2025.</p>
