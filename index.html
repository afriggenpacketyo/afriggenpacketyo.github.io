          <p>The Reform UK party has disavowed comments made by a guest speaker, Dr. Aseem Malhotra, at its conference. Dr. Malhotra suggested a potential link between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the recent cancer diagnoses of King Charles and the Princess of Wales, a claim widely discredited by the scientific community. Health Secretary Wes Streeting condemned the platforming of such views as "shockingly irresponsible," highlighting concerns over declining childhood vaccination rates. In response, Reform UK stated it does not endorse the remarks but supports the principle of free speech, while medical experts have labeled the theory as baseless pseudoscience.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, now a powerful Category 4 storm, is tracking westward across the Pacific Ocean, with its forecast path bringing it closer to Hawaii. While no coastal warnings are currently in effect, forecasters anticipate that swells generated by the hurricane will reach the Hawaiian Islands by the end of the weekend. These swells are expected to create life-threatening surf conditions and dangerous rip currents through the middle of next week. In response to the potential threat, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency to prepare for possible impacts from high winds and heavy rainfall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has strongly condemned President Trump's threats to deploy federal troops to the city, calling the rhetoric "beneath the honor of our nation." The response follows a social media post from Trump suggesting a military-style operation to address crime, which local leaders argue is a false pretext for a white supremacist agenda. Activist groups have organized emergency protests, asserting that violent crime in Chicago has actually decreased to its lowest point since 2019. This political clash highlights the deep divide between the city's Democratic leadership and the Trump administration's approach to urban law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Chrysler has issued a recall for approximately 91,787 Jeep Grand Cherokee plug-in hybrid SUVs from model years 2022-2026 due to a critical software error. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a flaw in the hybrid control processor can cause an unexpected loss of drive power, significantly increasing the risk of a crash. The issue stems from a microprocessor overload in the Battery Pack Control Module that is misinterpreted by the system.

          <p>A large demonstration in London's Parliament Square against the UK government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in over 425 arrests. The majority of arrests were for showing support for a banned organization, which is a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The Metropolitan Police reported significant hostility from some protesters, including physical assaults on officers. Organizers and civil liberties groups like Amnesty International criticized the police response as disproportionate, describing the arrests of peaceful individuals holding signs as "genuinely shocking" and a threat to fundamental rights.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines Boeing 737 MAX-9 bound for Baltimore was forced to return to San Francisco shortly after takeoff due to a "plastic burning smell" in the cabin. The flight, carrying over 150 passengers and crew, landed safely, and all occupants deplaned without incident before being rebooked on a different aircraft. This event marked the second incident involving United planes at the same airport that week, following a minor collision between two aircraft on the tarmac.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to Chicago has been met with sharply divided reactions across the city's neighborhoods. While some residents in areas like Canaryville welcome the intervention to combat crime, others, particularly on the South Side, view it as an unnecessary militarization. Community leaders and violence prevention groups argue they are the real "troops" making progress, pointing to a significant drop in the city's homicide rate over the past two years. The threat has also heightened anxiety in Latino communities over potential large-scale immigration raids, separate from the stated goal of crime reduction.</p>

The event, which drew nearly 50,000 fans, demonstrates the NFL's commitment to building a year-round presence in international markets rather than hosting one-off events. This season features a record seven international games across Europe and South America, with plans for a game in Australia next year.

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the performance under manager Thomas Tuchel was widely seen as lackluster and uninspired. The victory, secured by an own goal and a header from Declan Rice, maintains England's strong position in their group, yet the team has been criticized for regressing since the last European Championship. Despite dominating possession, England struggled to create clear chances against a defensive Andorra side, leading to a subdued atmosphere and many fans leaving before the final whistle. The team faces a more significant challenge against Serbia next, where improvement will be crucial.</p>

          <p>Investigators in Lisbon have determined that a snapped cable was a primary cause of the deadly funicular crash that killed 16 people. A preliminary report from Portugal's transport safety office confirmed that the cable connecting the two carriages gave way, causing the upper car to derail and crash into a building. While the brakeman attempted to engage emergency brakes, they failed to stop the carriage, which was traveling at approximately 37 mph. The investigation is ongoing to determine why the cable, which was well within its operational lifespan, failed and whether an automatic brake system malfunctioned.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has asked a federal judge to deny a media request to unseal the names of two individuals who received large payments from Jeffrey Epstein in 2018. The two unnamed associates, described as potential co-conspirators, received payments of $100,000 and $250,000 shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing its investigative series on Epstein's lenient 2008 plea deal. Citing privacy concerns expressed by the individuals, prosecutors are opposing the unsealing requested by NBC News. The payments were initially flagged by prosecutors in 2019 as potential evidence of witness tampering.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team secured their place in the World Cup quarter-finals by defeating Australia 47-7, extending their winning streak to 30 consecutive Test matches. Despite a dominant final score, the Red Roses had a difficult first half, initially trailing and struggling against a determined Australian side. The team's performance improved significantly after halftime, but the victory was marred by injuries to key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman. England will now face Scotland in the quarter-final, a team they have consistently defeated by large margins in recent encounters.</p>

          <p>Joseph David Emerson, an off-duty pilot, has pleaded guilty to federal charges after attempting to shut down the engines of an Alaska Airlines passenger jet during a flight in October 2023. Emerson, who was riding in the cockpit's jump seat, told pilots he was "not okay" before the incident and later admitted to having taken psychedelic mushrooms and struggling with depression. Under a plea agreement, he was sentenced in state court to time already served and probation, while prosecutors in the federal case can recommend a one-year prison sentence. The flight was safely diverted to Portland, Oregon, with no injuries.</p>

          <p>International postal traffic into the United States has fallen by over 80% since the Trump administration ended a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The change requires customs duties to be collected on parcels valued at $800 or less, a task that many foreign postal operators and carriers are not equipped to handle. As a result, 88 postal services worldwide have suspended some or all shipments to the U.S., causing major operational disruptions. The Universal Postal Union is now working to implement new systems to help operators calculate and collect these duties to restore the flow of mail.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order authorizing sanctions and other punitive measures against countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order creates a new "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, which will empower the State Department to impose penalties such as economic sanctions and visa restrictions. According to advocacy groups, at least 54 Americans were wrongfully detained in 17 different countries in 2024. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the measure is designed to ensure that any nation using an American as a "bargaining chip will pay the price."</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile session as a weaker-than-expected August jobs report created conflicting sentiment among investors. The data, showing only 22,000 new nonfarm payrolls, initially boosted markets on hopes that the Federal Reserve would be prompted to cut interest rates. However, this optimism was soon tempered by concerns that the slowing labor market could signal a broader economic downturn, causing major indices to reverse their gains. Despite the daily fluctuation, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq managed to end the week with modest gains, reflecting the market's ongoing uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House claimed, without evidence, that those killed were "narco-terrorists" from the Tren de Aragua gang, a group the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the "imperialist policies" of the U.S. and announced the activation of a special plan involving millions of armed militia members.
