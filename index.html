          <p>Right-wing extremism is reportedly becoming a "cool" part of pop culture for some youths in Dessau, a city in eastern Germany. This trend, marked by Nazi slogans and glorification of Hitler, is occurring in a region still grappling with the economic and social aftershocks of German reunification. Despite significant investment and its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its Bauhaus architecture, Dessau has a history of racist violence and recently elected a far-right mayor with past neo-Nazi affiliations. While many citizens and civic groups are actively confronting the hate, others express fear and a sense of growing hostility in their community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity remained in contraction for the third straight month in June, with the official PMI at 49.7, just below the 50-point expansion threshold. This comes amid persistent deflationary pressures and sluggish consumer demand, which have led to a price war among manufacturers. While there were slight improvements in production and new orders, and the government is pushing to boost domestic consumption, the overall economic outlook remains cautious. Analysts suggest that further fiscal stimulus will be crucial to invigorate the economy, especially as weaker export growth is anticipated for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and another individual was injured after being ambushed by a gunman while responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Following an hours-long manhunt involving multiple agencies, a deceased male suspect was found on the mountain with a firearm nearby. Authorities are investigating whether the fire was intentionally set to lure first responders to the scene in a "heinous direct assault." The incident prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order and a no-fly zone to aid law enforcement and firefighting operations in the popular recreation area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood from certain regions, partially lifting a ban that has strained diplomatic relations for two years. The ban was initially imposed over concerns about the release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. This easing of restrictions, which still excludes 10 prefectures including Fukushima, is seen as a move by Beijing to reset ties with Tokyo amid growing trade uncertainty with the United States. The resumption is contingent on continued international monitoring and Chinese sampling to ensure the safety and quality of the aquatic products.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its digital services tax just one day before the first payments were due, following a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to terminate all trade negotiations. The 3% levy would have applied retroactively to the revenue of large tech companies like Google and Amazon, a move the U.S. called discriminatory. Ottawa stated the reversal was made "in anticipation" of a new comprehensive trade arrangement, allowing for the resumption of vital economic and security talks. This decision marks an about-face for Canadian officials, who had previously insisted they would proceed with the tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British car manufacturers are resuming large-scale shipments to the United States as a new trade deal reduces a punitive 25% tariff down to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles. The higher tariff, imposed by the Trump administration, had caused exports of brands like Mini and Aston Martin to plummet. While the auto industry welcomes the relief, some British farmers argue that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip, citing concessions on US ethanol and beef imports. Meanwhile, the UK steel industry is still anxiously awaiting promised zero-tariff access to the US market. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the decision has caused unrest within the governing Labour Party, with many MPs questioning the priorities as programs like welfare for disabled people face cuts.

The author contends that Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine has drained Russia's military and financial resources, crippling its credibility as a reliable partner for its allies. Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, Moscow's response was limited to verbal condemnations and offers to mediate, rather than providing meaningful military or diplomatic backing. This inaction is presented as part of a larger pattern of strategic neglect, showing Russia can no longer effectively project power.</p>

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. A key factor is the regenerative braking system, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy when slowing down. This process can result in low-frequency deceleration that is known to provoke the uncomfortable symptoms of motion sickness in passengers.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came just hours after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenger against him. Tillis opposed the president's massive spending bill, citing "devastating" Medicaid cuts for his state. In his announcement, Tillis lamented that leaders willing to embrace bipartisanship and compromise are becoming an "endangered species" in Washington. His retirement opens up a key Senate seat in a perennial battleground state, setting the stage for a competitive race in the next election cycle.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy allegedly murdered by his youth soccer coach died from acute alcohol intoxication, according to the family's attorney. The finding raises new questions about the circumstances leading to the death of Oscar Omar Hernandez, who was found in a ditch in Oxnard after visiting the coach, Mario Edgardo Garcia Aquino. Garcia Aquino has been charged with murder with a special circumstance of committing lewd acts with a child. It was previously revealed that the coach had been the subject of two earlier investigations into alleged misconduct with children but was not charged.</p>

Grossi emphasized the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to ascertain what nuclear material remains and where it is located. He noted that you cannot "disinvent" the knowledge Iran possesses, suggesting that a definitive military solution to the nuclear issue is not possible.</p>

          <p>The retirement of Republican Senator Thom Tillis has turned North Carolina's 2026 Senate race into a prime target for both parties. Democrats see a rare opportunity to flip a seat in a state they have struggled to win at the federal level, with former Governor Roy Cooper considered a formidable potential candidate. For Republicans, the open seat sets up a potentially competitive primary, with several names being floated as strong contenders who could be endorsed by former President Trump. The race is poised to become one of the most expensive and closely watched contests of the midterm cycle.</p>

The inquiry will investigate key decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes without testing in early 2020, which many blame for seeding the virus and leading to thousands of deaths. It will also scrutinize issues like blanket "do not resuscitate" notices and restrictive visiting policies that left families separated from their loved ones.

While acknowledging the complaints about the calendar, he stated that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by FIFA and the Premier League. He also noted that many teams who complain would likely be happy to be in the competition for the prestige and income it provides.</p>

          <p>Turkish police detained more than 50 people and used a heavy presence to prevent a banned LGBTQ+ Pride parade from taking place in Istanbul. For the tenth consecutive year, authorities banned the march, with the governor citing threats to "social peace, family structure, and moral values." Despite the ban, activists attempted to gather with rainbow flags but were met by police. The crackdown occurs amid increasingly harsh rhetoric from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government against the LGBTQ+ community, a trend that human rights groups warn is fostering a hostile and discriminatory environment.</p>
