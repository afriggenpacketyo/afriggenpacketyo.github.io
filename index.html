          <p>The UK's Labour party is actively encouraging major US tech firms to build energy-intensive AI datacentres to stimulate economic growth. However, this strategy is drawing criticism for its potential environmental impact, as the energy and water demands of AI are projected to rise exponentially, conflicting with net-zero goals. The article also highlights growing concerns about the social costs, including the erosion of cognitive skills in students and the mental health impacts of AI chatbots, suggesting a more cautious approach is needed to balance the technology's benefits against its significant downsides.</p>

          <p>A new executive order imposing a $100,000 fee for skilled foreign worker visa applicants caused widespread panic and confusion, prompting many to spend thousands on last-minute flights back to the US. Although the White House later clarified the one-time fee would only apply to new applicants and not current visa holders, the initial announcement created a traumatic scramble. The article details the personal and financial turmoil experienced by workers, many of whom have lived in the US for over a decade and felt unwanted by the sudden policy shift.</p>

          <p>Travelers across Europe are experiencing significant flight delays and cancellations for a second day after a cyberattack targeted Collins Aerospace, a company providing check-in and baggage software. Airports including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin have been severely affected, forcing staff to resort to manual, paper-based check-in processes. The incident has resulted in long queues and frustration for passengers, with Brussels Airport asking airlines to cancel half of their departing flights to manage the ongoing disruption. The attack highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to digital threats.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Lindsey Halligan, a senior White House aide and one of his personal lawyers, as the new U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The move comes after the previous top prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned amidst pressure from the administration to press charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. This nomination places a close presidential ally in charge of a key office that has been investigating one of Trump's political adversaries, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>In an era dominated by streaming and declining box office revenue, Los Angeles's repertory cinemas are successfully drawing audiences by providing curated, communal viewing experiences. Theaters like Vidiots and the New Beverly are selling out screenings of classic films on 35-millimeter prints, often supplemented with special events like Q&A sessions with filmmakers. This model appeals to cinephiles seeking a more intentional and social alternative to mainstream multiplexes and at-home viewing. While reliant on nonprofit models and donations, these independent venues are revitalizing film culture and fostering a new generation of movie lovers.</p>

While control of the House could come down to a few seats, historical data suggests the president's party often faces significant losses, favoring Democrats. However, the article notes that numerous factors, including President Trump's approval ratings, voter enthusiasm, and fundraising, will be more decisive than gerrymandering alone, ultimately placing the outcome in the hands of voters rather than map-drawers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that just as the internet has been criticized for diminishing deep, critical thinking, the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence is poised to accelerate this cognitive decline. Citing recent studies, the author points out that reliance on AI tools like ChatGPT for tasks leads to "cognitive offloading," which weakens the brain's problem-solving and reflective capabilities. The piece expresses concern that this dependency, particularly among younger generations, is creating a society of passive consumers of machine-generated content, ultimately making humans less intelligent and more reliant on technology.</p>

          <p>A sense of cautious optimism is returning to Europe's economic outlook, with investment banks like Goldman Sachs expressing a more positive view on Germany's prospects. This sentiment will be explored at several upcoming financial conferences in Munich, London, and Paris. In London, the focus is on the revival of the Canary Wharf financial district, which is seeing its highest office leasing activity in a decade. While the private equity sector faces some fundraising challenges, the overall mood suggests a potential comeback for European markets after a period of underperformance.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, a 30-year-old self-made billionaire who dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University, recommends that aspiring entrepreneurs spend at least one to two years in college. Despite leaving her studies to accept a Thiel Fellowship and build a successful AI company, Guo emphasizes that higher education is invaluable for building a network of talented peers. She states that college provides a unique environment with a high concentration of smart, ambitious people who can become future co-founders, employees, and lifelong friends, an asset that is much harder to build later in life.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans football team defeated Michigan State 45-31 to improve their record to 4-0, led by a standout performance from receiver Makai Lemon. Lemon recorded eight receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown, and also scored a crucial rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter to seal the win. While the USC offense was effective, accumulating 517 total yards, the team's victory was complicated by poor discipline, as they incurred 10 penalties. The defense also showed vulnerability, allowing several long pass plays, an issue they will need to address before facing tougher upcoming opponents.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man has been arrested by the FBI after allegedly firing at least three shots into the lobby of the ABC10 television station in Sacramento.

The suspect was initially arrested by local police and released on bail before being taken back into custody on a federal charge. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, and the act has been condemned by public officials as an attack on journalism and democracy.</p>

Press freedom organizations have condemned the policy as a form of prior restraint and a dangerous step toward censorship, while the defense secretary stated the press "does not run the Pentagon" and must follow the rules.</p>

          <p>In China, lavish sales halls and unfinished luxury apartments from stalled real estate projects are being repurposed as film sets for the country's rapidly growing micro-drama industry. This trend provides a new revenue stream for developers facing cash flow shortages while meeting the high demand for opulent settings in popular urban romance dramas. The on-screen luxury creates a stark contrast with the reality of the idle construction sites and the frustrations of homebuyers who are still waiting for their properties to be completed amidst the ongoing property crisis.</p>

          <p>Top Premier League teams like Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly incorporating direct, long-ball tactics, a style once associated with lower-league football. This strategic shift is a response to the prevalence of high-pressing defenses, which make building up play from the back with short passes riskier. By using goalkeepers with excellent long-range distribution to target tall forwards, these teams can bypass the opposition's press, gain territory, and create isolated one-on-one matchups. This evolution demonstrates how top managers are adapting their systems to gain an unpredictable edge and mitigate risk in modern football.</p>

          <p>As more Western nations like the UK and France prepare to recognize a Palestinian state, this article analyzes the potential impact of these diplomatic moves. While largely symbolic, recognition elevates Palestine's status in future negotiations, shifting the dynamic from a state negotiating with a non-state entity to a state-to-state discussion. However, critics argue that such gestures are merely "political theater" without concrete actions like sanctions or boycotts to pressure Israel. The move could also prompt a defiant reaction from Israel, but supporters believe it is a crucial step in reaffirming Palestinian rights and keeping the two-state solution viable.</p>
