          <p>President Trump announced a delay in imposing 50 percent tariffs on all imports from the European Union until July 9, providing additional time for trade negotiations. Trump cited a conversation with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, as a catalyst for the extension, noting that talks would commence rapidly. This decision marks a turnabout from Trump's earlier threats to enact tariffs on June 1, which had raised concerns about an economically destabilizing trade war. Economists have warned that the tariffs and related uncertainty were slowing business investment around the world and disrupting supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has criticized the Australian government's plan to end a Chinese firm's control of the strategically located Darwin Port, labeling the move as "questionable." Landbridge Group, a Chinese company, was awarded a 99-year lease of the port in 2015, a deal now under scrutiny by the Australian government on national interest grounds. Xiao Qian argued that Landbridge Group had made significant investments in maintaining and building the port, contributing to the local economy, and secured the lease through an open bidding process. The ambassador expressed hope that Australia would view the project objectively, urging a fair and transparent business environment for Chinese companies in Australia.</p>

          <p>India and Canada are taking steps to mend their strained bilateral relations following tensions during Justin Trudeau's time as Prime Minister. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar spoke with Canada's new Foreign Minister Anita Anand, marking the highest diplomatic contact since Mark Carney became Canadian prime minister. The conversation focused on prospects for improving India-Canada ties, with both ministers expressing a desire to strengthen economic cooperation and advance shared priorities. Relations between the two countries deteriorated after Canada accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and Khalistan supporter, an allegation India denies.</p>

          <p>North Korea has arrested a senior official, Ri Hyong-son, deputy director of the ruling Workers' Party's Munitions Industry Department, over the failed launch of a new warship. The vessel tipped over and damaged its hull, an incident that Kim Jong Un has criticized as a "criminal act" that "severely damaged the [country's] dignity and pride." Ri Hyong-son is the highest-level official arrested so far in connection with the incident, with three officials at the Chongjin shipyard also detained. Analysts suggest Kim's swift and severe response signals Pyongyang's continued commitment to advancing its military capabilities despite the setback.</p>

Analysts from Citi expect BYD's price reduction to have caused a 30% to 40% spike in footfall at its dealership stores between May 24 and 25, compared to the previous weekend. Shares of other Chinese automakers also declined on Monday as investors turned cautious about stiffer competition and a potential price war in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The firm's pursuit continued even after staff admitted Mr. Holden was charged for a meter that shared the same serial number, due to an error in industry data.

          <p>Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president, has proposed seizing a vast "buffer zone" in Ukraine to protect Russian towns from Western weapons. The proposed zone would encompass nearly all of Ukraine, excluding a small area along the Polish border. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War estimate that at Russia's current rate of advance, it would take approximately 91 years to achieve this goal. The ISW also noted that the endeavor would likely cost Russia 50 million soldiers, based on previous casualty rates.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated a revised system for selling government rice stockpiles, aiming to reduce soaring prices to around 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through direct contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi established a special response team to address high rice prices and prevent a decline in rice product consumption. The new measures aim to streamline the distribution process and ensure lower prices for consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, effectively stripping out the cost associated with a middleman's profit. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. The first sale rule is considered particularly useful in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products, where margins are greater. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep allows the brain to enter a repair mode to flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research published in Cell Metabolism reveals how hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H₂O₂ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to “repair mode”, prompting restorative slumber. Excess build-up of these free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, offering critical insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

The bombardier, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, was to be buried Monday in Livermore, California, where he grew up in a ranching family. The remains of the pilot, 1st Lt.
