Additionally, a $500 million investment from Apple for rare earth magnets further signals growing confidence in the company's future profitability and strategic importance.

          <p>The United Nations human rights chief has called for an immediate halt to Israel's plan for a military takeover of Gaza City, warning of potential atrocity crimes and massive forced displacement. The plan, approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, has drawn sharp criticism from international leaders, including those from the U.K. and Germany, who fear it will lead to more bloodshed and undermine efforts to release hostages. The decision also faces significant opposition within Israel from hostage families and military officials concerned about the strategic and human costs of such an escalation.</p>

          <p>While national average rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain modest, top online banks are offering significantly higher yields, with some short-term CDs reaching around 4.5% APY. The article explains that this phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, makes short-term CDs (six months to one year) more attractive than long-term ones. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to look beyond traditional brick-and-mortar banks and compare offers from online institutions, which typically have lower overhead costs.

This event highlights the increasing frequency of natural disasters in China, which authorities link to the broader impacts of climate change.</p>

While a formalized peace treaty is not expected, the leaders are anticipated to sign a letter of intent, marking a significant step after years of conflict centered on the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The meeting is positioned as a major diplomatic achievement for the Trump administration, which has been more robustly engaged in the process than its predecessor.

          <p>A deadline set by U.S. President Donald Trump for Russia to cease its war in Ukraine has expired, raising questions about potential economic penalties. Trump had threatened to impose "secondary tariffs" of around 100% on Russia's trade partners if Moscow did not end its invasion, a key foreign policy goal for his administration. Despite a recent "highly productive" meeting between a U.S. envoy and Vladimir Putin, Trump expressed disappointment, stating the next steps were up to the Russian president. The potential tariffs could severely impact Russia's remaining crude oil clients, who currently operate under a G7 price cap system.</p>

Online banks can offer these higher rates due to lower overhead costs, and many have low minimum deposit requirements and no monthly fees, making them accessible to a wide range of savers.

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current average mortgage rates are approximately 6.75% for a 30-year loan and 5.99% for a 15-year loan, as of early August. Refinance rates are slightly higher, though these national averages can vary based on individual factors like credit score and location. The article suggests that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers can improve their chances of securing a good rate by strengthening their credit profile.

          <p>Togo's President Faure Gnassingbe has transitioned to a newly created, powerful position of "president of the Council of Ministers" after a constitutional amendment, a move critics label a "constitutional coup." This change allows him to rule indefinitely without facing direct elections, as the new role is appointed by the parliamentary majority, which his party controls. This development extends his family's 58-year rule and is causing concern among observers who fear it could inspire other African leaders to amend their constitutions to cement power.

The prosecution argued he had an "unhealthy interest in weapons" and acted deliberately.

          <p>A recent CNBC survey shows President Donald Trump's overall approval rating remains negative, with 51% disapproving of his performance. However, the poll also reveals a historically low favorability rating for the Democratic Party, suggesting widespread public dissatisfaction with both sides. While Trump's economic approval saw a slight improvement, it also remains in negative territory, and the public disapproves of his handling of key issues like inflation and taxes. The survey indicates a complex and conflicted political environment, with Democrats holding a slight edge in congressional preference despite their low party favorability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Report Details How Apple CEO Tim Cook Persuaded Trump on US iPhone Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 08:42:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook successfully navigated President Trump's demands for a U.S.-made iPhone by announcing a $600 billion, four-year spending plan in the United States, without committing to final assembly in the country. The plan focuses on expanding partnerships with U.S. suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensors, components that are already made domestically. This strategic move appeared to appease Trump, who subsequently announced that Apple would be exempt from a planned tariff on chips. Analysts view this as a savvy maneuver by Cook to avoid tariffs and gain political favor while maintaining Apple's existing global supply chain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenStore, an e-commerce aggregator co-founded by venture capitalist Keith Rabois, is shutting down most of the 40+ Shopify brands it acquired and will now focus on a single menswear brand, Jack Archer. The company recently raised funds at a drastically reduced valuation of $50 million, down from a previous $1 billion, marking a significant downturn for the once-booming aggregator market. This collapse follows a trend of similar companies struggling as e-commerce demand cooled and rising costs made it difficult to profitably operate a large portfolio of small online brands. The restructuring includes significant layoffs and executive departures.</p>

          <p>The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 has the highest theft rate in the U.S., being stolen 39 times more frequently than the average vehicle, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute. The report, which analyzed 2022-2024 models, found that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks dominate the top 20 most-stolen list. The Camaro's vulnerability is linked to an on-board data port that thieves can exploit to easily steal the car. Conversely, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in secure garages for charging and are more easily tracked.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Crocs has expressed concern over a cautious U.S. consumer, leading the company to plan a reduction in orders for the second half of the year. This warning, coupled with a weaker-than-expected forecast, caused the company's stock to plummet by nearly 30%. CEO Andrew Rees noted that retail partners are acting more carefully as consumers grapple with price increases on discretionary spending. To protect profitability, Crocs intends to pull back on promotions and reset inventory for its Heydude brand, which is expected to create short-term headwinds for sales volume.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's predictable four-year price cycle, historically driven by the "halving" event, may be ending due to fundamental market shifts. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has introduced a new class of long-term institutional investors, altering traditional dynamics and causing Bitcoin to hit an all-time high before the last halving, rather than after. Analysts suggest that a more supportive regulatory environment and the absence of major crypto "blowups" are also contributing to this change. As a result, the era of massive 80% price crashes may be over, replaced by more moderate volatility influenced by broader macroeconomic trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent weak jobs data, a slowdown in GDP growth, and the politically charged firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, the U.S. stock market has remained largely stable. Analysts attribute this resilience to several factors, including strong corporate profits from tech giants, the prospect of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, and a belief that the Trump administration will not return to its steepest tariff policies. This market optimism has created its own momentum, allowing investors to shrug off negative economic signals for now, though concerns about potential "stagflation" remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals a concerning paradox in China's water systems: while many cities are experiencing more extreme rainfall, the overall volume of water in the country's rivers has significantly declined over the past 60 years. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that over 72% of hydrological stations reported a decrease in river run-off between 1956 and 2016, with the decline being particularly severe in the north. This trend poses a major threat to the nation's water security, which is essential for sustaining its large population, vast agricultural lands, and industrial output.</p>
