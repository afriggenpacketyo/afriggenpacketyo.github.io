          <p>Israel's security Cabinet has approved a plan, called "Gideon's Chariots," to escalate military actions in Gaza, involving the occupation of the territory and the forced relocation of civilians to southern Gaza. The plan aims to dismantle Hamas, release hostages, and establish a new aid mechanism, but it will commence after a comprehensive evacuation of the population. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated the offensive will aim at defeating Hamas, and that the population will be moved for its own protection. International law considers forced displacement during armed conflict a war crime and potentially a crime against humanity, so this has caused concern among international bodies. Optimism score is 10 because of the war crime.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. would halt attacks on the Houthis in Yemen, claiming the group had "capitulated" and no longer wanted to fight. This announcement coincided with Oman confirming a "ceasefire" agreement with the Iran-backed group, aimed at preventing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis had been targeting ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, disrupting global trade routes. Israel responded with attacks on Yemen's Sanaa airport and other facilities.</p>

The ruling concerns an executive order that revoked President Biden's policy allowing transgender service members to serve openly. Seven active service members sued to block the policy, arguing that it violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause, but the Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration.</p>
