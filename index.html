            <p>Fox News reports on the latest advancements in AI technology, including James Cameron's evolving views on AI in Hollywood. Initially wary, Cameron now believes Hollywood should embrace AI. Nvidia has announced plans to manufacture its AI supercomputers in the US for the first time, marking a significant step in domestic production. Other advancements mentioned include a rideable, hydrogen-powered four-legged robot, an AI-powered system restoring speech to paralyzed individuals, and robots that autonomously milk cows, increasing milk production and cow comfort.</p>

            <p>Amid budget cuts, the White House is considering ending funding for NASA's Mars sample return program, potentially ceding space leadership to China. China's Tianwen-3 mission aims to bring Martian material to Earth by 2031. This decision could weaken US standing in space exploration, especially as China advances its lunar and Martian programs. International partners may reconsider cooperation with the US if the mission is canceled, according to a planetary geologist at the University of Hong Kong.</p>

            <p>The article criticizes the SAVE Act, which requires voters to present specific citizenship documentation, arguing it disproportionately disenfranchises women due to name changes after marriage or divorce. It contrasts this with Rep. Elise Stefanik's (R-N.Y.) support for the Women's Commemorative Coin Act, which celebrates suffragists. The author argues that requiring more documentation to vote than to buy a gun reveals a skewed view of constitutional rights. The author states that some elected officials code switch.</p>

            <p>Altadena, an unincorporated town, experienced a "catastrophic failure" in its response to the Eaton fire, raising concerns about its governance and resource allocation compared to incorporated cities. Residents felt left in the dark during evacuations, and the area suffered the worst damage from the fire. The article explores whether Altadena's lack of a dedicated city government contributed to the communication issues. The focus is on emergency planning, messaging and communications, not on-the-ground firefighting.</p>

            <p>US chocolate prices are surging due to soaring cocoa costs and Trump's tariffs on imports. Climate-related crises in West Africa have decimated cocoa production, driving up prices. Trump's tariffs are expected to further increase chocolate prices. The cacao plant can only be grown in tropical climates, so most cocoa is imported. Smaller chocolate businesses are particularly vulnerable to these unstable conditions. (not investment advice)</p>
