          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Hamas leaders will not have immunity anywhere, refusing to rule out further strikes following a recent attack in Qatar. Speaking alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu asserted that Israel acted alone in the strike and emphasized every nation's right to self-defense beyond its borders. The meeting also reportedly covered Israeli military plans in Gaza and controversial settlement expansions in the West Bank, which continue despite international criticism and ahead of a UN vote on Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are expressing alarm over a significant loss of expertise at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) due to high-profile departures and layoffs. Critics argue these changes, coupled with efforts to undermine vaccine guidance, are eroding public trust and leaving the nation less prepared for future health threats like measles or Ebola. The departures of several senior officials are seen as a major blow to health preparedness, with concerns that political extremism is compromising the agency's scientific integrity and ability to respond to emergencies.</p>

          <p>Chinese regulators have accused U.S. chipmaker Nvidia of violating antimonopoly laws in relation to its $6.9 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2020. Authorities announced a "further investigation" after a preliminary probe found breaches, escalating tech-related tensions with Washington during ongoing trade talks. This move follows other actions by Beijing, including antidumping and antidiscrimination investigations into the U.S. chip sector. The scrutiny on Nvidia, a key player in the U.S.-China tech rivalry, highlights the increasing pressure on American semiconductor companies operating in the Chinese market.

          <p>Fast-food restaurants are losing breakfast customers to convenience stores, which saw a 9% increase in morning traffic compared to fast-food's 1% rise in a recent three-month period. Chains like Wawa and Casey's are successfully attracting consumers with expanded food service options, convenience, and perceived value, chipping away at a market long dominated by giants like McDonald's. This trend reflects a shift in consumer behavior, as budget-conscious diners find convenience stores to be a viable and varied alternative for their morning meals, reversing a dynamic where c-stores traditionally followed fast-food's lead.</p>

This substantial insider acquisition was interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence from Musk in the company's future. The purchase comes as Tesla faces challenges, including slumping sales and analyst uncertainty, but also as Musk pushes a vision for the company centered on AI, robotics, and autonomous driving.

          <p>A National Women's Soccer League match between Seattle Reign and Racing Louisville was abandoned after midfielder Savannah DeMelo collapsed on the field late in the first half. Medical personnel provided immediate on-field care before she was transported to a local hospital, where she was reported to be stable and alert. DeMelo, who has previously disclosed a diagnosis of Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism, had a similar on-field medical incident in March. The NWSL emphasized its commitment to player safety, and the remainder of the scoreless match will be rescheduled for a later date.</p>

          <p>Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK, dealing a blow to Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's authority. At a press conference with Reform leader Nigel Farage, Kruger, who had served as a shadow minister, declared the Conservative Party "over" as a national political force and cited its "rule of failure" in government. The move highlights the deep ideological fractures on the British right and adds momentum to Reform UK, which now has two sitting MPs. Badenoch responded by stating she would not be distracted by the defection.</p>

          <p>An in-depth report from the front lines in Kherson details the brutal and innovative reality of Ukrainian drone warfare, where operators engage in a deadly, gamified system to eliminate Russian targets. Pilots in small, adaptable units use inexpensive, locally produced "suicide" drones to hunt soldiers, with kills logged on a point-based system that can be exchanged for better gear. This new approach to combat is highly effective, with drone teams accounting for a majority of Russian casualties despite making up a small fraction of Ukraine's forces.

He successfully cultivated a sense of community for young conservatives on liberal-leaning college campuses, transforming political activism into a cultural identity.

          <p>The trial of a former British paratrooper, known only as Soldier F, has begun in Belfast for his role in the 1972 "Bloody Sunday" massacre. He is charged with the murder of James Wray and William McKinney and the attempted murder of five others during a civil rights demonstration in Derry. In its opening statement, the prosecution described the shootings as "unnecessary and gratuitous," alleging the unarmed victims were shot as they ran away. The landmark, non-jury trial is proceeding after a long campaign for justice by the victims' families, more than 50 years after the event.</p>

          <p>"Fox & Friends" host Brian Kilmeade issued an on-air apology for suggesting that mentally ill homeless individuals should receive a "lethal injection."

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox stated that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, held a "very different ideology" from his conservative family. The governor also confirmed that the suspect's partner was a transgender person, though it remains unclear if this was a factor in the motive for the attack on Kirk, who was a vocal critic of transgender rights. Investigators are exploring how the suspect may have been radicalized online, with friends reportedly confirming he was involved in "dark places of the internet." Formal charges are expected to be filed on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta acted arbitrarily and violated the freedom of expression of adult film star Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. The court found that Meta applied its policies on nudity inconsistently and without clear justification, as other accounts with similar content remained active. In a significant decision, the court ordered Meta to review and adjust its terms of use to provide users with clearer mechanisms for challenging content moderation decisions. Gomez had argued the account closure affected her ability to work.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk has brought scrutiny upon the security arrangements at Utah Valley University, where the event was held. Security experts have questioned the choice of an open-air courtyard surrounded by buildings, which created a vulnerable "bowl-shaped" area and provided a clear line of sight for the shooter. Witnesses reported a lack of security checks, such as metal detectors or bag searches, for the event, which was open to the general public. The university's police chief acknowledged the tragic outcome, stating that despite planning, security measures were insufficient for the attack that occurred.</p>
