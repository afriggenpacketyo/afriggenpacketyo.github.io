            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed concerns that the U.S. economy is either in or rapidly approaching a recession, citing weakened growth and the negative impact of President Trump's tariffs on market confidence. Fink highlighted that business leaders share his apprehension, noting a slowdown across various sectors due to heightened uncertainty surrounding trade policies. Despite these concerns, Fink remains optimistic about long-term economic trends like artificial intelligence and does not believe the U.S. is facing a financial crisis. He suggests consumers may have been stocking up on goods ahead of tariffs, potentially masking underlying economic weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China has escalated the trade war with the U.S. by raising tariffs on imports from the U.S. to 125%, a retaliatory measure against President Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese goods.

Key U.S. exports to China include oilseeds and grains, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and aerospace products.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, must be returned to the United States. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to bring Garcia back, although they questioned whether the judge had exceeded her authority. The Trump administration had appealed the order, but now must explain to the judge what steps they are taking to return Garcia. The government admitted he was deported due to an administrative error, but alleges he is a member of MS-13, which his lawyer denies.</p>

            <p>Consumer sentiment has tumbled in April, with the University of Michigan survey showing a significant drop due to rising inflation fears. The survey's mid-month reading on consumer sentiment fell to 50.8, the lowest since June 2022, and inflation expectations surged to their highest level since 1981. Concerns about business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets have all contributed to the decline. The survey also showed unemployment fears rising to their highest since 2009, amid concerns that President Trump's tariffs will raise inflation and slow growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expects corporate earnings estimates to fall due to the uncertainty created by President Trump's trade negotiations. Dimon anticipates analysts will slash their S&P 500 earnings estimates, potentially leading to flat or negative growth. Companies are becoming cautious, pulling back from acquisitions and investments due to the uncertain economic environment. Dimon notes that consumers have been accelerating purchases on concerns that tariffs will make items more expensive, but businesses are dropping long-term plans in favor of near-term optimization of supply chains.

            <p>The Kennedy Center's interim executive director, Richard Grenell, has been criticized for his response to a musician's concerns about the center's rollbacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Grenell accused the musician, Yasmin Williams, of believing "newspapers who exist to hate Republicans" and defended the center's programming decisions. Williams shared the email exchange on social media, expressing her disappointment with Grenell's handling of the situation. Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center has triggered widespread criticism, with several artists canceling shows or resigning from advisory positions.</p>

            <p>Ukraine's European allies have pledged €21bn in new military support for Kyiv, describing it as "a critical year" for the war. Germany is providing more than half of the total, committing €11bn in aid over four years. The support includes air defenses, missiles, radar systems, anti-tank mines, vehicle repairs, and drones.  Air defence is a priority, as Russian forces have dropped 10,000 glide bombs on Ukraine in the first three months of this year, as well as launching 100 one-way attack drones a day.</p>

            <p>A Senate committee held a hearing to discuss the possibility of setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. The committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, noted that there is a general consensus that the current system needs to be changed, but disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time. Witnesses presented arguments for both options, highlighting potential benefits and drawbacks for health, the economy, and public safety. President Trump has expressed varying opinions on the issue, calling it a "50/50 issue" but also vowing to get rid of daylight saving.</p>
