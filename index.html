          <p>President Trump announced that he has a shortlist of four potential candidates to be the next Federal Reserve chair, confirming that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has withdrawn from consideration. While Trump did not name the four contenders, former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett are considered likely candidates. The news comes after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's resignation, giving Trump another opportunity to appoint a new member to the Fed's board. Trump has been aggressively pushing the central bank to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly preparing to update his Gaza war strategy, with media reports suggesting a potential expansion of the military offensive to seize the entire enclave. The stated goals remain defeating Hamas and securing the release of hostages. However, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert strongly criticized the potential plan, warning it would lead to an "endless war" with heavy casualties and calling instead for a ceasefire agreement. The article also notes Iran is facing a heatwave and Israel is partially reopening goods entry into Gaza.</p>

          <p>According to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the increasing adoption of generative AI has been cited as a reason for over 10,000 job cuts in the first seven months of 2025. The technology sector has seen the most significant layoffs, with AI reshaping the industry and impacting hiring for entry-level roles. While AI is a growing factor, the report notes that other issues, such as federal budget cuts and trade tariffs affecting the retail sector, are currently having a more immediate and larger impact on the U.S. labor market.</p>

He stated that JPMorgan gave him 20 days to move hundreds of millions in cash, and Bank of America subsequently declined to open an account for him. The claims come as his administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to investigate and potentially fine banks for dropping customers on political grounds. JPMorgan responded that it does not close accounts for political reasons and welcomes regulatory change.</p>

The outlook accounts for currently imposed tariffs and potential drug price changes, demonstrating resilience in a challenging regulatory and political environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a Department of Justice court filing, the grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell investigation contain little information that is not already public. The DOJ is asking a federal judge to unseal the documents but noted that most of the testimony was revealed during Maxwell's trial or through public statements. The annotated transcripts primarily conceal the identities of certain victims and witnesses. This development comes as part of a broader effort to unseal records related to both Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, though the DOJ has not yet taken a position on unsealing grand jury exhibits.</p>

          <p>A Legionnaires' disease outbreak in the Harlem area of New York City has resulted in two deaths and at least 58 reported illnesses. Health officials have been tracking the outbreak since late July and have identified and remediated eleven cooling towers that tested positive for the Legionella bacteria. The disease, a type of pneumonia, is contracted by breathing in contaminated water vapor and is not spread person-to-person. Officials are urging residents in the affected area with flu-like symptoms to seek immediate medical care, as early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.</p>

          <p>The strategic partnership between the United States and India is facing significant strain due to President Trump's tariff threats over New Delhi's trade with Russia and Iran. After imposing a 25% tariff, Trump has threatened further increases, accusing India of funding Russia's war in Ukraine through its oil purchases. Indian officials and analysts have described the U.S. approach as "intimidation" and an infringement on their "strategic autonomy." Experts suggest that while India does not seek confrontation, it will prioritize its national interests, necessitating careful diplomacy to manage the crisis.</p>

          <p>An active search is being conducted for Alec Luhn, an award-winning American climate journalist who has gone missing during a solo hiking trip on a glacier in Norway. Luhn, an experienced outdoorsman, was on a backpacking trip in the Odda region and did not return for his flight home on Monday. His family alerted the police after he failed to make contact. Rescue operations are ongoing but have been hampered by poor weather, and his family is appealing for any information from other hikers who may have been in the area.</p>

          <p>As Japan marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the focus is shifting to preserving the stories of the survivors, or "hibakusha," as their numbers dwindle. With the average age of survivors now over 86, museums and younger "successors" are taking on the responsibility of conveying the horrors of the nuclear attack. One such successor, a 12-year-old boy, guides foreign tourists to ensure the first-person accounts of the tragedy are not lost. The goal is to use the truth of the past to educate future generations and spread a message of peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to expectations, a new Gallup report reveals that Gen Z employees are the least likely generation to favor fully remote work arrangements. Only 23% of Gen Z workers prefer being fully remote, compared to 35% of older generations, with a strong majority of 71% favoring a hybrid model. The report suggests this preference is driven by a desire for in-person connection, mentorship, and a clearer understanding of their role within the organization. The findings indicate that younger workers, despite their digital fluency, crave the developmental and social benefits of being in a physical workplace.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is warning of an "unprecedented" hunger crisis in northern Nigeria, where an estimated 5 million children are already suffering from acute malnutrition. The crisis is driven by a combination of protracted insecurity from jihadist groups and banditry, which prevents farming, and critical funding shortfalls for aid organizations like the World Food Programme. Displaced persons are unable to return to their farmlands, and aid programs are being forced to shut down. Analysts state the root cause is a failure of governance and security, creating a dire humanitarian emergency.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the renewed diplomatic interest in the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral forum as a potential stabilizing force in Asia. For Russia, isolated by the West, the RIC forum offers a way to project influence and counter its growing dependency on China. For China, it helps stabilize its continental flank amid maritime tensions, while for India, it's a complex balancing act. The article questions whether these three powers can genuinely cooperate or if the revival is merely strategic choreography driven by geopolitical necessity in a multipolar world.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. citizens are speaking out after being wrongfully arrested and jailed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during raids in Los Angeles. One woman, Andrea Velez, described being violently detained while walking to work and later charged with assaulting an officer, a charge that was eventually dropped. The incidents are part of a broader pattern of aggressive tactics and prosecutions against bystanders and those who object to ICE arrests. The accounts highlight the chaotic nature of the raids and raise serious questions about civil rights violations and the accountability of federal agents.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, a perinatal psychiatrist expresses deep concern over misinformation about the use of SSRIs during pregnancy, particularly following a recent FDA advisory panel discussion. The author argues that the panel overstated risks and minimized the real harms of untreated maternal mental health conditions, which can be severe for both mother and child. Citing robust data that supports the relative safety of these medications when clinically needed, the psychiatrist criticizes the spread of fear and doubt. The article calls for evidence-based guidance to ensure patients can make informed decisions about their health.</p>
