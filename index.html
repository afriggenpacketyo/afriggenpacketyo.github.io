            <p>Chinese officials are pressuring the U.S. to entirely eliminate reciprocal tariffs as the trade war between the two economic giants persists. Despite Trump's recent announcement of a 90-day pause on global tariffs, increased levies on Chinese imports to 145% remain a point of contention. While the U.S. administration has suggested potential exemptions for some technology products, including those manufactured in China, uncertainty looms due to plans for a separate "semiconductor tariff." U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that there are currently no plans for direct talks between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping.</p>

            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have no scheduled talks amidst escalating trade tensions. Despite Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports from all foreign countries, China retaliated by raising tariffs on U.S. goods. Greer insists the U.S. is focused on reshoring American manufacturing and addressing the trade deficit. He also noted that China's decision to retaliate is the primary reason for the current trade impasse, as other countries have expressed a willingness to negotiate with the U.S.</p>

            <p>Manchester City Women's team is facing questions about squad depth and injury management after a season plagued by key player absences. Interim manager Nick Cushing acknowledges a review is needed to address the high number of injuries and the team's failure to win a trophy. Unlike rivals Chelsea, who made significant signings to cover injured stars, City's January signings were limited, raising concerns about their ability to compete at the highest level. Former City captain Steph Houghton emphasizes the need to address the lack of depth in the squad.</p>

            <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has accused President Trump of "weaponizing" the global trading system with import tariffs, potentially leading to a breakdown in the global economic order. Brown urges governments and central banks to develop a global rescue plan, similar to the response during the 2008 financial crisis, including coordinated interest rate cuts. He believes finance ministers and central bankers should discuss ways to bolster the global economy at upcoming meetings, cautioning that inaction could result in a depression reminiscent of the 1930s.</p>

In the skit, SNL explored the subject in several different ways; some were more genuinely amusing than others, but all captured the anxiety many Americans are feeling, across class lines. The skit reminds the audience that interpreting a big political story by way of a weekly grocery list makes it terrifyingly real.</p>
