          <p>The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination of Stephen Miran, President Trump's economic advisor, for a Federal Reserve governor position. This vote occurs amidst a legal challenge where a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump from firing another Fed governor, Lisa Cook. The nomination also comes a week before the Fed board is set to discuss potential interest rate cuts, a move Trump has been advocating for months. Miran's potential confirmation and service until January 31 is facing scrutiny from Senate Democrats who want him to resign from his current council position. The nomination process reflects ongoing tensions between the executive branch and the Federal Reserve. Optimism surrounds the potential for stability in financial leadership, despite political hurdles.</p>

          <p>Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf has expressed concerns about the U.S. economy, noting a significant divide between thriving corporations and struggling lower-income consumers. While companies are generally in good financial shape and spending remains steady across income levels, lower earners are depleting their savings and living close to the edge. Scharf's comments follow JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's assessment of a weakening economy based on a recent Labor Department report showing slowed hiring. Scharf suggests that there is a greater risk of economic downturn than potential for growth, especially considering the impact of trade policies on job creation. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic but underscores the need for attention to economic disparities.</p>

Despite reporting a net loss in the second quarter, Klarna's revenue increased by 20%, and the company aims to reposition itself as a digital retail bank, and the IPO serves as a test of investor confidence in this new direction.</p>

          <p>Wholesale prices unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, potentially easing pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The producer price index (PPI), which measures input costs for goods and services, dropped after a downwardly revised increase in July. Core PPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also decreased by 0.1%, signaling a slowdown in inflation at the producer level. This development could influence the Fed's upcoming decision on interest rates, with futures market pricing indicating a high probability of a rate cut. The report offers a mixed outlook, but the decline in wholesale prices may contribute to economic stability.</p>

          <p>Thomas Skinner, a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing, has apologized for taking a journalist's phone during press interviews, explaining that he saw a message about a personal story from his past. Skinner stated that the message caught him off guard and he felt it best to step away to gather himself, clarifying that the incident was unrelated to Strictly. He emphasized his excitement about participating in the show and expressed gratitude for the support he has received. The incident follows some controversy surrounding Skinner's selection for the show, given his political views, but the BBC has defended the decision.</p>

          <p>David Coote, a former Premier League referee, has been charged with making an indecent image of a child following an investigation by Nottinghamshire Police. The charge relates to a video file recovered by officers in February, and Coote is due to appear in court. This follows Coote's sacking by the PGMOL last year for comments made about Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp. He has also been banned by the FA and UEFA for separate incidents. The legal proceedings and past controversies cast a shadow over Coote's career.</p>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich will merge to create the UK's first "super-university," known as the London and South East University Group, starting in autumn 2026. The new institution will have one vice-chancellor and operate across existing campuses, with the aim of providing a strong financial foundation. While the universities insist the move is not driven by financial crisis, the merger is likely to provoke anxiety among staff about long-term prospects. The Office for Students has welcomed the move, suggesting more universities may explore similar options as they battle economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Over 270 million children worldwide are not enrolled in school, with millions more at risk due to cuts in international aid for education. The situation is particularly dire in conflict-affected countries like Sudan, Gaza, and Afghanistan, where violence and instability disrupt education systems. The absence of schooling deprives children of meals, stability, and support, and has long-term economic consequences. Efforts to keep children in class, such as underground classrooms in Ukraine and makeshift schools in Gaza and Sudan, offer hope amid the crisis, however the issue still remains.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy, plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 9,000 positions, or 11.5%, as part of a company-wide transformation. The move aims to simplify the organization, improve decision-making speed, and reallocate resources towards growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity. The headcount reduction will incur a one-off cost of 8 billion Danish kroner, leading to a revised operating profit growth forecast for the year. The overhaul comes after CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar took over the reins, and as the company faces increasing competition and supply chain issues. The company aims to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>Space law is facing a crisis as the line blurs between civilian and military uses, alongside concerns about satellite collisions, flight congestion, and space debris. Existing space treaties, such as the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, are outdated and insufficient to address current challenges. While some countries have tried to circumnavigate global treaties with their own legislation, the increasing number of states entering space calls for updated international frameworks. Experts suggest that diplomatic norms, financial penalties for bad actors, and data sharing are potential ways forward to ensure space security. The need for updated legal frameworks is growing.</p>

A report alleges that Weleda ordered raw materials from a garden in the Dachau camp, and that the cream was used in human experiments. The company has condemned the Nazi regime's atrocities and committed to transparently researching its history. A separate report in 2023 found no evidence that the cream was tested on prisoners kept in freezing conditions. The company is committed to investigating and to transparency.</p>

          <p>A mural by Banksy, depicting a judge looming over a protester, has been removed from the wall of a court building in London due to its listed status. The artwork, which appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice complex, has been interpreted as a comment on the arrest of protestors. The courts service confirmed that it is legally obliged to maintain the character of the building, leading to the mural's removal. The piece has been reported as criminal damage, and inquiries are ongoing. The removal is unfortunate, though is a neccessity to keep the historical structure intact.</p>

          <p>A decades-long study of songbirds in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire is providing insights into forest changes. Researchers have been mapping songbird territories since 1969, documenting how bird populations have responded to the aging and regrowth of the forest. The study has revealed the disappearance of certain bird species and shifts in habitat use, reflecting broader ecosystem changes. The project, which relies on decades of data, faces funding challenges but continues to offer valuable information about environmental change. The effort is admirable and will hopefully continue.</p>

Lepore contends that the Founders intended for the Constitution to change over time, and that the failure to amend it is a lost opportunity. She criticizes the dominance of originalism, arguing that it is a way to effect constitutional change while pretending otherwise. Lepore's analysis challenges the notion of a "dead" Constitution and emphasizes the importance of amendment in adapting to societal needs. The topic is very timely.</p>
