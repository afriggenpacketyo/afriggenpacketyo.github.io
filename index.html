          <p>Samsung Electronics reported first-quarter operating profit and revenue that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by robust sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The South Korean tech giant's revenue increased by 10% year-over-year, reaching a record quarterly high, while operating profit rose by 1.5%. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and global growth slowdown, Samsung anticipates improved performance in the second half of the year, contingent on diminished uncertainties. Samsung is a leading manufacturer of memory chips and the world's second-largest smartphone maker.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, comprising 78 articles aimed at reinforcing the country's private sector. The law, effective from May 20, seeks to promote fair market competition, improve the investment and financing environment, and encourage private firms' participation in scientific projects and technological innovation, as well as safeguard their economic rights and interests. Chinese leaders hope the new law will boost morale among private businesses, particularly amid ongoing trade tensions with the US. The drafting of this law, led by the National Development and Reform Commission, began in 2024.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, have identified $334 million in improper payment requests through its new automated payment system. These requests were flagged due to missing or invalid budget codes, or budget codes lacking authorization. This discovery follows DOGE's previous finding of a nearly untraceable budget line item responsible for $4.7 trillion in payments due to an optional Treasury Access Symbol (TAS) field. DOGE continues its efforts to identify savings and fraud across all aspects of the government, with $160 billion in savings discovered to date.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying tariffs for carmakers, removing some levies that Ford, General Motors, and others had complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing. The changes will modify Trumpâ€™s tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, for example on steel and aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico, according to the orders. However, the rules do not appear to protect automakers from tariffs on steel and aluminum that their suppliers pay and pass on. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over the next two years.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global is entering mediation to resolve President Trump's $20 billion lawsuit regarding a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris, with the board agreeing on parameters for a potential settlement. Trump's lawsuit alleges that CBS deceptively edited the interview to support Harris's election chances. Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder, is pushing for a settlement to facilitate Paramount's sale to Skydance Media, although this has sparked internal protests. Bill Owens, the executive producer of "60 Minutes," resigned due to increased corporate pressure over coverage, as Paramount seeks approval from the Trump administration for the Skydance deal.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has voiced his support for legislation that would increase the punishment to a felony for soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex, a stance that puts him at odds with some Democrats in the state Assembly. The bill seeks to criminalize loitering with intent to buy sex and build on existing state law to make it a felony to solicit anyone under 18 for sex. Currently, it is a felony in California to pay for sex with a minor under the age of 16, and state law also carries stronger felony penalties for sexual trafficking a minor under age 18. Democrats had initially removed the felony charge for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds from the legislation.</p>

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. have significantly decreased due to the Trump administration's high tariffs, prompting warnings from major U.S. retailers about impending supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%, while China has retaliated with 125% tariffs on U.S. products. At the Port of Los Angeles, shipments are down 10% compared to last year, with expectations of a further 35% drop in arrivals. Retailers had previously rushed to import goods ahead of the tariffs, but the increased costs have essentially halted shipments from China, potentially leading to empty shelves and price hikes for consumers. </p>

          <p>Harvard University is promising to review its academic offerings and admissions policies in response to internal reports on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice, commissioned after pro-Palestinian protests. The university is simultaneously battling the Trump administration over demands to limit campus activism, with the government freezing $2.2 billion in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber said the university has made "necessary changes and essential progress" but promised further action. Harvard will review admissions processes to ensure applicants can engage constructively with different perspectives and will work to hold professors to new standards of "excellence."</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to disburse $12 million in congressionally approved grant money that it had withheld from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a federally funded news organization providing independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that Congress had ordained that the funds should go to the news organization. The administration had terminated the grant in March but was blocked by the judge, who stated that Trump cannot unilaterally shut down an organization funded by Congress. The administration then withheld the money while negotiating new terms of the grant agreement, seeking powers to pause funds and control the outlet's board.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month, as the car industry grapples with regulatory uncertainty and additional costs due to the levies. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies, such as an additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Under the order, additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>

The settlement aims to provide some measure of closure to victims of horrific abuse and rapes, with the county planning to fund the settlement through bonds and its rainy day fund.
