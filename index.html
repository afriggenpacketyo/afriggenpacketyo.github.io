          <p>The Justice Department has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center. Simultaneously, they dropped a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka, who was arrested during the same incident when trying to join the congressional delegation's oversight visit. McIver maintains that ICE agents instigated the confrontation, while Habba stated the charges against McIver are due to her assaulting, impeding, and interfering with law enforcement. The congresswoman asserts that the charges are politically motivated and aimed at deterring legislative oversight, as she and the mayor have been critical of the ICE facility. This article from the New York Times provides a comprehensive overview of the events and the political fallout.</p>

Vendors demonstrated how AI could enhance combat decision-making, improve daily training, and assist in intelligence gathering and physical training. EverReach AI, a Beijing-based start-up, presented an AI-assisted military training model featuring a flight map near the Taiwan Strait, suggesting its possible use in refining drills around Taiwan. The system learns from flight training sessions, including weather conditions and pilot habits, to recommend actions, also offering an 'intelligent assistant' for military commanders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move aims to stimulate the economy amid a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. The rate cuts followed reductions in deposit rates by state-backed commercial lenders, protecting their net interest margin. Economists anticipate further policy easing, with forecasts of additional lending rate reductions by year-end, as the offshore yuan has strengthened against the dollar due to trade de-escalation and Beijing's preference for currency stability.

          <p>The UK and EU have reached a deal aimed at improving trading ties, but it underscores the continued complexities of their relationship post-Brexit. The agreement seeks to reduce trade frictions, though many details regarding timeframes and costs remain to be negotiated. Some Brexiteers are concerned about the acceptance of 'dynamic alignment' with EU rules, which they see as a compromise of sovereignty. Despite the government's claims of a 'reset,' the ongoing negotiations will determine the real-world impact of the deal, including costs, defense cooperation, youth travel, and mutual recognition of professional qualifications, showing that the uneasy relationship between the UK and its neighbors continues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as a temporary Air Force One due to delays in the delivery of new planes from Boeing. The idea emerged after the White House Military Office and the Defense Department compiled a list of available 747s with business-jet layouts, and Trump himself inspected the Qatari jet in Florida. However, the potential arrangement has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, raising ethical concerns and questions about the financial implications of refitting and operating the plane, as the cost of retrofits could be at least $1 billion.</p>

The dispensary features a cannabis consumption lounge, a bar with cannabis-infused drinks, and a Ganja Giggle Garden, and the incident occurred shortly after a suspected attempted burglary at another dispensary co-founded by the same individuals.</p>

CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build its factory in Hungary, supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen.

U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed his disappointment with the Justice Department's decision to settle the wrongful death claim. Babbitt's death has been a rallying point for Trump loyalists, as the lawsuit alleged U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in the use of force, but the U.S. Capitol Police said Byrd saved lives and did not engage in misconduct.</p>

The controversy stems from a flagrant foul committed by Clark on Reese during a recent game, with Griffin claiming that Reese 'hates Caitlin Clark.'</p>

          <p>Hawaii's coral reefs are experiencing widespread bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures, threatening marine life and coastal protection. Marine scientist Greg Asner, who leads Allen Coral Atlas, said the decline of coral reefs is worse in the Great Barrier Reef and the Galapagos Islands, and most severe in the Caribbean and Florida. Without healthy reefs, aquatic creatures lose their habitats, and coastlines lose natural protection from storms, which can cause billions of dollars in flood damage. Efforts are underway to educate tourists about reef-safe sunscreens and to implement underwater nurseries to help corals repair and regrow.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers focus on a new trade deal between the UK and EU, touted as a 'Brexit reset,' with promises of boosting the economy but criticism over fishing rights. Also covered is Donald Trump's phone call with Vladimir Putin, where he offered a trade deal in exchange for ending the Ukraine war. The papers also report on Britain, France, and Canada's warning to Netanyahu over Gaza and the condemnation of Israel for its actions, as they tackle the backlash against Sir Keir with a blunt assessment from Boris Johnson.</p>
