          <p>A 20-year-old student has been found guilty of assaulting two police officers during a violent altercation at Manchester Airport in July of last year. The incident, captured on mobile phones and widely shared, showed Mohammed Fahir Amaaz punching one officer, which broke her nose, and knocking another to the ground. He was also convicted for an earlier assault on a member of the public inside the airport's Starbucks. The jury could not reach a verdict on two other assault charges against Amaaz and his brother, prompting prosecutors to seek a retrial.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether senior citizens who already receive Social Security benefits should also purchase annuities for additional financial security. While annuities can offer a diversified and guaranteed income stream, supplementing Social Security and protecting against outliving savings, they also have drawbacks. These include illiquidity, complexity, and various fees that can reduce returns. The decision depends heavily on an individual's financial situation, risk tolerance, and life expectancy, making it a choice that requires careful consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of eight Senate Democrats, citing a little-known federal law, has formally requested that the Department of Justice release its complete investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein by August 15. The law allows any five members of the Senate Governmental Affairs panel to compel an executive agency to provide requested information. This move escalates pressure on the Trump administration, which Democrats accuse of failing to follow through on earlier promises to declassify and release the documents. The letter highlights the public's right to transparency regarding one of history's most notorious sex trafficking operations.</p>

          <p>A British brother and sister, aged 13 and 11, have tragically drowned off Llarga beach in Salou, Spain. The children were pulled from the water by emergency services on Tuesday evening along with their father, who survived but was in a state of exhaustion.

          <p>New York City police have revealed that the gunman in the Park Avenue skyscraper shooting constructed the AR-15-style rifle used in the attack himself from various parts. Investigators are now questioning an associate about the supply of these components as they trace the shooter's path from Las Vegas to New York. The gunman, who had a history of mental health issues and a recently expired security license, drove across the country before the attack. This new detail adds a critical element to the investigation into how he acquired the high-powered weapon.</p>

          <p>The French Rugby Federation (FFR) is actively seeking to establish a long-term partnership with the British and Irish Lions, moving beyond one-off warm-up matches. FFR officials believe the strength of French club rugby and the proximity for traveling fans make a tour of France an enticing prospect. They propose creating new opportunities within the revised global rugby calendar, such as a special game every four years, without disrupting the Lions' traditional tours. This revival of the rivalry, last seen in a 1989 fixture, could provide new, high-stakes challenges for a strong French national team.</p>

          <p>An explosion at the Horizon Biofuels plant in Fremont, Nebraska, has resulted in the deaths of three people: an adult male employee and two young girls. The girls, both under the age of 12, were reportedly at the facility waiting for a relative to go to a doctor's appointment. The massive blast on Tuesday tore apart the facility, which produces animal bedding and wood pellets, and the subsequent fire hampered initial rescue efforts. The incident has been declared a tragedy by the city's mayor, with the operation shifting from rescue to recovery.</p>

          <p>A new form of geothermal energy, known as "superhot geothermal," is being developed to meet the massive power demands of the artificial intelligence era. This technology involves drilling miles deep to access extremely hot rocks, which can generate five to ten times more power per well than conventional geothermal methods. Startups like Quaise Energy are pioneering the technology, which uses electromagnetic beams to vaporize rock and reach temperatures over 900 degrees Fahrenheit. The approach is seen as a way to provide a consistent, carbon-free energy source essential for powering data centers.</p>
