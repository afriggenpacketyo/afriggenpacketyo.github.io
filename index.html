          <p>Combat sport clubs are being used to boost recruitment for the white nationalist hate group Patriot Front, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. These Active Clubs, smaller networks of white supremacist groups, train members in mixed martial arts and bond over white nationalist ideologies. Patriot Front is using these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, evading researchers and law enforcement. The report highlights the expansion of extremist groups in the U.S. and the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and hateful beliefs.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings has downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing government debt and rising interest costs. The downgrade reflects concerns over the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address large fiscal deficits. The decision is expected to slightly increase the yield investors demand for U.S. Treasury debt. The downgrade aligns Moody's with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, which had previously lowered the U.S. credit rating.</p>

          <p>Over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will reach its target of having women occupy 30 percent of top corporate roles by 2030. They cite slow shifts in views among the male-dominated executive class as a major obstacle. A Kyodo News survey revealed that 73 percent believe a shift in top management's views is needed, while 54 percent emphasize the need to change company culture.

          <p>The United States has seen a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional figures showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. This marks the steepest single-year decline in 45 years, bringing deaths back to pre-pandemic levels. The growing availability of naloxone and policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to this reversal. While deaths from synthetic opioids are falling, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat.</p>

Aides have been meeting with industry leaders and policy experts to discuss proposals, but the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has not been invited to participate. The process has drawn criticism due to conflicting interests within Trump's base, as some conservatives oppose IVF due to concerns about the loss of embryos. The White House is aiming for a holistic fertility policy amid concerns about the declining U.S. birthrate.</p>
