          <p>Ukrainian forces have reportedly conducted a long-range drone strike on a key Russian oil pumping station, causing a fire and operational halt. In a significant development, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine has received a US-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel, which has been operational for a month. This move is considered surprising given Israel's previous reluctance to provide military aid and its complex relationship with Russia. The shift in Israel's stance is seen as a response to Russia's strengthening ties with Iran, marking a notable change in geopolitical alignments in the region.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to handle what he describes as "domestic terrorists" and protect federal facilities. He stated he would authorize the use of full force if necessary, framing the decision as a response to attacks on an ICE facility by groups he identifies as Antifa. This move follows similar federal deployments in other cities and has been met with resistance from local officials, including Portland's mayor, who stated that federal intervention was neither requested nor needed. The announcement signals an escalation in the administration's confrontational approach to civil unrest.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the profound influence of young adult literature, using Judy Blume's iconic novel "Forever" as a central example. Published 50 years ago, the book was a rite of passage for many teenagers, offering a rare and honest depiction of female sexuality and desire from a woman's perspective. Such novels provide a crucial space for young readers to see their own anxieties and curiosities reflected, validating their internal experiences. The piece argues that the art and literature discovered during adolescence hold a unique power, helping to shape identity and understanding of the world in formative ways.</p>

          <p>Hollywood legend Dick Van Dyke, at 99 years old, continues to demonstrate remarkable vitality, as captured in a recent social media post by musician Rick Springfield. Springfield shared a photo of himself with Van Dyke at a Malibu gym, expressing awe at the entertainer's dedication and energy. He noted that Van Dyke not only worked out on every machine but also performed a little dance step afterward. The encounter highlights Van Dyke's enduring spirit, especially in light of a recent illness that caused him to miss a comedy event, and provides an uplifting moment for fans of both stars.</p>

          <p>Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth has abruptly summoned hundreds of high-ranking generals and admirals from around the world to an unusual meeting in Virginia, causing anxiety and speculation among military officials. The gathering is reportedly intended for Hegseth to deliver an address on military standards and the "warrior ethos," which his team plans to record and release publicly. This unprecedented move comes after Hegseth has dismissed over a dozen senior officials and ordered cuts to the number of flag officers.

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist who became the first Black woman television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Davis broke into the industry during the 1960s, a time when it was dominated by white men, and became a trusted and respected figure in Bay Area news. Throughout her career, she covered major historical events, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning eight regional Emmy Awards. Colleagues and public figures remember her as a courageous and graceful mentor who opened doors for a new generation of journalists of color and women.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated journalist and writer known for his unconventional television interviews, has died at the age of 103. Born in Vienna to a Jewish family, he fled the Nazis at 16, later returning to Europe as a US soldier where he served as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He eventually settled in Paris and became a prominent correspondent for German television, creating the legendary interview show "Personenbeschreibung." Troller's sensitive and subjective style, which he described as a form of "self-healing," changed the landscape of television journalism and left a lasting legacy.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has suggested that certain individuals are actively trying to sabotage a reconciliation with his father, King Charles, following their recent meeting. In a statement, his spokesperson described media reports about the reunion as "categorically false" and "pure invention" from sources intent on undermining the relationship. The meeting at Clarence House was their first face-to-face encounter in over a year and was seen as a potential step toward healing the family rift. The statement also corrected details about a gift exchanged, clarifying that a framed photograph given to the King did not include the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p>

          <p>In response to a question about an attack on a federal facility, former President Donald Trump blamed the "radical left" for causing political violence in the country. He asserted that their rhetoric is inciting problems and warned that the situation will worsen. Trump suggested that the political right is "a lot tougher" and that there will be a point where they "won't take it anymore," implying a potential for retaliatory violence. Critics condemned his remarks as a dangerous and thinly veiled threat, arguing that such language could incite further conflict and heighten political tensions across the nation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's recent warnings against pregnant women taking Tylenol (acetaminophen) represent a dangerous and misogynistic attack on women's health. The author contends that the advice to "tough it out" is based on an unproven link to autism and dismisses the real medical risks of untreated fevers during pregnancy. The piece frames this as part of a broader historical pattern of the medical establishment downplaying or ignoring women's pain. The author concludes that the administration's focus on Tylenol is not a genuine health concern but another attempt to control women's bodies and choices.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a warning about foreign attempts to illegally acquire the country's strategic mineral resources, specifically highlighting the rare metal antimony. The ministry revealed it had uncovered two smuggling cases, one involving a family-run network and another by a group of traffickers, who were attempting to circumvent China's export controls. According to the ministry, these actions are driven by foreign nations seeking to expand their own reserves of critical resources. The agency stated that such smuggling operations pose a direct threat to China's national security and economic interests.</p>

          <p>Major players in the online dating industry, including Bumble and Match Group, are incorporating advanced AI to combat user swipe fatigue and create more meaningful connections. The new vision involves using AI as an "emotionally intelligent matchmaker" that goes beyond superficial criteria, focusing instead on shared values, goals, and life beliefs by analyzing user responses to in-depth questions. However, the article questions whether this approach is truly groundbreaking, citing past experiments where a site's suggestion of compatibility mattered more than actual compatibility scores. Ultimately, romantic chemistry remains unpredictable, and the true test of a connection still requires an in-person meeting.</p>

          <p>Unidentified drones have been observed flying near several Danish military facilities, including the country's largest airbase in Karup, prompting a brief closure of its airspace. This follows a series of similar incidents earlier in the week that disrupted operations at major airports in Denmark and led to possible sightings in Norway, Germany, and Lithuania. The repeated incursions have heightened concerns about national security and vulnerability to aerial attacks. While Danish authorities have described the activity as a potential "hybrid attack," they have not officially attributed the drones to any specific actor, though fears of Russian involvement are growing in the region.</p>

While some allies praise his diligence and performance on the world stage, many feel he lacks the gut political instinct of a leader.

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power in Africa through its government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture and now operate in 49 countries on the continent. These institutes offer scholarships and language training, enabling Africans like Miradie Tchekpo from Benin to secure jobs with Chinese companies. However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in spreading Chinese political ideology, interfering with academic freedom at host universities, and serving as a tool for economic leverage. Analysts suggest that while the programs offer opportunities, they also advance Beijing's strategic interests, potentially at the expense of local cultures and democratic principles.</p>
