            <p>Global markets experienced an upswing as U.S. futures indicated a possible rise amidst uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff plans. The administration's announcement of exemptions for many consumer electronics from reciprocal tariffs boosted market confidence, and Trump signaled a willingness to ease levies further, particularly for car companies. European markets also climbed following the European Commission President's pause on planned tariff countermeasures. However, markets in China, where tariffs remain in effect, showed less enthusiasm compared to other regions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of weakening as job vacancies have fallen to their lowest level in nearly four years, indicating a decline in demand for workers. While average UK pay continues to rise, increases in employer National Insurance Contributions and National Minimum Wage hikes are expected to impact salaries. The number of workers on payrolls also dropped in March, suggesting that businesses are pausing hiring in response to rising employment costs. The unemployment rate remains at 4.4%, but the ONS has cautioned that the jobs figures should be treated with caution.</p>

The senators argue that this decision violates the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 and puts vulnerable children at risk of trafficking and exploitation. While the administration has agreed to extend the contract for six months, the future of legal protections for these children remains uncertain. Concerns are rising about ensuring these children understand their rights and have access to independent legal services.</p>

            <p>Europe's aversion to American poultry, often dubbed "chlorinated chicken," stems from the practice of using chlorine to reduce harmful bacteria during processing. While this practice was once common in the U.S., most poultry processing facilities now use organic acids. The European Union prohibits chemical treatments on poultry, viewing them as a way to mask inadequate hygiene standards. While studies show that the chemical washes themselves do not pose a risk to human health, European regulators prioritize a "farm to fork" approach to food safety.</p>

            <p>A U.S. Justice Department investigation into the hacking of climate activists has revealed a link between the alleged attacker and some of the victims. Public tax filings show that DCI Group, a lobbying firm that allegedly commissioned the hacking, was also consulting for New Venture Fund, a nonprofit working on progressive causes. The investigation focuses on an Israeli private investigator, Amit Forlit, who is accused of orchestrating the hacking to gather information to foil lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry. The connection raises questions about the role of DCI's relationship with New Venture Fund in the alleged targeting of climate activists.</p>

            <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, is scheduled to appear in court. Routh is charged with holding a rifle near Trump's golf club and faces five federal charges. The hearing will focus on the rifle and whether defense experts can examine it. Prosecutors argue that Routh's intent to kill Trump is the primary issue, regardless of the rifle's functionality. Routh's lawyers are seeking access to the rifle for testing.</p>

            <p>A whistleblower alleges that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, accessed sensitive data from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The whistleblower claims DOGE engineers asked that their activities not be logged and appeared to cover their tracks. The data potentially includes information on unions, legal cases, and corporate secrets. Concerns are raised about potential misuse of the data, conflicts of interest, and the security of the information. The NLRB denies granting DOGE access to its systems.</p>

A team of advisers from President Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency initiative arrived at the Southeast Washington, D.C., headquarters of the National Labor Relations Board. The DOGE employees, who are effectively led by White House adviser and billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, appeared to have their sights set on accessing the NLRB's internal systems. Meanwhile, members of the DOGE team asked that their activities not be logged on the system and then appeared to try to cover their tracks behind them, turning off monitoring tools and manually deleting records of their access.</p>

The US relies heavily on chip imports from Taiwan, and Taiwan's government is running simulations and seeking talks with the US to ensure fair competition for its chip industry.</p>
