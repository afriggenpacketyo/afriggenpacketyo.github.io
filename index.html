          <p>Minnesota's Democratic Governor, Tim Walz, has announced he will seek a rare third consecutive term, a feat never before accomplished in the state's history. His campaign is highlighting progressive legislative victories, including codified abortion rights and legalized marijuana, while promising to address gun violence and government fraud. However, Walz faces significant political headwinds, including polling that suggests half of Minnesotans oppose his run and intense scrutiny over his administration's handling of the massive "Feeding Our Future" fraud scandal, which has become a central issue for his Republican opponents.</p>

This legal trouble comes as DeGeneres faces renewed criticism over a toxic workplace environment on her former show, which contributed to her recent move to the U.K. after President Trump's 2024 election victory.</p>

          <p>Two newly elected Labour MPs, Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley, were barred from entering Israel while on a parliamentary delegation to the occupied West Bank. The MPs, both doctors, intended to visit medical facilities and meet with human rights organizations to assess healthcare challenges in the region. The UK Foreign Office condemned the decision as "totally unacceptable," marking the second time this year that British parliamentarians have been denied entry by Israeli authorities, escalating diplomatic tensions over access and political speech.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, in the U.S. to help build a Hyundai and LG electric car battery plant, were detained in a large-scale immigration raid. The engineers, some on short-term visas or visa waivers, describe being handcuffed, chained, and held in freezing conditions with unsanitary water, despite believing their presence was legal. The incident has strained relations between the two allied nations, prompting an investigation by Seoul into potential human rights violations and an expression of "deep regrets" from a U.S. diplomat.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old wild burro named Cupid is recovering after being shot through the lung with a hunting arrow in Moreno Valley, California. This is the latest of at least six similar attacks on the federally protected animals since June, prompting a non-profit rescue group to offer a $24,000 reward for information. These burros are considered an iconic symbol of the region and even assist in wildfire prevention by grazing on dry brush, making the targeted cruelty particularly disturbing to the local community.</p>

          <p>Winfield House, the official residence of the U.S. ambassador to the UK, serves as a center for American diplomacy and hospitality in London, currently hosting President Trump during his state visit. Located in Regent's Park, the 35-room mansion boasts the second-largest private garden in central London and has a rich history of entertaining royalty, political leaders, and celebrities. Originally rebuilt by Woolworths heiress Barbara Hutton, it was sold to the U.S. government for one dollar in 1946 and has since hosted every U.S. president.</p>

          <p>Following the dismissal of head coach DeShaun Foster after an 0-3 start, UCLA has named Tim Skipper as its interim coach. Skipper, who has deep ties to the Foster family and previously served as a special assistant, faces the challenge of stabilizing a program with struggling offense and defense. He has prior interim coaching experience at Fresno State, where he led the team to a bowl game victory and was praised for his relentlessly positive leadership style and ability to foster belief among players during difficult circumstances.</p>

          <p>Several individuals across the U.S. have been fired or disciplined by their employers for making public comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Those who lost their jobs include a sports reporter, a university employee, and an MSNBC analyst, whose employers cited violations of company policy or reputational harm. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for public speech, as First Amendment protections are limited in the private sector, highlighting the professional risks of commenting on politically charged events.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again extended the deadline for Chinese company ByteDance to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok, pushing the date to December 16. A framework deal has reportedly been reached that would see an investor consortium, including Oracle and Silver Lake, own about 80% of the new U.S.-based entity. The extension prevents the Department of Justice from enforcing a national security law that would have effectively banned the popular app in the U.S. while the final terms of the complex deal are negotiated.</p>
