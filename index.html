          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially ended talks with the Chinese e-commerce company JD.com regarding the sale of its general merchandise chain, Argos. The discussions were terminated after JD.com proposed a 'materially revised set of terms' that Sainsbury's concluded were not in the best interest of its shareholders. Despite the collapsed deal, Sainsbury’s reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve an underlying retail operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. The potential acquisition was seen as a way for JD.com to leverage its expertise in technology and logistics to grow the Argos brand.</p>

          <p>The concluding stage of the Vuelta a Espana was abruptly abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the race course in central Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down safety barriers and occupied the road, making it impossible for the cyclists to proceed safely. This incident was the culmination of several protests targeting the Israel-Premier Tech team throughout the multi-stage race, which had already led to course alterations and safety concerns among riders. As a result of the cancellation, Danish cyclist Jonas Vingegaard, who was the leader entering the final stage, was declared the overall winner of the prestigious cycling competition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, University of Chicago professor Robert Pape described the current political climate in the U.S. as a 'watershed moment' for an era of 'violent populism.' He cited a rising trend of political violence and a corresponding increase in public support for such actions on both the right and the left, pointing to recent assassinations and attempts on political figures. Pape's research indicates that this trend is rooted in major social and demographic shifts, specifically the country's transition toward a white-minority democracy, rather than being caused solely by the internet, which he views as an accelerant. He urged political leaders to condemn violence unequivocally to prevent the situation from worsening.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested a significant portion of his nearly $80 million in career earnings into various tech startups and venture capital funds. His portfolio includes investments in AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. Barkley adopted this strategy early in his career, choosing to live off his endorsement deals while investing his NFL salary to build long-term, generational wealth. Initially focused on safer investments like S&P 500 index funds, he has more recently embraced riskier ventures, including a significant investment in bitcoin that has reportedly yielded substantial returns. This approach was partly motivated by a major injury in 2020, which highlighted the finite nature of a professional football career.</p>

In a recent interview, Bates acknowledged that the medication helped her lose the final 15 to 20 pounds but emphasized that the majority of her 100-pound transformation was the result of years of dedicated effort following a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. She detailed how the health scare motivated her to overhaul her lifestyle, a slow process that required significant personal discipline. Bates, who is nominated for an Emmy for her role in the reboot of 'Matlock,' also spoke about the emotional adjustment to her new body after shedding the weight.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, law enforcement has provided a comprehensive overview of the investigation that led to the arrest of 22-year-old suspect Tyler Robinson. Investigators used campus security footage to track Robinson's movements, observing him enter a building near the event, ascend to the roof from where the single shot was fired, and flee the scene. A high-powered, bolt-action rifle, believed to be the murder weapon, was recovered in a nearby wooded area, wrapped in a towel. The suspect was ultimately apprehended after his father recognized him from publicly released images and urged him to surrender to authorities. Robinson is now in custody on charges including aggravated murder.</p>

The family insists that his status should not shield him from the law and that if any participation in abuse is found, he should face severe legal penalties. Giuffre, who took her own life in April, alleged that Epstein introduced her to the prince when she was 17 and that he abused her on three occasions.</p>

          <p>Data from NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission has provided crucial new insights for planetary defense strategies. When the DART spacecraft intentionally collided with the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos, it ejected an astonishing 35.3 million pounds of rock and dust into space. This massive plume of debris acted like a rocket thruster, giving the asteroid a much stronger push than the impact alone and significantly altering its orbit by 33 minutes. The findings confirm that Dimorphos is a loosely bound 'rubble pile,' making it more susceptible to this type of kinetic impact. This 'ejecta bonus' is now a critical factor for scientists designing future missions to deflect potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids.</p>

          <p>'Buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna are rapidly gaining popularity, with an estimated 86.5 million American users in 2024. These services allow consumers to split purchases into short-term, often interest-free installments, presenting a direct challenge to the traditional credit card market. For banks and credit card companies, every transaction financed through BNPL represents lost revenue from interchange fees and interest. Furthermore, financial institutions are wary because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating a 'giant black hole' in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of visibility makes it difficult for lenders to accurately assess a person's total debt and overall credit risk.</p>

          <p>In a joint bipartisan appearance, Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Lankford (R-OK) discussed the growing problem of political violence in the U.S., catalyzed by the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk. Both senators identified the internet and social media algorithms as a powerful 'accelerant' driving extremism by pushing the angriest and most divisive content to the forefront. They argued that while the internet is not the sole cause, it amplifies underlying societal divisions. The senators called for leaders from both parties to condemn violence and advocated for legislative action, such as the Kids Online Safety Act, to mitigate some of the harms posed by online platforms.</p>

          <p>U.S. sprinter Melissa Jefferson-Wooden has capped a dominant season by winning the women's 100-meter world championship title in Tokyo. The 24-year-old delivered a stunning performance, clocking a time of 10.61 seconds, which set a new championship record and established her as the fourth-fastest woman in history. The victory marks a remarkable comeback for Jefferson-Wooden, who has significantly lowered her personal best this year after struggling with injuries in 2024. Jamaica's Tina Clayton took the silver medal, while reigning Olympic champion Julien Alfred of St. Lucia finished with the bronze in a highly competitive final.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham asserts that the United States is in a 'dangerous place,' with the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk highlighting a historical pattern of violence. Meacham argues that political violence erupts in America during periods when there is intense national debate over fundamental questions of identity, such as who qualifies as 'an American' and who is included in the nation's founding principles. He suggests that the current climate is not just a debate over political means, but over the very purpose of politics. Meacham warns that when citizens lose the ability to engage in peaceful dissent, they break faith with the American covenant of living in contention without resorting to violence.</p>

          <p>In a commentary reflecting on the recent wave of political violence in America, journalist James Fallows draws parallels to the tumultuous 1960s, another period marked by high-profile assassinations. He warns that cycles of political violence are far more damaging and self-reinforcing than many people realize, and that careless rhetoric about 'civil war' is catastrophic. Fallows offers two key lessons from history: first, leaders and citizens must actively work to emphasize real-world connections over the polarized warfare of social media. Second, he cautions against immediate, ungenerous reactions, urging a focus on empathy and unity, as exemplified by Robert F. Kennedy's impromptu speech following the death of Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

          <p>Following a large march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that the British flag will not be surrendered to those who use it as a symbol of 'violence, fear and division.' The 'Unite the Kingdom' march drew over 150,000 people and resulted in clashes that injured 26 police officers. Starmer emphasized that the flag represents the nation's diversity, tolerance, and respect, and that intimidation on British streets will not be tolerated. While affirming the right to peaceful protest, he condemned the violence against police and the atmosphere of fear created for some citizens.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the destructive Eaton fire, residents of Altadena, California, have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local businesses and foster community connection. Many members lost their homes in the fire, and the restaurants that survived have seen a sharp decline in customers. The club, founded by a resident displaced by the fire, rotates weekly among different struggling, often family-owned, establishments, providing a vital economic boost. Beyond financial support, the gatherings have become a crucial space for shared healing, allowing neighbors who were previously strangers to connect over their common experience of loss and recovery, rebuilding social bonds in a community fractured by disaster.</p>

          <p>A new commentary piece critiques America's pervasive tipping culture, arguing that the recent 'no tax on tips' law, while seemingly beneficial, only further entrenches a flawed system. The author contends that instead of creating complex tax deductions for tipped workers, the focus should be on compelling employers to pay a stable, living wage. The article points out inconsistencies in who is eligible for the new tax benefit, questioning why digital content creators are included while essential workers like teachers and postal workers are not. Ultimately, the piece advocates for abolishing tipping altogether, following the model of many other countries, to create a more equitable and predictable compensation system for service workers.</p>

          <p>A local official in Johnson County, Iowa, has publicly defied a directive from the state's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Jon Green, the Democratic chair of the county's board of supervisors, stated that while he condemns the killing, he will not bestow county honors upon a person who he says dedicated his life to denigrating marginalized communities. Green criticized Kirk's rhetoric as harmful to the fabric of the nation's politics. The decision has drawn criticism from the governor, who called it disgraceful, but has been supported by another Democratic supervisor who cited Kirk's divisive career.</p>

          <p>Swiss bank UBS is reportedly exploring a potential move of its headquarters to the United States in response to proposed new capital requirements from the Swiss government. The stricter rules, introduced following the bank's takeover of Credit Suisse, could force UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital. According to reports, senior executives have met with U.S. officials to discuss a strategic shift, which could even include acquiring a U.S.-based bank. While CEO Sergio Ermotti has publicly stated a preference for remaining in Switzerland, he has also described the proposed regulations as 'punitive and excessive,' indicating the bank will consider all options to protect shareholder interests.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reveals that the 16-year-old who opened fire at Evergreen High School in Colorado had been an active user of a website known for hosting graphic violence and extremist content. The teen, who injured two students before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot, was said by officials to have been 'radicalized by an extremist network.' The ADL report connects the shooter to a specific 'violent gore' site that has also been frequented by perpetrators of other recent school shootings. This connection highlights a disturbing trend of young attackers being influenced by online spaces that glorify violence and white supremacist ideologies.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new feature called 'Hear the Highlights,' which uses artificial intelligence to generate short audio summaries of product information. The AI voice scripts are created by a large language model that pulls data from product catalogs, customer reviews, and other information from across the web. While Amazon says the feature is designed to make shopping easier, it raises questions about whether an AI-generated distillation can replace the nuanced and often idiosyncratic value of human customer reviews. Critics are concerned that the feature could flatten important context, overlook unique user insights, and potentially blend marketing-driven descriptions with genuine user feedback without clear distinction.</p>
