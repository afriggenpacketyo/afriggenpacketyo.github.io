          <p>A sentencing hearing is underway for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on prostitution-related charges. This development comes after a high-profile trial where he was acquitted of more severe charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking. Combs has been detained in a federal jail for approximately 13 months leading up to this hearing. The outcome of the sentencing will determine the legal consequences for the charges on which he was found guilty, concluding a significant chapter in his legal battles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown has continued into its third day, with the Senate scheduled to hold a crucial vote to potentially end the impasse. The legislative deadlock between political parties has halted non-essential government services and furloughed numerous federal employees. Both sides are publicly blaming each other for the failure to pass a funding bill, creating uncertainty for the economy and government operations. The upcoming Senate vote is being closely watched as a potential breakthrough or a sign of continued stalemate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) highlights a substantial "motherhood penalty" in England, where women's earnings significantly decrease after having children. The data shows that five years after their first child, mothers' monthly earnings drop by an average of over £1,000 compared to their pre-childbirth salary. This financial impact persists and compounds with subsequent children, contributing heavily to the overall gender pay gap. Advocacy groups attribute this disparity to factors like high childcare costs, an unbalanced parental leave system, and workplace discrimination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has suspended $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago transit infrastructure projects, citing the ongoing government shutdown. The Office of Management and Budget stated the hold is to review whether the funds are being used for "race-based contracting," a justification also used for freezing funds for New York projects. This move affects the planned Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project, crucial for the city's public transit system. The action is seen by critics as a politically motivated tactic targeting Democratic-led cities during the budget dispute.</p>

          <p>Baseball Hall of Famer Chipper Jones publicly rebuked an Atlanta sports radio host for comments made following the retirement of Braves manager Brian Snitker. The host claimed Snitker "did more with less" while legendary manager Bobby Cox "did less with more," prompting a sharp response from Jones. Jones, who played under Cox, defended both managers and called the host's take a disrespectful attempt to diminish Cox's legacy. The exchange highlights the passionate debates among fans and media regarding the careers of two of the most successful managers in the franchise's history.</p>

Bezos argued that unlike purely financial bubbles, industrial bubbles can be beneficial because society retains the valuable inventions that emerge after the speculative frenzy subsides.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old day trader from Tennessee, who earns between $30,000 and $90,000 per month, sought financial advice on "The Ramsey Show" about when to invest in real estate. The show's hosts cautioned him against assuming his high income from trading futures would be permanent and advised a conservative approach. They recommended he first save enough cash to buy his own primary residence without a mortgage before considering purchasing rental properties. The hosts stressed the importance of avoiding debt for investment properties and warned him not to count on the "gravy train" of day trading for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Flight operations at Germany's Munich Airport were temporarily halted overnight due to unidentified drone sightings, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers. This incident coincided with reports from Belgian defense officials of multiple drones seen over the Elsenborn military base near the German border. These events are the latest in a series of unexplained drone activities near critical infrastructure in Western Europe, raising security concerns. European leaders have expressed suspicion that Russia may be behind the flights, viewing them as attempts to probe NATO's security and air defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>According to new data from the Federal Reserve, the total wealth of the top 1% of Americans reached a record $52 trillion in the second quarter, driven largely by a surging stock market. The top 10%, those with a net worth over $2 million, saw their collective wealth grow by $5 trillion in the same period to a record $113 trillion. This continued growth in wealth at the top has led to a bifurcated consumer economy, with the affluent accounting for a record share of spending. Analysts warn that this growing dependence on a small group of wealthy consumers poses a risk to the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the deep-rooted cumbia music scene in Monterrey, Mexico, a city that has become a second home for the Colombian genre. It focuses on the culture of "sonideros," DJs who have curated and popularized cumbia since the 1960s, leading to unique local styles like "cumbia rebajada." The music became intertwined with the identity of working-class and migrant neighborhoods, particularly the subculture known as "cholombianos." Despite periods of intense violence when organized crime suppressed public gatherings, the cumbia scene has shown resilience and is returning to the streets.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's first execution in five years has reignited the debate over its use of the death penalty, a practice that contrasts with its other progressive democratic reforms. While public opinion polls show strong support for capital punishment, opponents argue it violates human rights, risks executing the innocent, and is applied in a way that can be seen as political. The recent execution was condemned by activists and the European Union, who claim it was carried out unlawfully while an appeal was pending. This article explores the complex issue, including the views of victims' families and the potential for alternative sentences.</p>

          <p>An immigration judge has denied a request to reopen the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was erroneously deported earlier this year despite having legal protection against removal. After being brought back to the U.S. to face separate criminal charges, his lawyers sought to reopen his immigration proceedings to pursue asylum. The judge ruled there was insufficient evidence that his removal was imminent, a decision that can be appealed. Abrego Garcia, who was granted withholding of removal in 2019 due to threats in his home country, remains in immigration detention.</p>

          <p>David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has warned that a market "drawdown" is likely in the next 12 to 24 months following the recent frenzy around artificial intelligence. He compared the current situation to the dot-com bubble, where a period of intense capital investment in a new technology led to both big winners and significant losses for investors. Solomon stated that when investors are excited, they tend to overlook risks, and he anticipates a "reset" or "check" on equity markets. He clarified that while he wouldn't necessarily use the word "bubble," he expects a period where deployed capital fails to deliver returns. (not investment advice)</p>
