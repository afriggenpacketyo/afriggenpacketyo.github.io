          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, outperforming economists' forecasts and accelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The manufacturing sector was the primary driver of this expansion, growing by 5.5%. Despite the positive results, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to economic outlook risks, but low inflation could support a potential rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alicia Tournebize, a 17-year-old player for the French women's national team, executed a notable dunk during the FIBA U18 Women’s EuroBasket 2025 third-place game against Belgium. The 6-foot-4 athlete stole the ball and completed the dunk on a breakaway in the fourth quarter. Tournebize finished the game with 19 points and 12 rebounds, helping France secure a 72-47 victory and its fifth consecutive podium finish in the tournament. This was not her first in-game dunk, as she has previously accomplished the feat in league play, a rarity in women's basketball.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Federal Cuts to Public Broadcasting Raise Concerns for Rural American Communities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 21:15:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new spending bill, supported by President Trump, proposes to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports outlets like NPR and PBS. While the move is framed as targeting biased media, over 70% of the funding goes to local stations, with a significant portion supporting media in rural areas. For many of these rural stations, such as KOTZ in Arctic Alaska, federal grants constitute a critical part of their budget, providing essential life-saving information. Some Republican senators from rural states have expressed opposition to the cuts, creating uncertainty about the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is asking for public assistance after an M4 assault rifle went missing from a patrol vehicle in South L.A. The weapon, along with five magazines containing 30 rounds each, was stored in a hard case in the vehicle's trunk and is believed to have possibly fallen out. Deputies noticed the rifle was missing Saturday night and immediately initiated a search of their route, which spanned approximately four miles. The department is reviewing surveillance footage and investigating whether proper procedures were followed by the deputies involved.</p>

          <p>Wall Street futures and Asian stocks declined as investors reacted to President Trump's threat to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the European Union and Mexico. The market response was relatively muted, reflecting a mix of resilience and a belief that the threats may be part of a negotiating tactic rather than a definite policy shift. The EU has stated it will continue to seek a negotiated settlement, though Germany has called for a firm response if the tariffs are implemented. This uncertainty comes as the U.S. earnings season begins, with analysts watching for impacts on corporate profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the luxury hotel industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations. He notes that younger travelers, already well-traveled with their parents, are now seeking deeper, more authentic experiences and interactions with local communities rather than just sightseeing. Ho also highlights the rise of 'rainbow tourism,' where travelers come from a diverse range of developing nations, a stark contrast to the primarily Western-to-East travel flow of three decades ago. This shift demands a move away from one-size-fits-all offerings toward more tailored and experiential hospitality.</p>

Magyar is capitalizing on public discontent over corruption and the declining state of public services like hospitals and schools.

          <p>A long-running dispute over water sharing between the United States and Mexico is escalating amid a severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to the U.S., but it is currently in arrears. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs and sanctions if Mexico does not fulfill its obligations, while Mexican farmers in the drought-stricken state of Chihuahua argue they cannot give water they do not have. The conflict highlights the growing strain that climate change and water scarcity are placing on international agreements.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that King Charles III will host U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a state visit from September 17 to 19. The visit, which will take place at Windsor Castle, is an unprecedented second state visit for an American president. The invitation is widely viewed as a strategic diplomatic move by the British government to maintain strong ties with the Trump administration. Unlike his first state visit in 2019, this trip is not expected to include an address to Parliament, which will be in recess.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending its decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil, despite the U.S. having a trade surplus with the country. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated the move is part of a broader strategy to onshore production and reduce what he terms a national security risk posed by a massive overall trade deficit. When questioned about the justification, which included a criminal case against a Trump ally in Brazil, Hassett maintained that an overall strategy is necessary to prevent transshipping and achieve long-term economic security objectives for the United States.

          <p>Italy's Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon men's singles championship, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain in a four-set final. After losing the first set, the 23-year-old Sinner rallied to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, becoming the first Italian singles champion in the tournament's history. The victory was a significant turnaround from the French Open final just a month prior, where Sinner lost to Alcaraz in a grueling five-set match. Sinner credited his ability to learn from that tough loss as a key reason for his triumphant performance on Centre Court.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report has identified a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last year. The report, released by the Senate Homeland Security Committee, highlights a critical lack of structured communication within the agency and with other law enforcement partners. Key information about the shooter was not disseminated effectively to Trump's security detail in time to prevent the attack. The report also found that the Secret Service had denied resource requests for the rally and that its former director provided false testimony to Congress.</p>

          <p>Chicago is confronting a dire financial situation, with an anticipated budget deficit exceeding $1 billion for 2026 and one of its key emergency funds being completely depleted. The city's fiscal challenges are compounded by a $7 billion estimated cost for a new police and fire pension benefits bill, which would significantly increase its long-term liabilities. Mayor Brandon Johnson's administration is exploring efficiencies but faces a politically divided City Council resistant to new taxes or service cuts. This creates what some officials call the "grimmest picture" for the city's budget in years. (not investment advice)</p>
