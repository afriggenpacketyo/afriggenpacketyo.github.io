          <h2>Trump's Middle East Policies Align with Israeli Interests Despite Bypassing the Country During Recent Trip</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to experts, President Trump's recent Middle East tour, while bypassing Israel, advanced policies closely aligned with Israeli interests. Trump condemned the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, advocated for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and cautioned Iran regarding its nuclear ambitions. Despite some Israeli unease about being excluded from the tour, analysts suggest Trump's approach prioritizes American interests while maintaining strong support for Israel. Experts emphasize that Israel should seize the strategic opportunities presented by these developments rather than merely reacting to them, particularly concerning normalization with Saudi Arabia and addressing the Iranian nuclear threat.

          <p>The Mayo Clinic is utilizing its fecal waste biobank to uncover how the microbiome influences cancer patients' responses to medications, aiming to personalize medicine. The biobank, containing over 2,000 stool samples, seeks to understand why patients react differently to cancer treatments. Researchers believe the microbiome, a collection of bacteria in the body, plays a crucial role in nutrition, pathogen resistance, and immune system education. This research is part of broader efforts to understand how the gut microbiome mediates cancer treatment responses, with some experimenting with fecal transplants to colonize patients' guts with new bacteria.

          <p>Congressional Republicans are proposing new fees on immigrants seeking asylum or humanitarian parole, which could create significant financial barriers. These fees, including a $1,000 asylum application fee and charges for caring for minors in government custody, aim to offset the costs of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Advocates warn these measures will disproportionately affect vulnerable immigrants, potentially forcing them into exploitative labor or out of the country. The bill allocates over $50 billion for border wall construction and increased ICE enforcement, while critics argue the fees penalize immigrants seeking humanitarian protections.

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to deport international students over their pro-Palestinian speech have suffered setbacks in court, with judges ordering the release of several detainees. The administration argues their presence harms U.S. foreign policy, sparking concerns about political repression on campuses. While the government's legal arguments face skepticism, the fundamental question of whether the government can deport non-citizens for political speech remains unresolved. The arrests have created anxiety among international students, chilling campus activism related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even as the conflict in Gaza escalates.

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," portrays President Biden as experiencing cognitive decline, with his inner circle allegedly concealing his diminished capacities from the public. The authors suggest that Biden's decision to run for reelection, despite signs of decline, was a critical error. The book alleges a conspiracy to hide Biden's symptoms, leading to a lack of transparency with the American people. While the author is not entirely convinced there was a coordinated campaign to hide the truth about Biden's condition, the book emphasizes the corrupting influence of great power.

The drop in tourism has raised alarm, as German tourists significantly contribute to the U.S. economy, particularly in California.

          <p>As the NBA draft combine concludes, an analyst suggests the Lakers should pursue a player who has matured through four years of college, navigating the temptations of money and fame. The economic shifts in the NBA, including rookie contract limitations and NIL policies, favor players who have demonstrated resilience and emotional intelligence. While the Lakers need a big man, they could find value in a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money and a good head on his shoulders. The analyst hopes the Lakers will prioritize a grown-up player who can contribute both on and off the court. This article comes from the Los Angeles Times.</p>
