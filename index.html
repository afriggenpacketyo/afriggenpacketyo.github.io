          <p>President Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with both Israel and Iran for allegedly violating the ceasefire he announced, stating that both sides had not adhered to the agreement. He also addressed an intelligence report suggesting that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only delayed Tehran's nuclear program by a few months, without elaborating further on the matter. The president's comments came as his administration pushed back against claims that the strikes were ineffective, indicating a complex situation amidst ongoing tensions in the Middle East. The article highlights the delicate nature of the ceasefire and the ongoing debate about the impact of the strikes. Optimism regarding the situation remains guarded given the conflicting reports and continued violations.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying efforts to stimulate domestic consumption through structural financial support and incentives, as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) allocates 500 billion yuan for consumption and pension loans. The PBOC aims to encourage financial institutions to provide loans to businesses in key sectors such as retail, hotels, restaurants, sports, entertainment, and tourism. This initiative includes 19 measures to support both consumers and sellers, reflecting the government's commitment to bolstering consumption amid trade uncertainties and unemployment pressures. China hopes to strengthen consumption's role in economic development through these measures. This is part of a broader strategy to stabilize the Chinese economy by encouraging domestic spending.

          <p>State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary after a strong initial showing, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to concede. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on social media virality and enthusiasm among younger voters, while Cuomo, who resigned the governorship amid sexual harassment allegations, aimed for a political comeback. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, as no candidate reached the 50% threshold. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to have an advantage in the heavily Democratic city's general election, although incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent. The results reflect a shift in voter preferences and could signal a change in the city's political landscape.</p>

Researchers emphasize that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency and resilience against conflict and climate extremes.

          <p>Richard Gerald Jordan, Mississippi's longest-serving death row inmate, is scheduled to be executed for the 1976 kidnapping and murder of Edwina Marter. Jordan, a 79-year-old Vietnam veteran with PTSD, was convicted for killing Marter after a ransom scheme. His lawyers argued that his war trauma was not adequately considered during his trial. The execution follows decades of court proceedings and appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected a petition claiming he was denied due process rights.</p>

          <p>California's leaders have reached a tentative agreement on the state budget, which hinges on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The $321.1-billion budget reflects resistance to the governor's proposed cuts, with the deal relying on borrowing money and tapping into state reserves. The agreement is contingent on legislators sending the governor a proposal to lessen the number of building projects requiring a full environmental review. The budget also includes changes to Med-Cal funding and shifts money around to address the state's financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>
