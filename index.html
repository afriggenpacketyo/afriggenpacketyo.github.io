          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of November's presidential election after the original vote was annulled by the courts due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The annulled vote saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round. Alleged violations included the use of fake social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging. The election is seen as a test of Romania's pro-Western orientation, with candidates from both sides vying for support.</p>

          <p>Concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have led to a backlash against baby food pouches, with some criticizing their high sugar content and nutritional value. However, this panic contributes to the maternal guilt industrial complex, placing undue pressure on mothers. The article argues that this criticism often ignores the social, political, and economic factors that influence parents' choices. Instead of condemning pureed fruit, society should focus on providing better support for parents, such as improved paternity leave, workplace creches, and affordable housing.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is gaining traction following Reform UK's recent electoral success. The party's strong performance in local elections has shaken up the political landscape, with Labour and the Conservatives now viewing Reform as a serious threat. While Labour seeks to prove its ability to govern effectively, the Conservatives are scrambling to present a credible alternative. Farage's success reflects public disillusionment with the political system and his ability to connect with voters on key issues.</p>
