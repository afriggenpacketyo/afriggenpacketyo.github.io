          <p>The US banking system's slow transfer times, unlike many other countries, cause significant costs for consumers.  Banks benefit from the delays through float revenue and overdraft fees, while the slow system hinders timely access to funds for rent, paychecks, and other essential expenses.  The FedNow system aims to improve speed but faces challenges.</p>
