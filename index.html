          <p>Germany's government has approved a 2026 draft budget featuring €520.5 billion in spending and €174 billion in new borrowing, aiming to stimulate economic growth and modernize infrastructure. This significant investment of €126.7 billion is intended to address two years of stagnation and strengthen the military, representing a major shift from Germany's traditional fiscal restraint. However, Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has warned that this spending spree will necessitate significant austerity measures starting in 2027 to address an anticipated funding gap. The article also notes a sharp 55.8% profit decline for Mercedes-Benz in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS reported a second-quarter net profit of $2.395 billion, more than doubling the previous year's figure and significantly beating analyst expectations. The strong performance was driven by a 25% revenue increase in its investment bank's global markets unit, which capitalized on high market volatility. Despite the positive results, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that clients maintain a 'wait-and-see' attitude, and the bank continues to navigate challenges, including proposed Swiss capital rules that could require an additional $26 billion in core capital. The integration of Credit Suisse remains on track, with $1 billion in share buybacks completed this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting of the party's elite Central Committee comes amid ongoing geopolitical and trade tensions with the United States. President Xi Jinping has emphasized the importance of the new blueprint, which will be finalized and endorsed by the national legislature in March. The plan's formulation is critical as China navigates external uncertainties and aims to chart its course for continued development in a complex global environment.</p>

          <p>The latest five-day strike by junior doctors in England has concluded, but the underlying dispute over pay and working conditions is far from over. Doctors are seeking pay restoration to 2008 levels, which would require a further 25% increase, a demand the Labour government has so far rejected for the current year. While talks have touched on non-pay issues like exam fees and job rotation frequency, the relationship between the British Medical Association (BMA) and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has become acrimonious. Both sides have signaled a willingness to resume negotiations, but significant disagreements on pay remain a major obstacle to a final resolution.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has voiced concerns that the club is struggling to complete crucial player signings during the summer transfer window, stating that time is "running out." Despite having funds available, Moyes revealed that the club has been unable to finalize deals for key targets needed to strengthen the squad, which has been depleted by the departure of several experienced players. He candidly told fans that the club is facing a "struggle" to bring in new talent quickly. The slow activity comes as a disappointment after a promising end to last season and ambitions fueled by new ownership and a move to a new stadium.</p>

          <p>HSBC announced a $3 billion share buyback despite reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter pre-tax profit to $6.3 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was attributed to impairment charges related to a Chinese bank and lost income from business disposals. The bank's CEO, Georges Elhedery, highlighted structural economic challenges, including global tariffs and fiscal vulnerabilities, that are creating market uncertainty. HSBC warned that while the direct impact of tariffs might be modest, a broader macroeconomic downturn could affect future profitability, though it still expects double-digit growth in its wealth division over the medium term.

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced a significant policy shift, stating it will recognize a Palestinian state in September if Israel does not agree to a ceasefire and take steps to end the war in Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy expressed hope that the move would "affect the situation on the ground" and help abate the suffering of Palestinians. The decision has been met with a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism. The policy change has also drawn mixed reactions domestically, with some parties calling for immediate recognition and others arguing the timing is inappropriate.</p>

          <p>Following a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia, residents along the California coast responded to tsunami advisories with a blend of caution, curiosity, and nonchalance. In Southern California, where only small waves were expected, many beachgoers were undisturbed, while some expressed surprise and considered their lack of an emergency plan. In Crescent City, a Northern California town historically vulnerable to tsunamis, locals in a pub remained calm, accustomed to such alerts.

          <p>Despite the FTSE-100 stock index reaching all-time highs and outperforming many global benchmarks this year, its success is not necessarily reflective of the UK's domestic economy. A CNBC analysis points out that the index is heavily weighted with multinational corporations that derive the vast majority of their earnings overseas, such as in energy, mining, and defense. Consequently, the Footsie's performance is more influenced by global factors, a weaker pound, and international market dynamics than by the health of UK-focused businesses. This contrasts with the index's composition at its 1984 launch, when it was dominated by domestically oriented companies. (not investment advice)</p>

In Hawaii, authorities issued evacuation advisories and prepared for potential damage, while Japan reported initial waves of about one foot.

Johnson argues that the shutdown demonstrates the organization's financial reliance on abortion procedures, a claim she says contradicts its public statements.

The 436-million-year-old brachiopod fossils, found in China's Guizhou province, were arranged in a highly regular, checkerboard-like pattern on the former sea floor. Researchers believe the extinct species, Nucleospira calypta, used hundreds of flexible setae, each thinner than a human hair, to maintain optimal spacing from its neighbors. This behavior likely helped ensure each individual had adequate room for filter feeding, demonstrating a sophisticated survival strategy among early marine life.</p>

The article provides historical context, referencing the 1917 Balfour Declaration and Britain's complex role in the region's history.

          <p>The gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building was reportedly targeting the NFL headquarters located there, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The shooter, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, left a note indicating he believed he suffered from the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. Tamura, who had played high school football but never in the NFL, took the wrong elevator and opened fire at a different company. The attack, which also resulted in the death of an NYPD officer, has raised questions about the shooter's mental health history and access to firearms.</p>

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake off Russia, a tsunami advisory was issued for most of the California coast, with a more severe warning for the far northern counties of Del Norte and Humboldt. Officials projected modest waves of less than one foot for Southern California, but larger waves of up to 4.8 feet were possible in Crescent City, an area historically vulnerable to tsunamis. Authorities urged the public to stay away from beaches, harbors, and coastal waters due to the risk of strong, dangerous currents. The event served as a reminder of past tsunamis that have caused significant damage to California's coastal infrastructure.</p>

The hearing will examine factors such as the helicopter's data systems, the notoriously congested airspace around Reagan National Airport (DCA), and air traffic control procedures. Investigators are looking into whether the helicopter's altimeters were malfunctioning and if the crew was wearing night-vision goggles, which may have limited their visibility.</p>

Despite dodging a technical recession and posting solid 4.3% year-over-year GDP growth in the second quarter, the MAS signaled it remains ready to adjust its policy.

The slowdown was driven by a fall in transport costs, which partially offset price increases in housing and food. The softer inflation figures provide strong evidence for the RBA to consider another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting, especially given a weaker global growth outlook and a recent rise in the domestic unemployment rate.
