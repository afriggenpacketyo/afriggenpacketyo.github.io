          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low Alcohol Consumption Among Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that alcohol consumption among Americans has reached a record low, with only 54% reporting they drink. This decline is attributed to increased public awareness of alcohol's health risks, even in moderation, and a shift in social norms. Younger generations, in particular, are showing less inclination to drink, influenced by health messaging and economic factors. Experts anticipate this trend to continue as understanding of alcohol's negative health effects grows. The article highlights a significant cultural and public health shift.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This marks the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise. Chisholm's group will initially acquire at least 51% of the Celtics, with plans to buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at a $7.3 billion valuation. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and private equity firm co-founder, will assume the role of the Celtics' governor, ushering in a new era for the team.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:05:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virginia Tech study reveals that trained dogs can effectively detect the egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly, offering a new defense against the destructive pest. Spotted lanternflies, native to Asia, excrete a sugary honeydew that promotes mold growth and have spread to 19 U.S. states. Dogs, with their superior sense of smell, achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and over 60% in outdoor, real-world scenarios, outperforming human searches. Researchers hope this method can be expanded to detect other invasive species, providing a fun and fulfilling activity for dog owners while protecting local environments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings against mousse-form sunscreen products, including those from popular brands like Supergoop!, stating they may not provide adequate UV protection. The FDA sent five warning letters to manufacturers, classifying these products as unapproved drugs due to lacking required FDA authorization. Additionally, the agency highlighted a safety concern: the packaging often resembles whipped cream containers, increasing the risk of accidental ingestion, particularly by children. Companies like Supergoop! and Kalani Sunwear are working to address the identified violations, with some temporarily pulling products from the market.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu hydropower station, the world's fourth-largest dam, has ceased using Western industrial chips in its operations due to escalating security concerns. This strategic shift follows historical cyberattacks, such as the Stuxnet virus, which exploited vulnerabilities in industrial control systems. The move underscores a growing global apprehension regarding the security of critical infrastructure and technological supply chains. Xiluodu Dam, with its immense installed capacity, is a vital component of China's energy network, making its cybersecurity a national priority. This decision reflects broader geopolitical trends of technological decoupling.</p>

Barnes is serving a 21.5-year sentence based on child sexual assault allegations in the U.S. that American prosecutors found unsubstantiated. His family emphasizes his innocence and urges U.S. officials to designate him as wrongfully detained. The upcoming summit presents a potential opportunity for his release, drawing attention to the plight of Americans held abroad.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated national security trial of Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been postponed due to a typhoon. Lai, a 77-year-old British and Chinese citizen, faces a potential life sentence for allegedly colluding with foreign forces under Beijing's imposed national security law. Critics argue the case exemplifies the weaponization of Hong Kong's legal system to suppress political opposition. Lai, a vocal critic of the Chinese state, has been detained since December 2020, with his family expressing grave concerns about his health and the implications for press freedom.</p>

While rarely fatal, chikungunya can cause prolonged joint pain for months or even years. As the types of mosquitoes carrying the virus are not present in the UK, there is no risk of local transmission. Health officials urge travelers to take precautions against mosquito bites.</p>

Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the growths are real and caused by the relatively harmless Shope Papilloma Virus. This disease, mainly found in the American Midwest, is spread by fleas and ticks or direct contact between rabbits, but not to humans or other pets. The papillomas are generally benign unless they obstruct vital functions, and the rabbits' immune systems eventually clear them. This phenomenon is believed to have inspired the mythical 'jackalope' and has contributed to scientific understanding of virus-cancer links.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Warn UK Cities Face New 'Firewave' Risk Amid Rising Temperatures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 20:04:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK cities are increasingly vulnerable to "firewaves," a new phenomenon describing multiple urban wildfires triggered by prolonged hot, dry weather, according to Imperial College London scientists. Recent heath fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this growing risk. Researchers found that after ten consecutive days of very dry conditions, vegetation becomes highly flammable, making cities susceptible to simultaneous blazes that can overwhelm emergency services. Climate change is intensifying these conditions, pushing urban areas, especially those with green spaces, into uncharted territory. Experts advocate for a new "firewave" alert system to enhance public safety strategies and climate resilience.</p>

          <p>A brush fire in Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Highland Park burned an acre of dense brush on Wednesday afternoon before firefighters contained it within 40 minutes. Light winds fanned the blaze, but there was no immediate threat to nearby homes or calls for evacuation. One firefighter sustained apparent heat exhaustion while battling the fire in the summer heat and received treatment. Helicopters assisted by dropping water on the dry vegetation as a smoky haze settled over the area. Hand crews remained on scene to address any remaining hotspots.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska's capital, is recovering after facing record-breaking floodwaters from an outburst flood from the Mendenhall Glacier's Suicide Basin. The Mendenhall River peaked at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record. While some residents evacuated, temporary Hesco barriers largely protected hundreds of homes from catastrophic damage. Glacial outburst floods have become an annual concern since 2011 due to the retreating glacier, with this year's event being the most significant yet. City officials are assessing damage and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is studying long-term solutions, as these floods are expected to continue for decades.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revoked a 2021 executive order issued by Joe Biden aimed at promoting competition across the U.S. economy. Biden's order sought to combat corporate abuses and excessive industry concentration in sectors like agriculture, drugs, and labor. The Justice Department, under Trump, welcomed the revocation, advocating for an "America first antitrust" approach focused on free markets. Critics argue this move unwinds a popular initiative, potentially costing consumers billions in higher fees and lost compensation. This action signifies a clear policy divergence on economic regulation between the two administrations.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced a $5.5 billion package to support exporters impacted by high tariffs, up to 50%, imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The measures include credit, tax charge postponements, and incentives for local production. Trump justified the tariffs by linking them to the legal situation of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, accusing Brazil of human rights abuses. Lula vehemently rejected these claims, asserting Brazil's judicial independence. Despite the economic tensions, Lula expressed a desire for negotiation rather than escalating conflict, emphasizing Brazil's sovereignty.</p>

Many employees do not openly broadcast these plans to their companies, fearing unprofessionalism, though the practice is generally accepted if work objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated.
