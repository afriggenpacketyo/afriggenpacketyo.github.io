          <p>Play was halted during a fourth-round Wimbledon match after the new electronic line-calling system failed, leading to a disputed point. Player Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova accused officials of "stealing" a game from her when the system could not verify a ball that was visibly out. The incident has raised questions about the reliability of the automated technology and the role of umpires, especially after the All England Club had recently expressed confidence in the system's accuracy.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's new tax and spending bill, claiming it will spur growth and not add to the deficit, contrary to many analyses. Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi countered, calling it the "big, ugly bill" and arguing it will harm Americans by increasing the deficit and cutting healthcare coverage for millions. The discussion highlighted the deep partisan divide over the legislation's projected economic and social impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a public fissure with President Donald Trump over a major tax and spending bill, Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." Musk, who had previously been a key ally and major donor, criticized the bill for what he termed wasteful spending and its potential to increase the national debt. The move signals a significant political realignment for the billionaire and could impact the 2026 midterm elections, though the party's formal structure and viability remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of vandalism after portraits in the Windrush Untold Stories exhibition in Brixton were damaged. The outdoor art installation features portraits and accounts of those who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean. While community groups had initially feared the act was racially motivated, the Metropolitan Police stated that they do not believe it was a hate crime and sought to reassure the distressed local community that a suspect is in custody.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has strongly criticized efforts by the White House to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports PBS and NPR. In a recent interview, Burns called the move "foolhardy and misguided," arguing that public media is a vital service, especially in rural areas, and not a partisan entity as some critics claim. He emphasized that his own extensive body of work, which requires long-term development, would not have been possible without the unique, non-commercial environment that PBS provides.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are in a critical week of negotiations to secure a trade deal with the United States and avoid President Trump's threatened tariffs of up to 50% on EU imports. With a July 9 deadline looming, divisions have emerged within the bloc on whether to accept a less-than-ideal agreement or hold out for better terms, risking a trade war. The uncertainty has already impacted the global economy, and European industries are bracing for, at minimum, a new 10% baseline tariff on exports to the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR journalist in Gaza provides a harrowing first-person account of the life-threatening ordeal Palestinians face to acquire food from a U.S.-supported distribution site. The report describes navigating Israeli military fire, armed private contractors, and desperate, violent crowds just to obtain basic rations, a process the UN has called a "death trap." The journalist documents how this perilous system, intended to bypass Hamas, has instead fueled lawlessness and resulted in daily casualties, with the dead sometimes shrouded in the empty food sacks they had hoped to fill.</p>

The discovery of Peñico provides a link between coastal communities and those in the Andes and Amazon, highlighting its strategic importance for trade and cultural exchange in the ancient world.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Israel's war in Gaza is exposing and accelerating the collapse of the post-1945 "rules-based international order." It posits that the consistent failure to resolve the Palestinian situation, which it frames as the last case of incomplete decolonization, has created an anachronism that the world can no longer sustain. The West's complicity in allowing Israel to shift the boundaries of acceptable conduct in warfare, including the use of starvation, threatens to normalize such actions globally and erode the very foundations of international law.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its influence in the Western Balkans through a strategy that combines soft power with economic and political leverage, sometimes called "infrastructure imperialism." The funding of major projects, like the grand Namazgah mosque in Albania's capital, is just one element of a broader geopolitical push that includes investments in everything from agriculture to military hardware. This policy, rooted in President Erdogan's vision of Turkey as a regional power, aims to create a network of modern, Turkey-aligned states.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has suggested that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. Arguing for a "polluter pays" approach, he questioned why event organizers who profit from large gatherings do not pay for the public resources required to secure them. The proposal comes amid concerns over stretched police funding and is part of a broader call for radical reforms, including consolidating the UK's 43 police forces.</p>
