          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability, is highlighting the significant accessibility challenges within the Houses of Parliament. Despite the passage of the Equalities Act fifteen years ago, she points to persistent issues like heavy doors with unsuitable handles and long distances to accessible facilities. Tidball is advocating for systemic changes to make the historic buildings more inclusive for disabled individuals, ensuring that Parliament better reflects the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities. While some minor improvements have been made, a modernization committee is reviewing more substantial reforms to address these long-standing barriers.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is recognized as a pioneering example of national park architecture. Built in 1904, it was designed by Robert Reamer, who utilized uniquely twisted and gnarled wood from some 10,000 trees, earning them the nickname 'freaks of the forest.' Once advertised as the world's largest log cabin, the inn has hosted millions of visitors and set a stylistic precedent for other grand lodges in national parks like Yosemite and Glacier. Today, a dedicated team of carpenters works to preserve its historic character while ensuring its structural integrity for future generations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following an emergency request from lawyers who argued the government was attempting to bypass legal protections for minors. The government contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, but lawyers for the children disputed this, citing laws that guarantee them an immigration hearing. The judge justified the extraordinary measure by noting the administration's hurried plan to remove the children over a holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Tom Odell discusses the unexpected turns in his career, including learning that one of his 2016 performances inspired Finneas O'Connell and Billie Eilish to pursue their music. After early success with his hit 'Another Love,' Odell faced a period of mainstream obscurity before finding a new audience on TikTok, which propelled his song 'Black Friday' to global success. This resurgence has allowed him the creative and financial freedom to record his new, more introspective album, 'A Wonderful Life,' with his live band. He reflects on the vulnerability in his music and how connecting with audiences over shared feelings has been a profound experience.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan near the border with Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of more than 800 people and injuring at least 2,500. The quake, which was very shallow, caused widespread destruction, with officials reporting that numerous villages in Kunar province have been completely destroyed. Rescue operations are underway, but efforts are complicated by the remote location and the country's ongoing humanitarian crisis following the cutoff of Western financial aid. Survivors described scenes of devastation, with many trapped under rubble as families and rescue teams frantically searched for loved ones through the night.</p>

Hauser, who will reprise his role in an upcoming "Yellowstone" spin-off, takes the interactions in stride. The new series, with a working title of "The Dutton Ranch," will also star Kelly Reilly and Annette Bening, continuing the story from where the original show concluded.</p>

This change follows a recent dispute where ministers blocked guidance that would have advised judges to consider the background of offenders from certain minority groups before sentencing. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the reform will address a "democratic deficit" by ensuring Parliament has oversight of policy, while maintaining that judges' independence in individual cases will be protected. Critics of the original guidance had argued it could lead to a "two-tier justice" system.</p>

Using advanced uranium-series dating on calcite formed on the skull, researchers have placed it firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting estimates. The fossil, often attributed to the species Homo heidelbergensis, possesses features distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans. This new dating strengthens the theory that this more primitive human population coexisted with early Neanderthals, adding complexity to our understanding of Europe's prehistoric human landscape.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka delivered a commanding performance at the US Open, defeating defending champion Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 to advance to the quarterfinals. The match marked Osaka's most impressive victory since her return from maternity leave, as she controlled the rallies and capitalized on Gauff's service struggles. Gauff, who has been working to remodel her serve, was undone by five double faults and 33 unforced errors. For Osaka, a four-time major champion, the win signals a significant return to form on one of tennis's biggest stages, continuing her strong momentum in the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Examine Why Trump Has Not Imposed Harsher Sanctions on Russia</h2>

          <p>Despite repeated threats to punish Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine, President Trump has refrained from implementing a new wave of severe economic sanctions. According to analysts, this hesitation is strategic, stemming from a desire to be seen as a peace-broker and to potentially secure a Nobel Peace Prize. Additionally, there are significant concerns within Washington that further isolating Russia could push it into a deeper alliance with China. This could grant Beijing greater access to Russian energy, military technology, and strategic Arctic territories, a long-term outcome the U.S. hopes to avoid.</p>

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, have co-authored a guest essay warning that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is endangering American health. They accuse Kennedy of dismantling the nation's vaccine system, promoting unproven treatments, and replacing scientific experts with unqualified individuals who share his views. The unprecedented public condemnation follows the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and the resignation of other top officials, which the former leaders say has put the vital public health agency on "life support."</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has issued a public apology after a video of him taking a hat from a young boy at the US Open went viral. The incident occurred when tennis player Kamil Majchrzak attempted to give his cap to the child, but Szczerek intercepted it. In his statement, Szczerek said he made a "huge mistake" and was convinced the player was passing the hat to him. He has since returned the hat to the boy, and the player later met with the young fan to give him additional merchandise.</p>

Maduro characterized the deployment as the "greatest threat" in a century and an act of military pressure aimed at regime change.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will overturn an appeals court ruling that found President Trump's sweeping tariffs illegal. The administration justified the tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), citing the influx of fentanyl as a national emergency. Bessent stated that if the court does not uphold the president's authority under IEEPA, the administration has a backup plan, potentially using Section 338 of the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act to impose duties on countries that discriminate against U.S. commerce.

Washington has warned that these purchases help fund Russia's war in Ukraine, but India defends them as essential for its energy security. Analysts suggest that U.S. economic pressure is accelerating a process where India is working more closely with both China and Russia to counter American unilateralism.</p>
