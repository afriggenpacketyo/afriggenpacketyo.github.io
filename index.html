          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is transferring graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls. According to a company spokesperson, Nvidia is not modifying GPU designs to comply with export controls. The statement follows reports that CEO Jensen Huang discussed establishing a research and development center in Shanghai to cater to the local market while adhering to U.S. restrictions. The center would focus on assessing ways to meet U.S. restrictions while continuing production and design outside of China. Optimism score is 80.</p>
