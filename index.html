            <h2>Former Bank of England Official Advocates Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

            <p>Charlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, urges a significant interest rate cut to at least 4% in May to counteract the economic fallout from Donald Trump's tariffs, which have destabilized global markets and eroded business and consumer confidence. Bean argues for a more substantial cut than the market's expectation of 0.25%, drawing parallels to the 2008 financial crisis response. Another former rate setter, David Blanchflower, supports an emergency meeting for a deep reduction to prevent a recession, emphasizing the importance of consumer confidence in the face of economic shocks.

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports from numerous countries could inadvertently pave the way for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Trump's actions, styled as "Liberation Day," have triggered market instability and recession fears, potentially pushing countries to unite against the US and bolster China's application to join the CPTPP. The CPTPP, a 12-member trading bloc, includes major economies such as Australia, Canada, Japan, and the UK.</p>

            <p>Stock indexes in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen rose on Tuesday as Chinese state funds intervened to support the market and investor confidence. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.6 per cent, following a significant drop the previous day. Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China’s sovereign wealth fund, bought exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to stabilize the market amid concerns about reciprocal tariffs from the US.</p>

            <p>A cancer survivor recounts her experience with alternative medicine, detailing a visit to an integrative medical doctor who promoted thermography and a "Super Mineral Water" as potential cures.

She emphasizes the importance of trusting science and medical professionals, warning against the dangers of unproven screening tools and alternative therapies. This article underscores the need for critical thinking and reliance on evidence-based medicine. </p>

            <p>Amid turmoil in Sino-European relations and calls for de-risking, increased engagement between Europe and China may offer a contingency plan given an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship. As the US instigates a global trade war, Europe's engagement with China has grown, with softening tones from European officials and increased interest in Hong Kong as a gateway between the world and mainland China. The reciprocal tariffs challenge the idea of comparative advantage in trade between countries.</p>

            <p>Defensive miscues and missed opportunities contributed to the Dodgers' 6-4 loss to the Nationals, marking their third loss in four games. Errors by Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas led to unearned runs, while stellar defense from the Nationals prevented potential Dodgers rallies. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration with the team's lack of clean baseball, highlighting the need to improve on fundamentals. Despite Shohei Ohtani's strong offensive performance, the Dodgers' defensive struggles proved costly.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision in Trump v. J.G.G., allowing the Trump administration to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport individuals without due process, though it requires notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. The decision overturns a lower court ruling that blocked deportations under the Act, but does not address the legality of using the Act for deportations. Critics argue that the decision allows the administration to deport individuals to dangerous conditions in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>Peter Navarro, Trump's trade advisor, dismissed Vietnam's offer of 0% tariffs on U.S. imports, emphasizing "non-tariff cheating" as a more significant issue. He cited issues like intellectual property theft, value-added taxes, and currency manipulation as barriers to fair trade. This shift suggests that negotiating countries face higher expectations, requiring major domestic changes to eliminate non-tariff barriers. The stock market has reacted negatively to the tariff news, with significant losses recorded last week.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States will hold direct talks with Iran on its nuclear program, beginning Saturday, stating that the meeting will be at "almost the highest level." He stated that doing a deal would be preferable to the alternative and warned that if the talks aren't successful, "it will be a very bad day for Iran." Netanyahu said he and Trump are united in the goal that Tehran will never get nuclear weapons, while Trump also reiterated his vision of a post-war exodus of Palestinians from Gaza.</p>

The court emphasized that judicial review is required and the law can only be used when war has been declared or the United States has been invaded.</p>

            <p>China has vowed to take “countermeasures” against any move by the United States to further raise tariffs and pledged to take firm action to stabilize the markets, after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap another 50 per cent duty on Chinese imports. China’s Ministry of Commerce said that China “firmly opposes” any moves to increase tariffs by the US and vowed to “resolutely respond” if it does so. Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would “provide relending support if necessary to resolutely defend the stability of the capital market”.</p>
