          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang cautioned that if the U.S. continues to restrict AI semiconductor exports to China, Huawei will capitalize on its domestic market advantage. While acknowledging Nvidia's technological lead, Huang stressed the importance of global AI developers using American technology to maintain competitiveness. He also expressed confidence in President Trump's understanding of the industry and his support for Nvidia. Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei admitted that Huawei's single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation, despite U.S. export curbs that restrict Chinese firms from buying advanced semiconductors used in the development of AI. The article underscores the delicate balance between national security concerns and the potential for unintended consequences in the global technology landscape.

          <p>Demonstrations broke out in Nairobi after blogger Albert Ojwang died in police custody, sparking outrage and clashes between protesters and police.

President William Ruto condemned the death and acknowledged police involvement, prompting apologies from the Inspector General of Police. Ojwang, known for his political and social commentary, was arrested for allegedly defaming a deputy police chief, leading to questions about police conduct and accountability.

Symptoms of infection include strange app marketplaces, disabled Play Protect settings, and devices advertised as unlocked or capable of free streaming.

          <p>The planned military parade in Washington, D.C., is criticized for its focus on celebrating power rather than honoring service, with tanks and infantry fighting vehicles set to parade through the capital. The author argues that the administration's approach reflects a misunderstanding of the country's real strengths, such as its research universities and diverse military personnel. The parade's emphasis on old technology and the misuse of the National Guard are seen as undermining the tribute that should be paid to those who have defended freedom. The author suggests a more meaningful parade would highlight the Army's history, values, and accomplishments, including the contributions of diverse units throughout its history. The optimism score reflects the author's concern about the parade's message and implications.</p>
