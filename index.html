        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the U.S. are taking a toll, with exports plummeting and some items halting entirely, according to customs data, as retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. This cutback is likely to pressure U.S. manufacturers heavily reliant on Chinese rare earths, essential for products from smartphones to military equipment. China's strategic advantage in rare earth supply chains is being leveraged amid the trade war, leading to dramatic declines in U.S.-bound shipments of metals like tellurium and tungsten. The move highlights the complex interplay of trade, technology, and geopolitics in the modern global economy.</p>

          <p>China's CATL claims its second-generation Shenxing battery can add 520 km of driving range with just five minutes of charging, potentially surpassing BYD's recent advancements.

Analysts had expressed skepticism about BYD's earlier claims, noting potential technical hurdles and high costs, but if proven feasible, CATL's tech could address consumer concerns about EV range and convenience.

          <p>Walgreens has agreed to pay up to $350 million to settle accusations by the U.S. Department of Justice that it illegally filled millions of prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The settlement includes a minimum payment of $300 million, with an additional $50 million due if the company is sold or merged before 2032. The government alleged that Walgreens knowingly filled illegal prescriptions despite red flags and pressured pharmacists to fill them quickly, violating the False Claims Act. Walgreens denies liability but says the resolution allows them to close opioid-related litigation and focus on their turnaround strategy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after their statuses were allegedly unlawfully revoked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The ACLU and other groups filed a lawsuit claiming ICE abruptly terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), making students deportable. The lawsuit argues ICE's actions coerce students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting, despite not violating their status. Some students represented are nearing graduation or enrolled in work programs, and many had charges dropped.</p>

          <p>The UK government will publish the nationalities of foreign criminals living in the country for the first time, revealing data on their crimes and deportation status. The move comes amid pressure to increase transparency and address concerns about the impact of migration on crime rates. Official data indicates over 19,000 foreign offenders are awaiting deportation, with Albanians, Romanians, and Poles being the most common nationalities. The most frequent offenses include drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is presenting central banks globally with a complex challenge: whether to devalue their own currencies to maintain export competitiveness or risk imported inflation. A weaker dollar can ease the debt burden for countries with dollar-denominated debt and potentially allow central banks to cut rates to boost growth. However, devaluation could provoke retaliatory measures from the U.S. and stoke inflation, making central banks hesitant to pursue this path. For now, avoiding a currency war seems to be the preferred course of action.</p>
