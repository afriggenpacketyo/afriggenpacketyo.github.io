        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has expressed strong disapproval of President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, stating it complicates efforts to find a mutually agreed solution to the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson mentioned that the union is prepared to implement countermeasures in response to the tariff increase. The United Steelworkers union also criticized Trump's announcement, highlighting the potential risk to Canadian industries and workers. The EU had previously paused its countermeasures to allow negotiations but is ready to reinstate them if a resolution is not reached, with consultations on expanded measures currently underway. Optimism about a quick resolution is low given the escalating tensions. </p>

          <p>Germany's far-right AfD party is leveraging traditional Christian culture and values to appeal to a broader audience, particularly by stoking fears about Islam and social change. While not all AfD members are devout Christians, the party exploits the perceived special role of Christianity in Germany's history and culture, often using it to attack immigration. Beatrix von Storch, a prominent AfD politician, has expressed concerns about the decline of Christian values and the rise of Islamic influence, and she has faced sanctions for transphobic remarks. Critics argue that the AfD's connection to Christianity is instrumental, aimed at capitalizing on social uncertainty rather than fostering genuine ties with churches.</p>

          <p>Grupo Firme, a popular Mexican regional music band, canceled their performance at a California music festival after the U.S. government suspended their visas. This action follows the State Department's revocation of visas for several Mexican musicians who perform music that allegedly glorifies cartel violence. The band stated that the visas of its members and team are under "administrative review by the U.S. Embassy," preventing them from performing at La Onda Fest. The U.S. government has been targeting Mexican artists who glorify cartel leaders, while some argue that the music reflects the harsh realities faced by Mexican youth caught in cartel violence. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults suggests that parenting should be guided by instinct, culture, and the individual child, rather than complicated advice from influencers or clickbait. Parents should trust their instincts, follow cultural traditions, and pay attention to their child's unique interests. The focus should be on enjoyment and creating a joyful environment rather than obsessing over developmental milestones. The most important thing is for parents to be their real selves, providing love and attention, rather than striving for an unattainable ideal of perfection.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent pardons of rapper NBA YoungBoy and gangster Larry Hoover are viewed as a calculated effort to gain support from the Black community. These pardons are seen as disingenuous, considering Trump's past rhetoric and policies that have negatively impacted Black Americans. Trump has previously suggested that Black people support him because they, like him, have been mistreated by the criminal justice system, a sentiment many find insulting. While some Black celebrities have aligned with Trump, critics argue that these moves are self-serving and do not address the systemic issues facing the Black community.</p>

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, has reported that Iran has significantly increased its production of highly enriched uranium. Iran now possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a level well above civilian use and close to weapons grade, marking a near 50% increase in three months. The IAEA said it could not confirm whether Iran's program remains peaceful, prompting Israel to accuse Iran of being "totally determined" to acquire nuclear weapons. Despite ongoing negotiations between Tehran and Washington, the report indicates no slowdown in Iran's enrichment efforts.</p>
