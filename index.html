          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm, is currently moving west across the Pacific Ocean on a path toward Hawaii. Forecasters anticipate that swells from the hurricane could generate life-threatening surf and rip currents for the islands by the end of the weekend, with potential direct impacts like high winds and heavy rain beginning early next week. In response to the threat, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to prepare for the storm's arrival and monitor official updates. The National Weather Service is particularly concerned about the risk of flooding from anticipated heavy rainfall.</p>

          <p>The city of Austin has unveiled a new unified brand logo, a wavy blue and green "A," as part of a $1.1 million project intended to consolidate over 300 different departmental logos. The redesign has drawn sharp criticism from some residents and politicians, with one congressman calling it a "woke-looking" flop and others comparing it to a textbook publisher's emblem. City officials defended the expense, stating it will create a consistent brand identity for city services and will be phased in gradually to minimize budget impact. The new logo officially rolls out on October 1, 2025, starting with digital assets.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic funicular crash in Lisbon has resulted in the deaths of 16 people, including three British nationals. The victims, identified in part as theatre director Kayleigh Smith and her partner Will Nelson, were on the popular tourist attraction when it derailed and struck a building. The incident has prompted an independent investigation by the public transport operator, which stated that all maintenance protocols had been followed. Portugal's Prime Minister has described the event as a major tragedy, and a national day of mourning has been declared for the victims.</p>

Adams is facing a challenging race against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. In a heated statement, Adams called Cuomo "a snake and a liar" and asserted that he is the only candidate capable of defeating Mamdani. The political maneuvering comes as Trump seeks to consolidate the opposition against the front-running Democratic nominee.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies conducted a major raid at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgia, detaining 475 individuals suspected of working in the country illegally. Officials stated the operation was part of an ongoing investigation into unlawful employment practices and that most of those detained were Korean nationals working for subcontractors at the site. The raid, described as the largest single-site operation in Homeland Security Investigations' history, has shut down construction on an adjacent battery plant. Hyundai stated that none of the detained individuals were its direct employees but committed to investigating its suppliers.</p>

          <p>Kent Broussard, a 66-year-old retired accountant from Baton Rouge, has achieved a lifelong ambition by successfully auditioning for the Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band. Having dreamed of playing the tuba for the band since he was a child, Broussard returned to school and relearned the instrument to compete for a spot. The band's director confirmed that Broussard was not given any special treatment during the competitive audition process. Now the oldest member of the band by over four decades, he hopes his story inspires others to pursue their dreams regardless of age.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has introduced a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could increase his net worth to over $1 trillion if the company achieves a series of ambitious goals over the next decade. The package, which requires shareholder approval, is tied to increasing Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion and meeting significant production targets, including for Robotaxis and humanoid robots. This proposal aims to ensure Musk's long-term commitment to the company. The plan comes while his previous $50 billion pay package from 2018 remains contested in a Delaware court.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. is facing intense criticism from the scientific community following his recent firing of the new CDC director, Susan Monarez, which prompted several senior staff members to resign in protest. During a Senate hearing, Kennedy defended his actions and reiterated his intent to reform the agency he has previously called "the most corrupt" in government. The conflict stems from Kennedy's long-held skepticism of vaccines and his recent moves to install critics of established vaccine science in advisory roles. These changes are raising alarms about the potential weakening of U.S. and global public health systems.</p>

          <p>AI company Anthropic has agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who accused the firm of using their copyrighted books without permission to train its AI model, Claude. The settlement, which awaits court approval, would compensate authors approximately $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 works involved. This case is significant as it follows a judge's split ruling that found training on legally obtained works could be fair use, but using pirated books was not. The outcome is seen as a major precedent for how AI companies must handle copyrighted material.</p>

The FAIR Plan has seen its policyholder numbers swell as traditional insurers have withdrawn from the state.

The annuity option is described as a "safe bet" that makes it more difficult to lose the entire fortune quickly.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States will host the G20 summit in 2026, coinciding with the nation's 250th anniversary. He specified that the event will be held at his own Doral golf resort in Florida, a plan he had previously proposed and then abandoned for a G7 summit during his first term due to criticism over self-profiting. Trump dismissed financial motivations, stating the location is ideal, and confirmed that Vice President JD Vance will attend this year's summit in South Africa in his place. He also indicated he would be open to Russian and Chinese leaders attending as "observers."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a last-minute change to their pitching rotation for their series opener against the Baltimore Orioles. Scheduled starter Tyler Glasnow was scratched due to back tightness, and two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani volunteered to take the mound on short notice. Ohtani had his own recent start skipped due to illness but was deemed ready to pitch. Manager Dave Roberts expressed hope that Glasnow's issue is not serious and praised Ohtani's willingness to step up for the team, which is looking to bounce back from a recent series sweep.</p>

He was also cited for making discourteous and biased comments to defendants, crime victims, and prospective jurors, such as suggesting a woman would have a "meth baby." Monguia did not contest the admonishment and expressed regret for his actions, which the panel deemed an abuse of authority.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz has advanced to the US Open final after a commanding straight-sets victory over Novak Djokovic, winning 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2. The 22-year-old Spaniard showcased his superior energy and composure, overcoming the 38-year-old tennis legend in the semi-final matchup. While Djokovic fought hard, particularly in a tense second-set tie-break, he was ultimately unable to match the physicality and consistent power of his younger opponent. This marks the first time Alcaraz has reached a Grand Slam final without dropping a single set, underscoring his dominant form throughout the tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major scandal is unfolding in Australia after an independent consumer group found that 16 of 20 popular sunscreens failed to meet their advertised SPF rating. One prominent brand, Ultra Violette, which claimed an SPF of 50+, was found to have an actual rating as low as SPF 4 in some tests, leading to a product recall. The findings have sparked public outrage and a probe by the country's medical regulator in a nation with the world's highest skin cancer rates. The issue has raised broader questions about the reliability of sunscreen testing and regulation globally.</p>
