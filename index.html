            <p>China has cautioned nations against attempting to appease the United States through trade deals that compromise China's interests, particularly concerning President Trump's tariffs. A commerce ministry spokesperson stated that China would firmly oppose any such agreements and retaliate accordingly, echoing similar sentiments from state-controlled media. The warning comes amidst reports that the U.S. plans to pressure countries into restricting trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from U.S. import taxes, as the Trump administration initiates tariff negotiations with various trading partners. China emphasizes its determination to defend its rights and resist any attempts at economic coercion.</p>

Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges.

            <p>Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, once considered a frontrunner to become Canada's next prime minister, faces challenges due to President Trump's economic policies towards Canada. Trump's attacks on Canada's economy and sovereignty have sparked nationalism and boosted support for the Liberal Party. Poilievre, known for his populist rhetoric and similarities to Trump, now struggles to gain traction as Canadians react negatively to Trump's actions. The upcoming election is expected to focus on who is best equipped to handle relations with the U.S. under Trump's leadership.</p>

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, a war-linked site in Tokyo, as the shrine began its three-day spring festival. Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine during the festival, likely due to diplomatic considerations amid improving relations with China and South Korea. Past visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have drawn criticism from these countries, which view it as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Cabinet ministers also sent offerings to the shrine.</p>

India hopes to secure a trade deal within the 90-day pause declared on tariffs on Indian imports to the United States.

            <p>JPMorgan has released research outlining its expectations for President Trump's tariff policies, anticipating an effective tariff rate between 10% and 20%. The firm projects that these tariffs will lead to slower economic growth, increased unemployment, and higher inflation, while narrowly avoiding a full-blown recession. JPMorgan recommends that investors consider structured notes and hedge funds within diversified portfolios to navigate the more volatile environment. Structured notes offer defensive exposure and income through options premiums, while hedge funds can exploit market mispricings. (not investment advice)</p>

The season's focus on fractured bonds and unrelenting cheerlessness, as opposed to the first season's exploration of building relationships in impossible circumstances, leads to a more circular and suffocating narrative.</p>
