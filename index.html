          <p>China is undertaking one of its most ambitious and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. The project faces extreme engineering challenges, traversing high-altitude permafrost and mountain ranges, with an estimated cost reaching up to US$56.2 billion. This railway is considered strategically important for Beijing, aiming to enhance connectivity and economic integration in its western autonomous regions. The massive investment underscores the project's national significance despite the formidable construction hurdles.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the former frontman of the band Lostprophets, has died at age 48 after being attacked in HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for numerous child sex offenses. Two inmates have been arrested on suspicion of murder following the incident. Watkins was convicted in 2013 for heinous crimes, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby, which the sentencing judge described as plunging into "new depths of depravity." The attack occurs shortly after a report highlighted increased violence at the prison, particularly towards inmates convicted of sexual offenses.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has announced that an illegal and forceful attempt to seize power is underway in the country. The warning comes as a faction of soldiers joined large-scale anti-government protests, initially sparked by the youth-led "Gen-Z" movement over police brutality and shortages of essential utilities. These demonstrations have since evolved into broader calls for political change, with soldiers clashing with gendarmes before joining protesters in the capital. The island nation, one of the world's poorest, has a history of political instability and is facing a deepening crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has proposed doubling its tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move aimed at protecting its struggling domestic industry from global overproduction. This decision is seen as both a protective measure against cheap imports, particularly from China, and a strategic maneuver to gain trade concessions from the United States, which recently imposed similar tariffs. While the European Steel Association hailed the policy as a "lifeline," China criticized it as protectionism, and concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact on the steel industries in the UK and India.

An intense price war and the rise of e-commerce rivals have left most of the country's 30,000 dealers with negative cash flow and significant losses.

          <p>The European Union is phasing in its new digital border system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track the entry and exit of non-EU citizens in the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces passport stamping, requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon their first entry. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel in the long run, there are concerns about potential delays and queues during the initial registration process at borders like Dover and Eurostar terminals. The EES is expected to be fully operational at all Schengen border crossings by April 2026.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to qualify for the upcoming World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the team's failure to reach the 2022 finals. Clarke, who has successfully led Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, still feels the sting of the 3-1 play-off defeat to Ukraine that ended their previous World Cup hopes. He acknowledges the disappointment of that match, which was rescheduled due to the war in Ukraine and played under unusual circumstances with key players missing. A victory in their upcoming game against Belarus would significantly boost their chances for qualification.</p>

This development highlights Germany's ongoing efforts to integrate its diverse population and adapt its public and institutional calendars.

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the mechanism by which a single differentiated plant cell can regenerate into a whole new plant. Their research, published in the journal Cell, identifies two specific genetic switches that can be flipped to induce this process, known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized egg cells. The findings represent a significant breakthrough in biology, offering new insights into cellular plasticity and potentially revolutionizing plant cloning and agricultural science by enabling regeneration from non-reproductive cells.</p>

          <p>Fresh allegations against Prince Andrew, stemming from a newly revealed email, have intensified pressure on the Royal Family to further distance themselves from the disgraced Duke of York. The email suggests he maintained contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he admitted in his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, casting doubt on his credibility. While Andrew has already been stripped of his HRH title and public duties, the King has limited options for further formal sanctions, such as removing his Duke of York title, which would require an act of Parliament. The continuous scandals present a significant reputational challenge.</p>

          <p>King Miller, a redshirt freshman walk-on running back, delivered a breakout performance to lead USC to a crucial 31-13 victory against No. 15 Michigan. Thrust into action after USC's top two running backs left with injuries, Miller rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown, repeatedly breaking through a stout Michigan defense. His unexpected heroics powered a dominant ground game that was the key difference in the contest. The statement win is a major boost for coach Lincoln Riley and puts the Trojans back into the conversation for a potential College Football Playoff spot.</p>

          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers have advanced to the NLCS after defeating the Chicago Cubs 3-1 in the decisive fifth game of their division series. Key home runs from Andrew Vaughn, William Contreras, and Brice Turang powered the Brewers' offense, while a collective effort from five relief pitchers shut down the Cubs' lineup. This marks the Brewers' first postseason series victory since 2018, a particularly satisfying win as it came against their regional rivals and former manager Craig Counsell. Milwaukee will now face the Los Angeles Dodgers for a spot in the World Series.</p>

          <p>Beijing has criticized Washington for employing "double standards" following President Trump's threat to impose a new 100% tariff on Chinese goods and control software exports. In response, China stated it would take necessary measures to protect its interests. The escalation comes after China introduced its own new export limits on rare earth minerals, which are critical for technology and defense industries. Beijing defended its export controls as necessary for national security amid global instability, while asserting that its position on trade wars remains unchanged: it does not want one, but is not afraid to fight.

          <h2>Key Challenges the Los Angeles Dodgers Face Against the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series, a matchup that presents several distinct challenges. The Brewers, despite a much smaller payroll, have built a formidable team centered on a "small-ball" offensive approach that emphasizes getting on base, stealing, and clutch hitting. Their primary strength, however, is a deep and effective pitching staff that ranked second in the majors in team ERA and twice swept the Dodgers during the regular season. Key players to watch include ace Freddy Peralta and breakout rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, a former Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent and investment banker, is planning to run for mayor in 2026, challenging incumbent Karen Bass. Beutner is launching his campaign by heavily criticizing the city's leadership, particularly Mayor Bass's response to the devastating Palisades fire, which he argues was hampered by a "failure of leadership" and inadequate resources. He also cites rising crime and housing costs as key issues facing the city. Beutner's entry into the race marks the first serious challenge to Bass and could significantly reshape the political landscape ahead of the election.</p>
