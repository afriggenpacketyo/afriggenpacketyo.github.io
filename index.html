He alleges they illegally spied on Republican lawmakers during an investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, a claim stemming from a probe that obtained lawmakers' phone metadata but not call content. This continues a pattern of Trump urging legal action against his political adversaries, following recent indictments of other figures he has targeted.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated he is "open" to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) during his upcoming trip to South Korea. Acknowledging North Korea as "sort of a nuclear power," Trump indicated a desire to continue the diplomatic relationship established during his first term, which included three historic summits. While White House officials clarified that no meeting is currently scheduled, they reiterated that the president remains open to talks without preconditions to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula.</p>

Following her successful surgery, which dramatically improved her well-being, three of her older sisters were subsequently diagnosed with the same condition and related issues after exhibiting various symptoms. After a series of successful surgeries for each child, the family is now enjoying a new sense of normalcy and health, highlighting the challenges of diagnosing rare genetic conditions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has uncovered and dismantled the country's first known illegal factory producing weight-loss drugs. The raid in Northampton resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight-loss medicines, including thousands of unlicensed pens and raw ingredients worth over £250,000. Officials warned that these unauthorized products are untested and potentially deadly, urging the public to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies to avoid risks posed by organized criminal networks.</p>

          <p>Carlos Ramirez Valdez, a 61-year-old former pastor in Orange County, has been sentenced to 45 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting three young girls over an eight-year period. Valdez used his position of trust at two different churches to commit the abuses, which occurred in locations like a church basement and his van, starting when one victim was just four years old. The abuse came to light after one of the girls reported it to a school counselor, leading to an investigation and his eventual conviction on 14 felony counts.</p>

          <h2>California Wildlife Officials Euthanize Four Gray Wolves After Surge in Cattle Attacks</h2>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has euthanized four members of the Beyem Seyo gray wolf pack due to an "unprecedented" number of cattle kills in the Sierra Valley. Officials stated the wolves were responsible for 70 livestock losses between March and September and had become dangerously reliant on cattle for food, a behavior they were passing on to their young. The decision was made after extensive non-lethal hazing methods failed to deter the pack, highlighting the ongoing conflict between ranchers and the state's recovering, but still protected, wolf population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new federal law signed by President Trump is set to enact nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade, causing significant anxiety in low-income rural areas like Louisiana's East Carroll Parish. The law introduces stricter work reporting requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which researchers estimate could cause hundreds of thousands in Louisiana to lose their health coverage. For residents in the impoverished Delta region, where Medicaid expansion has been a crucial lifeline, the looming cuts threaten to reverse recent gains in healthcare access and exacerbate existing economic hardships.</p>

          <p>In a move seen as hopeful by traditionalist Catholics, American Cardinal Raymond Burke celebrated the old Latin Mass in St. Peter's Basilica with the explicit approval of the new Pope Leo XIV. This marks a potential shift from the policies of Pope Francis, who in 2021 significantly restricted the use of the traditional liturgy, citing concerns that it had become a source of division and opposition to the Second Vatican Council. The approval is being interpreted by supporters as a sign that the new pontiff may be more open to dialogue and reconciliation regarding liturgical practices within the Church.</p>

          <p>Researchers have captured rare and significant footage of a Bornean clouded leopard with two cubs in Indonesia's Tanjung Puting National Park. This is the first time a female of this threatened species has been documented with two offspring in the park, providing a hopeful sign for the declining population. Clouded leopards have a low reproductive rate and require undisturbed rainforest to thrive, so the presence of a successful breeding female indicates that conservation efforts within the park are creating a sufficiently protected and healthy habitat.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive military posture towards Venezuela, including strikes on alleged drug boats and authorizing CIA operations, is reportedly being driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This hardline approach, which has triumphed over more pragmatic voices within the administration, frames President Nicolás Maduro as a "narco-terrorist" and leverages the Patriot Act to justify military action. Analysts suggest the policy aims to provoke a response from the Venezuelan military that could lead to Maduro's ouster, reasserting U.S. influence in the region in a revival of the Monroe Doctrine.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs report indicates that major Chinese companies are increasingly shifting their export focus away from the United States and towards less-developed markets like Southeast Asia. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-U.S. markets have grown at an annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the U.S. have slightly declined. This strategic pivot allows Chinese firms to leverage their low-cost advantages and build new supply chains, while also moving up the value chain by exporting higher-end products to these emerging economies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary argues that the Trump administration's recent military strikes against alleged drug boats off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia are a modern application of the Monroe Doctrine. The author contends that for over two centuries, the U.S. has treated Latin America as a region to be dominated for its own interests, often justifying intervention under various pretexts. The current actions, framed as a war on "narco-terrorists," are seen as a way to rally domestic support and project strength, continuing a historical pattern of aggression that disregards international law and the sovereignty of Latin American nations.</p>

          <p>A proposal to erect a $2.3-million fence around Los Angeles's MacArthur Park has sparked debate over how to manage public safety and accessibility in the historic urban space. Officials and some residents support the fence as a necessary measure to combat issues like open-air drug markets and violence, which they say make the park unsafe for families. However, homeless advocates and social service groups argue that a fence would isolate vulnerable populations, hinder outreach efforts, and fail to address the root causes of homelessness and drug addiction in the community.</p>
