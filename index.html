          <p>Sergio Gor, President Trump's nominee for ambassador to India, has committed to steering New Delhi closer to the United States and away from China's influence. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Gor addressed concerns about recent strains in the relationship, describing them as mere "hiccups" and expressing confidence in a warmer partnership. He outlined his priorities, which include deepening defense and security cooperation through expanded joint military exercises and concluding critical defense sales. Gor also pledged to focus on opening Indian markets to more American goods and ending India's reliance on Russian oil purchases, reinforcing a strategic alignment with the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis highlights the minimal returns offered by traditional savings accounts, even with a substantial deposit of $10,000. With the national average interest rate at just 0.39% and August's inflation rate rising to 2.9%, money held in these accounts is effectively losing purchasing power. The article calculates that a $10,000 deposit would earn less than $40 in interest over an entire year, a figure that is neither reliable nor sufficient to keep pace with inflation. It suggests that savers should consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs), which currently offer significantly higher returns. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration argues that allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook, which predate her time in office, demonstrate a lack of trustworthiness required for her position. If Cook is removed, President Trump could appoint her replacement, potentially giving him more influence over the central bank's monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving closer to deploying the "nuclear option" to confirm President Trump's sub-Cabinet-level nominees after negotiations with Democrats for a bipartisan agreement fell apart. A proposed deal, which would have allowed for voting on nominees in batches, was blocked on the floor, leading to increased frustration. With the collapse of these talks, Republicans are expected to use a simple majority vote to change Senate rules, allowing an unlimited number of nominees to be confirmed en bloc with a reduced debate time.

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick finished his first round at the BMW PGA Championship with a strong six-under-par 66, partly due to a bizarre incident involving a potentially stolen ball. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found upon resumption of play. Witnesses reported seeing two individuals run out of the bushes with a golf ball, leading to the belief it was stolen. This allowed Fitzpatrick to take a penalty drop instead of playing his provisional ball, a situation he believes ultimately saved him at least one shot and resulted in a better score.</p>

          <p>A new study examined the cost-effectiveness of major individual tax incentives, finding that many fail to achieve their stated goals and primarily benefit specific constituencies rather than the broader economy. The article argues that while some provisions like 401(k) deductions effectively encourage new savings, others like the mortgage-interest deduction and education credits are wasteful. These expenditures reportedly do little to increase homeownership or college enrollment, instead subsidizing larger homes for wealthier households and allowing colleges to raise tuition. The author concludes that such tax breaks complicate the tax code, drain revenue, and should be eliminated to promote fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <h2>Oracle Stock Declines 6% Amid Concerns Over Heavy Reliance on OpenAI as a Client</h2>

          <p>Oracle's shares fell by 6% on Thursday, reversing a massive rally from the previous day, after a report raised concerns about the company's client concentration. The stock had surged nearly 36% after Oracle announced multi-billion-dollar cloud infrastructure contracts, swelling its backlog to $455 billion. However, enthusiasm cooled following a Wall Street Journal report that a single customer, OpenAI, is responsible for $300 billion of that total over five years. This heavy dependence on one client has tempered investor optimism, leading analysts to express caution despite the company's impressive growth projections.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into seven major technology companies, including OpenAI, Alphabet, Meta, and Snap, regarding the potential negative effects of their AI chatbots on children and teenagers. The agency is seeking information on the safety measures these companies have implemented, particularly when chatbots act as companions and simulate human relationships. The probe will examine how the companies monetize user engagement, handle personal data, and mitigate harmful impacts. This action follows growing concerns over the societal impact of AI companions and reports of chatbots engaging in inappropriate conversations with minors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is unfolding in Germany over whether classic literary works by authors like Goethe should remain central to the high school curriculum. Critics argue that the required reading lists are dominated by white male authors and fail to reflect the country's diverse student population, over 25% of whom have an immigrant background. Students and some educators are calling for more contemporary and relevant texts that resonate with young people's lives. While some advocate for reform to include more diverse voices, others stress the importance of studying classics to understand history and develop critical thinking, suggesting a balanced approach is needed.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has ignited a powerful wave of grief and rage online, particularly among right-wing influencers and commentators. While many mourned the 31-year-old as a martyr for their cause, others quickly directed their anger toward the political left, blaming their rhetoric for fostering an environment of violence. President Trump echoed these sentiments, claiming that years of hostile language from the left were "directly responsible for the terrorism" seen today. This reaction has emerged even as law enforcement continues to search for the shooter, with no information yet released about the attacker's identity or motives.</p>

          <p>The NFL has announced it will not discipline Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson for shoving a Buffalo Bills fan during a game on Sunday. The incident occurred after the fan slapped the helmets of both Jackson and his teammate DeAndre Hopkins as they celebrated a touchdown near the stands. The fan was ejected and subsequently banned from all NFL stadiums. While Jackson later expressed regret for letting his emotions get the better of him, the Ravens organization stated it has handled the matter internally and implemented additional security protocols to better protect its players during fan interactions.</p>

          <p>For the first time in NATO's history, allied aircraft have engaged potential threats in allied airspace after Polish and Dutch fighter jets shot down armed Russian drones over Poland. The incursion drew swift condemnation from European leaders, who called the act "unacceptable" and "reckless." However, the response from U.S. President Donald Trump has been notably muted, causing concern among allies about the American commitment to collective defense under Article 5. Analysts suggest the drone incursion was a deliberate test by Russia to probe NATO's defenses and exploit potential divisions within the alliance, particularly between the U.S. and its European partners.</p>

The strong consumer demand, particularly from Gen Z, comes at a crucial time for Kodak, which recently warned of financial instability.

The sacking, which occurred just a week before a state visit from President Trump, has prompted calls from the opposition for full transparency regarding the vetting process for Mandelson's appointment.

          <p>A legislative battle is underway in California over a bill that would ban PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," from cookware and other consumer products. The proposal has pitted environmental advocates, including actor Mark Ruffalo, against a group of celebrity chefs and the cookware industry. Proponents of the bill point to the significant health risks associated with PFAS exposure, such as cancer and liver damage, arguing that safer alternatives like stainless steel and cast iron exist. Opponents, including chefs Rachael Ray and Thomas Keller, argue that the nonstick coatings are safe when used correctly and that a ban could make cooking more difficult for families.</p>
