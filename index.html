        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data reveals a significant drop in freight vessel traffic from China to major U.S. ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, reflecting the impact of tariffs and recession fears. Container vessel traffic is down 29% week-over-week and 44% year-over-year, with a corresponding decrease in shipping container arrivals. The slowdown is also affecting ground transport, with a precipitous drop in available truck loads. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a potential de-escalation of the trade war with China in the near future, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the economic downturn.</p>
