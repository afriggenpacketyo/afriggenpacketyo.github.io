          <p>Dominican Republic authorities confiscated 377 packages of cocaine, part of an estimated 1,000 kilograms, from a speedboat destroyed by a U.S. Navy aerial strike. This marks the first joint U.S.-Dominican Republic operation against narcoterrorism in the Caribbean, aimed at disrupting drug transport to the United States. President Trump had previously announced the strike, which killed three individuals, as part of a broader mission to combat drug trafficking off Venezuela. However, human rights groups have criticized these strikes as extrajudicial killings, leading to a resolution in Congress seeking to block further actions, raising complex ethical questions.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a self-stated democratic socialist, is facing significant opposition from the city's billionaire class and powerful real estate lobby. Wealthy donors, including figures like Michael Bloomberg and Ron Lauder, have poured millions into supporting rival Andrew Cuomo to counter Mamdani's proposals for rent freezes and higher taxes on the richest 1%. Despite this immense financial opposition and "panic" among elites, Mamdani maintains a commanding lead in polls. This article highlights a struggle between entrenched wealth and progressive political change, suggesting that money alone may not determine the election's outcome.</p>

          <p>Many highly qualified U.S. job seekers, including those with advanced degrees and extensive experience, are struggling in a "bleak" labor market, reporting hundreds of applications yielding few interviews and a rise in scam offers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down job additions for early 2025, and long-term unemployment is climbing, with underemployment also growing as people take jobs below their skill level. Factors like AI-driven hiring tools, over-reliance on networking, and economic uncertainty due to tariffs are compounding these issues. This article reveals a stark disconnect between official statistics and the lived experiences of job seekers, causing widespread financial and emotional strain.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of its founder Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA (TPUSA) is experiencing a significant increase in financial support from large donors and Donald Trump allies. Lynn Friess, widow of an early backer, pledged $1 million, and other major figures are boosting their contributions, ensuring the group's continued influence on the American right. TPUSA's fundraising success, which saw its revenue double to $85 million in 2024, is attributed to Kirk's strong ties to Trump and the MAGA movement. His widow, Erika Kirk, has taken over leadership, with supporters viewing Kirk as a martyr whose legacy will drive youth engagement and voter turnout.</p>

          <p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, while both professionally managed and offering diversification, have key distinctions important for investors. ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day, providing immediate pricing, unlike mutual funds which price at day's end. ETFs also offer significant tax efficiency due to "in-kind" transactions, rarely distributing capital gains to shareholders in taxable accounts, a major advantage over mutual funds. Furthermore, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios, making them a cheaper investment option. However, mutual funds still offer a wider selection and are more common in 401(k) plans.

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved a £2.2 billion privately-financed plan for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. The project involves relocating the Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular use, projected to increase annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. While proponents emphasize economic benefits, the plan faces strong opposition from climate campaigners and local residents concerned about noise and environmental impact. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate some of these concerns.</p>

Reform claims this policy would save over £234 billion, though this figure has been disputed by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

          <p>Duke University researchers have made a surprising discovery: under specific conditions, pancreatic alpha cells, previously thought to only produce glucagon, can "switch gears" to produce GLP-1, a hormone mimicked by diabetes drugs like Ozempic. When glucagon production was blocked in mice, alpha cells ramped up GLP-1, enhancing insulin release and blood sugar control. This finding suggests the human body has a built-in "backup plan" for managing blood sugar and could lead to new, more natural therapeutic approaches for type 2 diabetes by boosting pancreatic GLP-1 output.

          <p>Robert Reich, former Labor Secretary, sharply criticizes America's leadership class across universities, religious institutions, businesses, and media for their "deafening silence" in defending constitutional rights against the Trump administration's actions. He argues that these leaders have abdicated their moral responsibility, succumbing to greed and cowardice, and are failing to protect free speech, assembly, and due process. Reich contends that this leadership vacuum means ordinary citizens must step up and become leaders themselves to defend democracy. The article serves as a powerful call to action and a critique of institutional failures in a time of democratic crisis.</p>

          <p>The recent death of Robert Redford has rekindled interest in the decades-old, unresolved murder of his daughter Shauna's boyfriend, Sid Wells, in 1983. Wells' roommate, Thayne Alan Smika, was initially arrested but charges were dropped, and he disappeared in 1986. A 2010 warrant was issued for Smika's arrest after new DNA tests, prompting Redford to thank authorities for their continued efforts. The FBI recently announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to Smika's capture, highlighting the enduring impact of the crime on the Wells and Redford families, who have long sought justice.</p>

          <p>A solo practitioner is facing a motion for sanctions from the Trump administration for her efforts to prevent an immigrant client's removal, despite securing a court order against it. This case highlights a novel strategy by the administration to target immigration attorneys personally, raising ethics concerns and potentially ruining their professional records. The lawyer, who took the case pro bono, argues the government defied human rights treaties and due process by proceeding with the client's removal.

His work also includes drawings that delete figures from colonial paintings, revealing the constructed nature of racial hierarchies.

          <p>Chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% or more of school days, is highest among kindergartners in California, with significant long-term impacts on literacy and social-emotional development. A report by Families in Schools found that illness and difficulty transitioning from home to school are primary reasons for absences, often not perceived as problematic by parents. Despite efforts by the Los Angeles Unified School District to improve attendance, nearly one-third of Latino kindergartners were chronically absent in 2023-24.

          <p>MQ-9 Predator drones, once reserved for border surveillance and war zones, are now being deployed to monitor protests on U.S. soil, marking a significant policy shift by the Department of Homeland Security. These high-tech aircraft, capable of beaming live video and tracking individuals, were used over anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, raising civil liberties concerns. While DHS claims the flights enhance officer safety, critics argue it's a "gross abuse of authority" and an impingement on First Amendment rights. Legislation has been introduced to restrict such deployments, as experts anticipate increased domestic drone use due to reduced migrant crossings.</p>

          <p>The rapid, eight-month federal cleanup of 2.6 million tons of wildfire wreckage from nearly 9,700 properties in Los Angeles, following the Eaton and Palisades fires, is being lauded as historically fast.

Soil testing was largely bypassed, and subsequent university research found elevated levels of toxic metals in many "cleaned" properties. Issues like over-excavation, improper handling of contaminated pool water, and a wealth gap in cleanup options have left many survivors with lingering doubts and potential financial burdens, despite the overall efficiency of the operation.</p>
