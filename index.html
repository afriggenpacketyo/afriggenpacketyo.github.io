          <p>President Trump's executive order aims to dismantle the US Department of Education, a long-standing conservative goal.  However, complete closure requires congressional approval, which is considered unlikely. The department's functions, including student loan programs and funding for public schools, would need to be transferred to other agencies, a process fraught with political and logistical challenges.</p>
