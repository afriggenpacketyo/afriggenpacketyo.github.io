          <p>President Trump indicated he might deploy active-duty Marines to California due to ongoing immigration enforcement protests, supporting Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's suggestion. This follows the deployment of California National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a decision criticized by Democratic governors like Gavin Newsom. Trump stated the threshold for sending Marines would be based on his assessment of danger to the country and its citizens, emphasizing a strong stance on law and order. He also accused protestors of spitting at police officers, stating his administration would not tolerate such behavior. The president conveyed his intentions to maintain order and ensure the safety of the country and its citizens.</p>

          <p>Israel has cautioned it will use necessary measures to prevent the 'Madleen' yacht, carrying pro-Palestinian activists and aid, from reaching Gaza, citing security concerns. Defence Minister Israel Katz stated the blockade is essential to prevent weapons transfers to Hamas, and advised the crew, including Greta Thunberg, to turn back. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition argues the blockade is illegal and accuses Israel of threatening unlawful force against civilians. The vessel, carrying symbolic aid, experienced temporary signal jamming, with Israeli media reporting the navy is expected to block the boat and deport the crew. The country's military is taking action to prevent aid from reaching Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem attributed the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles to California Governor Gavin Newsom's alleged failure to manage violent clashes between police and immigration protesters. Noem asserted that Newsom's poor decisions necessitated federal intervention to ensure community safety, referencing injuries to officers and incidents of violence. President Trump indicated he might invoke the Insurrection Act depending on the situation's severity, while White House border czar Tom Homan suggested Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass could face charges if their response exceeds legal boundaries. Lawmakers reacted along party lines, with Republicans supporting Trump's decision and Democrats criticizing it as an escalation.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the top five recurring conflict areas in relationships: tone of voice/attitude, family relations, household chores, communication styles, and money. Contempt, signaled through tone, is a key predictor of divorce, requiring partners to resist striking back and name the effect instead. Family relation arguments often reflect misalignments and unmet needs, necessitating reassurance and discussions about limits. Uneven distribution of household chores reveals an unacknowledged "invisible load," requiring open acknowledgment and redistribution of tasks. Ineffective communication styles lead to spiraling arguments, which can be avoided using the "five-second rule."</p>

          <p>An executive order banning travel from 12 countries is set to take effect, implementing more methodical screening standards. The order, issued on January 20th, directs top advisers to compile a list of countries with insufficient screening standards for potential migrants, considered a national-security risk. This signals a resurrection of the travel ban, a controversial policy from Trump's first term. The new ban aims to address national security concerns related to immigration.</p>

          <p>ABC News correspondent Terry Moran was suspended after posting a critical tweet about President Trump and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, calling them "world class" haters. The tweet violated the network's policy on objectivity and impartiality in news coverage. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned Moran's remarks and called for action by ABC. The suspension reflects heightened sensitivity among news organizations regarding antagonizing the Trump White House, which has previously taken retaliatory actions against critics.</p>

Anaya, who has described Bukele as a "dictator," was arrested at his home in Santa Tecla. Human rights organizations have condemned the arrest, alleging it aims to silence those who question the government. The arrest follows a similar detention of another lawyer, Ruth Lopez, who heads an anti-corruption unit, raising concerns about diminishing civil liberties.</p>
