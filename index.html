          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's dedication to controlling inflation, despite criticism and uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of tariffs. Powell characterized economic growth as strong and the labor market as near full employment, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. He indicated that policymakers are prepared to maintain their current stance until the effects of tariffs on prices become clearer. Powell's cautious approach could further provoke President Trump, who has publicly criticized the Fed's handling of monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The payout from a $400,000 immediate annuity purchased at age 70 varies based on gender, with men receiving around $2,923 per month and women around $2,763 due to differing life expectancies. Joint life annuities, which continue payments to a surviving spouse, offer lower monthly checks of approximately $2,449. Annuity payouts are influenced by interest rates, with higher rates translating to stronger payouts, and the type of annuity chosen, such as fixed, inflation-adjusted, or variable. To maximize monthly income, opting for a single-life annuity and skipping optional riders are recommended, but one should consider the lack of access to the lump sum and changing circumstances before purchasing.

          <p>A look into Toni Morrison's career as an editor at Random House reveals her significant role in transforming the relationship between Black writers and white publishers. Morrison championed Black voices and ideas, pushing for their inclusion in mainstream literature. As an editor, she supported writers like Angela Davis and Gayl Jones, while also navigating the challenges of racial dynamics in the publishing industry. Her work at Random House left a lasting legacy, though the number of Black authors published by the company declined after her departure.</p>

Regular maintenance of AC systems, such as changing filters, is also crucial for optimal performance. The average American home could pay around $186 a month for air conditioning, but New England residents are expected to face even higher charges, the Journal reports, with average monthly bills reaching around $200.
